<a name="toc_2"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter I&mdash;Thirlwell Makes His Choice</h3>

<p class="noindent">Dinner was nearly over at the big red hotel that
stands high above the city of Quebec, and Thirlwell,
sitting at one of the tables, abstractedly glanced
about. The spacious room was filled with skilfully
tempered light that glimmered on colored glasses and
sparkled on silver; pillars and cornices were decorated
with artistic taste. A murmur of careless talk rose
from the groups of fashionably dressed women and
prosperous men, and he heard a girl's soft laugh.</p>

<p class="dgp">All this struck a note of refined luxury that was
strange to Thirlwell, who had spent some years in the
wilds, where the small, frost-bitten pines roll across
the rocks and muskegs of North Ontario. One lived
hard up there, enduring arctic cold, and the heat of
the short summer, when bloodthirsty mosquitoes
swarm; and ran daunting risks on the lonely prospecting
trail. Now it looked as if chance had offered him
an easier lot; he could apparently choose between the
privations of the wilderness and civilized comfort,
but while he grappled with a certain longing he knew

this was not so. He had adopted the pioneers' Spartan
code; one must stand by one's bargain, and do the
thing one had undertaken.</p>

<p class="dgp">For a few moments he was silent, lost in rather
gloomy thought, with a frown on his brown face, and
Mrs. Allott, his English relative, studied him across
the table. On the whole, Jim Thirlwell had improved
in Canada, and she thought he would be welcomed if
he returned to England. She had been his mother's
friend, and during the week or two they had now
spent together, had decided that if he proved amenable
she would help him to make a career. Indeed, it was
largely on Thirlwell's account she had accompanied her
husband on his American tour.</p>

<p class="dgp">Jim had certain advantages. He was not clever,
but his remarks were sometimes smarter than he knew.
Then he had a quiet voice and manner that impressed
one, even when one differed from him, as one often
did. He was not handsome, and his face was rather
thin, but his features were well-defined, and she liked
his firm mouth and steady look. His figure was good
and marked by a touch of athletic grace. Then she
was, on the whole, satisfied with the way he chose and
wore his clothes. His mother had held a leading place
in the exclusive society of a quiet cathedral town, until
her husband lost his small fortune. Mrs. Allott understood
that something might have been saved had
Tom Thirlwell been less scrupulous; but Tom had unconventional
views about money, and Jim was like his
father in many ways. Mrs. Allott, having done her
best to enlighten him, hoped he would now see where
his advantage lay.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are not very talkative, Jim," she said.</p>


<p class="dgp">Thirlwell looked up with an apologetic smile, but
his eyes rested on the girl by Mrs. Allott's side.
Evelyn Grant was young and attractive, but there was
something tame about her beauty that harmonized
with her character. Thirlwell had not always recognized
this; indeed, when they were younger, he had
indulged a romantic tenderness for the girl. This,
however, was long since, and the renewal of their
friendship in Canada left him cold. Evelyn was gracious,
and he sometimes thought she had not forgotten
his youthful admiration, but she did not feel things
much, and he suspected that she had acquiesced in
Mrs. Allott's rather obvious plot because she was too
indolent to object. For all that, he imagined that if
he took a bold line she would not repulse him, and by
comparison with his poverty Evelyn was rich. Then
he banished the thought with an unconscious frown.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, well, I suppose it's our last evening together,
and one feels melancholy about that," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"But I thought you were coming to New York
with us," Mrs. Allott objected.</p>

<p class="dgp">Evelyn was talking animatedly to a young American,
but looked round with languid carelessness.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Are you really not coming, Jim?" she asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then, without waiting for Thirlwell's answer, she
resumed her talk, and Mrs. Allott wondered whether
the girl had not overdone her part. After all, she
must have known why she had been brought.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think not," said Thirlwell. "Very sorry, of
course, but there's only a week of my holiday left and I
have some business in South Ontario. Then I must
go back to the bush."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's ridiculous, Jim," Mrs. Allott rejoined.

"You know you needn't go back to the bush at all.
Besides, we hoped you had decided to come to England."
She paused and touched Evelyn. "Do you
hear what he says? Can't you persuade him to be
sensible?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Evelyn turned and looked at Thirlwell with a careless
smile. She was very composed, but Mrs. Allott
thought she noted a trace of heightened color.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, no; it would be useless for me to try.
Nobody could persuade Jim to do what he does not
want."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Aren't you taking something for granted?" asked
Allott, who sat with the others, but had been silent.
"Jim hasn't admitted that he doesn't want to come."</p>

<p class="dgp">The girl gave Thirlwell a tranquil glance in which
there was a hint of mockery.</p>

<p class="dgp">"He has only a week left, and I imagine knows better
than we do what will please him best," she replied,
and turned to her companion.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What have you to say to that?" Allott asked
Thirlwell, with a twinkle.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It looks as if Evelyn knew my character&mdash;I suppose
I am obstinate. But I don't think she has stated
the case correctly. It isn't that I don't want to come.
Unfortunately, I can't."</p>

<p class="dgp">The other guests were leaving the tables and Mrs.
Allott, getting up, gave her husband a meaning glance.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I must let Stephen talk to you. You may
listen to his arguments; I have exhausted mine."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You could not expect me to succeed where you
have failed," Allott remarked, and touched Thirlwell
as Mrs. Allott and Evelyn went away. "Shall we go
upstairs for a smoke?"</p>


<p class="dgp">A lift took them up, and Allott lighted a cigarette
when they entered an unoccupied room. The evening
was hot, and Thirlwell sat on the ledge of the open
window and looked out upon the river across the
climbing town. Church spires, the steep roofs of old
houses, and the flat tops of modern blocks, rose in the
moonlight through a thin gray haze of smoke. Lower
down, a track of glittering silver ran across to the shadowy
Levis ridge, along the crest of which were scattered
twinkling lights. Presently Allott, who was well preserved
and rather fat, turned to Thirlwell.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I hope you won't be rash, Jim, and throw away the
best chance you may ever get."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You mean Sir James's offer of the post with the
big engineering firm?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I mean that and other things," said Allott dryly.
"Perhaps I have spoken plainly enough; you are not
a fool!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thanks! I don't claim much wisdom and I am
sometimes rash. But perhaps we had better stick to
Sir James's offer. Why does he make it now, after
standing off when I needed help some years since?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"We'll take the offer first," Allott agreed. "Sir
James had not been knighted and pulled off the big
business combine then. He hadn't as much influence,
and perhaps wanted to see what you could do. I expect
he was surprised when you got and kept the mining
job in Canada. Anyhow, you're his namesake
and nearest relative. My wife, you know, comes
next."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He left my father alone in his trouble," said Thirlwell
grimly. "I wonder why they gave him his title.
There were things done when the combine was made

the shareholders didn't know, besides injustices to the
staffs. You see, I had friends&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"What has that to do with you? He offers you a
good post, with a hint about favors to come."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The post is good," Thirlwell agreed, with a
thoughtful look. "In a way, I'd have been glad to
take it; but I can't very well."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your engagement at the little wild-cat mine is an
obstacle? After all, there are other engineers in Canada;
I don't suppose your employers would suffer
much inconvenience if you gave up the job."</p>

<p class="dgp">"There's a year yet to go, besides an understanding
that I'd stay until we got down to the deep vein."</p>

<p class="dgp">"For very small pay? Much less than you're now
offered, and with no prospects?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"My employers are straight people and pay me as
much as they can afford. They treat me well, though
they're a small firm and the mine is not prospering. In
fact, I expect they'll have some trouble to hold out
until we reach good ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The risk of their not holding out is rather a curious
argument for your staying."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell was silent for a few moments, and his face
was hard when he resumed: "I know something about
the combine's methods&mdash;Masters, who's still with one
of the companies Sir James bought up, writes to me.
I suppose one mustn't be too fastidious, but there are
things the man who takes the post I'm offered will be
expected to do; things I haven't done yet and mean to
leave alone. You have often to throw your scruples
overboard when you pay big dividends."</p>

<p class="dgp">Allott chuckled. "The combine does not pay big
dividends. It's a grievance of the shareholders'."</p>


<p class="dgp">"Oh, well; Sir James was knighted, and I hear
about another director building a hospital. One
doesn't get honors for nothing. They're expensive."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Jim," said Allott reproachfully, "you're talking
like your father, and while airing one's views may be
harmless, trying to live up to them doesn't always pay.
Taking that line cost him much; I thought you wiser."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell colored. "My father was an honest man.
If I can live as he did, I shall be satisfied."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, for some reason, Sir James is keen about
bringing you back, and if you state the terms on which
you'll come, I imagine he'll agree. This should make
things easier, and I believe he'll be responsible if you
pay your employers a fine to let you off."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell was silent and looked out of the window.
The hum of traffic came up from the dark gaps between
the buildings and he heard a locomotive bell and the
clash of freight-cars by the wharf. Then the hoot of
a deep whistle rang across the town, and red and white
flashes pierced the darkness down the river. A big
liner, signaling her tug, was coming up stream, and
presently her long hull was marked by lights that rose
in tiers above the water. He watched her as she
swung in to the wharf with her load of cheering immigrants.</p>

<p class="dgp">It reminded him of his landing in Canada, and he
looked back upon the disappointments and hardships
he had borne in the country. He had soon found there
was no easy road to wealth, and life had so far been
an arduous struggle. He had known poverty, hunger,
and stinging cold, and now his pay left little over when
he had satisfied his frugal needs. All would be different
if he went back to England, and he pondered

over Allott's specious arguments. There was no reason
he should not take the offered post if he could do
so on his terms, and it was possible that his employers
would release him. He was thirty years of age, had
long practised self-denial, and would soon get old.
Why should he not enjoy some prosperity before it
was too late? Allott had said enough, but did not
know this and had not finished yet.</p>

<p class="dgp">"There's another matter, Jim," he resumed. "You
can't think about marrying while you stay in the bush."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know that I want to marry. I couldn't
support a wife."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why not, if you chose a wife with money?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then she'd have to support me. Besides, I expect
it would be hard to find a rich girl willing to marry a
poor engineer."</p>

<p class="dgp">Allott made a sign of impatience. "Let's be frank!
The matter's delicate, and perhaps requires a lighter
touch than mine, but I understand that Helen has
given you a hint."</p>

<p class="dgp">"She has," said Thirlwell, with some grimness. "I
hoped you'd both let the thing go when she saw my
attitude."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We'll let it go after the next few minutes, if you
like, but there is something to be said. Evelyn is an
attractive girl, and has some money; besides which,
Sir James would approve her marrying you. He has
hinted that he'll give you a chance of making your
mark in England if he is satisfied. Evelyn's relations
know this, and it was significant that they agreed when
Helen invited her to join us. As the girl consented, I
might perhaps go farther&mdash;"</p>


<p class="dgp">Thirlwell stopped him. "Why is Sir James anxious
to help me?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"We can only guess. Perhaps he feels you have a
claim and he has neglected you. Then he may think
you will do him credit and realize the ambitions he's
getting too old to carry out. He has noted that you
have inherited your father's character, and I've heard
him remark that while Tom Thirlwell had extravagant
notions, he certainly had brains. However, we were
talking about Evelyn."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell, exercising some self-control, lighted a
cigarette and gave Allott a steady look.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then we'll finish the talk. Evelyn is a charming
girl; amiable, pretty, tranquil, but there's no ground
for believing she has contemplated marrying me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Suppose we admit that's possible?" said Allott,
with a meaning smile. "I imagine, because I know
you both, that if you were firm enough, you could, so
to speak, carry her away. Since you own that she's
charming, why don't you try?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you are curious, you can take it that Sir James's
gratuitous approval is an obstacle. I shall not marry
to please him or let him plan my career. I mean to
stand on my own feet and not be ruled by a greedy old
man's caprices. Now you understand this, we'll say
no more about the thing."</p>

<p class="dgp">Allott shrugged. "Very well! I've done my best,
and since you mean to take your own line, wish you
success. Perhaps we had better go downstairs."</p>

<p class="dgp">Evelyn was talking to the young American when
they crossed the big hall and she smiled as they passed,
but an hour later Thirlwell saw her alone. She beckoned

him carelessly and indicated a place near her in a
corner seat.</p>

<p class="dgp">"So Allott has not persuaded you to come with us!"
she remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Thirlwell. "Very sorry, but there are
matters I can't neglect."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We shall miss you," she said, with a side glance.
"I suppose you are not coming to England afterwards?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm afraid not," Thirlwell answered.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then, to his surprise, she gave him a rather curious
smile. "From the beginning I didn't think you would
come."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" said Thirlwell. "Still I don't see why&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"That doesn't matter," she answered calmly. "After
all, I dare say it's better in many ways that you
should stay in Canada, and I wish you luck." She
paused a moment and resumed: "I want you to feel
that I do wish it. But Mrs. Allott is waiting for me.
We shall, no doubt, see you before we start."</p>

<p class="dgp">She left him puzzled but relieved. Next morning
he stood on the platform of the Grand Trunk station,
and Evelyn, leaning on the rails of a vestibule, smiled
and waved her hand as the train rolled away.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter II&mdash;Strange's Story</h3>

<p class="noindent">After Allott's departure Thirlwell went to Montreal
and spent two depressing days transacting
some business for his employers. Quebec was quiet and
picturesque, and a cool, refreshing breeze blew up the
river from the Laurentian wilds, but Montreal, shut
in by the wooded mountain, sweltered in humid heat.
Then the streets were being torn up to lay electric
mains, and sand and cement blew about from half-finished
concrete buildings. Thirlwell did not like
large cities, and after the silence of the bush, the bustle
of the traffic jarred.</p>

<p class="dgp">He had, however, better grounds for feeling depressed.
His employers trusted him, and actuated
by loyalty as well as professional pride, he had resolved
to make their rather daring venture a success. Now
this looked difficult. Money was scarce, and he found
credit strangely hard to get. The mining speculators
he called upon received him coldly, and although he
had a warmer welcome from the manufacturers of giant-powder
and rock-boring machines, they demanded
prompt payment for their goods. When Thirlwell
stated that this was impossible they told him to come
again.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was known that there was silver in the rocks that
run back into the North-West Territories, but nobody
had found ore that would pay for refining. The rich

strike in Ontario had not been made yet, and the prospectors
who pushed into the forests with drill and
dynamite were regarded as rash enthusiasts. Bankers
were cautious, and declined to accept rusty mining
plant and a shaft in the wilderness as good security.</p>

<p class="dgp">On the evening before he left Montreal, Thirlwell
sat in the hall of his hotel, listening to the clanging
street-cars and the rattle of the Grand Trunk trains.
Poisoned flies dropped upon the tables and an electric
fan made an unpleasant whirring as it churned the
humid air. Had his mood been normal the heat and
noise would not have disturbed Thirlwell, but now
they jarred.</p>

<p class="dgp">His visit had been a failure, and his employers must
develop the mine without the help of the latest machines.
He doubted if they could finance the undertaking
until they struck the vein. Then it looked as
if he had been rash to reject Sir James's offer. He
had thrown away a chance of winning prosperity and
perhaps fame in England, for he knew he had some
talent and he was ambitious. Instead he had chosen
exhausting labor and stern self-denial in the wilds.
The life had some compensations, but they were not
very obvious then. It was, however, too late for regrets;
he had chosen and must be content, and putting
down the newspaper he was trying to read, he went
to bed.</p>

<p class="dgp">Two days later he sat in the garden of a new summer
hotel on the shore of Lake Huron. A pine forest
rolled down to the water past the pretty wooden building,
and the air in the shade was cool and sweet with
resinous smells. The lake glittered, smooth as glass,
in the hot sun, but here and there a wandering breeze

traced a dark-blue line across the placid surface.
Along the beach the shadows of the pines floated motionless.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell smoked and meditated on the errand that
had brought him to the hotel. The clerk had told him
that Miss Strange was on the beach, but he had not seen
her yet and felt some curiosity about the girl whom
he had arranged to meet. They had corresponded and
he had brought a photograph he thought she would
like to see, but on the whole he would sooner she had
not asked for the interview. She might find it painful
to hear the story he had to tell, and the thing would
require some tact, more perhaps than he had.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the meantime he wondered what she was like.
Her letters indicated a cultivated mind, and he knew
she had a post at a Toronto school; but one could not
expect much from the daughter of the broken-down
prospector he had met in the North. Strange had
worked spasmodically at the mine, where he was employed
because labor was scarce. He was not a good
workman, and when he had earned a small sum generally
bought provisions and went off into the bush to
re-locate a silver lode he claimed to have found when
he was young. He came back ragged and disappointed,
and when liquor could be got indulged freely
before he resumed his work.</p>

<p class="dgp">Nobody believed his tale; Strange's lode was something
of a joke. The miners called him a crank, and
Thirlwell had doubted if he was quite sane, but he
persisted in his search and sometimes Black Steve
Driscoll went North with him. It was suspected that
Driscoll made an unlawful profit by selling the Indians
liquor, which perhaps accounted for his journeys with

Strange. As they returned from the last expedition
their canoe capsized in a rapid near the mining camp,
and although Driscoll reached land exhausted,
Strange's body was never found. Thirlwell knew his
daughter's address, and sent her news of the accident,
which led to an exchange of letters. Now he would
shortly see her, give her the particulars she wanted,
and then their acquaintance would end, although he
liked the hotel and might stay for a few days' fishing.</p>

<p class="dgp">His pipe went out and he was half asleep when a
girl crossed the lawn. She came nearer, as if to avoid
the glistening showers the nickeled sprinklers threw
upon the thirsty grass, and Thirlwell watched her
drowsily, noting her light, well-balanced movements
and the grace of her tall figure. She wore a big white
hat and a thin summer dress that he thought was very
artistically made. There was something aristocratic
about her, and he imagined she belonged to a party that
had landed from a fine steam yacht. Then he noted
with some surprise that she was coming to him.</p>

<p class="dgp">She stopped and Thirlwell got up, imagining that
she had made a mistake. Her face, like her figure,
hinted at strength tempered by proud self-control.
She had brown hair with a ruddy tint that caught the
light, gray eyes that met his with a calm, inquiring
glance, and firm red lips. Thirlwell was not a critic
of female beauty, but he saw that she had dignity and
charm. In the meantime, he wondered what she
wanted.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mr. Thirlwell, I suppose?" she said.</p>

<p class="dgp">He bowed and she resumed: "Then I must thank
you for coming here to meet me. I am Agatha
Strange."</p>


<p class="dgp">It cost Thirlwell an effort to hide his surprise; indeed,
he wondered with some embarrassment whether
he had succeeded, for this was not the kind of girl he
had expected to meet.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It was not much out of my way, and I wanted to
see the lake," he replied, as he brought a chair.</p>

<p class="dgp">She thanked him, and sitting down was silent for
a few moments while she gazed across the lawn.
Some of the guests were sitting in the shadow by the
water's edge, their summer clothes making blotches of
bright color among the gray rocks. Out on the lake,
a young man knelt in the stern of a canoe, swinging a
paddle that flashed in the sun, while a girl trailed her
hand in the sparkling water. As the craft passed
the landing she began to sing. No breath of wind
ruffled the surface now, and the dark pine-sprays were
still. A drowsy quietness brooded over the tranquil
scene.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It is very beautiful," she said slowly. "Different,
one imagines, from the rugged North!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very different," Thirlwell agreed, and took out
a photograph. "You will see that by the picture I
promised to bring."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha took the photograph. It showed a broad
stretch of sullen water with a strip of forest on the
other side. The pines were ragged and stunted and
some leaned across each other, while the gloomy sky
was smeared by the smoke of a forest-fire. In the
foreground, angry waves broke in foaming turmoil
among half-covered rocks. No soft beauty marked
the river of the North, and the land it flowed through
looked forbidding and desolate.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The Shadow River," said Thirlwell. "You can

see the Grand Rapid. I have marked a cross where
the canoe upset."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha said nothing for a few moments, and Thirlwell
was relieved. He saw she felt keenly, but she
was calm. In the meantime he waited; one learns to
wait in the North.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thank you; I would like to keep the picture," she
said by and by, and gave him a level glance. "I suppose
you knew my father well?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I knew him in a way," Thirlwell answered cautiously,
because he did not want to talk about Strange's
habits. Perhaps the girl knew her father's weakness,
and if not, it was better that she should think well of
him. Yet Thirlwell imagined she understood something
of his reserve.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" she said, "you knew him in the bush, but
not when he lived at home with us. I should like to
tell you his story."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not if it is painful."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It is painful, but I would sooner you heard it,"
she replied. "For one thing, you have been kind&mdash;"
She paused, and when she resumed there was a faint
sparkle in her eyes. "I want you to understand my
father. He was my hero."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made a vague gesture. He had seen
Strange, half drunk, reeling along the trail to the mine,
but this did not lessen his sympathy for the girl. He
hoped she had taken his sign to imply that he was willing
to listen.</p>

<p class="dgp">"To begin with, do you believe in the silver lode?"
she asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"One disbelieves in nothing up yonder," Thirlwell
tactfully replied. "It's a country of surprises; you

don't know what you may find. Besides, there is some
silver&mdash;I'm now sinking a shaft&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled and he saw she had the gift of humor.
The smile softened her firm lips and lighted her eyes.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I imagine you are cautious. In fact, you are rather
like the picture I made of you after reading your
letters."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell felt embarrassed and said nothing, as was
his prudent rule when his thoughts were not clear.</p>

<p class="dgp">"My father found the ore many years since, when
he was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company," she
resumed. "The factory was in the Territories, three
or four hundred miles north of your mine, and the
agent sent him out, with a dog-train and two Indians,
to collect some furs. They had to make a long journey,
and were coming back, short of food, when they
camped one evening beside a frozen creek. The water
had worn away the face of a small cliff, and the frost
had recently split off a large slab. That left the strata
cleanly exposed, and my father noticed that near the
foot of the rock there was a different-colored band.
They were making camp in the snow then, but he went
back afterwards when the moon rose and the Indians
were asleep, and broke off a number of bits. The
stones were unusually heavy. Doesn't that mean
something?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Silver has a high specific gravity; so has lead.
Sometimes one finds them combined."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have a piece here," said Agatha, taking out a
small packet. "My father gave it me when I was
a child, and I brought it, thinking I might, perhaps,
show it to you."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell, examining the specimen, missed something

of her meaning, and did not see that her decision
to show him the ore was a compliment. He looked
honest, and strangers often trusted him. His friends
had never known him abuse their confidence.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," he said at length. "I think it's silver.
Traces of lead, and perhaps copper, too; you seldom
find silver pure. But won't you go on with the tale?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The party's food was getting short. That meant
they would starve if they did not reach the factory
soon, and they set off again at dawn. There was no
time to prospect and deep snow covered the ground,
but my father made what he called a mental photograph
of the spot. It was a little hollow among the
rocks, with a willow grove by the creek, and in the
middle there were two or three burned pines. If you
drew a line through them it pointed nearly north, and
where it touched the cliff you turned east about twenty
yards."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Aren't you rash to tell me this?" Thirlwell asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled. "On the whole, I think not; but
nothing I could tell would be of much use to you.
My father, although he had been there, could not find
the spot again."</p>

<p class="dgp">She paused a moment and then went on: "When
they reached the factory he showed the specimens to
the agent, who said they were worthless and laughed
at him. But it was perhaps significant that he was not
sent that way again. One understands that the Hudson's
Bay directors were jealous of their game preserves."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Furs paid better than silver," Thirlwell agreed.
"They didn't want miners with dynamite and noisy

machines to invade the solitudes and frighten the wild
animals away."</p>

<p class="dgp">"My father, going south on a holiday, met my
mother and gave up his post when they were married.
She had a little money, enough to open a small store,
and for her sake he started business in a new wooden
town. He did not like the towns, and I know when I
got older that he often longed for the wild North, but
although the place grew and the business prospered, he
could not spare the time and money to look for the
lode. He wanted to give my brother a good education
and start him well, and after a time I was sent to
a university."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That explains something," Thirlwell remarked,
and then pulling himself up, added: "If you take
proper appliances, a prospecting expedition costs much.
But did your father often talk about the lode?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"No; not unless it was to me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But why did he tell you and not your brother?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"George was very practical; I was romantic and
my father something of a dreamer. We lived happily
at home, but I felt that he needed sympathy that he
did not get. I think now my mother knew he longed
for the North, and was afraid the longing might grow
too strong and draw him back. When he did speak of
the silver she smiled. I suppose when you have known
the wilderness its charm is strong?"</p>

<p class="dgp">She stopped and her face was gravely thoughtful
as she looked across the shining water towards the
faint blur of a pine forest on a distant point, and Thirlwell
felt as if they had been suddenly united by a bond
of understanding.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Yes," he said. "It's a stern country and one has
much to bear; but it calls. One fears the hardships,
cold, and danger&mdash;but one goes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha looked up quietly, but he noted the gleam in
her eyes.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You <em>know</em>! Well, you can imagine what it cost
my father to resist the call, but he did resist for many
years. He loved my mother, but I think he hated the
growing town; then there was the dream of riches
that might be his. He was not greedy, and my brother
did not need money. George had a talent for business
and his employers soon promoted him; but I was fond
of science, and it was my father's ambition that I
should make independent researches and not be forced
to work for pay."</p>

<p class="dgp">She hesitated, and then went on: "Perhaps I am
boring you, but I wanted you to understand what his
duty must have cost. You see, you only knew him
in the bush, and after he went back I noted a difference
in his letters. They were sometimes strange; he
seemed to be hiding things. I think he felt the disappointment
keenly and lost heart."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell saw she suspected something, and replied:
"Disappointment is often numbing; but your father
never lost his faith in the lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Nor have I lost mine," said Agatha. "But we
will not talk about that yet. He brought us up and
started us well; then my mother died, and nobody had
any further claim on him. His duty was done, and
though he was getting old, he went back to the North.
Well, I have told you part of his story, and you know
the rest."</p>


<p class="dgp">"It is a moving tale," said Thirlwell, with quiet
sympathy.</p>

<p class="dgp">He thought she felt it was necessary to defend her
father, and she had done so. Indeed, he admitted
that one must respect the man who had, with uncomplaining
patience, for years carried on his disliked
task for his wife and children's sake. Longing for
the woods and the silent trail, Strange must have found
it irksome to count dollar bills and weigh groceries
in the store; but he had done his duty, and borne hardship
and failure when at last freedom came. Still the
girl must not know what he had become.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha asked him a number of questions and then
got up. "Thank you," she said. "I will take the
photograph and would like you to keep the specimen of
ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I will keep it; but I wonder why you wish to give
it me?"</p>

<p class="dgp">She smiled. "I believe in the lode and would like
you to believe in it, too. You are a mining engineer
and can find out if there is much silver in the stone."</p>

<p class="dgp">Then she crossed the lawn to the hotel veranda and
left Thirlwell thoughtful.</p>
</div>



<hr class="page">

<div class="div">
<a name="toc_4"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter III&mdash;Agatha Makes A Promise</h3>


<p class="noindent">Next morning Thirlwell wrote to his employers,
stating that he meant to take another week's
holiday, and smiled as he reflected that the letter would
arrive too late for them to refuse. The hotel was
comfortable, he had met one or two interesting people,
and was told the fishing was good; besides, he thought
he would not be badly needed at the mine just then.
For all that, he was not quite persuaded that these
were sufficient reasons for neglecting his work, and
when he went through the hall with the letter in his
hand he put it into his pocket instead of the box. He
would think over the matter again before the mail
went out. Then as he crossed the veranda Agatha
came up from the beach and gave him a smile.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are out early," Thirlwell remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I like the morning freshness and have been on
the lake."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It looks as if you had hurt yourself," said Thirlwell,
noting a small wet handkerchief twisted round
her hand.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha laughed. "Not seriously; I blistered my
fingers trying to paddle. I have been practising since
I came, but it is difficult to keep the canoe straight
when you are alone."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's so," Thirlwell agreed. "The back-feathering
stroke is hard to learn."</p>


<p class="dgp">"For all that, I mean to learn it before I go."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps I could teach it you. How long have
you got?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"A fortnight," she said, moving on, and when she
left him Thirlwell went to the mail-box and dropped
in his letter.</p>

<p class="dgp">Afterwards he felt annoyed that he had done so,
and wondered whether he had weakly given way to a
romantic impulse, but next morning he went down to
the beach and found the girl launching a canoe. Making
her sit near the middle, he knelt in the stern and
drove the canoe across the shining water with vigorous
strokes. Agatha wore a white jersey and had left
her hat, and he noted the color the cool wind brought
to her face and how the light sparkled on her hair.</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by they skirted a rocky island where resinous
smells drifted across the water and the reflections
of tall pines wavered round the canoe, until he ran
the craft on a shingle point and they changed places.
Agatha took the single-bladed paddle and although her
hands were sore made some progress while he instructed
her. After a time she stopped and let the
canoe drift in the hot sunshine.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think you'd soon make a good <em>voyageur</em>," Thirlwell
remarked. "For one thing, you're determined;
I saw you wince once or twice and imagine the paddle-haft
hurt."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I must learn to use the pole yet, and mean to try it
in the river by and by. You must pole, I think, when
you go up a fast stream?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"That is so, when you can't use the tracking line.
But I don't see why you are anxious to learn."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have an object," Agatha answered with a smile.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Then why don't you practise canoeing at Toronto?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The trouble is that I haven't time. You see, I
teach all day."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But you have holidays and the evenings."</p>

<p class="dgp">"My evenings are occupied by study."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know if it's wise to over-work yourself for
the advantage of your pupils," Thirlwell remarked.
"At one time, I was very keen about my profession,
but soon found it a mistake to tire my brain for my
employer's benefit. But what do you study?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Science; chemistry and geology, but not in order
to teach the girls."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, I suppose knowledge is worth getting for its
own sake. Anyhow, I thought so, but you learn when
you undertake rude mining that the main thing is to
be able to make a practical use of what you know. In
fact, that's often better than knowing much."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps so," Agatha agreed. "Some day I hope
to make a good use of what I have learned."</p>

<p class="dgp">"About canoeing, or geology?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"About both," said Agatha. "Now, however, I
think we'll make for the landing. Breakfast will be
ready soon."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell saw no more of her during the day, but
she came down to the beach in the evening and he gave
her another lesson. As they paddled home he thought
she looked tired, and asked: "Where have you been
since morning?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha indicated a ridge of high ground with a few
pines on its summit that rose indistinctly at some distance
across the shadowy forest.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I took my lunch with me and went up there."</p>


<p class="dgp">"But it must be a two or three hours' walk. Is
there a trail?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"A loggers' trail. It's partly grown up and broke
off altogether when I got near the rocks. After that
I had a rough scramble, but I like the woods and try
to walk as much as possible in my holidays."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, no doubt, walking is good for one. But
don't the girls in Toronto prefer the street cars?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't go long walks for health's sake," Agatha
answered with a smile. "But I think some people I
know are waiting. Can you paddle faster?"</p>

<p class="dgp">The canoe's bows lifted out of a wisp of foam as
Thirlwell swung the paddle, and in a few minutes he
helped the girl to land. After this, their acquaintance
ripened fast and Agatha went fishing with him on the
lake and, by disused logging trails, long distances into
the shadowy bush. Thirlwell imagined she knew this
excited some remark, but he saw there was an imperious
vein in the girl, who did what she thought fit,
without heeding conventions. Besides, no touch of
sentiment marked their friendship; she accepted him
as a comrade who could teach her something about
lake and forest, and he was satisfied with this.</p>

<p class="dgp">Yet he was puzzled. It was strange that an attractive
girl should wish to learn something of the bush-man's
skill, but she obviously meant to do so. Although
it often cost her an effort to follow him, she
would not let him turn back when they came to an
angry rapid or a belt of tangled woods. She certainly
had charm besides having pluck, because when
she did not go fishing young women as well as young
men gathered round her on the shady lawn. It was
hard to imagine why a girl like this should practise

walking long distances and combine the study of canoeing
with geology.</p>

<p class="dgp">The fortnight slipped by and on the last evening
Thirlwell took Agatha out upon the lake. They were
later than usual and as they stole across the glassy
water the pines on a western headland cut black and
sharp against an orange glow. To the east a faint
track of silver ran back into the blue distance under
the moon. It was very quiet except for the splash of
the paddle and ripple at the bows, but somewhere in
the shadows a loon was calling. By and by the lights
of the hotel faded and they were alone in the dusk.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell put down the paddle and lighted a cigarette.
He had drawn nearer the girl in the last week;
a curious feeling of confidence and liking united them,
but he was not her lover and knew that if he drifted
into philandering she would be repelled. Perhaps this
was unusual, but she was different from other girls.
Thirlwell could not tell how she differed, but he was
satisfied that she did and let the matter go.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You start for the mine to-morrow, don't you?"
she asked presently.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," he said; "it's my last evening on the lake.
There's something melancholy about the end of a holiday,
but I don't think I have felt it as much before."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha gave him a calm glance and saw he had not
meant her to read a sentimental meaning in his admission.
It was unconscious flattery and she was
pleased.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can understand. One values the days of liberty
when they are gone! But do you feel daunted by the
thought of the work and hardship that waits you in
the North?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"Not in a way. Now and then you shrink from
the arctic winter, but in summer, in spite of the mosquitoes,
the bush gets hold of you. Sometimes you
hate the solitude; but when you leave it you long to
return."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," said Agatha, "I have not seen the wilderness,
but next summer I hope to make an exploring
trip."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But where?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"To the Shadow River and on into the Territories,"
she answered quietly. Thirlwell looked hard at her,
and she smiled. "Yes; if things go well with me, I
mean to look for the silver ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Now I begin to understand! This is why you
wanted to learn to manage a canoe and train yourself
to walking through the bush. But it's a ridiculous
undertaking. Your father, who found it, could not
locate the ore again."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I may be luckier. Luck counts for something
when you go prospecting, doesn't it?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Success in prospecting is often due to luck," Thirlwell
admitted. "But it's a very rough country where
no food can be got. You will need canoes, tools, and
tents, and two or three good packers to carry the outfit
across the divides. This would be expensive.
Then I doubt if you are strong enough to bear the
strain; I imagine very few women could do so without
breaking down."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You have seen how I have tried to harden myself,
but I have made other preparations. It's some time
since I resolved to go, and every month I put by a little
money. By next summer I ought to have enough."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder whether you found it easy to save."</p>


<p class="dgp">"I did not," said Agatha, smiling. "Sometimes it
was very hard; I should not have taken this holiday
only that I wanted to get used to the lakes and woods.
I am grateful for all you have taught me."</p>

<p class="dgp">A thought that pleased him took shape in Thirlwell's
brain, but he used some restraint. He must not encourage
the girl in what he imagined was folly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The chance of your finding the vein is very small,
and there's another thing. You have told me your
father's story, and I have met men like him in the
woods, who had wasted their money and lost their
health following an illusion. The lode, so to speak,
haunted him and made him restless when he might
have been content at home, and then drove him into
the wilds when he was old. It's dangerous to give
oneself up to a fixed idea, and you mustn't let the infatuation
get hold of you. It will bring you disappointment
and trouble."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The warning's too late," said Agatha in a curious
quiet voice. "The infatuation has got hold of me,
but one must follow one's bent, and life is tame if one
does nothing that is not prudent and safe. Besides,
romantic dreams sometimes come true."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not often," said Thirlwell dryly. "But why do
you really want to go?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The silver is mine; my father gave it me. It
looked as if my brother would prosper without his help,
and I think he loved me best. Perhaps this was because
I believed in the vein."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell shook his head. "I cannot think you
greedy."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then," said Agatha with a flush of color, "if you
must have the truth, I feel I must finish my father's

work. His son and his best friends thought him the
victim of his imagination and the lode a joke; but if I
succeed, his dreams will be justified."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell said nothing for a minute or two; he saw
that she was resolute and was moved by her staunch
loyalty. After all, Strange's story was not uncommon;
Thirlwell had known men leave work and home
to follow an elusive clue to mineral treasure in the
barren solitudes. Some had come back broken in fortune
and courage, and some had not come back at all.
Then while he mused the harsh cry of the loon rang
through the dark. It fired his blood, and unconsciously
he fixed his eyes on the North, for in summer the birds
of the lakes and rivers push on towards the Pole. He
had done his duty and tried to persuade the girl, but
after all she was stronger and finer than Strange. It
was possible that she might succeed, and he could help.</p>

<p class="dgp">"When you go I hope you will let me come," he said.
"We have the tools and outfit one needs for prospecting
at the mine, and I could get the packers and canoes."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But you don't believe I shall find the lode. Why
do you want to come?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I know the bush," Thirlwell answered with a
smile. "So far I've been prudent and stuck to my
job, but I've felt the pull of the lone trail like other
men. In fact, I'd rather like to do something rash, for
a change."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Have you never done anything rash?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Only once, I think. It needed all my pluck; but
the curious thing is that it's now turning out better
than I hoped."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha pondered and then looked up. "It would

be an advantage to have somebody I could trust to look
after the packers and canoes; but the journey must be
made at my cost. I couldn't let another undertake my
duty."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I may come? It's a promise?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha quietly; "when I am ready I
will let you know. Now, however, we must get back
to the hotel."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell dipped the paddle, the canoe lurched, and
her bow rose at his next vigorous stroke. The ripples
she threw off widened into a fan-shaped wake that
trailed away and was lost in a glitter of moonlight.
The black pines on the point rose higher, resinous
smells came out of the dark, and presently a row of
lights twinkled ahead. Thirlwell ran the canoe alongside
the landing and when they reached the veranda
Agatha gave him her hand.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You start early, I think," she said. "I have much
to thank you for and am glad we have met."</p>

<p class="dgp">He let her go and afterwards leaned against the
rails. She had made him a promise and when they
next met it would be beside a river of the North. But
this was twelve months ahead; he felt it was a long
time to wait.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter IV&mdash;Strange's Partner</h3>


<p class="noindent">The day's work was over and Thirlwell and his
employer sat, smoking and talking, in their
shack at the Clermont mine. Scott was young and
had once been fastidious, but, like Thirlwell, he wore
work-stained overalls. For a time when they first
came up, both had clung to a few of the refinements of
civilization, but their grasp on these had slackened,
and now they frankly admitted that it was too much
of an effort to change their clothes when they were
tired.</p>

<p class="dgp">The shack was built of pine logs, notched where they
crossed at the corners, and the seams were caulked
with clay and moss. A big stove, now empty, stood
at one end, its pipe running obliquely across the room
before it pierced the iron roof, so as to radiate as
much heat as possible. Plans, drawing instruments,
and some books on mining, occupied a shelf on the
wall; guns, fishing rods, and surveying tools a corner,
and a plain, uncovered table the middle of the room.
Besides this, there were two or three cheap folding
chairs.</p>

<p class="dgp">The door and window were open, although the mosquitoes
were numerous, and the roar of the Shadow
River and a smell of wood smoke came in. When he
looked out, Thirlwell could see the ragged tops of the
stunted pines cut against a pale-green glow. By and

by Scott knocked out his pipe and stretched his legs.
There was another partner, but he only visited the mine
at intervals and had left it while Thirlwell was away.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Brinsmead has gone to Nevada and probably won't
come back," Scott remarked. "He has a plausible
manner, but seems to have done no better in New York
than you did in Montreal; it looks as if machinery
agents are very shy about giving credit to the owners
of half-developed mines. Anyhow, when he heard
of a field for his talents in a Western town he didn't
hesitate. Now he tells me that he finds the prospect
of earning some money instead of spending it a refreshing
change."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's lucky he didn't take his capital out of the
Clermont," Thirlwell replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott laughed. "He couldn't take it out. Nobody
would buy his share, and my fortune's represented by
a shaft in danger of flooding and some cheap and antiquated
boring plant. In fact, if we don't strike pay-dirt
soon, the Clermont will go broke, and I imagine
that's why Brinsmead skipped. After floating one or
two small mines successfully, he has some reputation
to lose, while I'm, of course, not an engineer or a business
man." He paused and looked hard at Thirlwell.
"I'd like you to stay and see me through, but wouldn't
blame you if you quit."</p>

<p class="dgp">"My reputation is not worth much and can be
risked. Besides, I imagine we'll get down to the
deep vein before the funds run out."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I hope so! You're not a quitter, and we'll hold
on while we can, but I think we'll talk about something
else. Well, I've examined the specimen of ore
you brought back. It looks like high-grade stuff and

certainly carries enough metal to pay for smelting."</p>

<p class="dgp">"What do you think about Strange's tale?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott knitted his brows. "I did think the man a
drunken crank and the lode an illusion that had grown
on him by degrees until he really believed in the ore.
When you get the tanking habit such things happen.
One specimen certainly doesn't prove very much; but
since Strange gave it to his daughter a long time before
we knew him, I'm willing to revise my judgment."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Miss Strange is persuaded that he did find the lode.
She tells me he led a very industrious and sober life
at home."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's rather curious you met the girl," Scott observed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't think so. When we found her address
among the truck Strange had left with the foreman, it
was the proper thing for me to tell her he was drowned.
This led to another letter or two, and when I said I
was going to Montreal she asked me to meet her."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Is she like Strange?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not at all," Thirlwell declared. "In fact, although
her letters ought to have prepared me, I got
something of a surprise. She was not the kind of
girl I had expected to meet. I understand she teaches
at a Toronto school."</p>

<p class="dgp">"She must have some talent to get a post there,"
Scott remarked when he had asked the name of the
school. Then he paused and vaguely indicated the
North. "Well, it's a romantic story! Nobody knows
yet what there is in the rocks up yonder, but we have
heard of other prospectors striking pay-dirt and making
nothing of their discovery. Rumors about mysterious
lodes are common in a mineral belt, and while

they're often imaginative, my notion is that now and
then there's some fact behind the fiction. Fur-traders
in Alaska heard such tales long before the Klondyke
strike."</p>

<p class="dgp">He stopped, for there were steps outside, and Thirlwell,
leaning forward, saw a man come up the trail.
The fellow had a dark, sullen face and wore an old
gray shirt and ragged overalls. He walked with a
slight limp, in consequence of getting his foot frost-bitten
on a winter journey, but he was an expert trapper
and had penetrated far into the wilds. When skins
were scarce he worked at the mine, but generally left
his employment after a drunken bout.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder whether Driscoll believes in Strange's
lode," Scott resumed as the man went by. "He knew
him better than anybody else. They went North together
once or twice, and had been away some time
when Strange was drowned coming back."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Strange wouldn't tell Black Steve where he
thought the lode was," Thirlwell objected. "I understand
they only kept together until they had portaged
their outfit across the divide."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Strange would leave a trail a trapper could follow.
Then I don't see why Steve stops here instead of locating
on better hunting ground. It looks as if he
didn't want to leave the Shadow."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't see how stopping here would help him to
find the lode," said Thirlwell, who went to the door.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was getting dark and except for the turmoil of the
river the bush was very still. The green behind the
pines had faded, and they rose against the sky indistinctly
in smears of shadowy blue. They had neither
height nor beauty, but straggled back, battered and

stunted by the winds, among the rocks until they faded
from sight. There was not much to attract a white
man in the desolation of tangled bush, but as he glanced
across it, looking to the North, a hint of mystery in its
silence appealed to Thirlwell. He felt that the wilderness
challenged him to find a clue to the treasure it
hid. Then he reflected with a smile that it was taking
much for granted to admit that there was treasure
there, and he went back into the shack and lighted
the lamp.</p>

<p class="dgp">A week later, he went up the river bank, one evening,
with a fishing rod, and stopped at dusk at the
tail of the Grand Rapid. He had gone farther than
he meant and was tired after scrambling across slippery
rocks and among the driftwood that lay about
the bank. There was, however, a shorter way back,
and lighting his pipe he sat down upon the gravel and
looked about.</p>

<p class="dgp">The sun had set some time since, but the light would
not quite die out until just before the dawn, and the
pines across the river rose against the green sky in a
dark, broken-topped wall. Near his feet the bleached
skeletons of trees, ground by floods and ice, glimmered
a livid white, and beyond them the rapid frothed and
roared in angry turmoil. The river had shrunk now
the melted snow had flowed away, and rocks one seldom
saw lifted their black tops above the racing foam.
Inshore of the main rush, smooth-worn ledges ran in
and out among shallow pools. A short distance ahead,
the bush rolled down to the water's edge in a dark
mass that threw back in confused echoes the din the
river made.</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by the mosquitoes that had followed Thirlwell

got more numerous and when, in spite of the
smoke, they settled upon his face and neck he reeled
up his line ready to start. As he did so he thought he
saw something move where the forest ran down to the
river. The object was indistinct, but it looked like a
man walking cautiously upon a ledge between the pools,
and Thirlwell wondered what the fellow was doing
there. The big gray trout had stopped rising, there
were no Indians about, and the miners had not left
the camp.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell waited until the man moved out from the
gloom of the trees. His figure was now distinct
against the foam of the rapid, and he stooped as if
he were looking down into a pool. Then he moved on,
and Thirlwell, noting that he would soon pass in front
of a dark rock, resolved to change his place in order
to watch him better. Getting up, he went down to
the water's edge, but came to a tangle of white branches
that the river had thrown up. As he stopped he saw
the man plainly, but when he looked up after scrambling
over the driftwood there was nobody about.</p>

<p class="dgp">This was strange and excited his curiosity. The
other's figure would probably be invisible against the
rock, but he must have moved rapidly to get in front
of it. Then Thirlwell saw that where he stood the
bush was no longer behind him. He had the inshore
eddies for a background and the water reflected a faint
light. There was no obvious reason why the other
should be alarmed and try to steal away, but it looked
as if he had done so.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell sat down among the driftwood and waited,
but saw no more of the man; and then going back
quietly, turned into a trail that led to the mine. The

trail was rough and narrow; in places, short brush had
sprung up, and there were patches of outcropping
rock. It would be difficult for anybody to follow it
without making some noise, but although he stopped
and listened no sound came out of the gloom.</p>

<p class="dgp">He went on, pondering the matter with some curiosity.
Since the miners were in camp, he imagined
the man he had seen was Driscoll, who lived alone in
a log shack near the bank. But, if this were so, what
was Driscoll's object for wading among the reefs, and
why had he stolen away when he thought he was
watched? Thirlwell could not solve the puzzle, but
he could find out if the fellow were Driscoll or not,
because the trail passed his shack.</p>

<p class="dgp">He walked faster, making as little noise as possible,
and by and by reached a belt of thinner forest. He
passed a fallen pine, from which he knew the shack was
visible in daylight, and resolved to see if Driscoll was
at home. If not, Thirlwell thought it would be safe
to conclude that he had seen him among the reefs. A
few moments later a light flashed among the trees,
flickered once or twice, and then burned steadily.
Thirlwell knew it came from the window of the shack,
but it was curious that Driscoll had lighted his lamp.
In summer, miners and prospectors went to bed at
sunset, and Driscoll read no books or newspapers.
Besides, if he wanted a light, why had he not got it
before? It, however, looked as if the man had not
been at the rapid and when Thirlwell passed the shack
he saw his dark figure at the door.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Who's that?" he asked, and when Thirlwell answered,
added: "Watch out as you go down the gulch.
There's a rampike across the trail."</p>


<p class="dgp">When Thirlwell came to the burned pine he stopped
abruptly as a thought struck him. Driscoll's voice
had sounded breathless; perhaps the fellow had overdone
his part. It might have been wiser for him to be
silent. Driscoll often went fishing and knew the river
well; now the water was low he could have saved some
distance by crossing the uncovered reefs instead of
scrambling along the curved bank. Besides, he had
had a few minutes' start. After all, he might have
been at the rapid and have hurried back in order to
deceive the man who had disturbed him. Moreover,
he had learned who the man was.</p>

<p class="dgp">This, however, did not take Thirlwell far and he
resumed his walk, wondering what Driscoll had been
doing and why he feared to be disturbed. It was
plain that he had taken some trouble to put Thirlwell
off the track and might have succeeded had not the
hoarseness of his voice given the latter a hint. Thirlwell
felt puzzled, but could find no clue, and deciding
that the matter was not important presently dismissed
it. For all that, he resolved to watch Driscoll, but
saw nothing to excite his suspicions for the next week
or two. Then the man bought all the provisions
Scott would let him have and loading his canoe started
for the North.</p>
</div>



<hr class="page">

<div class="div">
<a name="toc_6"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter V&mdash;A Night's Watch</h3>

<p class="noindent">Winter began unusually soon and a blizzard
raged about the shack one evening when Scott
and Thirlwell sat near the stove. The small room
smelt of hot-iron and the front of the stove glowed
a dull red, but the men shivered as the bitter draughts
swept in. Thirlwell watched the skin curtain he had
nailed across the window bulge while the snow beat
savagely against the glass, and then picked up a book.
Presently Scott hung a bearskin on the back of his
chair.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's a pretty good hide although the forequarter's
cut away," he said. "Still I don't know that I wanted
the thing and reckon the half-breed who sold it me got
its value in cartridges and food. Now transport's difficult,
I hope he and his Indian friends won't bring us
any more of the damaged stock they can't sell to the
Hudson's Bay."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell nodded. The rivers were frozen and canoeing
was stopped, while the bush was deep in fresh,
loose snow. It would be a long and strenuous business
to break a trail to the south, and in winter the mine
was often cut off from the settlements. Provisions
sometimes ran short, but Scott found it hard to refuse
the starving Indians a share of his supplies.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You bought a fine skin," he resumed. "I haven't
seen the thing since. What have you done with it?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"I sent it away," said Thirlwell. "Old Musquash
said he'd try to make the settlements and took it out
for me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He'll probably get through, though I don't think
a white man could. But I didn't know you had friends
in Canada."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell did not reply. He had bought the skin
for Agatha and now wondered what she would think
about his present, or whether she might feel he ought
not to have sent it. Still he doubted if the skin would
arrive, because the old half-breed would meet with
many dangers on the way. Thirlwell pictured him
hauling his sledge up thinly frozen rivers, crossing
wide lakes swept by icy gales, and plunging into tangled
forests smothered in snow. The thought of it emphasized
the sense of isolation one often felt at the
mine, but while he mused there was a knock at the
door.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I expect it's an Indian come to beg for food,"
Scott remarked and the door swung open.</p>

<p class="dgp">The flame of the lamp leaped up and then nearly
flickered out as a shower of snow blew in. The stove
roared and the room got horribly cold, and for a moment
or two a shaggy, white figure, indistinct in the
semi-darkness, struggled to close the door. Then
there was a sudden calm and when the light got steady
an Indian in ragged furs leaned against the table,
breathing hard and holding out a note.</p>

<p class="dgp">"From Father Lucien," said Scott, who took the
folded paper. "He's had a sick man on his hands for
three or four days and wants one of us to relieve him.
I allow I'd sooner stop here. It's pretty fierce to-night."</p>


<p class="dgp">"Who's sick?" Thirlwell asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Black Steve. I don't know that he has much claim
on us, but Father Lucien's a good sort. I guess we've
got to help him out."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell nodded. Father Lucien was a French-Canadian
missionary who had studied medicine, and,
for the most part, lived with his wandering flock. In
summer, he went North with canoe and tent, but generally
returned in winter to a shack near the mine.
Scott and Thirlwell had found his society pleasant
when they sat round the stove on long cold nights, for
the priest had been trained in Europe and knew the
great world as he knew the Canadian wilds. A scholar
and something of a mystic, he was marked by a wide
toleration and liberality of thought.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Who's going? Shall we draw cuts for it?" Scott
resumed.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell hesitated. He felt tired, the shack was
warm, and he heard the blizzard rage among the tossing
pines; but he was curious about Driscoll and something
urged him to go to the priest's help.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'll take first turn. You can come along to-morrow
if you're wanted," he said, and putting on his fur
coat and cap, went out with the Indian.</p>

<p class="dgp">When the door shut he let his companion take the
lead, for his eyes were filled with water and snow.
He knew the bush, but imagined that nobody but an
Indian could find the trail that night, and to lose it
would mean death. For some moments the icy gale
stopped his breathing, and he stumbled forward, seeing
nothing, until he struck a pine, which he seized
and leaned against. Looking round, with his back
to the wind, he noted that the shack had vanished, although

he thought it was only a few yards off. There
was nothing visible, but when the Indian touched him
he pulled himself together and struggled on again.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was a little warmer when they plunged into the
bush, but the snow was soft and deep, and they stumbled
over fallen branches and fell into thickets. Torn-off
twigs rained upon their lowered heads, shadowy
trunks loomed up and vanished, and Thirlwell could
not tell where he was going; but the Indian plodded on,
his white figure showing faintly through the snow.
At length, when Thirlwell was nearly exhausted, another
sound mingled with the scream of the gale, and
he knew it was the turmoil of the Grand Rapid, where
the furious current did not freeze. They were getting
near the end of the journey, and he braced himself for
an effort to reach Driscoll's shack. By and by a ray
of light pierced the snow, surprisingly close, and a
few moments later he reached the shelter of a wall.</p>

<p class="dgp">A door opened, somebody seized his arm, and he
stumbled into a lighted room. Throwing off his snow-clogged
coat, he sat down in a rude chair and blinked
stupidly as he looked about. His head swam, the
warmth made him dizzy, and the tingling of his frozen
skin was horribly painful. Then he began to recover
and saw that the Indian had gone and Father Lucien
sat by a bunk fixed to the wall. The priest wore an
old buckskin jacket with a tasseled fringe, and long,
soft moccasins, and looked like an Indian until one
studied his thin face. His forehead was lined, as if
by thought or suffering, and his skin was darkened by
wind and frost, but the Indian's glance is inscrutable
and his was calm and frank. One got a hint of patience
and dignity.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Thank you for coming," he said. "I would not
have sent for you on such a night only that I cannot
trust myself to keep awake and neglect just now might
cost Driscoll's life. One sleeps soundly after watching
for three nights."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell glanced at the figure rudely outlined by
the dirty blue blanket on the bunk. Driscoll's face
was turned to the wall, but Thirlwell saw that his
black hair was damp.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What's the matter with Steve?" he asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Pneumonia. Two of my people who passed the
shack in the daytime saw a light burning. They went
in and found him unconscious, an empty whisky bottle
on the floor, and the stove burned out. They made a
fire and then came for me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's something of a compliment," Thirlwell remarked.
"If it had happened before you came, they'd
probably have cleaned out the shack and left Steve to
freeze. I don't know that he'd have been regretted,
and if the rumors about his selling the Indians liquor
are true, imagine he's your worst enemy."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He's a sick man. Besides, have you often seen
my people drunk?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Thirlwell thoughtfully; "I believe only
once. But Steve didn't deny the thing when one of
the boys at the mine called him a whisky runner, and
I thought it curious, because there's a heavy penalty.
I suppose he can't hear what we say?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"He's unconscious, but has fits of weak delirium.
Three or four o'clock may mark the turning, and if he
lives until daybreak I'll feel hopeful. But do you imagine
he didn't deny your workman's charge because
it was true?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"I'd have expected him to deny it whether it was
true or not. That's what puzzled me. It looked as if
he was willing to be suspected."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Driscoll," said Father Lucien, "is a strange, dark
man, but he needs our help and one of us must watch."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm fresh and will take the first turn," Thirlwell
offered, and pulled his chair to the stove when Father
Lucien, wrapping himself in a blanket, lay down on the
floor.</p>

<p class="dgp">He found watching dreary and got very cold. The
pines roared about the shack and the lamp flickered
in the draughts, but the wind was falling and between
the gusts one could hear the river. Drift-ice churned
in the rapid and broke with jarring crashes upon the
rocks. Once or twice Thirlwell thought the sound
disturbed Driscoll, because he moved and muttered
brokenly. Thirlwell, however, could not hear what
he said, and getting drowsy with the dry warmth of
the stove, struggled to keep awake. He was not sure
that he altogether succeeded, for now and then his
head fell forward and he roused himself with a jerk,
but did not think he really went to sleep. For all that,
some hours had passed when he moved his chair and
looked at his watch. It was quieter outside and the
roar of the river had got distinct. Then Thirlwell
heard a blanket thrown back and glanced at the
bunk.</p>

<p class="dgp">Driscoll had turned his head and the light touched
his face, which glistened with sweat. His eyes were
wide open, his lips moved as if he tried to speak, and
Thirlwell thought his brain was clear, but saw next
moment that Driscoll was not watching him. He had

a curious, strained look and gazed at the door, as if
somebody had come in. The strange thing was that
he looked afraid.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I couldn't stop her with the back-stroke," he said
hoarsely. "She rolled over as she swung across the
stream."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell shivered, because it was obvious that the
sick man was going over what had happened the night
Strange was drowned. His manner hinted that he
was trying to excuse himself for something he had
done. Shrinking back in the bunk, he resumed in a
stronger voice: "I couldn't stop her! The stream was
running fast."</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he was silent for a time and Thirlwell heard
the river rolling through its ice-bound channel and the
dreary wailing of the pines. He felt disturbed; something
in Driscoll's voice and look had jarred his nerves,
and it cost him an effort not to waken Father Lucien.
It was not time yet and the priest needed sleep. Driscoll
lay quiet with his eyes shut, but presently moved
and began to mutter. Thirlwell, leaning forward,
caught the words: "I never had the thing; he took it
with him."</p>

<p class="dgp">The strained voice broke, Driscoll drew a hard
breath, and feebly turned his face from the light.
After this Thirlwell, whose curiosity was excited, had
less trouble to keep awake, and at length roused Father
Lucien, as he had been told. It was nearly three
o'clock in the morning, the fire had sunk, and the shack
was very cold. The wind had fallen and the bush was
silent; one could hear the loose snow dropping from
the boughs.</p>


<p class="dgp">Father Lucien crossed the floor and after standing
for a time beside the bunk came back and sat down
by the stove.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can put in fresh wood; it won't disturb him
now," he said. "He's sleeping well. I think the
danger's over."</p>

<p class="dgp">The cord wood snapped and crackled, the front of
the stove got red, and sitting in a corner out of the
draughts, they began to talk in low voices.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Driscoll was delirious; he talked strangely," Thirlwell
remarked. "Is a sick man's raving all such stuff
as dreams?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," said Father Lucien, "we know little yet
about the working of the disordered brain, but the
imagination sometimes centers on and distorts things
that have happened. Did you get a hint of intelligence
in what Driscoll said?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I did. He said he <em>never had the thing</em>.
Somebody&mdash;Strange, perhaps&mdash;<em>took it with him</em>."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why do you think he meant Strange?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Because his mind was obviously dwelling on the
night Strange's canoe capsized. He said it was an
accident&mdash;he could not stop her swinging across the
stream&mdash;as if he were answering somebody who accused
him. The disturbing thing was that although
delirious he looked horribly afraid."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien was silent and Thirlwell went on:
"You have been with him for three nights. Has he
talked like this before?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Father Lucien, quietly. "You can be
trusted. I think he is afraid."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" said Thirlwell, looking hard at him.
"Then I wonder why the canoe capsized. Were they

drunk, or was there a quarrel? But perhaps you know
and cannot tell!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I do not know. Driscoll is not of my flock. He
is ill and it is my business to cure his sickness, but I
can go no farther. If he has other troubles, he would
refuse my help."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That is so," Thirlwell agreed. "There's a mystery
about the capsize, and I'm curious. You see, I
met Strange's daughter and she believes in the lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien hesitated, and then went to a shelf.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I will show you something," he said, and gave
Thirlwell a small Russian leather wallet. It was well
made, but worn and stained as if it had been soaked
in water. "I found this when I undressed Driscoll,"
he went on. "It is not a thing you would expect a
rude prospector to carry. But I found something
else."</p>

<p class="dgp">He held out a piece of broken stone and Thirlwell
as he took it moved abruptly. He knew something
about ore and saw that the stone had come from the
same vein as the specimen Agatha had given him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think Strange found the silver," Father Lucien
said quietly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell knitted his brows. He had dark suspicions,
but after all they had no solid foundation, and
he thought it best to copy the missionary's reserve.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We know Driscoll's character, and may have been
mistaken about one thing. Is it logical to imagine
that such a man would feel afraid?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Fear sometimes comes without remorse," said
Father Lucien.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Superstitious fear, working on a brain disordered
by liquor and illness?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"We will not argue about the proper name. It
may be superstition, or something greater. I believe
that retribution follows the offense."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell looked hard at the other. "Well, I doubt
if we will ever know the truth about Strange's death."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It is possible," Father Lucien agreed. "Perhaps
it is not important whether we know or not. One
thing is certain: if wrong has been done, it will be
made right, if not by the way we would choose, by
another. I think we may leave it there."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We must," said Thirlwell dryly. "There is nothing
else to do. In the meantime, if I can't be useful,
I'm going to sleep."</p>

<p class="dgp">Day was breaking when he wakened and Father
Lucien told him that Driscoll was better, but would
need careful nursing for a time.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then Scott must come to-night," Thirlwell replied.
"I've had enough of watching Steve, and
don't mind admitting that your charity is greater than
mine."</p>

<p class="dgp">When he reached the shack he told Scott nothing
about what he had heard, because he thought Father
Lucien would sooner he did not. The latter knew
when to be silent and it would do no good to talk about
the matter unless something happened to throw a light
upon the mystery. On the whole, he was relieved
when Driscoll, who soon recovered, set off up river
with a half-breed and a loaded hand-sledge.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter VI&mdash;Father Lucien's Adventure</h3>

<p class="noindent">The snow was firm and the rivers were frozen
hard when Thirlwell left the mine with two
<em>Metis</em> trappers to examine an outcropping reef that
one of the half-breeds had told him about. He was
not very hopeful, but agreed with Scott, who thought
it might be worth while to look at the reef, since the
specimens the <em>Metis</em> had brought showed traces of silver
and lead. Then Father Lucien had gone to visit
some of his people who had camped for their winter
trapping far up in the bush, the shack was lonely, and
the frost hindered the work at the mine.</p>

<p class="dgp">Winter is not a good time for prospecting, but travel
is often easier then, for the hand-sledges run smoothly
on the snow that covers fallen trunks and underbrush
and levels the hollows. The muskegs are frozen and
one can make fast marches along the rivers and across
the lakes. Thirlwell had no tent, but it is not a great
hardship for a well-fed man, wrapped in furs, to sleep
beside a big fire behind a bank of snow, and he had no
misadventures as he pushed into the wilds. The ore
proved to be worthless, and soon after he started back
he met an Indian who said he had seen Father Lucien
going south with a dog-team two days before, and had
found the trail of another white man near the spot
where he and his friends had camped.</p>

<p class="dgp">The clear, cold weather broke when Thirlwell began

his homeward march. The sky was low and
leaden, and a biting wind blew from the south. It
drove the snow-dust into the men's smarting faces and
froze their breath on their furs. Their hands stiffened
on the sledge-traces and their feet got numb. The
cold got worse when snow began to fall and when they
camped one night Thirlwell noted that they had used
more food than he thought. The transport of provisions
is perhaps the main difficulty of a winter journey
in the bush, for men who brave the arctic cold
must be generously fed. Thirlwell, however, expected
to reach the mine before their stores ran out, and set off
at daybreak next morning in heavy, driving snow.</p>

<p class="dgp">At dusk he camped in a clump of dry willows by a
river. The snow had stopped, but a bitter wind blew
down the valley and the cold was intense. When he
had eaten a meal Thirlwell sat with his back to a snow
bank and a big fire in front, holding up a moccasin to
the blaze. This was necessary because moccasins absorb
moisture during a long day's march, and the man
who puts them on while damp risks getting frozen
feet.</p>

<p class="dgp">He was lighting his pipe when the <em>Metis</em> he had sent
out for wood came back with an armful of branches
and said he had seen a light up the river. Thirlwell
put on his half-dried moccasins and reluctantly left
the camp. He had met nobody but an Indian on the
trail and was curious to know who was camping in
those solitudes. Besides, it was possible that he might
be able to get some supplies.</p>

<p class="dgp">As he pushed through the willows the savage wind
pierced him to the bone. The dry branches rattled and
the pines upon the ridge above wailed drearily. The

sky was clear and the frozen river, running back, white
and level, through the dusky forest, glittered in the
light of a half moon. This was all that Thirlwell
saw for a few minutes, and then a twinkling light in the
distance fixed his attention. It flickered, got brighter,
and faded, and he knew it was a fire.</p>

<p class="dgp">After a time he and the <em>Metis</em> left the river and
climbed the steep bank. The fire had vanished, but
the pungent smell of burning wood came down the
biting wind, and by and by trails of smoke drifted past
the scattered pines. Then as they struggled through a
brake of wild-fruit canes a blaze leaped up among the
the rocks and he saw an indistinct figure crouching
beside a fire. The figure got up awkwardly and a few
moments later Father Lucien gave Thirlwell his hand.
The light touched his thin frost-browned face, which
was marked by lines that pain had drawn.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's lucky you came, but, if you don't mind, we'll
sit down," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you're alone, you had better come back to our
camp," Thirlwell replied. "Where's your truck and
the dogs?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien indicated the torn blue blanket that
hung from his shoulder. "All gone except this! But
it's a long story and I can't walk."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you have nothing to eat?" said Thirlwell
sharply.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Half a small bannock; I ate the rest this morning.
The worst was I had only melted snow to drink."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made a sympathetic gesture, for men who
camp in the frozen woods consume large quantities of
nearly boiling tea. Then he turned to the half-breed
and sent him back for his companion and the sledge.</p>


<p class="dgp">"We'll haul you down the river as soon as they
come," he said. "By good luck, we camped in perhaps
the only place from which we could have seen
your fire."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," said Father Lucien with a quiet smile, "I
do not know if it was luck alone that made you choose
the spot."</p>

<p class="dgp">They sat down in the hollow among the rocks, and
the missionary shivered although the fire snapped and
threw out clouds of smoke close by. Thirlwell gave
him his tobacco pouch.</p>

<p class="dgp">"In the meantime, you can eat your bannock and
then take a smoke. I'm curious to learn how you lost
your outfit and the dogs."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien ate the morsel of hard cake, and
afterwards looked up. "Perhaps I had better tell you
before your men arrive. Well, I traveled about with
my people as they moved their traps, and one night
when very tired I slept in damp moccasins. The fire
got low and next morning my foot was slightly frozen.
We were forced to make long marches for some days,
and I found the frost-bite had gone deeper than I
thought. You can, no doubt, guess what happened."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell nodded. A frozen foot sometimes galls
into a sore that will not heal while the temperature is
low.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Father Lucien, "some time after we
pitched camp, a man came in with a dog-team that
belonged to the Hudson's Bay. He was not going
farther but offered to lend me the dogs, if I would
leave them with some friends of his who were trapping
to the south."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But can you drive dogs?" Thirlwell asked, knowing

that skill is required to manage the snarling, fighting
teams.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not well, but I have driven dogs, and was anxious
to reach the mine before my foot got worse. I
thought I might find somebody at the Indians' camp
who would go on with me. For a day or two we made
good progress, though I had trouble to harness the
leader in the morning; he was a stubborn, bad tempered
animal, and missed his master's firm control. Then,
one evening, we came to a creek. The stream had
kept the channel open here and there, and I thought
the ice thin, but it was open, rocky country round about,
and I saw a clump of pines in the distance where we
could camp. It got dark as we followed the creek and
clouds drifted over the moon, but I wanted to find
shelter and pushed on. Once or twice the ice cracked
ominously, but it held until we came to a spot where the
stream got narrower between high, rocky banks.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The leader stopped and growled, at the edge of an
open crack. His instinct warned him of danger, but I
knew I could not get up the rough bank with my lame
foot, and drove him past. As I limped by his side with
the whip, I thought I heard the current gurgle under
the ice, but we went on, the dogs snuffing and treading
cautiously. Then there was a soft thud and a splash,
the team was jerked back and I saw that the sledge had
vanished. I suppose it had broken through a snow-bridge
that our weight had shaken.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I scrambled back a yard or two and looked down
into the dark gap&mdash;I could not run because of my
galled foot. Part of the sledge was covered by fallen
snow, but the fore end rested on something and I
leaned down and seized my blanket. There was a bag

of food beneath it that I tried to reach, but perhaps I
shook the sledge, which began to slip down, and I saw
the dogs roll among the traces as they were dragged
towards the hole. The leader clawed desperately at
the snow, howling as if he begged my help, and I felt
that I must save him. You have heard a dog howl
in fear or pain?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Thirlwell, "it makes a strong appeal.
But I suppose you remembered what you risked by
leaving the food?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I cut the trace," Father Lucien went on. "Another
mass of snow fell and the sledge sank out of
sight. I imagine the stream swept it under the ice, for
I could only see the dark water foam. All the food I
had except a bannock in my pocket was lost. I forgot
the team for a few moments and when I looked up they
had gone."</p>

<p class="dgp">He paused and Thirlwell made a sign of sympathy.
"A nerve-shaking jar! But what became of the
dogs?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think they were afraid of the ice. If my camp
had been made and a fire lighted, they might have come
in for warmth, but I was not their master, and perhaps
they took the back trail to the spot we started from.
Well, as I could not follow, I limped on until I reached
the pine clump, where I slept, and then dragged myself
across the divide to this corner among the rocks. I
knew I could go no farther and sat down to wait&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien's voice was calm and Thirlwell knew
his courage had not failed. The man had often risked
death when duty sent him out across the snowy wilds.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Anyhow," said Thirlwell, "I'm glad I found you

before it was too late. It's something I and others will
long be thankful for."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien smiled deprecatingly. "If I had
starved, another would have filled my place. Men fall
on the trail, but the work goes forward. Perhaps I
have said too much about my danger, but I did so because
of a curious thing that happened last night. I
slept as well as usual for some hours, and then opened
my eyes. I think, however, I was not quite awake,
or else my brain was dull, because I felt no surprise
although a man was in my camp. The fire had burned
low and he stood back in the gloom where I could not
see his face, but a dry branch broke into flame and the
light fell on me. The way the man turned his head
indicated that he was looking about the camp, and he
must have seen that I had nothing but my blanket.
But he was silent and did not come forward."</p>

<p class="dgp">"An Indian?" Thirlwell asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Father Lucien. "He was white."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell started. "A white man? It looks impossible.
But why didn't you&mdash;?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I did not speak. You see, I had not heard him
come, and imagine now that I thought I was dreaming
and was afraid to wake and find my hope of help had
gone. After a few moments, he stepped back very
quietly into the shadow, and I called out. There was
no answer and I got up. It took a little time&mdash;the
blanket was round my legs and my foot hurt&mdash;and
when I stumbled away from the fire he had vanished
and there was no sound in the bush. Soon afterwards
I fell down in the snow, and lay until the cold roused
me to an effort and I crawled back to the fire. By

and by I went to sleep again and did not waken until
daybreak."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then," said Thirlwell, meaningly, "you could find
no tracks."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I could not," Father Lucien agreed. "That was
not strange, because light snow was falling when I
got up and the wind was fresh. Still I found this; it
shows I was not dreaming."</p>

<p class="dgp">He gave Thirlwell a wooden pipe with a nickel band
round the stem.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" said Thirlwell, who examined the frozen
pipe and scraped out a little half-burned tobacco with
his knife. "Fifty-cents, at a settlement store! Not
the kind of things the Indians buy, and this is not the
stuff they generally smoke. Besides, you would know
an Indian, whether he spoke or not, by his figure and
his pose."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien said nothing, but looked at him with a
quiet smile, and Thirlwell resumed: "Well, there was
a man; a white man. But the thing's not to be understood.
He knew you were starving and stole away!
Then where did he come from? There's no white man
except Driscoll between the Hudson's Bay post and the
mine, and you saved Driscoll's life."</p>

<p class="dgp">"When I last heard of him, Driscoll was trapping
about Stony Creek, a long way to the east."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell knitted his brows and lighted his pipe,
which he had put near the fire to thaw, and there was
silence until the <em>Metis</em> arrived with the sledge, when
they took the missionary to their camp and gave him
food. After he had eaten they lay down with their
feet to the fire and Thirlwell said: "If the man had
seen your fire and come to borrow something or find

out who you were, he would have spoken. There's
nobody I can think of who has not some grounds for
wishing you well, but it looks as if the fellow thought
you were asleep and meant to let you starve."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It looks like that," Father Lucien agreed with a
curious calm. "Perhaps we shall find out who he was
some day, and if not, it does not matter."</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he drew the blanket across his face and went
to sleep.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter VII&mdash;Agatha's Resolve</h3>

<p class="noindent">Agatha looked pale and tired as she sat, rather
languidly, in an easy chair in Mrs. Farnam's
pretty room. There was bitter frost outside, but the
new wooden house, standing among the orchards of
South Ontario, was warm, and furnished with a regard
for comfort and artistic taste. Mrs. Farnam was
proud of her house and good-humored husband, who
gave way to her except about the growing of fruit.
On this subject, she had told Agatha, he was extraordinarily
obstinate. She had some tact and much
kindly feeling, but had been a teacher and believed she
had a talent for managing other people's business. In
fact, she had tried to manage Agatha's, but was forced
to admit without much success. Agatha, she said, was
difficult.</p>

<p class="dgp">For all that, it had given her keen satisfaction to
bring the girl there when she was threatened by a
nervous breakdown in consequence of over-work.
Agatha had been her confidential friend when they
were at school, but since Mabel married she had sometimes
felt that the confidence had been rather one-sided.
She had told Agatha much, but the latter had said little
about her future plans.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't think you're very much better yet," Mrs.
Farnam said after a pause in the talk, for she was
seldom silent long.</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha languidly looked about the room, noting the
warm color of the polished floor, on which the light
of the shaded lamp lay in a glistening pool, the fine
skin rugs, and thick curtains. She had not an exaggerated
love of comfort and her Toronto rooms were
bare, but she owned that Mabel had a pretty house.
Besides, she had a husband who indulged her and was
always kind.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's very nice to be here, and I shall soon get
strong," she said. "I suppose I rather overdid things,
but the examination was coming and I was anxious my
girls should pass well."</p>

<p class="dgp">"From the school managers' point of view, that was
a laudable aim, but I don't know that it was worth injuring
your health for. You used to agree that managers
often expected too much from a teacher."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm afraid I had a selfish object," said Agatha,
smiling. "I wanted a better post that will soon be
vacant."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ambition sometimes deceives one. I know the
post you mean and the girl who's going. It carries
duties that wore her out."</p>

<p class="dgp">"And better pay," said Agatha.</p>

<p class="dgp">Mrs. Farnam gave her a thoughtful look. "Well,
that's plausible; but I never thought you greedy. Why
do you want the extra pay?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have a use for it," Agatha replied with a twinkle.
"I don't suppose I shall carry out my plans, and after
all, they are too ridiculous to talk about. Anyhow,
you would think so. You're very practical."</p>

<p class="dgp">"People are curious," Mrs. Farnam remarked.
"I'm willing to admit I'm practical, but I married and
love my husband, while you look romantic and in many

ways are not. You risk your health for money, and
I don't think any man ever roused a tender thought in
you. There's Jake, for example&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">She stopped and Agatha was silent for a few moments,
although she was moved. She was tired and
felt lonely and that life was hard. Instinctive longings
that she had fought against awoke. She wanted somebody
to shelter her and brush her troubles away.
Mabel had her husband, whom she loved; but she had
chosen a rocky path that she must walk alone.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I hope Jake is getting on well in British Columbia,"
she said. "I suppose you hear from him?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"He writes to us regularly and is getting on very
well. Finds his work absorbing and sees a chance of
promotion, but it's obvious that he's not satisfied. I
don't know if you feel flattered, but he can't forget
you."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha stopped her. Jake was Mrs. Farnam's
cousin, and had been a teacher of science until he got
a post at a mine. He had helped Agatha in her studies,
and she blamed herself for imagining that common interests
and ambitions accounted for their friendship.
In fact, it was something of a shock when, on getting
his new post, Jake had asked her to marry him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm not flattered but sorry," she replied. "I liked
Jake very much&mdash;one was forced to like him&mdash;but
after all that doesn't go far enough. And, you see, I
didn't know&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I believe you really didn't know. It would be
ridiculous to admit this about any other girl, but, in a
way, you're not quite normal. You're too absorbed in
your occupation and haven't a woman's natural feelings.
You took all Jake had to give and were surprised

and half indignant when he asked something
from you."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha wondered rather drearily whether Mrs.
Farnam's reproaches were not justified; but the latter
went on: "Perhaps, however, your coldness is encouraging.
I don't suppose you have met anybody you
liked, or felt you could like, better than Jake."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Agatha, and then hesitated. Since
Mabel was capable of giving her cousin a hint, she
saw that frankness was needed and remembered the
fortnight she had spent with Thirlwell by the lake.
She had thought about him since; indeed she had done
so oftener than she knew.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I shall never marry Jake," she said. "Just now it
seems unlikely that I shall marry anybody else."</p>

<p class="dgp">Mrs. Farnam made a sign of disappointed acquiescence.
"Very well! That's done with. If there's
anything more to be said about your plans for the next
few months, your brother will say it. I'm glad George
is coming, because he's sensible and will deal with you
firmly. Now I'll go and get supper."</p>

<p class="dgp">She left Agatha thoughtful. George, whose business
occasionally brought him into the neighborhood,
had written to say that he was coming and would stop
the night, and Agatha wondered what he wanted to
talk about. He would certainly give her good advice,
but they seldom saw alike and she braced herself for a
struggle, although she was fond of her brother.</p>

<p class="dgp">Supper in the bright cedar-paneled room was a
cheerful function, and as she looked about and joined
in the talk Agatha was conscious of a feeling that was
hardly strong enough for envy or actual discontent,
but had a touch of both. Mabel looked happy and

modestly proud. She was obviously satisfied and in a
way enjoyed all that a woman could wish for. The
house was pretty; Farnam was indulgent and showed
his wife a deference that Agatha liked. He owned a
large orchard and had sufficient capital to cultivate it
properly. George Strange was marked by a complacent,
self-confident manner that his urbanity somewhat
toned down. He dealt in artificial fertilizers and
farming implements, and it was said that he never lost
a customer and seldom made a bad debt.</p>

<p class="dgp">In character, George was unlike his sister, because
while unimaginative he generally saw where his advantage
lay. For all that, he was just and often generous.
He was married, and talked to Mrs. Farnam
about his wife and child when he was not eating with
frank enjoyment and telling humorous stories. While
the others laughed and joked Agatha mused. They
had commonplace aims and duties that brought them
happiness; but she had been given a harder task. Still
it was a task that could not be shirked; she had accepted
it and must carry it out.</p>

<p class="dgp">Some time after supper Mrs. Farnam went away,
and Farnam presently made an excuse for following
his wife. When they had gone George remarked:
"I must pull out to-morrow, but Florence sends a
message. She wants you to stop with us for two or
three months."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Florence is kind," said Agatha. "I would like to
go, but you know it's impossible."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know," George rejoined in an authoritative
voice. "I'm your elder brother and it's my duty to see
you do what you ought. To begin with, I looked up
your doctor and he told me you needed a long rest."</p>


<p class="dgp">"It can't be got. I must go back to school when the
holidays are over."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Wait a bit! None of us is as indispensable as we
sometimes think."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha felt half amused and half annoyed. George
often made remarks like this and imagined that they
clinched his arguments. She saw that he had been
meddling.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What did you do after seeing the doctor?" she
asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I went to your principal at the school. She said
she would talk to the managers and had no doubt that
if it was needful they would let you off for a time.
Now as I can fix the thing with the doctor, there's no
reason you shouldn't quit work and stop with us."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha colored angrily. George meant well, but he
had gone too far. She felt this worse because she was
tempted to give way. She liked her brother's wife
and needed a rest.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," she said, "I suppose I ought to have expected
something of the kind, but it's comforting to
feel that your efforts are wasted. I shall be quite well
in a week or two and am going back to school. For
one thing, I shall need some money before very long."</p>

<p class="dgp">George looked hard at her. "You don't say why.
Still if it's money that prevents you taking the proper
line, I might lend you some&mdash;" He stopped and resumed
with suspicion: "But I won't give you a dollar
to waste in searching for father's silver lode!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I am going to look for the lode," said Agatha
quietly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I hoped you had got over that foolishness," George
rejoined, throwing his cigarette on the floor, although

he was generally careful about such things. "Now
listen to me for a few minutes, and try to be sensible!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"One misses much by always being sensible,"
Agatha remarked with a resigned smile.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It often saves one's relations trouble. Anyhow,
the blamed lode has thrown its shadow on all our lives,
and I don't mean to stand off, saying nothing, and see
you spoil yours."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You escaped the shadow, because you never believed
in the lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I certainly didn't and don't believe in it now! For
all that, I saw father's restlessness and mother's fears."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" said Agatha, "I didn't think&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I allow I haven't your imagination, but I can see a
thing that's obvious. Father thought he hid his feelings,
but mother knew and grieved. She was afraid
he would give us up and go back to the North."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No!" said Agatha with firmness; "she was not
afraid he would give us up! Father never failed in
his duty."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then she was certainly afraid he'd die in the bush;
as he did. She knew what the prospectors were up
against, and though she smiled when he talked about
the ore, I knew she had an anxious heart. I don't
claim that the anxiety broke her down, but it made a
heavy load and helped."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yet when she was very ill she did not ask him to
promise he wouldn't go."</p>

<p class="dgp">"She did not mind then," said George in a quiet
voice. "She was dying and we had grown up. But
there was nothing selfish about her acquiescence. I
think she was glad to set him free, because she loved

him and knew what he had borne. He was a dreamer
and not a business man. She had run the store and
taken care of him, and knew he would be lonely
after she had gone. Besides, I sometimes feel she
thought he would follow and rejoin her soon. It did
not matter by what road he came."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha was silent for some moments because she
was surprised and moved. George had a keener imagination
and saw farther than she thought. It looked
as if he had known her mother best.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You loved her well and so you understood," she
said. "But the troubles she bore are done with, and
now I stand alone. I have no responsibilities; my life
is mine!"</p>

<p class="dgp">George's face got red. "Well, perhaps I don't
count for much, but we didn't cut loose when I married.
I have a sister as well as a wife."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm sorry, George," said Agatha, putting her hand
on his arm. "I didn't mean to hurt."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well! I'm not a sentimental fellow; let's be
practical. You can't locate the ore, because it isn't
there; but you may spoil your health and get soured
by disappointment. Then, if you stop long, you'll lose
your post and ruin your career. The blamed silver
may become a fixed illusion. That's what I'm really
afraid of most. In some ways, you're very like
father."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You're persuaded the silver was an illusion?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I am persuaded," George declared. "Men who
live in the frozen woods get credulous and believe extraordinary
things, and tales of wonderful lodes are
common in the mining belts. Father heard something
of the kind and brooded over it until he came to believe

he had located the ore. He had too much imagination
and wasn't practical."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But he gave me some specimens he found and they
carry rich metal."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I allow he thought he found them; but that's a different
thing."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled. "Perhaps your theory's plausible,
but it has some weak points."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Anyhow, if father couldn't locate the vein he
claimed to have struck, I reckon there's not much
chance of your doing so."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I mean to try," said Agatha, with ominous quietness.</p>

<p class="dgp">George saw that she was resolute, and although he
was obstinate knew he was beaten. Agatha could not
be moved when she looked like that.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can't allow that you know best, but guess I may
as well quit arguing," he remarked with a resigned
shrug. "You'll come along and stop with Florence
before you go back to Toronto?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I will come for a week," Agatha agreed, and
George went away to look for Farnam.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter VIII&mdash;The Burglar</h3>


<p class="noindent">George went away next morning and a few
days afterwards Farnam walked home with his
wife and Agatha from a visit to a neighbor's homestead.
When they reached the edge of Farnam's orchard
they stopped and looked about. An extensive
clearing had been cut out of the forest, the evening was
clear and cold, and the pines threw long blue shadows
on the snow. The young fruit trees ran back in orderly
rows, and a frozen creek that crossed the orchard
was picked out in delicate shades of gray. Farnam
told Agatha that he found the creek useful for irrigation,
because he had known the apples to shrivel on the
trees in a dry summer.</p>

<p class="dgp">At the edge of the bush a group of men were at
work. The thud of their axes jarred on the quietness,
and the rattle of a chain rang musically through
the shadows as a teamster threw the links across a log.
His horses stood close by, with a thin cloud of steam
rising from their bodies.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Lumber worth sawing is getting scarce, and we'll
float the best logs down to the mill when the thaw
comes," Farnam said to Agatha. "In the meantime,
we want them off the ground before we clean up the
pieces the boys have slashed. One gets at this kind
of work in winter when nothing much can be done, and

I must be ready to break new soil for planting in the
spring."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are spending a good deal of money," Mrs.
Farnam interrupted. "You haven't been paid for the
last shipments to England yet."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mabel's cautious," Farnam remarked to Agatha.
"She's a pretty good business woman, but doesn't
understand that the more you spend on your job the
more you get. Anyhow, you ought to get more, but
I admit you're sometimes badly stung." Then he
turned to his wife. "I must go up and see the shippers
in Montreal; in fact, now you have Agatha with
you, I think I'll start to-morrow."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," said Mrs. Farnam. "I hate to be
left alone, particularly when the nights are long."
She indicated the teamster. "I see you have hired
another man; that's a fresh extravagance. How long
have you had him?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"A week or two; thought I told you when he came.
He's a pretty good worker."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You didn't tell me; I imagine you didn't want me
to know! He's certainly not what the boys call a
looker and his face doesn't inspire me with much confidence.
Besides, he's lame."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha glanced at the man, who came towards them,
walking with a slight limp beside his horses as they
hauled the log across the snow. He had a sullen air
and did not look up as he passed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"He is not handsome," she agreed, and asked:
"Where do the men live?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"We have fixed up this lot in the packing shed;
my regular hands leave me in winter," Farnam replied,
indicating a wooden building at some distance

from the house. "However, we'll go home. There
are some accounts I must examine before I start for
Montreal."</p>

<p class="dgp">They went on, and when after supper Mrs. Farnam
grumbled at being left without a man in the house,
Farnam took out an automatic pistol and explained
how it was used.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know why I bought the thing, unless it
was to satisfy Mabel," he said to Agatha. "It's curious,
but while she could handle mutinous pupils and
bluff the managers, she quakes if a door rattles on a
windy night. One's rather safer in our homestead
than a Montreal hotel; but Mabel has lived in the cities
and the Wild West tradition dies hard. As a matter
of fact, there never was a Wild West in Canada."
He opened the pistol. "You put the cartridge shells
in like this&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can show Agatha how it works; I won't
touch the thing," Mrs. Farnam declared. "She's
something of a sport, but I'm a womanly woman, except
when I teach school."</p>

<p class="dgp">Farnam laughed. "On the whole, it might be better
to leave the cartridges out. If somebody did break
in, all you need do would be to pretend you were
asleep. Everybody in the neighborhood knows where
my office is and an intelligent burglar begins at the
safe. There's no money in mine now."</p>

<p class="dgp">After a little good-humored banter, Agatha took the
pistol and Farnam went to his office at the other end
of the house. Next day he started for Montreal, and
at night Mrs. Farnam made Agatha come with her
while she examined the fastenings of the doors and
windows. The house was low and the roof of the

veranda in front reached nearly to the second floor.
Nothing disturbing happened, and on the next night
Agatha sat up after Mrs. Farnam had gone to bed,
reading the letters Strange had written her from the
North.</p>

<p class="dgp">There were not many, and some were marked by a
careless style that obscured the meaning. This puzzled
Agatha, who remembered that her father had
generally talked with lucid clearness. Still they
helped her to picture the life he had led in the wilds,
and she read them often, trying to follow on a map
his wanderings in search of the lode. They told her
more about the country than the books she read, and
she had read a number, because the subject had a fascination.
All she could learn would be of use when
she came to carry out her plans.</p>

<p class="dgp">When she tied up the letters and looked at the clock
it was later than she thought. The room felt cold and
she shivered, but sat still for a few moments, musing.
The house was quiet and she imagined Mrs. Farnam
was asleep; but it was snowing, for she heard the
flakes beat upon the window. Looking round the
comfortable room, she thought of the men who braved
the rigors of winter in the frozen wilds. Thirlwell,
for example, was bearing such cold as was never felt
in South Ontario.</p>

<p class="dgp">She started, for there was a noise overhead, as if
a door had been gently opened, but next moment pulled
herself together. Mabel had not gone to sleep as she
had thought, and picking up an electric torch, she put
out the lamp. When she was half way up the stairs
she heard somebody moving about, but it was not like
Mabel's step. The movements seemed cautious, and

there was something awkward about them. Agatha,
who wore felt-soled slippers, stopped and listened,
while her heart beat fast. She heard nothing now,
but felt alarmed, and wondered what she ought to do.
A call would probably bring an answer that would
banish her fears; but suppose it was not Mabel she
had heard? There was, however, another way of
finding out, and with something of an effort she went
upstairs.</p>

<p class="dgp">Mrs. Farnam's room was on the landing, and Agatha
turned the handle cautiously. The door would
not open, and it was obvious that Mabel had locked
herself in. Then the latch slipped back with a jar
that sounded horribly loud, and she waited, trembling
and trying to keep calm. Since Mabel had not heard
the noise, it was plain that she was asleep and somebody
else was in the house. Still Mabel, if awakened,
would not be of much help, and remembering that the
pistol was in her room, Agatha went down the passage.</p>

<p class="dgp">The passage was very cold, a curtain swayed in an
icy draught, and she found the door of her room open.
Stopping for a moment, she thought there was somebody
inside. This, however, might be a trick of her
imagination, and although she wanted to steal away,
she knew that if she did so she would lose her self-respect
and the confidence she would need for her
journey to the North. She must brave real dangers
in the wilds and live among rude men. Besides, the
pistol was on a table near the door.</p>

<p class="dgp">Somebody moved as she went in, for there was a
rustle and a board cracked, but her hand touched the
pistol and she turned on the powerful electric torch.
As the beam of light swept across the room she saw

that the drawer of a small writing-table had been pulled
out. Then the beam passed on and touched a man
kneeling beside her open trunk. The clothes she had
not unpacked were scattered on the floor, as if the man
had been looking for something, and a lantern stood
near his hand. She thought he had just put it out,
since she noted a smell of oil.</p>

<p class="dgp">Now she had found the intruder, she was less afraid
than angry that he had pulled about her clothes with
his coarse, dirty hands. She knew him, for he was
the teamster she had seen in the orchard. The beam
that picked him out, however, left the rest of the room
in gloom, and it was hard to hold the torch steady.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Light your lantern, but don't move from where
you are," she said. "I have a pistol."</p>

<p class="dgp">He did as he was told, using an old-fashioned sulphur
match that smelt disagreeably but made no noise.
The light spread and showed her standing with the
pistol in her hand, but when she risked a glance about,
nothing seemed to have been disturbed except the
writing-table and her trunk.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Now you may get up, but don't be rash," she said
quietly and was glad to feel she could control her voice.</p>

<p class="dgp">He got up and waited, watching her sullenly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What have you taken?" she asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Nothing! There was nothing worth taking!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha forced a mocking smile. "Worn clothes
won't sell for much and I have no jewelry." Then
she raised the pistol. "Don't move! I mean you to
keep still."</p>

<p class="dgp">He stood motionless, with a kind of dull resignation,
although she thought she had noted a curious

shrinking when she spoke, as if something in her
voice had disturbed him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know what to do with you," she resumed.
"No doubt you knew Mr. Farnam is away, but the
pistol magazine is full. To begin with, you had better
empty your pockets. Pull them inside out!"</p>

<p class="dgp">He obeyed and dropped a pipe, a tobacco tin, and
two or three silver coins.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Those are mine; I've corralled nothing of yours."</p>

<p class="dgp">"So it seems!" Agatha rejoined. "For all that,
you can leave the things there. How did you get in?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Over the veranda roof. You hadn't fixed the
shutter in the middle."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha pondered for a few moments. The fellow
did not look afraid, but seemed to recognize that the
advantage was with her. This was lucky, because she
could not keep it up long and wanted to get rid of him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," she said, "I think you had better go out
by the window you opened. Walk down the passage
in front of me and don't try to turn round."</p>

<p class="dgp">He did so until he reached the window, which opened
to the side. The hinges were in good order and made
no noise when he pushed back the frame.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Get out," said Agatha. "I'll shoot if you stop."</p>

<p class="dgp">He climbed quietly over the ledge, his lantern flickered
and went out, and next moment Agatha saw
nothing but the driving snow. Then she closed the
window and fastened the shutter in frantic haste, and
afterwards leaned against the wall, trembling and
breathing hard. Still the man had gone and she
thought he would not come back. Pulling herself
together she returned to her room.</p>


<p class="dgp">Although she had driven the man away, she locked
the door, and when she had lighted the lamp sat down
to recover her calm. There was no use in wakening
Mrs. Farnam, and by and by she began to look about.
The papers in the writing-table had been thrown upon
the floor; her trunk was empty and the clothes it had
held were scattered. The man had obviously been
searching for something, and this was curious, because
one would not expect to find jewelry in a writing-table,
and a bureau with three or four drawers had not been
opened. Then she noticed her father's letters lying
in a bundle on the table, and put them back in the
trunk from which she had recently taken them. After
this, she re-packed her clothes, and sitting down again
tried to remember all that had happened.</p>

<p class="dgp">There was something puzzling about the adventure.
To begin with, she could not see why the man
had come to her room and what he expected to get.
A clever thief would have gone to Farnam's office.
Then she thought he was not a coward; he had given
way because he was cool enough to see that he was
in her power and resistance would lead to his getting
shot. Yet he had seemed to shrink when he heard her
voice. She reflected with faint amusement that her
voice was not harsh, and she had studied its control as
part of her training when she began to teach. The
little tricks of tone and gesture one used to overawe
young girls would not frighten a man. For all that,
when she first spoke there was a hint of fear in his
furtive eyes.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha let this go, and pondered her own feelings
and the part she had played. She had, of course, been
frightened, but had preserved her judgment and seen

that she could control the situation so long as she kept
cool. The man had not a pistol, and she could have
fired three or four shots before he could seize her; but
he might have tried to seize her had she not shown that
she was ready to shoot. It looked as if she had the
nerve and confidence to face a crisis, which was satisfactory,
since she would need these qualities when she
traveled through the wilds. She had, however, long
trained herself for this object; in fact, as far as possible,
she made her life a preparation for the adventurous
journey. Then she remembered her brother's
warning and wondered whether it was justified.
There was, perhaps, a danger of her dwelling too much
upon the lode. She must not let it possess her mind
and make her deaf to other claims. One ought to
keep a proper balance. In the meantime, she was
tired, and feeling limp with the reaction from the
strain. She got up and shortly afterwards went to
bed.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter IX&mdash;Agatha Asks Advice</h3>


<p class="noindent">Agatha said nothing next morning about her
adventure, although she heard that the lame
man had left the packing shed when his companions
were asleep and had not come back. Next day Farnam
returned and in the evening, when Mrs. Farnam was
busy, she found an opportunity of talking to him alone.
He looked thoughtful when he heard her story.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You did right not to tell Mabel; but I certainly
can't understand the thing," he said. "I reckon you
have your imagination under pretty good control."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I didn't imagine I saw the man," Agatha rejoined
with a smile.</p>

<p class="dgp">Farnam nodded. "We'll take that for granted.
I wanted a teamster and hired the fellow when he asked
for the job. He worked well, but I don't know where
he came from or where he's gone, and it would scare
Mabel if we put the police on his trail. Besides, I
guess he lit out by the train in the morning that catches
the west-bound express."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Since he knew you were away, why did he wait
instead of coming as soon as you left?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"He probably reckoned there was a risk of his being
heard on a calm, frosty night; I understand it was
blowing fresh and snowing when he came. The snow
would cover his tracks. But I'm puzzled. It's strange
that he took nothing and left my s7afe alone!"</p>


<p class="dgp">"Do you think he knew where the safe is?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sure," said Farnam. "The boys come to my office
for their pay." He paused and added thoughtfully:
"Looks as if the fellow had an object for searching
your room!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder whether he knew I was a school teacher,"
Agatha remarked. "If he did know, it complicates
the thing, because teachers are not often rich. Besides,
how did he learn which was my room?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"That wouldn't be hard," Farnam replied. "The
boys get talking, evenings, with Mabel's kitchen help
and I guess she tells them all about the house and our
habits. The girl's a powerful talker."</p>

<p class="dgp">He lighted his pipe and then resumed: "Well, my
notion is he expected to find something in your room;
something that he thought worth more than money."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But I have nothing valuable," Agatha objected,
with a laugh. "Now I remember, I made him empty
his pockets and he left two half-dollars! It wasn't a
very big fine, and I can send the dollar to some
charity."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can't see an explanation, and we'll have to let it
go; but the man will find trouble waiting if he comes
back. Let me know right away if anybody gets after
you like that again."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha said she would do so, and hearing Mrs. Farnam's
step in the passage, they began to talk about
something else.</p>

<p class="dgp">A week later, Agatha went to visit George, and then
feeling braced by the holiday, resumed her duties in
Toronto. Soon afterwards, she sat in her room one
evening in a thoughtful mood. The house was on the
outskirts of the city and she heard cheerful voices and

the jingle of sleigh-bells on the road. The moon was
nearly full and riding parties were going out for a
drive across the glittering snow, while where the wind
had swept it clear ice yachts were, no doubt, skimming
about the lake. Agatha envied the happy people who
could enjoy such sports, and it had cost her something
to admit that they were not for her. A ticket for a
concert to which she had thought of going was stuck
in a picture frame, but she was not in the humor for
music, and putting down the book she held, leaned
back languidly in her chair.</p>

<p class="dgp">The room was small, plainly furnished, and shadowy,
for the lamp had a deep shade that confined the
light to a narrow circle. Three or four books lay upon
the table and a map of the North-West Territories
occupied the end in front of Agatha. It was not a
very good map and the natural features of the country
were sketchily indicated, for belts of the northern wilderness
had not been thoroughly surveyed, but she had
opened it for half an hour's relaxation. After that,
she must get to work.</p>

<p class="dgp">She was not very strong yet, but had undertaken
extra duties that necessitated private study. Now she
felt tired after lecturing a class of absent-minded girls,
and closing her eyes, abandoned herself to moody
thought. George's warning was bearing fruit. Agatha
was young, but knew one soon got jaded and youth
slipped away. There was a risk of her spending in
unrewarded efforts the years that ought to be happiest,
and then finding herself old and soured. Still, when
she came to think of it, she had recognized this and felt
a vague dissatisfaction with her lot before George had
talked to her. In fact, the dissatisfaction had begun

soon after she wandered through the bush and paddled
about the lake with Thirlwell.</p>

<p class="dgp">For all that, she was not going to give up the resolve
she had made long ago. She owed her father much,
and must carry out the task he had unconsciously left
her. She meant to search the country he had traveled
for the silver vein; and then, if she was persuaded it
could not be found, she would have paid her debt and
be free to lead the life that others led. In the meantime,
she was, so to speak, set apart, like a nun, from
common joys and sorrows by a vow that must be kept.
Perhaps this was an exaggeration, but it was partly
true.</p>

<p class="dgp">Banishing her thoughts, she put away the map and
opened her book, but soon afterwards a servant brought
in a card and stated that a man wished to see her. On
the card was printed <em>John Stormont</em> and the number
of a post-office box at Winnipeg.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know Mr. Stormont," Agatha remarked.
"But if he wants to see me, you may show him in."</p>

<p class="dgp">A few moments later a man entered the room. He
was young and neatly dressed, and smiled urbanely as
he bowed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Miss Strange, I suppose? If you are not much
occupied, I hope you can give me a few minutes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha, feeling curious, indicated a chair and studied
him when he sat down. His voice was rather
harsh, his glance was quick, and his alert manner implied
self-confidence. There was, however, nothing
else to be remarked about him, and she thought him a
common type of young business man.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I am not engaged just now," she replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thank you," said Stormont. "Perhaps I'd better

state that I'm pretty well known in Winnipeg,
where I do business in real estate and sometimes undertake
the development of mineral claims. I've recently
put over two or three big transactions in that
line."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But Manitoba is a farming country."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Certainly; the prairie belt. The eastern strip, running
along the edge of the Territories from Lake of
the Woods, is different. There the rocks break out
among the pine forests and in the last few years prospectors
have found valuable minerals. Some are being
worked, and I expect we will soon hear of fresh
discoveries. I understand you are the daughter of
Gordon Strange, who found a silver lode in North
Ontario."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I am his daughter; but I believe the lode was not
in Ontario."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then it was in the neighboring Territories. I expect
your father often talked to you about his find."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He did," said Agatha. "Still I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont smiled. "You wonder where I am leading
you? Well, it's part of my occupation to investigate
mining propositions, and where the owners want
to sell, to find a buyer. Sometimes I lend them money
to improve the claim. In fact, I imagine you would
find me useful in many ways."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I cannot sell the lode before I know where it is."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's obvious," Stormont agreed. "The difficulty,
however, might be overcome, and that's where I
could help. But, to begin with, am I to understand
your father altogether failed to relocate the claim?
Although he filed no record, he may have found a
clue."</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha gave him a keen glance. He had said nothing
to excite much suspicion, but she felt that he was
going too fast and asking too many questions.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I did not see him after he went back to the North.
I suppose you know he lost his life on his last journey?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont made a sympathetic gesture. "I heard
so. But, no doubt, he wrote to you and told you about
his prospecting."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha, with some reserve. "He sent
me letters."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I expect he told you where he went. It's
possible that a study of the letters would give an experienced
prospector a useful hint."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha pondered. She had, with the help of her
map, followed Strange's journeys, and his letters
showed where the silver was not to be found, which
eliminated large belts of country. Then if Stormont
knew much about mining and was accustomed to negotiate
the sale of claims, his curiosity implied that her
father's belief in the lode was well grounded. This
was encouraging, but the man was a stranger and she
felt a vague distrust.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The person who finds a vein of ore and files his
record is registered as its owner when he has complied
with the legal formalities," she said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"That is so," Stormont agreed with a smile. "You
feel that if you parted with the letters, you would run
some risk of losing the claim? Well, one must trust
one's agent to some extent, and I'll make you two
propositions. You can give me all the information
you have about the ore, and, if I think it worth while,
I will bear the cost of prospecting and development,

and give you a large share of the profits when the mine
is worked. Or I'll pay you a fixed sum for the letters
and any clues you can supply."</p>

<p class="dgp">"After you have read the letters?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Certainly. You can't expect me to make a plunge
of this kind in the dark. Anyhow, if you decide on
the first plan, you will be a partner and have some control.
It's plain that you will benefit by my experience."</p>

<p class="dgp">For a few moments Agatha was tempted to agree.
She needed help and could not begin the search for
some time, while a man who knew all about mining
could undertake it with a better chance of success.
Still she saw that much depended on the man's honesty,
and she had no grounds for trusting Stormont.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Can you give me two or three weeks?" she asked.
"I want to consult my friends."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The delay might upset my plans. For one thing,
it would be necessary to get as much work as possible
done before the thaw comes. Prospecting is difficult
in winter, but it's considerably easier traveling when
the rivers are frozen, and first of all we want to find
the spot. I daresay you could give me some landmarks
that would help us."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha hesitated. Strange had often described the
neighborhood where he had found the ore, and she
saw that what she knew about it might be important.
Stormont's explanation of his anxiety to begin the
search was plausible; but it was possible he wanted to
prevent her asking advice.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I must wait until I know what my friends think,"
she insisted.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Although the loss of time may spoil our chance
of locating the ore?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha firmly. "I must run the
risk."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont got up. "Very well! I don't know if
we'll be able to do anything when you make your decision,
but you can write to me. In the meantime, I
think you ought to promise that you won't negotiate
with anybody else."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I will promise this," said Agatha and knitted her
brows when he went out.</p>

<p class="dgp">She was half afraid she had been too prudent and
let a good offer go by; but although it might bring her
trouble and disappointment, she would sooner look for
the ore herself. She had sometimes shrunk from the
task, but after all it was her duty. Then she could not
ask George for advice. He had never believed in the
lode and would, no doubt, tell her she was lucky to get
an offer, and had better make the best bargain she
could. Farnam knew nothing about mining; he was
absorbed in his orchard, and Mabel now and then declared
that his judgment was only worth trusting about
fruit trees.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha paused and admitted that she had from the
beginning meant to ask Thirlwell. She could trust
him; he was honest, but this was not all. When he
talked about important things he had a quiet, decided
manner that she liked. He would not be daunted by
obstacles, and if her resolution wavered, he would not
let her shirk. She did not think him clever, but he
would somehow carry out what he undertook. It was
curious that after a fortnight of his society she knew

him so well; but she did know he was trustworthy and
there was nothing more to be said.</p>

<p class="dgp">Since a letter might not reach him for some time,
she had better write at once, and she got some paper
and began. It was easy to write to Thirlwell, and she
told him about the lame man who had broken into the
house, before she came to Stormont's offer. Indeed,
when she stopped she was surprised to see how much
she had said. After fastening the envelope she got
up and went to the window, where she drew the thick
curtain behind her and looked out.</p>

<p class="dgp">The moon was higher up the sky and the roofs glittered
in the silver light. Half the street lay in shadow,
a belt of grayish blue, but the rest sparkled where the
sleigh-shoes had run. A sleigh came up with a load of
girls and young men in blanket-coats and furs. They
seemed to be talking and laughing, but Agatha no
longer envied them; the depression she had felt had
gone. Then as the sleigh went past with a chime of
bells she tried to follow her letter on its journey to
the North.</p>

<p class="dgp">After it left the railroad it would lie in a pack on a
half-breed's shoulders, or perhaps in a skin bag on a
hand-sledge, in front of which men with snowshoes
marched. It would travel up winding rivers between
dark walls of ragged pines, across frozen lakes, and
among the rocks on high divides. Then the tired men
would stop at a cluster of shacks beside a shaft and an
ore-dump in the wilds, and she wondered what Thirlwell
would think when he opened the envelope; whether
he would be pleased or not.</p>

<p class="dgp">But this was indulging idle sentiment that she had

meant to avoid, and she went back to the table and
opened her books. Thirlwell's answer would not arrive
for some weeks, and if she went north, summer
would come before she could start. In the meantime,
she had her pupils to teach. The subject for the next
morning's lesson was difficult and needed careful study.</p>

<hr class="page">

<div class="div">
<a name="toc_11"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter X&mdash;Thirlwell Gets A Letter</h3>

<p class="noindent">A dreary wind wailed about the shack, and
now and then the iron roof cracked as it shrank
and wrenched its fastenings in the bitter cold. The
room was not warm, although the front of the stove
glowed a bright red, and after supper Thirlwell pulled
his chair between it and the wall. He had been out for
some hours with snowshoe and rifle, but had seen nothing
to shoot. The white desolation was empty of
life, and silent except for the wind among the pine-tops.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'd meant to look into the Snake Creek muskegs,
but the cold drove me back," he said. "In summer
one's bitten by sand-flies and mosquitoes; in winter
one runs some risk of freezing to death. I wonder
now and then whether mining's worth the hardship
and why we stop here."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Unprofitable mining isn't logically worth much
hardship," Scott remarked. "But don't you mean you
wonder why you came back?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Thirlwell, with a touch of embarrassment;
"that was pretty obvious. I was offered a good
post in England, but it meant I'd be dependent on a
man I don't like. A rough life with liberty is better
than luxurious servitude."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The latter has some advantages," Scott rejoined.
"To-night, for example, you could enjoy a good dinner

instead of moldy beans and rancid pork, put on
clean clothes, and go to a concert or theater. Then
you'd get up next morning in a warm room, with a bath
and hot water at hand, instead of freezing by a stove
that had burned low. Anyhow, admitting that you're
obstinate and hate to go where others want, I've a notion
that you felt you had to see me out when you refused
that post."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, well," said Thirlwell awkwardly. "In a
sense, I was bound&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"By your scruples? But we'll let it go," Scott rejoined.
"I expect we're all to some extent the slaves
of an idea. I'd pull out to-morrow if I didn't feel I
had to make my mining venture good before I quit.
All the same, it looks as if I'd save my money by
stopping now."</p>

<p class="dgp">He looked up, for there was a knock at the door
and a man who had gone down to the settlements came
in. His skin cap was pulled down to meet the collar
of his coat, leaving only his eyes and nose exposed,
and fine frost-dried snow stuck to the shaggy furs.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's surely fierce to-night," he said. "Thought
we couldn't make it when we met the wind on Loon
Lake, but there was no shelter on the beach and our
tea had run out. I brought a letter for Mr. Thirlwell
along."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Nothing else?" Scott asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">The man said there was nothing, and when he went
away Scott smiled.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, that's a relief! I had expected a reminder
that we hadn't paid our last bill for tools. But I guess
you want to read your letter."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell felt a thrill of satisfaction as he recognized

the hand, for it was some time since Agatha had
written to him. He got thoughtful as he read the
letter, and when he had finished put it down and lighted
his pipe.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'd like you to listen to this and tell me what you
think," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott make a sign of agreement, and when Thirlwell
had read Agatha's account of her meeting with the
burglar and Stormont, he remarked: "It's a nice frank
letter, and Miss Strange has some talent for dramatic
narrative."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's not what I meant," said Thirlwell, with an
impatient frown. "What d'you think about Stormont's
visit?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"On the whole, I imagine Miss Strange ran less
risk of being robbed when she met the burglar."</p>

<p class="dgp">"So I think. But why did the fellow go?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott looked thoughtful. "Though Stormont's said
to be a rogue, he's certainly not a fool. You seem to
take it for granted that Strange never found the lode,
but I'm not sure. Anyhow, it looks as if Stormont
didn't agree with you."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But how did he hear about the lode?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's not very plain, but I have a suspicion. There's
a curious thing; I don't see much difference between
Stormont's object and the burglar's. Both seemed to
want the letters Strange wrote to the girl."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Now I come to think of it, perhaps there wasn't
much difference. The fellow stole nothing, although
he broke open the writing-table and Miss Strange's
trunk. She says he disturbed nothing else. But the
matter gets no clearer."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott smiled. "My explanation is that Stormont

tried to buy the letters after he found they couldn't
be stolen."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But he'd have to trust the man he hired to break
into the house; and this would put him in the fellow's
power."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I reckon the man told him about the lode; Miss
Strange states that he was lame," Scott remarked in
a meaning tone. "Where has Black Steve been since
he left this neighborhood?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell started. "It's possible you have got near
the truth. Nobody knows as much as Driscoll about
Strange's prospecting. But I must answer the letter.
What am I to say?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you tell her to have nothing to do with Stormont,
it ought to be enough in the meantime," Scott
replied. "You could send down your answer when,
the next Hudson's Bay breeds come along."</p>

<p class="dgp">They were silent for a few minutes, and then Scott
resumed: "I understand Miss Strange means to look
for the vein next summer and you are going. Why is
that, since you don't believe her father's tale?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"She's resolved to go and I can help. When she's
persuaded the ore can't be found she'll be content to
give the notion up. I don't want the thing to occupy
her thoughts until it becomes a kind of mania, as it
did with Strange."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I imagine she's an attractive girl."</p>

<p class="dgp">"She is attractive; but that has nothing to do with
it," Thirlwell replied with a frown. "I'm not in love
with Miss Strange. To begin with, I can't support a
wife, and marriage hasn't much charm for me. Then
I think she's clever enough to make her mark, and
will stick to her occupation until she does, if she gets

rid of this foolish notion of looking for the ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I see," said Scott, with some dryness. "You feel
sorry for the girl and want to save her from getting
like Strange? Well, it's a chivalrous object; but
there's a thing you don't seem to have thought of yet.
Prospecting a big belt of country is a long job, and if
you're away much of the summer, how are you going
to keep your engagement with me?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have thought of it," Thirlwell replied. "It's
awkward&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott smiled at his embarrassment. "Well, I'll let
you go. In fact, I don't mind taking a stake in the
expedition, in the way of food and tools."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Miss Strange wouldn't agree."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well. Suppose you locate the ore, she'll
need advice and further help. Now I know something
about mining; I've paid pretty high for what
I've learned. I understand Miss Strange hasn't much
money, and we might save her some expensive mistakes.
You see, I haven't much hope of getting down
to pay-dirt here."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell pondered. He liked and trusted Scott,
and the thought of being able to offer Agatha the help
she might need was attractive; but he meant to be honest
and exercised some self-control.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It would pay you better to leave the thing alone.
I feel pretty sure the ore's a freak of Strange's imagination."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's possible," Scott agreed. "Go and see."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell knocked out and filled his pipe; and then
remarked with some diffidence: "You stated that you
didn't think you had enough capital to keep the Clermont
going long."</p>


<p class="dgp">"I haven't enough," Scott said, smiling. "But I
have some rich relations who might finance me if I
could show them a sure snap. I'd like to do so, anyhow,
because, after spending most all my money, I
feel I've got to make good."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can understand this. Why did you come up
here in the beginning?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's rather a long story and I reckon it starts with
a canoe trip I made in the North one fall. I had then
begun a business in which family influence could give
me a lift. Well, it was Indian summer; mosquitoes
dying off, lakes and rivers all asleep in the pale sunshine.
As we paddled and portaged through the
woods I felt I'd got into another world. Wanted to
stop forever and began to hate the cities; the feeling
wasn't new, but I hadn't got it really strong till then.
Sometimes at night, when the loons were calling on the
lake and my packers were asleep, I'd lie by the fire and
speculate what civilization was worth and if a man
might not do better to cut loose and live by his gun
and traps. Well, of course, it was a crank notion, and
I wasn't all a fool. I stopped longer than I meant, but
I pulled out and got to work again."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott paused and smoked meditatively before he
resumed: "It was of no use; the city palled. Don't
know that I'm a cynic or much of a philosopher, but
the folks I knew seemed to have a wrong idea of values.
Spent their best efforts grubbing for money and
trying to take the lead in smart society. They made
me tired with their hustling about things that didn't
matter; I wanted the woods and the quiet the river
hardly breaks."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You went back?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"I did," said Scott. "Felt I had to go. It was
winter and the cold was fierce, but we made four hundred
miles with the hand-sledge across the snow, and
when I came out with some fingers frozen I was nine
pounds heavier. Used to sit in my office afterwards
and dream about the glittering lakes and the stiff white
pines; saw them crowding round the lonely camps,
when I ought to have been studying the market reports.
Well, I couldn't concentrate on buying and selling
things. Betting on the market and getting after other
people's money seemed a pretty mean business." He
paused and added with a twinkle: "That's how I felt
then, and I don't know that I've changed my opinions
much."</p>

<p class="dgp">"All the same, you're anxious to make your mining
pay."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It isn't logical, but I was born a white man and
had got civilized. You can't altogether get rid of
what you're taught when young, and it's harder when
the notions you inherit are backed by your training.
Well, I saw there was a danger of my turning out a
hobo if I went back North without a job. I must get
some work, and when Brinsmead came with a proposition
about the Clermont vein I took down my shingle
and located here with him."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But what about your relations? Did they object?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not much. On the whole, I reckon they were
satisfied to see me go. They had long decided I was a
crank, and since I was bound to do something foolish,
I'd better do it where I wouldn't disgrace them.
That's about all. We're here, and I don't know that
I'd go back if the road was open. Would you?"</p>


<p class="dgp">Thirlwell pondered. It was a hard life he led,
working, for the most part, in the dark underground,
for when money was scarce and wages high he could
not be satisfied to superintend. Scott, indeed, worked
like a paid hand, and they had fought a long, and it
seemed a losing, battle against forces whose strength
science cannot yet properly measure. The fish-oil
lamps sometimes went out in poisonous air while they
examined an unsafe working face; props broke under
a load they ought to have borne; and now and then
the roof came down. Rock pillars crushed, massive
stones fell out where one least expected, and there was
always the icy water that the pump could not keep
under and the frost could not stop.</p>

<p class="dgp">Yet there was something that thrilled one in the
stubborn fight, and a strange ascetic satisfaction in
proving how much flesh and blood could stand. One
felt stronger for bracing one's tired body against fresh
fatigue, and watchfulness in the face of constant danger
toned up the brain. Then, after all, the vast,
silent wilderness had a seductive charm.</p>

<p class="dgp">"This country draws, and holds what it gets," he
said. "I'm satisfied to stop here, as long as I'm
young."</p>

<p class="dgp">For a time they smoked in silence, and presently
went to bed, tired with exhausting labor and glad to
rest in dreamless sleep until they began again in the
bitter dawn.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XI&mdash;Stormont Finds A Clue</h3>


<p class="noindent">The Dufferin House was the best hotel in the
small Ontario town, and about ten o'clock one
evening Stormont read a newspaper in his comfortable
room. His clerk had been some days in the town,
looking into a proposed transaction in real estate, and
Stormont left Winnipeg when a letter from him arrived.
This was not because the business required
his supervision, but because Watson, the clerk, had
found out something that might prove to be important,
although it might lead to his employer's wasting his
time. Stormont seldom let what he called a fighting
change go by.</p>

<p class="dgp">He had eaten a good supper at about six o'clock,
and after a talk with Watson and a young man whose
acquaintance the clerk had made, had sent them off to
see the town at his expense. This was not rash, because
Stormont could trust his clerk. Now he waited
their return, but it was not for Watson's benefit he
had put a cigar-box and a bottle of strong liquor on
the table. Much depended on Watson's tact and judgment,
and Stormont felt relieved when he came in.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I've got Drummond downstairs," the clerk said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very good," said Stormont. "Had you much
trouble?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I certainly had some. He wanted me to hire a

sleigh and take a girl at a sweet-stuff store for a joy-ride.
Suggested it when she was there, and I think
she meant to go. Then he broke a lamp in the pool-room
that cost us two dollars."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, I hope you haven't overdone the thing."</p>

<p class="dgp">"On the whole, I guess not," Watson replied.
"It's hard to hit the proper mark, but I reckon he's
just drunk enough."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then bring him up," said Stormont, and in a few
minutes Watson came back with a young man.</p>

<p class="dgp">The latter's skin was somewhat dark, and his coarse
black hair and athletic figure hinted at a strain of Indian
blood. As a matter of fact, his mother was a
French-Canadian <em>Metis</em>, and he was born in a skin
tent in the North. His clothes were cut in the latest
fashion, and he looked self-confident; but he moved
unsteadily and his face was flushed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Had a gay time, Mr. Drummond?" Stormont
asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You bet!" said the other, giving the clerk a patronizing
smile. "This young fellow is surely a sport.
Promised half the girls up-town he'd take them a
sleigh-ride and broke a big lamp in the pool-room."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You broke the lamp," Watson interrupted, with a
glance at his employer.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, well," said Drummond, "perhaps I did. I
certainly put the marker out. He allowed I couldn't
hold my cue and was going to cut the cloth. Why, I'd
play any man in this old town for fifty dollars!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"And beat him!" said Stormont. "Watson told
me how you play. But won't you sit down and take
a smoke."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I surely will," Drummond replied, and pulling up

an easy chair, put his wet snow-boots on Stormont's
bed, after which he lighted a cigar. "Now," he resumed,
"if you have anything to say to me, you can
go ahead."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You're a store clerk, I think. It's a poor job
making a profit for another man and Watson tells me
you are enterprising. How'd you like to run a store
of your own? If you could put up the stock to start
with, I reckon you'd soon make good."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I've figured on that," Drummond replied, with a
cunning look, though Stormont saw he was flattered.
"You want some money to begin, but I've a notion
how I'm going to raise my pile."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont nodded. He had appealed to the young
man's raw vanity, but meant to work upon another
emotion. "Watson tells me you came from Hamilton.
Nice town and business was pretty good when
I was there." He paused and asked sharply: "Why
did you quit?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond hesitated and got confused. "Nothing
much doing in my line; didn't see many chances, and
Hamilton made me tired."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, well," said Stormont, who had given the other
a hint that he knew something about his past history.
"I reckon you didn't leave your employer your new
address! Anyhow, store-clerking's a tame job, and
you're a sport. You want to get out and give yourself
a chance. Wasn't Hector Drummond, Hudson's Bay
agent at the old Longue Sault factory, your father?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"He was. Don't know how you know, but you've
got it right."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont smiled. The young man had told Watson

much about himself one night when he was drunk.
"I don't think it matters. You'd like to get rich and
hinted that you knew how to make your pile."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I know where there's a silver lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" said Stormont, "that's interesting! But
it's an expensive business to prove and develop a mineral
claim, and you couldn't do much alone. I expect
you know this, since you stop here clerking for a few
dollars a week. You want help."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The man who looks for that ore will want my
help," Drummond rejoined.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, it's my business to speculate in mines, and
I'm generally willing to pay for a useful tip. But
it's got to be useful. I don't like to be stung, and the
woods are full of dead-beat prospectors ready to put
you wise about rich pay-dirt for a dollar or two."</p>

<p class="dgp">"My tip's all right," Drummond declared in a defiant
tone. "I'll show you! When the old man was
at Longue Sault he had a clerk called Strange, and
sent him off somewhere one day with a sledge and
dogs. Strange came back with a bagful of mineral
specimens, and said he'd struck it rich, but the old man
knew nothing about mining and didn't want any prospectors
mussing up things round there. By and by
Strange left the factory, and the old man pulled out
and brought me South. Located at Owen Sound, and
told me about Strange's specimens one day when he
was very sick. Said he'd reckoned the fellow was a
crank, but he'd kept two or three specimens and a mining
man told him they carried good silver."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Did Strange tell your father where he found the
specimens?" Stormont asked carelessly.</p>


<p class="dgp">Drummond grinned. "Since the old man sent him,
I guess he knew where he went. But I've got to
know what my tip is worth before I tell you."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Certainly," said Stormont. "Suppose we take
a drink?" He filled a glass and gave it Drummond,
but was silent for some minutes afterwards.</p>

<p class="dgp">The young man was not as drunk as he thought,
and had obviously some caution left. The heady liquor,
however, might make a difference.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," he resumed, when Drummond put down
his glass, "you're ambitious and enterprising. I expect
you'd like to own a share in a paying mine?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You bet I would; I'm surely going to!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you had better let me help. It will cost you
something to locate the vein, and you won't find people
ready to believe your tale and put up the money,"
Stormont replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">He saw by Drummond's look that he had tried to
sell his secret; but the lad answered: "Cut it out!
What's your offer?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Fifty dollars now, and five hundred when we find
the lode, if it's worth working. Then a share that
will depend on the cost of development and the
profit."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Shucks!" said Drummond. "I want five hundred
dollars before I start."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you had better try somebody else," said
Stormont, smiling. "It's possible that all you can tell
me isn't worth five dollars."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'll show you! Gimme a hundred now and 'nother
drink."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Take fifty, or I quit," said Stormont, who passed
him the bottle.</p>


<p class="dgp">Drummond drained his glass. "You're mean, but
I gotter make a start. Where's the bills?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont gave him some paper money, and then
turned to the clerk. "See about mailing the letters,
Watson."</p>

<p class="dgp">The clerk went out, knowing why he had been sent.
His employer trusted him where he was forced, but did
not want him to hear what Drummond had to say.</p>

<p class="dgp">When Watson had gone Drummond knitted his
brows, as if trying to remember something. "The
vein runs out on the face of a cliff, 'bout forty paces
from the first rampike pine; there's three or four rampikes,
but the fire hadn't gone far into the bush."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not much of a clue! There are patches of burned
forest all over the country," Stormont remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Don't interrupt!" said Drummond, with a frown.
"It's pretty hard to remember. Give me 'nother
drink. I wanter get it right."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont filled his glass and he resumed in an unsteady
voice: "Cliff rises from the creek in a little
round hollow. There's a big rock near the top of the
divide opposite&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Go on. How does the creek run?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You're hustling me," Drummond grumbled. "I
wanter think. It's important. Knowing how the
creek runs fixes where she is." He paused, and a
vague distrust of Stormont entered his bemused brain.
He had got the fifty dollars and saw, with drunken
cunning, that it might be prudent to keep something
back. "She runs south."</p>

<p class="dgp">"South?" exclaimed Stormont, who knew that the
natural drainage of the region is north-east to James
Bay.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Sure," said Drummond, with a sullen look.
"Strange told the old man, and the old man told me."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont pondered. If the creek flowed south, it
drained a subsidiary basin and probably filled a lake
from which a river ran north or east. The clue was
worth fifty dollars because it would simplify the search
for the lode.</p>

<p class="dgp">"How does the creek lie from the factory?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"'Bout south-west," said Drummond in a thick,
drowsy voice. "There isn't a factory at Longue Sault
now. Company moved the post after the old man
left."</p>

<p class="dgp">"How far is the creek from where the post was?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Lemme think," Drummond muttered, and his eyes
half closed. "Old man reckoned Strange made it in
a fortnight's march."</p>

<p class="dgp">"From the creek, or from the place where he was
sent? Or do you mean the double journey?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Don't know," Drummond answered dully. "Old
man said fortnight. Told you all I remember."</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he slipped down in the big chair, his head
drooped forward, and he fell into a drunken sleep.
Stormont got up and leaned against the table. He
had borne some strain in the last few minutes, because
it had been obvious that Drummond was overcome by
liquor and would soon be unable to talk, while when
he woke up sober he might repent his rashness. Now
Stormont imagined he had told him all he knew, and
it ought to be worth fifty dollars. Lighting a cigar,
he waited until his clerk came back, when he indicated
Drummond, who lay, snoring heavily, with his dirty
boots on Stormont's bed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Wake the drunken fool and see him home."</p>


<p class="dgp">Watson had some trouble to get Drummond on his
feet and after Stormont shut the door there was a
heavy thud. It looked as if Drummond had fallen
down the stairs, but Stormont smiled. He had done
with the fellow, and if Watson could get him out of the
hotel, it did not matter if he reached home or not.
Ringing for the bell-boy, he gave orders about being
called in the morning, as he meant to leave by an early
west-bound train.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XII&mdash;On The Trail</h3>


<p class="noindent">Thirlwell had been to the railroad settlement,
and returning with Father Lucien,
camped on the trail not far from the mine. The day
had been unusually warm and at noon the pines
dripped in the sun and the snow got damp. At dusk
it began to freeze and a haze hung about the woods
and obscured the moon, but, by contrast with the rigors
of winter, Thirlwell sitting by the camp-fire, felt almost
uncomfortably warm. Father Lucien had taken off
his furs and sat with a blanket over his shoulders on a
bundle of dry twigs. Both had hung their moccasins
up to dry near the heap of snapping branches.
Wreaths of aromatic smoke slowly drifted past and
faded in the mist.</p>

<p class="dgp">"One feels spring coming," said Father Lucien.
"We have had a foretaste to cheer us while winter
lasts. The sun is moving north, and up here, it always
thrills me to watch the light drive back the dark. One
could make a homily on that."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The dark soon returns," Thirlwell remarked, "I
hate the long nights."</p>

<p class="dgp">"There are men who like the dark, in spite of the
terrors it has for some."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder whether you are thinking of a particular
example," Thirlwell suggested, remembering a

night watch he had kept while the blizzard raged about
Driscoll's shack.</p>

<p class="dgp">"One does think of examples. Perhaps we generalize
too much. It is easy to let an individual stand
for a type."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If the individual is Black Steve Driscoll, I hope
he's an uncommon type."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien made a sign of agreement. "Driscoll
was in my thoughts. A strange man; dogged and
sullen, with a heart that kindness cannot touch. Yet
one feels he is afraid."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He was afraid when he was ill; I wonder why.
The fellow has no religious or moral code. But he
drinks hard and perhaps he's superstitious."</p>

<p class="dgp">"What is superstition?" the missionary asked with
a smile. "The old atavistic fear of the dark and the
mysterious dangers that threatened our savage ancestors?
Or is it an instinctive knowledge that there
are supernatural powers, able to punish and reward?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know," said Thirlwell, who mused and
watched the smoke drift past.</p>

<p class="dgp">The bush was very quiet; he could hear nothing but
the crackle of the fire. Now and then a blaze leaped
up and pierced the shadows among the pine trunks. A
few yards away, the trees got blurred and melted into
the encircling gloom. In one place, however, there
was an opening, and when he turned his back to the
light, he saw a faint glimmer in the mist that indicated
the frozen lake. Although he was used to the wilds, he
felt the silence and desolation.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's easy to be superstitious here," he resumed.
"One feels that human power is limited and loses one's
confidence. I expect something of the kind accounts

for Driscoll's nervous fears. In the city, he would
have no time to brood; he'd spend his days in a noisy
workshop and his evenings in a crowded tenement or
saloon. But if he's scared of the dark and loneliness,
why doesn't he pull out?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Human nature's stubborn. A man with a compelling
object may be afraid and fight his fears."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'd like to know what Driscoll's object is. Since
the night in his shack, when the fellow was sick, I've
wondered why Strange's canoe capsized. Strange
was a clever <em>voyageur</em>; so's Black Steve."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien looked at him curiously and there
was a hint of shrinking in his eyes. "I cannot tell;
perhaps we shall never know! But if there was foul
play, what would Driscoll gain?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's hard to see," Thirlwell agreed. "I could understand
it if Steve had afterwards staked a claim, but
nobody has found the ore yet. There's another curious
thing; I don't see what he'd gain by leaving you
to starve, as I think he meant to do."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Father Lucien sharply, "that is impossible!
Besides, Driscoll was trapping some distance
off."</p>

<p class="dgp">"A white man stood looking down at you and then
stole away, although he saw you had no camp outfit,"
Thirlwell insisted.</p>

<p class="dgp">"He may have been short of food and came to borrow.
Seeing I had none, he was perhaps afraid to
share any he had left with me."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell shook his head. "I haven't met a prospector
who would let a white man starve; they're a
rough but generous lot. In fact, the only man I know
who's capable of the thing is Driscoll."</p>


<p class="dgp">Father Lucien did not answer and presently lay
down, but Thirlwell sat for a time, thinking while he
dried his moccasins. The missionary was something
of an idealist, although he knew the weaknesses of
human nature, but Thirlwell was practical. Somehow
he had got entangled in the complications that sprang
from Strange's supposititious discovery of the ore, but
he did not want to break loose. Agatha Strange
needed him; she had admitted that there was nobody
else to whom she could look for help and advice. So
far, he could find no clue to the web of mystery that
surrounded the matter and had caught them both, but
he meant to search.</p>

<p class="dgp">When the moccasins were dry, he began to wonder
why he was anxious to help the girl, since he was not
in love with her. In a sense, it was perhaps his duty,
but this did not account for his keenness. He gave it
up, and after throwing some branches on the fire lay
down and went to sleep.</p>

<p class="dgp">The fire was low and gave out no light when he
wakened. He felt cold and remembered with some annoyance
that he had not gathered enough wood to last
until morning. He had not brought his watch, partly
because he had fastened a small compass on the chain,
but he knew that day would not break for some hours
yet. The mist was thinner, although it had not gone,
and looking up he guessed the moon's height by the
elusive glimmer in the haze. It was about four o'clock,
and he imagined he had wakened when the heat of his
body had sunk to its lowest; but was not altogether
satisfied, since he had slept undisturbed by much keener
frost.</p>

<p class="dgp">For all that, it was a nuisance to get up and look for

dead branches in the dark, and he waited, reluctant to
throw off his blanket, for some minutes, and then
roused himself with a jerk. He imagined he heard
voices out on the lake. He glanced at Father Lucien,
but the latter was fast asleep. Thirlwell wondered
whether he himself had gone to sleep again and
dreamed, but half-consciously fixed his eyes on the
opening that commanded a view of the lake. He could
see it indistinctly; a smooth white plain running back
into the dark. The snow caught a faint reflection although
the moon was hidden, but nothing broke the
even surface.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then Thirlwell got up abruptly, for he heard a
shout. It sounded as if somebody had given an order,
and he felt disturbed. There was, he knew, no
ground for this. The few white trappers and prospectors
who now and then entered the wilds were, for
the most part, good-humored, sociable men; the <em>Metis</em>
and Indians were friendly. Indeed, the proper line
was for him to invite the strangers to share his camp,
but he hesitated. He had got suspicious since he
promised to help in the search for Strange's silver, and
trappers and Indians did not travel at night.</p>

<p class="dgp">As he pondered the matter, a dark object came out
of the misty background on the lake. It was indistinct,
but by its height and slow movements he knew it
was a man. It vanished presently where the pines
cut off his view, but three others followed after an
interval, two apparently hauling a loaded sledge.
They crossed the stretch of ice that Thirlwell could
see, and when the trees shut them out he forgot to
gather wood and lighted his pipe.</p>


<p class="dgp">The hazy figures had an unsubstantial, ghostly look;
he might have imagined he had not really seen them
had he not heard the leader's shout. Then it was hard
to see why they were traveling in the dark, since they
must leave the ice soon and the trail was rough. He
thought their leader knew the country, because their
coming down the lake indicated that they had taken a
short but difficult line from the settlements. But one
would expect a man who knew the country to make for
and stop at the mine, which was not far off. Thirlwell
hoped to reach it next day, and wondered whether
the others meant to pass it at night. If so, it would
indicate that they did not want to be seen.</p>

<p class="dgp">When he had smoked out his pipe he gathered some
wood, and then, as Father Lucien had not wakened,
thought he would look for the others' trail and see
which way they had gone. They were traveling north,
but two routes the Indians used started from the head
of the lake. He found the marks of the sledge-runners,
and then noted with a thrill of excitement that
there was something curious about one of the men's
tracks. The steps were uneven; one impression was
sharper than the other.</p>

<p class="dgp">Imagining that the party would camp soon, Thirlwell
determined to follow and presently came to a
rough slope where the trail left the ice. Caution was
now needed, because he could not see far and might be
heard if he made much noise in pushing through the
bush. The silence that brooded over the woods indicated
that the others had stopped. The pines were
small and tangled, but he could see where the sledge
had gone and when he reached the summit a gleam of

light sprang up in the valley below. Thirlwell thought
the man who made the fire had chosen the spot well if
he meant its light to be hidden.</p>

<p class="dgp">The wood was thin on the slope he went down and
it was difficult to keep in the gloom. The glimmering
moonlight was brighter and his figure would be visible
against the snow as he crossed the openings.
When he was some distance from the fire he stopped
and studied his line of approach.</p>

<p class="dgp">The men were moving about on his side of the fire.
Their figures were distinct, but he could not see their
faces, and if he crossed the belt of rather open ground,
the light would fall on him. If he could creep up on
the other side, the fire would be between them and,
shining in the men's faces, prevent their seeing far.
The trouble was, that the wood behind the camp looked
tangled and thick, and he doubted if he could get
through without making a noise. Something, however,
must be risked, and stealing across the opening to
the next tree, he presently reached a belt of thicker
wood.</p>

<p class="dgp">He could not be seen now, but he made a circuit
round the fire before he began to approach it from the
other side. His progress was slow and he felt anxious,
because it was possible that the men had moved
round the fire while he struggled through the bush.
Still he thought they had not done so, because he had
seen one throwing up a snow-bank behind which they
meant to sleep. They would probably cook their meal
and sit down on that side in the shelter of the bank.
When he left the thick bush he saw that his reasoning
was good, but he had yet to get near enough and the

fire was burning well. There was not much wind, but
the red blaze leaped up and sank, throwing out clouds
of sparks, while a trail of smoke drifted about the
camp. The resinous wood, however, crackled fiercely
and he hoped this would drown the noise he made.</p>

<p class="dgp">There was nothing to hide him for some distance,
and then a patch of juniper scrub and some willows
ran towards the camp. If he could reach them he
would be safe, and he crawled across the open space
and lay behind the first juniper while he got his breath.
There was nothing to indicate that the others had
heard him, and a few minutes later he stopped again
at the edge of a gap where a fire had run through the
scrub. He could see the men, though he could not
distinguish their faces. One seemed to be looking in
his direction, and Thirlwell felt his heart beat but did
not move. He had a background of dark bushes and
it was wiser to keep still than drop into the snow.</p>

<p class="dgp">Presently the man stooped, as if to pick up something,
and Thirlwell, stealing forward, sank down
among the willows. They rustled as he crept between
their stems, but the fire was snapping furiously and
after he had gone a few yards he thought he was near
enough. Rising nearly upright, he pushed the dry
branches aside. Since they broke his outline, it would
be hard to see him by the unsteady light.</p>

<p class="dgp">The flames tossed and wavered, throwing a fierce
red glow about the camp. Pine-trunks and snow-bank
stood out sharply from the shadow, and faded again.
The light played on the men's faces for a few moments
and then left them blurred and dim. Thirlwell waited
until one threw on some branches and a blaze and cloud

of sparks sprang up. The glare touched the fellow's
face and Thirlwell thrilled with excitement as he saw
it was Driscoll.</p>

<p class="dgp">He did not know the others, but one had a rather
pale color, as if he had come from the cities, and his
fur-coat looked new and good. The sledge carried
an unusually heavy load, and among the provision bags
he noted some iron drills and a small wooden box such
as giant-powder is packed in. It was a prospecting
party and he had seen enough.</p>

<p class="dgp">Creeping back into the scrub, he set off for camp.
When he got there Father Lucien was asleep, and
when they resumed the march next morning Thirlwell
told him nothing about the other party. He thought
the missionary had difficulties enough of his own
without being involved in the trouble that seemed to
follow all who had anything to do with Strange's silver
lode.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XIII&mdash;The Prospectors' Return</h3>

<p class="noindent">It was snowing, but there was no wind and the
shack was warm when, on the evening after his
return, Thirlwell sat, smoking, by the stove. Now
and then a mass of snow rumbled down the iron roof
near the spot where the hot pipe went through, and the
draughts had lost their former sting. The air in the
room felt different; it was not humid yet, but one no
longer noticed the harsh dryness that is caused by intense
frost. The long arctic winter was coming to
an end.</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by Scott, sitting opposite Thirlwell, said
thoughtfully, "Driscoll's outfit will have to hustle, if
they mean to do much prospecting and get back while
the ice is good. I'll give them a month, and if they're
not out then, they'll have trouble."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made a sign of agreement. Rivers and
lakes are numerous in the North, and in winter one
can travel smoothly on the ice. When the latter rots
and cracks, <em>voyageurs</em> and prospectors wait until the
melting snow sweeps the grinding floes away and canoes
can be launched. To push through tangled bush
and across soft muskegs costs heavy labor.</p>

<p class="dgp">"They were taking up a big load and couldn't march
fast," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I understand you don't know Stormont?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"I know his character&mdash;and unless he's badly
slandered that's enough! I haven't met him, but
I'm nearly sure it was a city man I saw in Driscoll's
camp."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Stormont's indicated," Scott replied. "I reckon
Driscoll went to him because he needed capital; but he
wouldn't put another fellow on the track. If we take
it for granted that he did go, the mystery about
Strange's letters is cleared up. It's characteristic that
Stormont tried to steal them before he made Miss
Strange his offer."</p>

<p class="dgp">"In a way, it's curious that he did make an offer!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott smiled. "He didn't run much risk. It would
be hard to frame an agreement out of which Stormont
couldn't wriggle; I've met the fellow, and Brinsmead
has grounds for knowing his methods. Anyhow, it's
plain that he thinks it worth while to spend some
money in trying to find the lode, and on such matters
his judgment is said to be pretty good. Then I imagine
Black Steve knows more about Strange's prospecting
trips than you suspect."</p>

<p class="dgp">"My notion is, that nobody knows much about the
lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Scott, "it looks like that. Strange is
dead, and I don't imagine he took Black Steve very far
into his confidence; though he may have given him a
hint when he was drunk. But there's another man,
whom nobody seems to have thought of yet."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Who's that?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The Hudson's Bay agent at the factory where
Strange was employed. Strange was young then, and
was probably frank and enthusiastic about his find.
I daresay he gave the agent all the particulars he could

recollect when he saw the fellow doubted his tale. His
memory was, no doubt, pretty good, since he'd seen the
lode a week or two before."</p>

<p class="dgp">"They have pulled down the factory and I expect
the agent's dead," Thirlwell replied. "If not, he must
be an old man and I don't know where he is. I'm not
persuaded yet that Strange did find the ore; but if it
hadn't snowed, I'd have followed Stormont's trail.
It would be interesting to know where he means to
look."</p>

<p class="dgp">He frowned as he lighted his pipe, because it was
too late to satisfy his curiosity. The prospectors had
vanished into the trackless desolation, and now deep
snow had fallen the wilds would hide them well. Scott
pondered for a few minutes and then resumed: "You
mean to help Miss Strange put this matter over, although
you don't believe in the lode?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Thirlwell, "I've promised her."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you're up against two hard men who have
got a start, and one of them is dangerous."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Black Steve? Well, I believe he meant to leave
Father Lucien to starve, but I don't see why."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You need help yourself," Scott rejoined dryly.
"When Driscoll was ill and delirious he talked in a
curious way, and when he got better may have had
some recollection of being badly scared. If so, I expect
he imagined he said more than he did and had, so
to speak, given himself away. As a matter of fact,
he said enough to be suspicious. Since he was delirious,
he probably didn't know you were there, and it
might be prudent not to let him know. It's possible
he thought Father Lucien knew too much, and saw his
opportunity of getting rid of him."</p>


<p class="dgp">Thirlwell started. "It is possible! I'm glad I told
you about my watch at the shack. I didn't at first;
the things I suspected looked ridiculous."</p>

<p class="dgp">"In future you had better tell me all you can. My
opinion is, that you have undertaken a very tough job.
For all that, I'm getting curious about the lode, and
would rather like to have a stake in the venture, if Miss
Strange agrees when she comes up."</p>

<p class="dgp">"She won't agree unless she finds the ore. Then, of
course, she'd need help and money."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," said Scott, and they talked about
something else.</p>

<p class="dgp">For some weeks they said nothing more about the
silver vein. Part of the roof of the main heading in
the mine came down, and they had afterwards to contend
with a dangerous flow of water. Extra timbering
was needed and the men risked their lives as they
wedged the props under the cracking beams, while
now and then they worked for a shift with buckets to
help the clanging pump. Their clothes were always
wet, and they were generally smeared with mud when
they came up to eat and sleep. The miners grumbled,
and Scott and Thirlwell felt the mental and physical
strain. They were highly strung and often irritable,
while when they sat by the stove when work was over
they only talked about the difficulties they had struggled
with all day and others that must be met in the
morning.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the meantime, the thaw began. The snow softened
and got honeycombed by the drops from the
trees. One sank to the knees in trampled slush among
the sawn-off stumps about the shaft-head. The ice
rotted, and in places where the current ran fast large

floes broke off, and drove down stream until they
were stopped by the thick ice in the slacks. Above
the Shadow Rapids, however, there was, for a time,
no break in the frozen surface, and one evening Scott
and Thirlwell sat listening to the growl of the rising
flood in the open channel it had made near the mine.
The sound swelled and sank, and at intervals they
heard rain patter on the roof.</p>

<p class="dgp">"In a week or two the canoes will be out," Scott
remarked. "There's a big head of water coming
down and I guess the jamb that's backing up the
stream won't stand till morning."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Some of it's going now; that's an extra large floe,"
said Thirlwell as a detonating crash rang across the
woods. Then there was a roar that was pierced by a
high, strident note, and he knew the floe was tearing
open upon a rock.</p>

<p class="dgp">The shrill scream died away, but the turmoil of the
current swelled, and knowing what would happen soon,
they waited with strained attention and let their pipes
go out. The mine buildings stood back from the bank
and they ran no risk, but nobody can listen unmoved
when the ice breaks up on a river of the North.</p>

<p class="dgp">Presently there was a deafening concussion like the
shock when a giant gun is fired. The shack trembled
as if struck by a battering ram, and Thirlwell felt his
nerves tingle. After the concussion came a roar that
grew into an overwhelming din, and they braced themselves
against the strain; one could not bear that appalling
noise very long. It subsided a little into a confusion
of jarring sounds that were sometimes distinguishable
and sometimes drowned each other. Massy
floes shocked and smashed, and tore apart upon the

ledges with a noise like the ripping of woven fabric.
Others, lifted out of the water, ground across those
that stuck fast, and some crashed against the rocky
bank, throwing huge blocks among the pines.</p>

<p class="dgp">This lasted for a time, and then the uproar got
bearable and gradually sank. There were intervals
when one could hear the turmoil of the liberated flood
as it rolled by in swollen fury. The intervals lengthened,
and by and by Thirlwell got on his feet with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You never get used to hearing the ice break up.
It's tremendous!" he said. "This is a very stern
country. Sometimes it frightens one&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">He stopped abruptly and listened. The uproar was
sinking fast and in a lull he heard footsteps outside.
Then the door was pushed open and a man staggered
in. His fur-coat was torn and muddy, his feet came
through his pulp moccasins, and the water that drained
from him made a pool on the floor. Three others followed
and stood, dripping, in the light, while Scott and
Thirlwell gazed at them. Then the first dropped into
a chair and leaned his arms on the table as if overcome
by fatigue. His face was gaunt and his eyes
were half shut.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The boss is pretty well used up," said one of the
others and Scott crossed the floor.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Stormont," he said, "you look as if you had been
up against it hard."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont lifted his head and Thirlwell thought his
eyes got like a wolf's.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm starving! No food the last two days."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not much before!" one of the rest remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Been on mighty short rations since we hit the backtrail.

Had a tough job to make it; had to leave our
blankets and truck."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We can give you a meal and a place to sleep. But
where have you been?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Up north," another answered vaguely, and Scott,
recognizing his caution, smiled as he turned to the last
of the party, who stood near the door.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You look fresher than the others, Steve. However,
you're used to the country and I expect you
brought your partners down."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's so," Driscoll growled. "Didn't think
they'd make it. They're a tender-footed crowd!"</p>

<p class="dgp">In the meantime, Thirlwell studied the fellow.
Driscoll was wet and ragged; his face was thin, but
inscrutably sullen. Unlike the rest, he did not look
overcome by fatigue. When Scott spoke he gave him
a dull glance and then fixed his eyes on the floor.
Thirlwell had noted something unusual in his comrade's
manner. Scott's voice had an ironical note and
his look did not indicate much sympathy. In the
North, a demand for food is seldom refused, but Scott
obviously meant to be satisfied with supplying the
party's urgent needs. With this Thirlwell agreed.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then Scott said to Driscoll, "You had better take
your friends to the bunk-house and tell the cook to
make you supper. You know where to get blankets."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont got up with an effort, and when he went
out with the others Scott smiled.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm not going back on my duty, but I don't want
that outfit in my shack," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">Next morning after breakfast Stormont came in.
He had to some extent recovered from his fatigue, but
looked worn and dispirited.</p>


<p class="dgp">"I guess I owe you some thanks," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know if you do or not," Scott answered
coolly. "In the bush, a starving man is, so to speak,
entitled to ask for food and shelter. I couldn't refuse."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont gave him a keen glance. "Well, there's
another thing. It's a long trail to the railroad and I
want to buy stores enough to see us out."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I suppose I must let you have supplies; but
you can't expect to get them as cheap as at the settlements.
In fact, you'll have to pay my price."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That needn't break the deal," Stormont replied.
"I know when there's no use in kicking."</p>

<p class="dgp">"An unsuccessful prospecting trip is an expensive
undertaking," Scott said meaningly. "Then there's
the disappointment. You would have got a big lift if
you'd been lucky enough to find Miss Strange's silver."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The silver is not Miss Strange's. The law gives a
mineral vein to the person who stakes it off and records
it first."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That is so," Scott agreed. "Well, you don't look
as if you had staked a valuable claim! I suppose you
stopped too long trying to find the vein, and the ice was
unsafe when you left. However, you want supplies
to carry you down to the settlement, and if you'll come
along to the store, we'll see what I've got."</p>

<p class="dgp">They went out, and in the afternoon Stormont's
party took the trail to the South.</p>

<a name="toc_15"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XIV&mdash;Stormont Disowns A Debt</h3>

<p class="noindent">The general store was empty, and Drummond,
leaning on the counter, frowned as he glanced
at the clock. It was a few minutes after the time for
closing and he had been busily occupied all day. Besides,
he had an engagement at the pool-room and
thought he would be late. If so, a man whom he
knew he could beat would probably begin a game with
somebody else, and he would miss an opportunity of
winning two or three dollars. This was annoying,
because Drummond needed the money, but he had
other grounds for feeling dissatisfied.</p>

<p class="dgp">Keeping store was monotonous and rather humiliating
work that left one very little time for amusement.
He could drive a fast horse as well as other young men
he met up town, play a clever card game, and beat his
friends at pool. His talents were obviously wasted
in measuring dry-goods and weighing flour. Moreover,
since meeting Stormont he had been extravagant
and got into debt. There was no need to be economical
when he had been promised a share in a rich mining
claim.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he wondered with misgivings what the farmer
who had gone into the back office was talking about,
and hearing angry voices, felt sorry he had made some
alterations in the man's order. Certain stale goods
carried a commission if the salesman could work them

off, but the thing needed tact and a knowledge of the
customer's temper. Drummond feared he had been
imprudent.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the meantime, he looked about the store with a
feeling of disgust. The long room, with its cracked,
board walls and dusty floor, was uncomfortably warm,
and smelt of hot iron, dry-goods, and old cheese.
Drummond had neglected to regulate the draught when
he filled the rusty stove, and now felt that_ one could
not expect a spirited young man to spend his days in
such a place. Anyhow, it was after closing time, and
sitting on the counter he lighted a cigarette, letting it
stick to his under lip. This was the latest fashion and
gave one a sporting look. Soon after he began to
smoke, the farmer came out of the office.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can send for the truck when you like; I've
no use for goods like that," he said. "Next time you
pack me a dud lot I'll cut out your account. If you
and the sporting guy who's sitting on your counter
thought me a sucker, I guess I've put you wise!"</p>

<p class="dgp">He went down the steps into the street, and the lean,
hard-faced storekeeper turned to Drummond with an
ominous frown.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Get off that counter! You make me tired to look
at you, with your dude clothes and a cigar-root hanging
out of your mouth. Throw the blamed thing
away and put up the canned stuff you left about."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond felt tempted to refuse, but his employer's
eye was on him and he obeyed sullenly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"When you've finished, you can clean up that row
of shelves," the other resumed. "Then stack the flour
and sugar bags where they're kept. Guess you reckoned
to leave the truck all night where the transfer

man dumped it. If you can't serve a customer, I'll
see you keep the store straight!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond imagined the work would occupy him
for an hour and might spoil his clothes. Besides, if
he gave way, his employer might make fresh encroachments
on his evenings, and he thought the fellow
wanted to goad him to revolt.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No, sir," he said. "It's closing time. I'm going
to quit."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you quit now, you quit for good! Don't know
why I've kept you, anyway!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I know," said Drummond, who resolved to be
firm. If his employer really meant to get rid of him,
he risked nothing, but if not, he might win some advantage.
"You couldn't get another clerk to take my
job for the wages you pay."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said the other grimly, "I'm willing to try.
It's a sure thing I couldn't get a man who'd muss up
the store like you. Come to me for your money and
light out when you like."</p>

<p class="dgp">He went out, banging the door, and Drummond sat
down, rather limply, on a dry-goods bale. After all,
it was something of a shock to find himself dismissed,
but in a few minutes he gathered confidence. Stormont
had given him fifty dollars and promised him a
share in the silver mine, and although he had soon
spent the money, he would go to Winnipeg, ask for
another payment, and see what progress the fellow was
making. If the vein had not yet been located, Stormont
would, no doubt, find him a job. In fact, the
only trouble was that when he had bought his ticket he
would not have enough money left to pay his bill at
the boarding-house.</p>


<p class="dgp">Four days later, he left the town, and reaching Winnipeg
one afternoon, began to inquire about Stormont
in the great, domed, marble-paved waiting-room. To
his surprise, the officials he questioned knew nothing
about the man, and when one sent him to the inquiry
office, the fashionably dressed lady clerk was ignorant.
She, however, threw a directory on the counter and
told him haughtily that he could look for the address.</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond found it, and walking along Main
Street, turned up Portage Avenue. There was a block
of traffic at the corner where the broad roads cross, and
close by a crowd had gathered to read the bulletins on
the front of a newspaper office. Stopping for a few
minutes, Drummond studied the row of tall buildings,
but saw that the number he wanted was farther on.
There was, however, an imposing block some distance
ahead, but this turned out to be a huge department
store, and afterwards the buildings got smaller
and plainer. It began to look as if Stormont was not
as important a man as he had thought, and he was
conscious of some disappointment as he went on until
he stopped where private houses, workshops, and
shabby stores ran out towards Deer Park. Then he
found the number and entered a narrow, dingy building.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was obvious that Stormont had studied economy
when he chose his office, and Drummond stopped and
hesitated on a landing opposite a door that badly needed
painting. He began to think he had been rash in leaving
his post in the Ontario town, but nerving himself
with the reflection that he had a share in a silver vein,
knocked at the door. Somebody told him to come in,
and he walked into a small room.</p>


<p class="dgp">The dirty walls were hung with plans of building lots
and surveys of the forest belt in Eastern Manitoba. A
glass partition ran up the middle and on one side Watson
sat in front of a typewriter. He looked at Drummond
with surprise, but did not get up.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," he said, "why have you come to town?
Have you got a week off, or have you got fired?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You ought to know what I've come about, but I
want to see the boss," Drummond rejoined.</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's easy, anyhow," said Watson, with a grin
Drummond did not like, and indicated a door in the
partition.</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond opened the door and saw Stormont sitting
at a table covered with papers. He looked up and
nodded coolly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Hallo!" he said. "Mr. Drummond, isn't it? Sit
down for a few minutes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Then picking up a letter, he knitted his brows. He
did not think Drummond could give him much trouble,
but he might become something of a nuisance unless
he was dealt with firmly. Stormont had not long since
come back from the North, feeling disappointed and
savage, for he had spent a good deal of money on the
expedition. Besides, things had gone wrong at the
office while he was away and he had lost some profitable
business.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What can I do for you?" he asked by and by.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I've left the store," said Drummond. "Thought
I'd locate in Winnipeg. One has better chances in
the big cities, and I reckoned you could find me a job.
Anyhow, I'll need some money."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's a sure thing. But why did you come to
me for it?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"You gave me fifty dollars&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"When did I give you fifty dollars?" Stormont interrupted
with a look of surprise.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The evening Watson took me to your room at the
Dufferin House. Besides, you promised me a share
in the mine."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont smiled. "That accounts for the thing!
I'm afraid you were drunker than I thought."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You did give me the money," Drummond insisted.
"Are you trying to go back on your promise?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, well," said Stormont with an indulgent smile,
"in order to satisfy you, we'll ask Watson." He
knocked on the partition and turned to the clerk as
the latter came in. "Mr. Drummond states that I
gave him fifty dollars on the evening you brought him
to the Dufferin House. Do you remember anything
about it?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Certainly not," said Watson. "You gave him
a cigar and some liquor, though I thought he'd had
enough. He fell down the stairs afterwards and made
trouble for me when I saw him home." Watson
paused and resumed with a meaning smile: "It's
pretty hard to remember what happens when you've
got on a big jag!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond colored angrily, but pulled himself together.
"I remember I got the money and told Mr.
Stormont about the ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Now I come to think of it, you did tell me a curious
story about a mysterious silver lode," Stormont
agreed. "Somewhere in the North, wasn't it? Anyhow,
I didn't give the thing much attention. You can
hear tales of that kind in any miners' saloon."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's so," Watson supported him. "Sometimes

we hear them in this office when a crank prospector
comes along. All the same, they're not business propositions."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You promised me a share in the mine," Drummond
declared, and added with dark suspicion: "I guess
you found the ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont laughed ironically. "Cut it out, Mr.
Drummond! It's a sure thing I haven't found a silver
lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you're going to turn me down, I'll try somebody
else."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can't object. In fact, I dare say Watson will
give you the addresses of some people who speculate
on mining claims. But you mustn't be disappointed
if they fire you out."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond's face got red and he clenched his fist,
for he had already told his tale to people who heard
it with amused incredulity.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You promised you would make me rich and I've
thrown up my job! I've got about five dollars and
don't know what to do!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Stormont coolly, "there's an employment
agent a few blocks up the street and as trade's
pretty good it's possible he can find you a post. That's
about the only thing I can think of and I'm occupied
just now&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond stopped him with a savage gesture and
walked out of the room.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We have fixed him; I guess he won't bother us
again," Stormont remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">After leaving the office, Drummond wandered
moodily along the avenue and presently came to a
square, past which rows of pretty wooden houses surrounded

by poplars, ran towards the river bank. The
snow had gone, the afternoon was warm, and finding a
bench in the sun, he sat down to think. His character
was complex and his thoughts involved, for he had
inherited something from ancestors of different type.
A touch of Indian vanity and French expansiveness
was balanced by his father's Scottish caution and the
Indian's stolid calm. Sometimes he was rash and impulsive,
and sometimes strangely patient, but he seldom
forgot an injury.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was obvious that he had been cheated and in the
meantime could get no satisfaction for the wrong he
had been done. What he knew about the silver ore
was worth something while he alone had the secret, but
now he had told somebody else its value had disappeared.
It was, however, a comfort to reflect that he
had not been altogether frank with Stormont; he had
kept something back that would be a useful guide when
one looked for the creek. His recollection of this was
hazy, but he would think about it later.</p>

<p class="dgp">On the whole, Drummond thought Stormont had
not found the ore. A hint of anger in his ironical
amusement implied that he had come back disappointed;
and if he imagined he had got on the right
track, he would, no doubt, have been willing to pay
another fifty dollars. For all that, Watson and Stormont
had plotted to win his confidence, make him
drunk, and find out all he knew, and this indicated that
the fellow thought the vein worth looking for. When
Stormont got over his disappointment he would try
again.</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond saw that he could embarrass Stormont
by selling the secret he had been cheated of to somebody

else. It was amusing to think of two parties
looking for the vein; the difficulty was that he did
not know anybody likely to be a buyer. But he could
wait, since it looked as if he had put Stormont off
the track, and by and by he might find a speculator
willing to believe his tale. Sooner than let Stormont
locate the vein he would give, for nothing, any antagonist
of the latter's all the help he could.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he remembered that he had only a few dollars
and must find some work soon. Supper would
not be served at the cheap hotels for an hour yet and
he set off to look for an employment agent. The man
charged a dollar and gave him a card with an address,
remarking that Drummond ought to get a job,
as business was good. Drummond went back up the
avenue, and presenting the card at a big store, was engaged
for a week and promised a post afterwards if
the department boss was satisfied.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XV&mdash;The Grand Rapid</h3>

<p class="noindent">Bright moonlight touched the river, streaking
the angry water with a silver track, when Scott
and Thirlwell poled against the stream in the gloom
of the wooded bank. The Shadow, swollen by melted
snow, rolled by in flood, swirling along the stony beach
in lines of foam, and tossing about battered trunks
brought down by winter storms. Farther down
stream, a shimmering haze of spray indicated the
Grand Rapid, and Thirlwell meant to stem the current
until they were far enough from the foaming turmoil
to paddle across. The gray trout were shy that evening
and they had let the canoe drift farther than they
thought. Presently somebody hailed them from the
bank, and as they let the canoe swing round in an eddy
a dark figure moved out from the gloom of the pines.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Driscoll's voice, I think," said Scott. "Head her
inshore; we'll see what he wants."</p>

<p class="dgp">It transpired that Driscoll wanted them to take him
across. He had left his small canoe some distance
down stream, because he thought he might be drawn
into the rapid before he could reach the other bank.
Scott's canoe was larger, and with three men on board
they could easily make head against the current.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I guess we've got to take him," Scott remarked.
"Give her a push and run her in behind the rock."</p>


<p class="dgp">When the canoe grounded Driscoll got on board and
picked up a pole. As there was not another, Thirlwell
paddled in the stern while they pushed the craft
through the slack. It was hard work and he noted
how slowly the pines rolled past. By and by they
reached an angry-white rush of current between an
island and the bank, and as they could scarcely make
progress Scott suggested putting down the poles and
paddling across. Driscoll, however, grumbled that
they were not far enough up stream, and getting out
when they ran the canoe close to the driftwood that
washed about the shingle, tracked her for some distance
through the shallow water. While the fellow
stumbled among the dead branches, Scott gave Thirlwell
a meaning look that the latter thought he understood.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was obvious that Driscoll was anxious to avoid
being swept into the rapid and Thirlwell admitted the
prudence of this, but did not think the danger great
enough to account for his rather excessive caution.
The Indians generally shot the rapid when the water
was low, and although the river was now rolling down
in flood, it was not impossible for men with steady
nerves to take the canoe safely through to the tail-pool.
He wondered whether Black Steve had been
drinking, but on the whole did not think he had, and
admitting that the fellow knew the streams and eddies
best, let him have his way. At length, however, Scott
threw down his pole.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We're far enough and I want my supper," he said.
"Get hold of the paddles and let her shoot across."</p>

<p class="dgp">Driscoll grumbled half aloud, but made no determined
protest, and paddling hard they headed obliquely

for the opposite bank. As they forged through the
glittering water the current swept them down and
Thirlwell noted that it was running faster than he had
thought. The river was wide and the ragged pines got
indistinct as they rolled back up stream. It looked as
if the canoe were standing still and the banks moving
on, only that the gleaming spray-cloud got rapidly
nearer. It stretched across from bank to bank, and a
dull roar that rose and fell came out of the wavering
mist. For the most part, the current was smooth, but
here and there broken lines of foam streaked its surface,
and sometimes the canoe swung round in revolving
eddies.</p>

<p class="dgp">Still the dark rocks ahead got nearer and at length
Driscoll made a sign that they could stop paddling.
He occupied the stern, where he could steer the craft.
Thirlwell, feeling breathless after his efforts, was glad
to stop, and looked about as he knelt in the middle.
He had often thought it was from the river one best
marked the savage austerity of the wilderness. In the
bush, one's view was broken by rocks and trunks, but
from the wide expanse of water one could look across
the belt of forest that ran back, desolate and silent, to
Hudson Bay. Here and there the hazy outline of a
rocky height caught the eye, but for the most part, the
landscape had no charm of varied beauty. It was
monotonous, somber, and forbidding.</p>

<p class="dgp">The canoe was now thirty or forty yards from the
rough bank, and drifting fast. Driscoll obviously
meant to land on a patch of shingle lower down, which
was the only safe spot for some distance. At low-water
one could run a canoe aground among the

ledges that bordered the slack inner edge of the rapid,
but when the Shadow rose in flood the current broke
and boiled furiously among the rocks. One faces forward
when paddling, and while Thirlwell watched the
dark gaps in the pines open up and close he heard Driscoll
shout. Next moment Scott leaned over the bow
and plunged his arm into the water. It looked as if
he had dropped his paddle and Thirlwell backed his
in order to stop the craft.</p>

<p class="dgp">The paddle floated past, too far off for Driscoll to
reach, and signing to Thirlwell, he swung the canoe
round, but the water was getting broken and they
missed the paddle by a yard. Then they drove her
ahead in a semi-circle, and a minute or two had gone
when Scott, leaning over cautiously, seized the paddle-haft.
In the meantime, they had drifted fast, and
Thirlwell saw that that patch of shingle was now up
stream.</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's awkward," Scott remarked, and the canoe
rocked as Driscoll dipped his paddle.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Drive her! You have got to make the beach," he
shouted in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p class="dgp">There was something contagious in the man's alarm,
and knowing his physical courage, Thirlwell made his
best effort. The sweat ran down his face, he felt his
muscles strain and his sinews crack, and the canoe's
bow lifted as the paddle-blades beat the water. Driscoll
leaned far forward to get a longer stroke and
urged the others with breathless shouts, but the shingle
they were heading for slowly slipped away.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Try along the bank," Driscoll ordered, and Thirlwell,
turning to pick up a pole, saw his face in the

moonlight. It was strangely set, and he was not looking
at the bank, but at the rapid. His gaze was fixed
and horrified.</p>

<p class="dgp">For some minutes they scarcely held the craft
against the stream. Indeed, Thirlwell afterwards
wondered why they kept it up, since it was obvious that
they could not reach the landing, but imagined that
Driscoll urged them. The fellow seemed resolved not
to be drawn into the rapid.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We can't make it; I've got to let up," Scott gasped
at length, and Thirlwell, breathing hard, wiped his
wet face as the canoe drove away.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was galling to be beaten, and there was some danger
unless the craft was handled well. Steadiness and
skill were needed, but after all the risk was not greater
than he had often run in the mine and on the frozen
trail. The daunting thing was that Driscoll, whom
they had expected to steer the canoe, looked afraid.
He crouched astern, paddling in a slack, nerveless
manner. There was no chance of landing now; they
must run through the mad turmoil into the eddies of
the tail-pool.</p>

<p class="dgp">The roar of the flood rolled in confused echoes along
the wall of pines. Angry waves broke upon the reefs
near the bank, and a cloud of spray wavered and glittered
above a tossing line of foam. They were drifting
towards the line extraordinarily fast, and Thirlwell
felt his nerves tingle as he tried to brace himself.
There was ground for being daunted, but he thought
he would not have felt much disturbed had Driscoll
not looked afraid.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then Scott, kneeling in the bow, turned, and after

a quick glance at Driscoll said, "Keep as cool as you
can, partner. Steve's badly rattled and can't be
trusted."</p>

<p class="dgp">A minute or two afterwards, they plunged over the
edge of the rapid. The air got cold and the light got
dim, for a wind blew against the rush of water and the
spray hid the moon. Still, they could see for a distance,
and Thirlwell frankly shrank as he glanced
ahead. The river was broken by ridges of leaping
foam that ran one behind the other with narrow gaps
between. White-ringed eddies span along the bank
and the tops of dark rocks rose out of the turmoil.
Moreover, there were rocks in the channels, and one
must strain one's eyes for the upheavals that marked
sunken shoals. Driscoll knew the reefs and eddies,
and while they plunged down like a toboggan Thirlwell
risked a glance astern. The man's eyes were fixed on
the river, but his pose was slack. It was plain that
he had not recovered and they could expect no help
from him. Thirlwell drew a deep breath and gripped
his paddle hard.</p>

<p class="dgp">He could never remember much about the next few
minutes. Sometimes he shouted to Scott, and thought
Scott called to him, as a wedge of stone suddenly split
the rushing foam, and sometimes when the current
boiled in fierce rebound from a hidden obstacle. The
canoe plunged until the water stood up above her bows,
and now and then leaped out half her length. When
they dared, they checked her with a back-stroke as
some danger loomed ahead, but oftener drove her
faster than the current to steer her round a reef or
dark, revolving pool. Yet, for the most part, she must

be kept straight down stream, for if she swerved across
a breaking wave its crest would curl on board and bear
her down.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell was vaguely conscious that his hand had
galled and bled, but this did not matter. The trouble
was, that the sweat ran into his eyes and he could not
see distinctly. He felt his heart thump and his breath
come hard, but braced himself against the lurching
and tried not to miss a stroke. If he did so, Scott,
paddling in the bow, would swing her round and next
moment they would be in the water.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the meantime, he was conscious of a curious,
fierce excitement, but had braved danger too often to
indulge the feeling. It led to hot rashness, and judgment
and quick but calm decision were needed now.
He must concentrate all the power of his mind as
well as the strength of his body on taking the canoe
down to the tail-pool.</p>

<p class="dgp">She shipped some water on the way and they could
not bail. It washed about their knees as the frail craft
plunged, and Thirlwell wondered anxiously how much
she would carry without capsizing. The rocks and
pines ashore now streamed past, blurred and indistinct,
but he had seldom an opportunity for glancing at
the bank. He must look ahead, and every now and
then his view was shortened by a ridge of tumbling
foam.</p>

<p class="dgp">Somehow she came through, half-swamped, and
swung down the savage fan-shaped rush that spread
in white turmoil across the tail-pool. Paddling hard,
they drove her out of the eddies that circled along the
bank, and finding a slack, ran her on to a shingle beach.
Then they sat down, wet and exhausted, to recover

breath. Driscoll helped to pull the canoe up, but when
Thirlwell presently looked about he could not see him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"He's gone," Scott remarked dryly. "Lit out
while you were taking off your boots."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell imagined that the roar of the river had
drowned the fellow's steps, but he did not want to talk,
about Driscoll yet, and when he put on his boots, which
had been full of water, they started for the shack.
After they had changed their clothes Scott sat down
and lighted his pipe.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What do you think was the matter with Black
Steve?" he asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It looked as if he'd taken some liquor, but I don't
know," Thirlwell answered. "He was obviously
scared."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sure," said Scott. "But he wasn't scared of getting
drowned. Steve's a better canoe hand than either
of us and has physical pluck."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then why was he afraid?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott looked thoughtful. "I imagine he was afraid
of the rapid and the dark. When he hailed us to take
him over, I thought it an excuse; he could have got
across in his own canoe if he had braced up. My
notion is he didn't want to make the trip by himself."
He paused and gave Thirlwell a keen glance. "Curious,
isn't it?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"He's a curious man," said Thirlwell, who had
dark suspicions that he did not want to talk about.
"When we were drifting into the rapid, I got a glimpse
of his face and didn't look again. Thought I'd better
not; the fellow's nerve had gone. Anyhow, if he
hates the rapid, why does he stop here and live near
the bank?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"Steve is primitive; I guess you don't understand
him yet. He's an old trapper and one gets superstitious
in the bush. For all that, he's stubborn, and if
he has an object, he'll persist until he carries it out."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But what object has he got?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott made a vague gesture. "I can't tell you that.
Hadn't you better get out the plates? I want some
food."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell put a frying-pan on the stove and they
talked about something else.</p>

<a name="toc_17"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XVI&mdash;The Pit-Prop</h3>

<p class="noindent">Driscoll was sorting pit-props, throwing them
on to piles at the bottom of the shaft, when
Thirlwell stopped to hook a small, flat lamp to his hat.
The man sometimes worked in the mine for a few
weeks when the trapping season was over, and Scott
was generally willing to engage him because he was
skilful with the axe and labor was scarce. He made
no friends among the men, and gave Thirlwell a sour
look without speaking when the latter picked up his
lamp.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell went on down the inclined gallery.
Water splashed upon his slickers and trickled about
his feet; the tunnel was narrow and the air was foul.
Here and there a smoky light burned among the props
lining the walls, and the dim illumination touched the
beams that crossed the roof, but the gaps between the
spots were dark. The timbers were numerous, and
where one could see a short distance, ran on into the
gloom in rows so closely spaced that they seemed continuous.</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by Thirlwell found Scott looking up at a
massive beam a few inches overhead. The beam was
not quite level, and the prop beneath one end had bent,
while a threatening crack extended across the roof.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We may have a bad fall here," Scott remarked.

"The prop's getting shaky and the pressure's pretty
fierce. I reckon we'd better shore her up as quick as
we can. It's lucky our lumber doesn't cost us much."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell examined the crack and thought it dangerous.
There were one or two transverse splits,
which indicated a heavy mass of rock was ready to
come down. None of the men were near the spot, and
he knew they were occupied, but Driscoll had left a
few props between the timbers, ready for use where
the roof was weak. Thirlwell found one and dragged
it to the spot.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We'll put this up and then I think I'll get a fresh
beam across."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott helped him to raise the timber. It was a few
inches too long, and crossed the space between floor
and roof with a small slant, but it was meant to do
so, in order that when its lower end was driven forward
until it stood upright it would wedge fast the
beam above. Then Thirlwell brought an ax and
struck the prop some heavy blows with its back while
Scott steadied the top. It was almost in place, and
the bent timber was getting loose, when the top slipped
and shook the beam. There was an ominous crack and
a few small stones broke away and fell on Scott's head.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I've got her butted solid now," he shouted after
a short breathless struggle with the timber. "Be
quick! The roof's coming down!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell saw the danger. So long as the prop
slanted, it would not support the beam, and if the beam
gave way, the roof would fall and crush them before
they could get from underneath. He thought he had
a few moments to hammer the prop straight, and swung
the ax savagely while the sweat ran down his face.

He dared not look up again, but the ominous cracking
went on and while he wondered what was happening,
Driscoll ran past. A big stone fell beside the man as
he seized another prop and with a tense effort jambed
it under the beam.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'll take some weight off her while you shore her
up," Driscoll gasped.</p>

<p class="dgp">He had brought a heavy mallet, but before he used
this he dragged the foot of the timber round, bending
his body forward while his arms got stiff and hard,
as if carved from wood. His sullen face was darkly
flushed and the swollen veins stood out from his forehead.
Thirlwell saw him for a moment as he lifted
his ax, and remembering the scene afterwards, thought
the fellow had looked a model of savage strength. It
was obvious that he had no fear.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the meantime, he was vaguely conscious that Driscoll
had saved his life. He and Scott had stayed too
long, and could not have fixed their prop before the
beam gave way had not the other come to help. For
that matter, they were not out of danger yet. Unless
they could wedge the timber in the next few moments,
the roof would come down. There was not room to
swing the ax properly, his body was cramped from
bending, and he could not lift his head. Stooping in
the low tunnel, he nerved himself for a tense effort
and struck several furious blows. The prop quivered,
groaned as it felt the pressure from above, moved
an inch or two, and stood upright. Then Thirlwell
dropped his ax and staggered back. He felt limp and
exhausted, and wanted to get away. The beam would
hold the roof for some minutes and might do so for a
time.</p>


<p class="dgp">"You can let up now, Driscoll," Scott called out
when they stopped a few yards off. "We'll see if the
prop will stand before we do anything else."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Guess I'll fix the other," Driscoll replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Come out," Scott insisted. "You don't know if
it's safe."</p>

<p class="dgp">Driscoll glanced round for a moment. His hat had
fallen off and the miner's lamp flared and smoked in
the water at his feet. His hair was wet with the drops
from the roof, and a thin streak of blood ran down
his face from a cut a falling stone had made. But his
heavy eyes had a fixed, obstinate look.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You hired me to mind the timbers; it's my job."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott acquiesced with a gesture and he and Thirlwell
watched. There was a risk that in wedging the
extra prop the man might loosen the first; and then, if
neither was able to bear the load, the rock above would
fall and bury him. For all that, Driscoll looked undisturbed
and did not stop until he had carefully driven
the timber into its proper place. Then he turned to
Scott and his glance was slow and dull.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I want you to send two of the boys along."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why do you want them?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I've got to have some help. She won't hold up
long unless we run another beam across."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It would be prudent," Thirlwell agreed, and went
down the gallery with Scott to the working face.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What do you think of Black Steve?" Scott asked
when they had sent the men and stood near a lamp.
"He wasn't scared just now!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm puzzled," said Thirlwell thoughtfully. "The
fellow was quite cool. If he hadn't come with the

prop, I expect the roof would have buried us. But
that's another thing. Why did he come?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott smiled. "We were plainly in some danger,
but I don't imagine Black Steve was moved by a generous
impulse to save our lives. In fact, if it had
promised him some advantage, I rather think he'd have
seen us buried."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You don't claim it was a sense of duty?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not in a way; Steve's too primitive. On the
whole, I think he explained the thing best when he said
it was his job. A fellow of his kind doesn't reason
like you; perhaps he did once, but lost the habit in the
bush. He's, so to speak, atavistic; moved by instincts,
like the Indians and animals."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps it isn't very obvious," Scott admitted.
"For all that, the Indian's instinctive obstinacy carries
him far. Steve had undertaken to look after our
timbering, he's used to danger, and the risk didn't
count. I expect he was moved by the feeling the bushman
gets when he's up against Nature; he knows he'll
be crushed if he can't make good. Anyhow, I've
moralized long enough. Will you see what they're doing
with that rock-borer?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell left him and went to the machine, which
made a jarring noise. He spent some time adjusting
the cutters, and afterwards stood for a few minutes
thinking about what his comrade had said. Scott's
argument was involved, but Thirlwell thought he saw
what he meant. Driscoll's bemused mind could not
grasp the thought of duty that demanded self-sacrifice,
but he had animal courage and stubbornness. He

would carry out what he had undertaken. Moreover,
he might have animal cunning without having cultivated
intelligence, and his strength and resolution made
him dangerous. Thirlwell did not like Driscoll better
than before, but it looked as if the fellow had saved
his life, and although he might not have meant to do
so, this counted for something. Going back to the
shaft presently, he climbed up and sat down in the
sun.</p>

<p class="dgp">A warm wind blew across the pine woods, the sun
was getting hot, and the wet grounds about the shaft-head
was drying fast. The river had risen as the
lakes in the wilds it came from overflowed with melted
snow, and raged, level with its banks, in angry flood,
rolling broken trees down stream and strewing ledges
and shingle with battered branches. Its hoarse roar
echoed across the bush, and Thirlwell felt that there
was something daunting in the deep-toned sound.
One could understand that a man like Driscoll, whose
brain was dulled by liquor, might let it fill him with
vague terrors when the woods were still at night.</p>

<p class="dgp">But listening to the river presently led Thirlwell to
think about Strange. There was something pathetic
about the story of his life, for Agatha had made Thirlwell
understand her father's long patience, gentleness,
and self-sacrifice. His duty to his family had cost him
much, but he had cheerfully paid. It looked as if he
had done best at the task he most disliked&mdash;managing
the humble store in the small wooden town. One
could not think of him as having failed there. His
wife and children loved him, though all but one had
smiled when he talked about the lode.</p>

<p class="dgp">His daughter, who knew him best, had inherited his

confidence, and Thirlwell owned that this had some
weight. She was perhaps influenced by tender sentiment,
but there was nothing romantic about Driscoll
and Stormont, and it looked as if they shared her belief
that the lode could be found. Scott, too, thought
it possible, and his judgment was often sound. Thirlwell
had imagined the lode an illusion of Strange's, but
his disbelief was giving way.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he forgot the others and thought about Agatha.
In some ways she was like Strange, but she was
made of finer and stronger stuff. She had his patience,
but her brain was keener, and her resolution was
backed by moral force. Moreover, she was a very
charming girl and Thirlwell admitted that he looked
forward with eagerness to their journey. She would
come in summer, when the rivers and lakes were open
and the woods were filled with resinous smells. The
sun was hot in the North then, the days were often
calm, and there was a wonderful bracing freshness
when the lingering twilight glimmered behind the pines.</p>

<p class="dgp">It would be strangely pleasant to listen to the girl's
soft voice while the canoes glided smoothly across
sparkling lakes, and perhaps to tell her stories of the
wilds when the smoke of the camp-fire drifted by and
the cry of the loon came out of the shadows. For
all that, there was not much risk of his falling in love
with her. He was not a sentimentalist, and she had
told him that her vocation was science. Her journey
was a duty, and when the duty was carried out she
would concentrate on her studies, and as she had talent
presently make her mark. He did not think she would
find the lode, but when she was persuaded it could not
be found he would no longer be useful and they would

go their different ways. Well, he supposed he must
acquiesce. He was a poor engineer, and such happiness
as marriage could offer was not for him.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he glanced at his watch and got up with an
impatient shrug. He had forgotten his work while he
thought about the girl, and there was much to be done.
For one thing, he had come up to see if the smith had
tempered some boring tools; and then he must send
the <em>Metis</em> river-jacks to float a raft of props down to
the mine. Pulling himself together, he set about the
work with characteristic energy, but as he walked
through the murmuring woods he unconsciously began
to sing a romantic ballad he had learned when a boy.
Presently, however, he stopped and smiled. It looked
as if he were getting sentimental, and one must guard
against that kind of thing.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XVII&mdash;Drummond Offers Help</h3>

<p class="noindent">It was a calm evening and Thirlwell and Scott sat
outside the shack, watching the river while the sunset
faded across the woods. A few <em>Metis</em> freighters
had gone to the settlements for supplies and mining
tools, and although much depended on the condition
of the portages, Scott expected them that night.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Antoine will bring up our mail," he said. "It's
some time since Miss Strange has written to you about
her plans."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell said it was nearly three months, and Scott
resumed: "Well, I think if I'd had a part in the business,
I'd have tried to find if the Hudson's Bay agent
was alive. It's possible that he could tell you something
about the location of the ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know that I have any part in the business,"
Thirlwell replied. "I promised to go with Miss
Strange, but that's all."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If she finds the lode, she'll need a mining engineer."</p>

<p class="dgp">"She'll have no trouble in engaging one if the pay
is good."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But you wouldn't think you had first claim to the
post? In fact, if you helped the girl to find the ore,
you'd be satisfied to drop out and leave her alone?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell frowned. He had made no plans for the
future and certainly did not mean to trade upon Agatha's

gratitude, but he knew it would hurt him, so to
speak, to drop out and let her look for other help.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The lode isn't found yet," he rejoined.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Anyhow, I feel that the girl or you ought to have
got on the agent's track," Scott insisted. "He knew
where Strange went, and saw him when he returned.
It's possible that Strange confused his memory by his
subsequent trips, but the agent heard his story when
the matter was fresh."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell did not answer, and Scott cut some tobacco.
When he had finished he looked up the river.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The <em>bateaux!</em> Antoine has made good time."</p>

<p class="dgp">Two craft drew out of the shadow of the pines,
slid down the swift current, and presently grounded
on a gravel beach. They were of the canoe type, but
larger, and their bottoms were flat, since they were
rather built for carrying goods than paddling fast.
There was a good water route to the rocky height of
land, across which the cargo was brought on the
freighters' backs from a river that joined the wagon
trail to the settlements. As soon as they landed, the
crews began to carry up boxes and packages, but a
young man left the group and came towards the shack.
He wore neat store-clothes that were not much the
worse for the journey, and although his skin was
somewhat dark, looked like a young business man
from the cities.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Which of you is Mr. Thirlwell?" he asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I am," said Thirlwell. "Who are you?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ian Drummond; the boys call me Jake. A son
of Hector Drummond's of Longue Sault factory."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," said Scott, "this gets interesting! Did Hector
Drummond send you?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"No; he died nine years since."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott gave Thirlwell a meaning look, and turned
to the young man.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then what do you want?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"To begin with, I want a job."</p>

<p class="dgp">"A job?" said Scott with some surprise. "What
can you do?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I know nothing about mining, but I'm pretty
strong," Drummond answered, giving Scott a deerskin
bag. "Anyhow, Mr. Thirlwell had better read
his letter before you hire me. Antoine, the <em>patron</em>,
brought up your mail."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," said Scott. "The cook will give the
boys supper soon and you had better go along. Come
back afterwards."</p>

<p class="dgp">When the lad had gone, Thirlwell felt pleasantly
excited as he opened a letter Scott took out of the bag,
for he saw it was from Agatha. She told him that
Drummond had met her in Toronto and related how
Stormont had victimized him. The young man stated
that he wanted to see the North and would like to get
work where he could watch for the prospecting party
he thought Stormont would send up.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I warned him that you may not be able to give him
employment, but he is keen about going and willing
to take the risk," she said. "We can, I think, trust
him to some extent, and perhaps he knows enough
about my father's journey to be useful; but I cannot
tell if it would be prudent to offer him a reward. I
am glad to feel I can leave this to you, and will, of
course, agree to the line you think it proper to take."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell read part of the letter to Scott, who said,
"Miss Strange seems to have a flattering confidence in

your judgment. Do you want me to hire the fellow?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know yet. I wouldn't ask you to engage
him unless he could be of use."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You needn't hesitate on that ground, since we're
two men short," Scott answered, smiling. "Well,
suppose we wait until we have talked to him. I guess
you know this silver-lode is getting hold of me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder why!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott laughed. "You understand machines and
rocks; to some extent I understand men. Anyhow,
I find them interesting, and perhaps other people's firm
belief in the lode influences me."</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by Drummond came back and Scott studied
him as he advanced. He saw the lad had a strain of
Indian blood, and he knew something about the half-breeds'
character. They were marked by certain
weaknesses, but as a rule inherited a slow tenacity
from their Indian ancestors. He had known a man,
shot through the body, walk four hundred miles to
reach a doctor, and they made the revenging of serious
injuries a duty. A <em>Metis</em> would wait the greater part
of a lifetime for a chance of repaying in kind a man
who had wronged him. Drummond looked somewhat
dissipated and had a superficial smartness that young
men without much education acquire in Canadian
towns, but Scott thought him intelligent.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sit down," he said, indicating a short pine-stump.
"You want a job. Is that all?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Drummond coolly, "it's all I want
<em>now</em>. If you and Mr. Thirlwell mean to look for the
ore and take me along, you can give me what you think
my help is worth. But I've already put Miss Strange
wise."</p>


<p class="dgp">"You seem to be pretty trustful! How did you
find her?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"My father knew where Strange, located after he
left the factory, and I tried to get on the track of his
folks when Stormont turned me down. Talked to
packing-house drummers at a department store in Winnipeg
where I was employed, and found a man who
sold Strange canned goods when he ran a grocery
business. The drummer had known him pretty well
and told me Miss Strange was in Toronto. By and
by, when trade was slack in Winnipeg, the firm sent
some of the clerks to their Toronto store and I bothered
the department boss until he let me go. Then I
was 'most a month locating Miss Strange; couldn't find
her in the directory and Toronto's a big town."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott noted the determination that had helped him
in his search. "You knew about the lode for some
time," he said. "Why did you wait so long?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I allowed there wasn't much use in my butting in,
until I read in a newspaper that Strange was drowned.
Besides, the drummer reckoned his own folks thought
him a crank and there was nothing to his tale. All the
same, when I got tired of keeping store I thought I'd
see what I could do about the lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I suppose it was because the drummer put you
wise that you went to Miss Strange and not her
brother? No doubt you tried to interest other people
first. Still, as she promised you nothing, I don't see
why you came here."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Stormont played me for a sucker; found out all I
knew and turned me down!" Drummond answered
with a savage sparkle in his eyes.</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott was silent for a few moments and then looked

up. "You can begin work to-morrow and Mr. Thirlwell
will pay you what you're worth. We'll make no
further promise, but if you like, you can tell us anything
you think important."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Miss Strange knows," said Drummond with a curious
smile. "You want to remember that I told Stormont
the creek runs <em>south</em>. She does run south, for a
piece, but she turns and goes down a valley to the east."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then it's hard to see your object for playing the
crook with Stormont, though I don't suppose he'd have
done the square thing if you had put him on the right
track," Scott remarked. "However, that's not our
business. You'll find room and some blankets in the
bunk-house."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond left them and Thirlwell said, thoughtfully,
"It's plain that he deceived Stormont by telling
him the creek flowed south. This would make the
fellow think the ore was on our side of the last height
of land, but if the water goes east, it must run into the
James Bay basin on the other slope. That's something
of a clue, but I see a risk in keeping Drummond
here. Suppose he makes friends with Driscoll?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Driscoll doesn't make friends," Scott rejoined and
added with a twinkle: "Then as you don't admit
there is a lode, it's not worth while to wonder whether
the lad could tell Black Steve anything useful."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We'll let that go," Thirlwell replied, and when
Scott strolled away read Agatha's letter again with
keen satisfaction. It was a charming, frank letter,
and he thrilled as he noted her trust in him.</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond went to work next morning and Thirlwell,
allowing for some awkwardness at first, thought

he would earn his pay, while a doubt he had felt about
the prudence of engaging him was presently removed.
Going to the smith's shop one afternoon, he heard angry
voices and stopped to see what was going on.
The smithy, which stood at the edge of the clearing
round the mine, was a rude log shack without a door.
It was generally rather dark, but just then a ray of
sunshine struck in and the charcoal fire on the hearth
glowed a dull red. The smith leaned on his hammer,
watching Driscoll and Drummond, who confronted
each other close by.</p>

<p class="dgp">Driscoll was heavy and muscular, Drummond wiry
and thin, but as they stood, highly strung, Thirlwell
noted the athletic symmetry of both figures. Driscoll
had, no doubt, acquired it by travel in the woods, and
Drummond by inheritance from Indian forefathers.
The older man's limbs and body had the fine proportions
of a Greek statue, and since he did not move one
could not see that he was lame. Their faces, although
different in modeling, were somehow alike, for both
had a curious, quiet watchful look. They disputed in
low voices, but Thirlwell saw their mood was dangerous.
He knew that noisy fury seldom marks a struggle
in the North, where hunting animals and men
strike in silence. There was something strangely like
the stealthy alertness of the animals in their attitudes.</p>

<p class="dgp">Waiting in the gloom among the pine-trunks, he
gathered that the quarrel was about the sharpening of
tools. Drummond had brought some cutters from the
boring machine, and Driscoll wanted his ax ground.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I came along first," Drummond declared. "Tom's
going to fix my cutters; your ax has got to wait!"

He glanced at the smith, sharply, as if reluctant to
move his eyes from Driscoll. "Give the wheel a spin
and let's get busy!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"He certainly won't," said Driscoll; "I've unshipped
the handle. You'll get your cutters quickest if
you quit talking and wait until I'm through."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's not playing it like a white man. Don't
know why they hired you at the mine. Your job's
smuggling the Indians liquor."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your folks!" sneered Driscoll. "You're not
white."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Stop there!" said Drummond, with stern quietness,
and Thirlwell saw him balance a cutter he held.
It was a short but heavy piece of steel, curved at the
point.</p>

<p class="dgp">Driscoll's eyes glittered. "Your father was a
squaw-man; your mother&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">He bent his body with the swift suppleness of an
acrobat, and the cutter, flying past, rang upon the
wall of the shack. Then he swung forward and the
end of a pick-handle missed Drummond by an inch.</p>

<p class="dgp">Another cutter shot from Drummond's hand and
struck Driscoll's side. He stooped, and Thirlwell
thought he was falling but saw that he had bent down
to pick up his ax. Next moment the blade flashed in
a long sweep and Drummond sprang behind the anvil,
which occupied the middle of the floor. He had another
cutter and held it back, with his arm bent, ready
to launch it at Driscoll's head, but Thirlwell imagined
he was pressed too hard to feel sure of his aim and
wanted to get out of his antagonist's reach. It was
plain that the situation was dangerous, but Thirlwell
knew he could not stop the men by shouting, and the

fight would probably be over before he reached the
shack. He had, however, forgotten the smith, who
pulled a glowing iron from the fire.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can quit now; I butt in here!" he said, holding
the iron close to Driscoll's chest. Then he turned
to Drummond. "Put that cutter down! I don't:
want to see you killed in my smithy."</p>

<p class="dgp">All were quite still for a moment, and then Driscoll
moved, as if he meant to get round the anvil, but the
smith held him back.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Try it again and I'll surely singe your hide!" he
shouted, and swung round as he heard Drummond's
cautious step. "If you sling that cutter at him, I'll
put you on the fire. Get out now; I'm coming to see
you go!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond backed to the door, with the red iron a
few inches from his face, and when he had gone the
smith signed to Driscoll.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You're not going yet! Sit down right there and
take a smoke."</p>

<p class="dgp">A few moments later Thirlwell joined Drummond,
who was waiting near the smithy. "If you mean to
make trouble, I'll pay you off," he said. "You're
hired to work, not to fight."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If I quit now, Steve will get after me again,"
Drummond grumbled.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think not. In fact, I'll see about that; but if
you provoke the man, you'll be fired as soon as I know.
It's worth while to remember that you're a long way
from the settlements."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I got him with the cutter, anyhow," Drummond
rejoined, and when he went off Thirlwell entered the
smithy.</p>


<p class="dgp">He imagined what he said to Driscoll would prevent
the quarrel beginning again, and presently went
back to the mine, feeling satisfied. There was now not
much risk of Drummond and Driscoll making friends
and finding that both knew something about the lode.
Thirlwell was persuaded that Driscoll did know something,
more in fact than anybody else; he knew where
Strange had expected to find the ore. Thirlwell had
not admitted this to Scott, because he shrank from stating
his suspicions, which were dark but vague. Now,
however, he thought he would try to formulate them
and see how they looked, since he might, after all, take
Scott into his confidence.</p>

<p class="dgp">To begin with, nobody knew why Strange's canoe
capsized. Strange was clever with the paddle, and
Driscoll's narrative, while plausible, left something to
be accounted for. It was improbable that he had quarreled
with his partner while they shot the rapid, because
their minds would be occupied by the dangerous
navigation. Then supposing that Driscoll had intentionally
let the canoe swerve when they were threatened
by a breaking wave, it was hard to see what he
would gain. If he thought Strange had found the ore,
it would obviously be impossible to learn anything
about it after the man was drowned. The theory that
Strange had already told him where the lode was, and
Driscoll meant to get rid of a partner who would demand
the largest share, must be rejected, since if
Strange had told him, Driscoll would have gone away
to register the claim. But he had not done so.</p>

<p class="dgp">The thing was mysterious, and Thirlwell could see
no light. He must wait and watch for a hint, and in
the meantime resolved to talk to Scott about it. So

far, he had rather avoided the subject of Strange's
death, but it might be better to abandon his reserve.
He did not think he could expect much help from Scott,
but he was clever and Thirlwell had known him to solve
some awkward puzzles.</p>

<hr class="page">

<div class="div">
<a name="toc_19"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XVIII&mdash;The Hand In The Water</h3>

<p class="noindent">Scott lying among the pine-needles after work
had stopped, lighted his pipe and glanced at Thirlwell,
who had been talking for some minutes.</p>

<p class="dgp">"On the whole, it was lucky the smith had an iron
hot," he said. "Black Steve's a dangerous man and
we know something about the <em>Metis</em> temper. Drummond,
of course, is hardly a <em>Metis</em>, but he has a drop
of Indian blood that must be reckoned on. It's a remarkably
virile strain."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I was rather glad they quarreled. I'd been afraid
Driscoll might learn he knew something about the lode
and persuade him to join the gang. I wouldn't trust
him far."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can trust his Indian instincts," Scott replied.
"No doubt he's greedy, but he hates Stormont, and I
imagine he'd sooner punish the fellow than find the
silver." He paused, and looked thoughtful when he
went on: "The other matter's difficult; but, like Father
Lucien, I don't see what we can do. It's possible
that Steve drowned his partner, or anyhow, took advantage
of an accident to let him drown; but we're
not detectives, and you can't move against a man without
something besides suspicion to go upon. Then we
were under the cracking beam when he fixed the prop
that stopped the roof coming down."</p>


<p class="dgp">"I suppose, if he's guilty, that oughtn't to count?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's an awkward question," Scott replied. "However,
we don't know if he is guilty, and I don't see much
chance of our finding out. But there's something else.
Miss Strange had the shock of hearing about her father's
sudden death, and it would not be kind to harrow
her again."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Certainly not," said Thirlwell, who felt annoyed
because his comrade had guessed his thoughts.</p>

<p class="dgp">A week later, Thirlwell was walking down the tunnel
when he saw one or two of the men and Driscoll
shoring up the roof. Drummond was helping, but a
stone fell on him and he sat down. There was no light
except the flicker of the lamps in the men's hats and
they did not see Thirlwell.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Are you hurt, kid?" one asked Drummond.</p>

<p class="dgp">"He's scared," Driscoll growled. "Let him get
out; this is a man's job."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond sprang to his feet, although Thirlwell
noted an ugly bruise on his forehead.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Talk about being scared!" he cried. "Why
you're 'most scared to death of the rapid! What d'you
reckon lives there that's going to get you in the dark?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Driscoll stepped forward. His face looked gray,
but his mouth was hard and his eyes shone with savage
rage. Thirlwell thought the man's passion was
dangerous, and running up, got in front of him and
sent Drummond to the shaft.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Load up that broken rock," he said. "If you
leave the job and come back here, I'll fire you out."</p>

<p class="dgp">He was disturbed by the quarrel, because he understood
something of Driscoll's feelings when stung
by the taunt. Then he was curious about Drummond's

object for making it, and wondered how much he knew.
He kept them apart and when they stopped at noon
Driscoll came up to him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I want to quit when the week's up," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why?" Thirlwell asked, looking hard at him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"For one thing, I've put up most of the new timbers
and guess she'll hold for a while. Then I sure don't
like that <em>Metis</em> kid. Reckon I'll kill him if I stop."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Do what you think best," said Thirlwell, who saw
he must get rid of one and would sooner keep Drummond.
"If you come back later, we may find you a
job."</p>

<p class="dgp">At the end of the week, Driscoll went off into the
bush, and after supper Thirlwell sent for Drummond.
Scott was sitting near him outside the shack when the
young man came up.</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you make any fresh trouble here, you know
what's coming to you," Scott remarked. "Steve is a
good miner and it won't pay us to keep you and let
him go."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I guess you won't find the boys are sorry he lit
out. There's something wrong about the man."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If that's so, it's not your business," Thirlwell rejoined.
"But why did you tell him he was scared of
the rapid?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond sat down on a fir-stump and grinned
with frank amusement. He had finished his duty
until the next shift went under ground and in the
meantime his employers had no authority over him.
Indeed, he felt that he had conceded something by
coming when he was sent for, and he might not have
done so had he not liked Thirlwell.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Because Steve certainly <em>was</em> scared," he replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">"How do you know this?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, I s'pose I've got to put you wise. I go fishing
evenings, when the trout are on the feed just before
it's dusk, and I'd seen Steve prospecting round the
pools among the reefs. Struck me as kind of curious,
because if he was looking for something, he'd do better
in daylight."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott glanced at Thirlwell, who remembered having
come upon Driscoll when he was apparently engaged
in searching the pools. It was obvious to him, and
he thought to Scott, that the fellow had chosen the
twilight in order to avoid being seen.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Did Driscoll see you?" Thirlwell asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know; the boys tell me he's a trapper,"
Drummond answered with a smile.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I suppose that means you kept out of sight and
watched? But go on with your tale."</p>

<p class="dgp">"One evening I was sitting among the rocks. It
was very calm and getting dark when I heard a rattle
and a splash. I reckoned Steve was looking hard for
something if he trod on a loose stone."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell nodded. Driscoll was a skilful trapper
and a trapper does not disturb loose stones. Since he
had made a noise, it was obvious that he was very much
occupied, and thought himself alone. In a way, it
was curious that he imagined there was nobody about;
but although Driscoll had studied wood-craft, Drummond
had, no doubt, inherited the ability to lurk unseen
in the bush. Thirlwell could picture the lad crouching
in the gloom of the dark pines.</p>

<p class="dgp">"After a piece," Drummond resumed, "I got his

figure against the sky, and reckoned, because he looked
short, he was wading in a pool. Felt I had to see
what he was looking for, but knew I couldn't get near
him along the bank. There are patches of gravel
among the rocks, and the brush grows pretty thick
where it gets the light at the edge of a wood."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Willows, for the most part; they're green, and
soft, just now," Scott remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can't crawl through green brush without making
some noise. If you watch your arms and shoulders,
you can't watch your feet."</p>

<p class="dgp">"How'd you know that? Gone hunting often?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Never owned a gun," said Drummond "Still I
did know."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It doesn't matter. Go on," said Scott, who looked
at Thirlwell meaningly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"For a while, I couldn't see what I'd better do, and
then I looked at the water. It was glimmering a few
yards out, but there was a dark piece where the stream
runs slack beside the rocks, and I took off my jacket
and my boots."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why didn't you take off all your clothes?" Scott
asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond looked at him with surprise. "I knew
my skin would shine in the water."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes, of course," said Scott. "Well, it was a risky
swim. If you had been washed into the main stream
you'd have gone much farther than you meant. Did
you get near Driscoll?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sure I did. An eddy swung me out and I reckoned
I was going down the main rush, but I caught the
back-swirl and after that kept very close along the
bank. Got a knock from a boulder, but, just paddling

enough to keep on top, I drifted down to where Steve
stood. He was on a ledge now, and I could hardly see
him against the pines, but his head was bent, as if he
was looking into the water. Then I allowed I'd been
a fool. I couldn't stop unless I crawled out almost at
his feet; you can't swim against that stream. Steve
doesn't like me and there were some hefty rocks
around."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond paused, and Thirlwell imagined the lad
had run some risk. A blow from a heavy stone would
have stopped his swimming, without leaving a tell-tale
mark, since his body would bear many bruises when
the rapid threw it out among the eddies in the tail-pool.
Thirlwell could picture the scene&mdash;the dark pines
standing against the pale sky, and the dim reflection
from the river; the unsuspecting man bending over the
ledge; and the lad drifting noiselessly down stream,
with only his head above water and his rather long
hair streaking his dark face.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," continued Drummond, "you see how I was
fixed! I couldn't pull out from the bank because the
slack was narrow, and, if I kept on, I must pass Steve
very close. I surely didn't like it, but saw what I'd
better do. He was facing down stream, turned half
away from me, and I reckoned the water was about
four feet deep. I'd grab his foot and pull him in.
Then I'd get away while he was floundering about,
while if he was too quick and gripped me, we'd be equal
in the water and he'd have no rocks to throw.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I drifted on until I could reach him and seized his
foot, but the rest didn't work out as I thought. Steve
didn't slip into the water; he kept on his feet and
screamed."</p>


<p class="dgp">"I suppose you mean he shouted," Thirlwell suggested.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No, sir&mdash;I mean <em>screamed</em>; like a jack-rabbit in
a trap. The ledge slanted awkwardly; he couldn't turn
to see what had got hold of him, and had hard work to
keep his balance when an eddy swung me off the bank.
I saw him stiffen as he braced himself, and guess he
felt my grip get tighter through his boot, because he
gave another scream, as if he was mad afraid. Then
he got his other foot against something that steadied
him and I saw I couldn't pull him off. I let go and
swam under water as long as I could. When I came
up Steve wasn't there, but I heard him push through
the willows up the bank. He was running as if he
thought he had to go for his life. Well, I got out at
the next slack and went for my boots and jacket.
Steve wasn't watching; I guess he'd had enough!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's possible," Scott agreed dryly. "Do you think
he saw you just before you dived?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"He might have seen my hand; it would look whiter
than my gray shirt. He certainly didn't see my face;
I didn't mean him to."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Scott, "it's an amusing tale, but you
had better not tell it to anybody else. Now you can
go along, but see you keep out of trouble in future. If
I find you talking about Driscoll, or quarreling with
the boys, I'll butt in."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond went away, and when he vanished into
the shadow of the pines Thirlwell remarked: "I don't
imagine Driscoll found the thing amusing!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Do you think he afterwards guessed it was Drummond
who got hold of him? The young idiot gave
him a hint when he taunted him with being scared."</p>


<p class="dgp">"It's likely," said Thirlwell. "If he did guess,
it would account for his anger; the man was carried
away by a rage. He looked as if he'd have killed the
lad if there had been nobody about, and perhaps he had
some excuse. He's afraid of the river, and we have
seen his imagination get the better of his pluck. I'm
not surprised he got a nasty jar. Try to picture it!
The growing dark; the roar of the rapid that we know
he hates; and the wet hand that rose from the eddy
and seized his foot."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott nodded. "Just so! <em>Whose</em> hand do you
imagine he thought it was?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think we both suspect. But we agreed that suspicion
was not enough."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It is not enough," said Scott, who took his fishing
rod from the pegs in the wall of the shack. "Well,
shall we go down to the river? The trout ought to
rise to-night."</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XIX&mdash;A Lost Opportunity</h3>

<p class="noindent">The class-room was very hot and a ray of dazzling
sunshine quivered upon the diagrams on
the yellow wall. An electric fan hummed monotonously
and buzzing flies hovered about Agatha's head.
Her face and hands were damp as she stood with
knitted brows beside a tall blackboard, looking at the
drowsy girls whom she was teaching inorganic chemistry.
One or two fixed their eyes on the symbols she
had written; the rest had obviously given up the effort
to understand the complicated formula. In fact, they
did not seem to notice that she had stopped her lecture.</p>

<p class="dgp">For a few moments she looked about and mused.
With one or two exceptions, she liked her pupils, and
had led them patiently along the uphill road to knowledge.
They had made some progress, but she had lost
her delight in leading. For one thing, few would go
far, and when they left her the rest would turn aside
from the laborious pursuit of science into pleasant human
paths and forget all that she had taught while they
occupied themselves with the care of husband and
children. Moreover, she herself could not follow the
climbing road to the heights where the light of knowledge
burns brightest, as she once had hoped. When
the school term was finished she must turn back and
begin again, at the bottom, to direct the faltering steps

of another band. But she sometimes wondered
whether the beckoning light was not austere and cold.</p>

<p class="dgp">She glanced at her dress. It was a neutral color and
like a uniform. After all, she had physical charm
and it was sometimes irksome to wear unbecoming
clothes. Then the lofty room, with its varnished desks
and benches, looked bleak; her life was passed in bare
class-rooms and echoing stone corridors. This would
not have mattered had she been able to follow her
bent and take the line she had once marked out; but
she could not. She must give up the thought of independent
research and teach for a living, cramping her
talents to meet her pupils' intelligence, until, in time,
she sank to their level.</p>

<p class="dgp">She roused herself with an effort and mechanically
resumed her lecture, for her wandering thoughts now
dwelt upon the foaming rivers and cool forests of the
North. The class-rooms smelt of varnish and throbbed
with the monotonous rattle of the fan; in the wilds
one breathed the resinous fragrance of the pines and
heard the splash of running water. For all that, she
must not shirk her duty and she tried to make the meaning
of the symbols on the board plainer to the languid
girls.</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by she remarked that they were more alert.
Some were making notes, and one or two looked past
her with frank curiosity. The door was behind the
board, and Agatha had heard nobody come in, but
when she looked round she saw a gray-haired gentleman
standing near the lady principal. He seemed to
be listening to what she said and she thought his eyes
twinkled as if he understood the difficulty of rousing
her pupils' interest. This was somewhat embarrassing;

but the school was famous and visitors were now
and then shown round.</p>

<p class="dgp">She paused, and the stranger turned to the principal.
"If you will allow me&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">The principal smiled and he came up to Agatha,
holding out his hand for the chalk.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Suppose we alter the formula this way?" he said
and wiped out the letters and figures.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha studied him as he wrote fresh symbols. He
was plainly dressed and about sixty years of age.
There was nothing else worth noting, but he obviously
knew his subject and she liked his face. She saw that
the girls could follow his explanation, but while suited
to their understanding, it was, in one respect, not quite
accurate.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know if I've made it much plainer," he said
deprecatingly when he stopped.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha indicated a group of letters. "It is plainer,
thank you! But does the combination of the two
elements take place exactly as you have shown?
At a normal temperature, the metal's affinity for
oxygen&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," he said, "you know that? It looks as if
you had studied the new Austrian theory. But perhaps
one may make a small concession, for the sake of
clearness."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Science is exact," Agatha replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's a bold claim for us to make," he rejoined,
smiling. "Our symbols are guess measures; our elements
split up into two or three. But I gather that
you refuse to compromise about what, in the meantime,
we think is the truth?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think one must adhere to it, as far as one knows."</p>


<p class="dgp">"Well, no doubt, that is the proper line. But I've
stopped your lecture and perhaps bored your pupils."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Agatha. "You have helped me over
awkward ground, and I expect they would sooner
listen to a stranger."</p>

<p class="dgp">He went away with the principal, and Agatha wondered
about him as she resumed her task. It was
plain that he knew something about science, but this
was not strange, since geologists and chemists sometimes
visited the school. After she dismissed her
class the principal sent for her.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I suppose you don't know who that man is?" she
asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha admitted that she did not know and colored
when the other told her. The man was a famous scientist
who had recently simplified the smelting of some
refractory British Columbian ores, and was now understood
to be occupied with the problem of utilizing certain
barren alkali belts in the West.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh!" she said, "I talked to him as if he were one
of the girls. In fact, I believe I was gently patronizing."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't think he was much hurt."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then he must have been amused and that is nearly
as bad. After he had gone I imagined I'd seen his portrait
somewhere."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He hasn't gone yet," the principal answered with
a twinkle. "He's waiting to see you in the managers'
room, and I must confess to something of a plot when
I brought him in quietly to hear your lecture."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But what does he want?" Agatha asked with excited
curiosity.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I imagine he wants to offer you a post, but he will

tell you about this. You have half an hour before
the next class."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha went out, trying to preserve her calm. The
man had made his mark by the application of science
to industry and the thought that she might help him
gave her a thrill. This was different work from teaching
beginners; taking them so far and then going over
the ground again. If she got the post, she could go
on, farther perhaps than she had hoped, and when she
had learned enough embark on a career of independent
research. She thought she had the necessary
tenacity and brains. There was an obstacle, but she
would not hurry to meet it and it might be removed.</p>

<p class="dgp">When she entered the room the man got up and indicated
a chair. He asked a few questions, rather carelessly,
and afterwards remarked: "Miss Southern had
already told me what I most wanted to know. You
may have heard about the work in which I am engaged."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha, with a touch of color, "I know
what it is now."</p>

<p class="dgp">He smiled. "Perhaps it would have been better
had I asked Miss Southern to present me, but I'm not
very formal. Well, I was asked by the Provincial
Government and the railroad to find the best way of
developing the alkali wastes, and the subject is extraordinarily
interesting. If I can solve the problem, it
will make important changes in our irrigation system
and enable us to cultivate wide belts of barren soil.
However, I must have help and want a lady who can
take the charge of my correspondence with scientific
people and assist in my experiments. After talking to
Miss Southern, I feel I can offer you the post."</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha thrilled, but used some self-control.</p>

<p class="dgp">"But you might not need me long, and I must give
up the school."</p>

<p class="dgp">He smiled. "If you wished to resume teaching, I
daresay your having helped in my investigations would
be an advantage."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then do you expect me to help much in that way?"
Agatha asked with growing excitement.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes; as far as you are able. I am told that you
are used to laboratory work. Would this suit you?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha's eyes sparkled. "It would realize my pet
ambition."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well. We had better talk about the salary.
My notion is&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha thought the offer generous. She would be
richer than she had been yet and there was an object
for which she needed money. She felt flattered and
almost overjoyed. The work she was asked to do
might start her well on the road she had long wished
to take.</p>

<p class="dgp">"There is another matter," the man resumed when
she declared that she was satisfied. "It will be necessary
for you to come to Europe. My wife will take
care of you."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you are going to Europe?" Agatha said with
a curious sinking of her heart.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes. I must consult an eminent Frenchman and
two or three Austrians. They have studied some of
the problems I am up against."</p>

<p class="dgp">"When do you start?" Agatha asked with forced
quietness.</p>

<p class="dgp">"In about three weeks, if I can get ready."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha tried to brace herself. The disappointment

was hard to bear, and for a few moments she engaged
in a bitter struggle. If she took the post and went to
Europe, she could not go North for a year, and Thirlwell
might not be able to help her then. She knew that
she had counted on his help, and that without it she
could not penetrate far into the wilds. Indeed, it was
possible that she could not start at all.</p>

<p class="dgp">Yet, if she went North, she must refuse an alluring
offer and throw away an opportunity for making her
mark. Her ambition must be abandoned, and if she
failed to find the silver, she would have to resume her
monotonous duties at the school. She was beginning
to find them strangely dreary. Then George had
warned her against sacrificing her youth, and perhaps
all her life, to the pursuit of a shadow. Her friends
did not believe in the silver, and she doubted if she
could find the vein. Failure might leave her sour and
the hardships break her health; she would come back
with her savings exhausted to toil and deny herself
again. Yet the lode was waiting to be found somewhere
in the North, and the duty she had accepted long
since must come first.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I'm sorry I cannot go," she said with an
effort.</p>

<p class="dgp">The man looked surprised. "The voyage is short
and comfortable if one travels by a big, fast boat. I
expect to work hard, but you would have some leisure
and opportunities for seeing famous pictures, statues,
and laboratories. Then you would meet eminent chemists
and learn something from their talk. In fact,
the visit ought to be of help in many ways, and, if you
afterwards left my employment, make it easy for you
to get another post."</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha struggled for calm. He had rather understated
than exaggerated the reasons why she ought
to go. Then Toronto and Montreal were the only
cities she knew, and she was offered a chance of seeing
some of the capitals of Europe, with their treasures of
art, and meeting men who had made famous scientific
discoveries. It would help her more than many certificates
if later on she resumed her work of teaching.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," she said in a strained voice, "please don't
try to show me all that I shall miss! I want to go so
very much, but it's impossible. If I went, I should
neglect a duty that has a stronger claim."</p>

<p class="dgp">He bowed. "Then, although I'm sorry, there's
nothing to be said. Would it be an impertinence if I
asked about the duty?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha was silent for a moment or two. Her refusal
had cost her much; indeed, she was afraid to
think what she had lost and felt she must do something
to banish the crushing sense of disappointment.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," she said impulsively; "I cannot resent anything
you ask. I must start North soon to look for a
vein of ore my father told me about, I'm forced to
make the search, but it would be a long story if I told
you why." She hesitated and then went on: "I wonder
whether you would look at this analysis and tell
me what you think&mdash;I mean if you think there is ore
of that kind on the Northern slope of the Ontario
watershed."</p>

<p class="dgp">He took the paper she had long carried about and
studied it for a time. Then he said: "It is not the
ore a practical miner would expect to strike, but practical
miners are sometimes deceived. As a rule, they

know more about shafts and adits than scientific
geology."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Would <em>you</em> expect to find the ore where I have
told you?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," he said thoughtfully, "the Laurentian
rocks are very old, and our miners have so far dealt
with newer formations. On the whole, I think it possible
that ore like this has been forced up from unusual
depths."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But would the silver be easily refined?"</p>

<p class="dgp">He smiled. "There would be no trouble about its
reduction. If you can locate the vein, you will be
rich."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha thanked him and went out, feeling somewhat
comforted. She had given up much, but she
saw a ray of light in the gloom ahead. The way she
had chosen was difficult, but after all it was the right
way, and, if she were resolute, might lead to success.
Then she remembered with a strange satisfaction that
for a time she need not walk alone: Thirlwell would be
her guide when she plunged into the trackless wilds and
she knew that one could trust him.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XX&mdash;The Plunge</h3>

<p class="noindent">Supper was over at the Farnam homestead and
Agatha enjoyed the cool of the evening on the
veranda with her hosts and George. The school had
closed for the holidays, and George had arrived as the
meal from which they had just got up was served. Although
he had not stated his object yet, Agatha knew
why he had come and shrank from the vigorous protest
she expected him to make. In the meantime, she had
something else to think about and listened for the
noise of wheels.</p>

<p class="dgp">Farnam's hired man had driven across to the settlement
in the afternoon and she wondered, rather anxiously,
whether he would bring her a telegram. She
had written to Thirlwell, telling him when she would
be ready to begin her search for the ore, and now
waited his reply. Her letter might take some time to
reach him, and she must allow for his messenger's
journey to the railroad from the mine; but she knew
she would feel restless until the answer came.</p>

<p class="dgp">The evening was calm, the air was fresher than in
the city, and she found the quiet soothing. A field
of timothy grass near the house rippled languidly, the
dark heads rising stiffly upright when the faint breeze
dropped. Sometimes there was a movement among
the tall blades and feathery plumes of the Indian corn,
and then the rustle stopped and everything was still.

Beyond the zig-zag fence, the fruit trees ran back in
rows that converged and melted into a blurred mass at
the edge of the bush. The narrow landscape had no
prominent feature. It was smooth and calm, and
Agatha found it rested her eyes and brain. She
wanted to be tranquil, but must shortly rouse herself
when Mrs. Farnam and George began their joint attack.
George had an ominously determined look, and
she knew Mabel would give him her support.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why didn't you come and stop with us? Florence
expected you," he said by and by.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha saw he was feeling for an opening, and since
it was hard to put him off, answered with a smile:
"You are a persistent fellow, and I'm not fond of argument.
I wanted to be quiet."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You mean you were afraid I'd get after you about
your crank notion of finding the old man's lode? As
you haven't talked about it for some time, I'd begun
to hope you had given that folly up. Are you going?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Some time; I may go very soon. Perhaps I shall
know to-night."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I'll wait," George said grimly. "If you
get a message from the miner fellow, I may have some
remarks to make!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Farnam began to talk about the fruit crop, and it
was half an hour later when Agatha heard a rattle of
wheels. Then a rig lurched along the uneven road in
a cloud of dust and soon after it vanished among the
trees Farnam's hired man walked up to the veranda.</p>

<p class="dgp">"A wire for Miss Strange! There was no mail,"
he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha's nerve tingled as she opened the envelope,
and then the restless feeling left her and she felt very

calm. The telegram was from Thirlwell, who stated
where he would meet her and that the sum she named
would be enough. This was a relief, because she had
insisted that the journey should be made at her cost
and traveling is expensive in the wilds.</p>

<p class="dgp">One needed tents, clothes, and prospecting tools;
canoes must be bought and experienced <em>voyageurs</em> engaged,
since the craft and stores would have to be carried
across rugged divides. Agatha had for a long
time practised stern economy, doubting if her savings
would cover the expense, and now when she had met
all demands she would have very few dollars left.
This did not matter; the money would go round, and
she felt recklessly satisfied. After a moment or two
she gave the telegram to George.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I start in three days!"</p>

<p class="dgp">George said nothing, although his face got red, and
Agatha studied him with sympathetic amusement. It
was obvious that he was using some self-control while
he mustered his forces for an attack. He had begun to
get fat and looked rather aggressively prosperous. In
fact, George was a typical business man and it was
ridiculous to think he could understand.</p>

<p class="dgp">"But what about your clothes?" Mrs. Farnam
asked. "You must have a special outfit for the bush."</p>

<p class="dgp">"They're all bought! Before I left Toronto I ordered
what I would need to be got ready and properly
packed. The things will be sent as soon as the people
get my telegram. You see, I've been thinking about
my outfit. One can't take much when it must be carried
across the portages."</p>

<p class="dgp">George frowned savagely. "You ought to know
my sister, Mrs. Farnam! When she undertakes a

job she leaves nothing to chance, and I guess she's
had it all fixed some time since." He turned to Agatha.
"I've got to relieve my feelings, if I do nothing
else! Well, I suppose you understand what this adventure
means? Unless you get back before the new
term begins, you'll lose your post, and you take steep
chances of ruining your health. You're not used to
sleeping on wet ground and going without food. Then
you'll have to live with half-tamed <em>voyageurs</em> and perhaps
help them track the canoes. They'll upset you
in the rapids and the bush will tear your clothes. I
hate to think of my sister going about, draggled and
ragged, with a bunch of strange men. But that, while
bad enough, is certainly not the worst!"</p>

<p class="dgp">He stopped to get his breath and then resumed:
"You won't find the lode, and you'll come back feeling
sick and sore. If they keep you on at the school, you
won't want to teach; you'll think of nothing but saving
all you can and pulling out again. You're like father,
and when he took the lone trail the blamed foolishness
got such a grip of him that he never broke loose.
Well, you'll lose your job and the next you get; in fact,
you'll come to hate any work that keeps you from the
North. But a girl can't let herself down until she
turns into a hobo. It's frankly unthinkable. Pull up
and cut out the crazy program before it ruins you!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's too late," said Agatha. "I knew what I might
have to pay when I resolved to go."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder whether you do know. There's something
George hasn't mentioned," Mrs. Farnam remarked.
"I don't think I'm prudish, but you can't
keep your adventure secret, and school managers are
censorious people. Have you thought what it may

mean if they hear about your traveling through the
woods with a man who's not a relative and a band of
wild half-breeds?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha, coloring, "I have thought of
that."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But it didn't count?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It counted for much," said Agatha, in a rather
strained voice.</p>

<p class="dgp">George clenched his fist. "If you're turned out,
people will talk. I'll engage to stop the men, but the
women are dangerous and I can't get after them. For
my sake, drop your fool plan!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can't. I know the risks, but I must go on."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said George with a gesture of helpless indignation,
"I allow I'm beaten and there's not much
comfort in feeling I've done my duty! I didn't expect
you'd bother about my views when I began.
Looks as if we gave young women a dangerous freedom."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Women have won their freedom; you didn't give
it," Mrs. Farnam rejoined, and then turned to Agatha.
"After all, something depends on the man's character.
You haven't told us much about Mr. Thirlwell!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha did not reply and George said grudgingly:
"In a sense, the fellow's all right. I made some inquiries
and must admit that I was satisfied with what
I learned."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You both take it for granted that Agatha will not
locate the vein," Farnam interposed. "Since Thirlwell
manages a mine, he must know something about
prospecting, and if he reckons the chances are pretty
good&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mr. Thirlwell does not really believe I will find

the ore," Agatha said with incautious frankness.</p>

<p class="dgp">George laughed ironically and Farnam looked surprised,
while his wife asked: "Then why is he going?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha felt embarrassed. "I don't know&mdash;He
made me promise I would let him come. I think prospecting
has a charm for miners&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">She stopped as she saw Mrs. Farnam's smile, but it
was some relief to note that George did not seem to
remark her hesitation.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," he said, "your statement's, so to speak, the
climax! The only person who knows anything about
the matter thinks you won't find the vein! The blamed
proposition's ridiculous from the beginning." He got
up and filled his pipe with an unsteady hand. "I'm
too mad to sit still. Guess I'll walk round the orchard
and take a smoke."</p>

<p class="dgp">Farnam presently went after him, and Mrs. Farnam
put her hand on Agatha's arm.</p>

<p class="dgp">"My dear, you have pluck, but you have chosen a
hard road and given your friends a jar. But we are
your friends; don't forget that!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled gratefully, though she found it difficult.
"I didn't really choose. Sometimes I was
afraid; but I knew I had to go."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," said Mrs. Farnam. "We won't talk
about it. Tell me about your clothes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Next day George left the homestead and Agatha
walked across the orchard with him while Farnam
harnessed his team. When a rattle of wheels warned
them that the rig was coming George stopped and
said, "This trip will cost you something and your pay's
not high. How much do you reckon to have left when
you get back?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"About ten dollars," Agatha answered with a
twinkle.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I knew you had grit. But I want you to understand!
I wouldn't give you five cents to help you find
the lode, but you'll go broke on ten dollars long before
your next pay's due. Better take this; it may help
you out."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha took the envelope, but as she began to open
it the rig stopped at the gate, and George put his hand
on her shoulder.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We mustn't keep Farnam; wait until I've gone,"
he said and kissed her. "I'm not going to wish you
good luck, but if you have trouble with the school
people when you get back, come along and stop with
Florence. I'll interview the managers, and, if needful,
find you another job."</p>

<p class="dgp">He hurried off, and when the rattle of wheels died
away Agatha opened the envelope and found a check
for a hundred dollars. She felt moved, but smiled.
The gift was generous, but the way he had made it
was very like George.</p>

<p class="dgp">Three days afterwards, Farnam and his wife drove
her to the railroad and she felt a pang at leaving them
when the cars rolled in. The excitement of starting,
however, helped her over an awkward few minutes,
and she found a girl on the train who wanted to talk.
Besides, it was evening, and after an hour or two the
colored porter lighted the lamps and told her her berth
was ready. She slept well, for it was too late to give
way to misgivings now, and soon after she rose next
morning the train stopped at the station where she
must get down.</p>

<p class="dgp">The conductor threw her baggage out upon the line.

The locomotive bell tolled, the cars went on, and
Agatha's heart sank as she glanced about. It was
early morning and thin mist drifted among the pines.
There was no platform, but a small wooden shack with
an iron roof stood beside the rails, which ran into the
forest a hundred yards off. The agent, after gruffly
asking for her checks, vanished into his office and
banged the door. There was nobody else about, and
the place was very quiet except for the murmur of running
water.</p>

<p class="dgp">A narrow clearing, strewn with ashes and dotted
by blackened stumps, ran along the track, and at its
end were three or four shabby frame houses. A
rudely painted board on one stated that the building
was the Strathcona Hotel. Agatha felt very forlorn.
Except for a week or two with Thirlwell, and once
with a band of merry companions at a summer camp
she had not seen the rugged bush, and now it daunted
her. She was not going on a pleasure excursion, from
which she could return when she liked, but to push far
into the lonely wilds. She had done with civilization
until she came back; it could not help her when she
left the railroad. She must live and struggle with
savage Nature as the prospectors and half-breeds did.
But this was not all; she had, perhaps, cut herself off
from other things than the comfort and security that
civilization offered.</p>

<p class="dgp">Mabel Farnam's warning was, no doubt, justified.
It was possible that the school managers would dismiss
her and she would be unable to get another scholastic
post. She might have to give up her occupation and
although she disliked business earn a frugal living as a
clerk. Her face got hot as she remembered Mabel's

statement that her rashness had given her friends a
jar; but in one sense Mabel was wrong. She had not
been rash; she knew she could trust Thirlwell and the
men he hired. There was nothing to fear from them.
Still she had made a bold plunge that might cost her
much, and now the reaction had begun she felt slack
and dispirited. The plunge, however, was made; she
must carry out what she had undertaken, and it was
foolish to indulge her doubts. She tried to pull herself
together and in a few minutes a man led a team out of
the hotel stable.</p>

<p class="dgp">He leisurely harnessed the lean horses to a very dirty
wagon and then drove them across the clearing to
the track, where he stopped in front of Agatha's baggage.
She noted that his skin was very brown and he
had coarse black hair. The overalls he wore were
very ragged.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mees Strange?" he said. "Dat your truck?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha said it was, and jumping down he threw her
bag and some rough wooden boxes into the wagon.
Then he climbed back up the wheel and held out his
hand.</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>Montez. Allons, en route!</em>"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha got up with some trouble and when she sat
down on a board that crossed the vehicle he cracked his
whip and the wagon, rocking wildly, rolled away
among the stumps and plunged into a narrow trail
chopped out of the bush.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Eet is long way; we mak' breakfast by and by,"
he said. "Thirlwell wait at portage. We arrive to-night,
<em>si tout va bien</em>."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha said nothing, but felt somewhat comforted
as they jolted along the uneven trail.</p>

<a name="toc_22"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXI&mdash;The Wilderness</h3>

<p class="noindent">Dusk was falling and the tired horses plodded
slowly past the rows of shadowy trunks when the
sound of running water came out of the gloom. Agatha
ached from the jolting and felt cramped and sleepy,
but she roused herself when a light began to flicker
among the trees. The driver urged his team, the light
got brighter as the rig lurched down a rough incline,
and Agatha saw a man standing in the trail. His
figure was indistinct and she could not see his face, but
she no longer felt jaded and lonely, for she knew who
he was.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Tired?" he said in a sympathetic voice as he
gave her his hand to get down when the rig stopped in
an opening. "It's a long ride from the railroad, but
after all it was better for you to make it in the day.
Besides, we must pull out to-morrow."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha said she was not excessively tired. She
liked his matter-of-fact manner and thought he had
struck the right note.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Have you got the tent I recommended?" he asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," she said. "It's in the small box."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then as the poles are cut, the boys will soon put
it up. In the meantime, supper's ready."</p>

<p class="dgp">He took her across the narrow open space, and when
near the fire she stopped and looked about. It was

after ten o'clock, but a pale-green glow shone above
the pines, whose ragged tops cut against it in a black
saw-edge. Below, a river brawled among dark rocks,
catching a reflection here and there, and then plunging
into shadow. It was not dark; she could see the
brush and the wild-berry vines that crawled between
the trunks. Then she turned towards the fire that
burned at the foot of a ledge. Two or three figures
moved about the rocks behind it; sometimes picked out
with hard distinctness so that she could see their brown
faces and travel-stained overalls, and sometimes fading
into gloom.</p>

<p class="dgp">The smoke went nearly straight up and then spread
slowly across the river; the flames leaped among the
snapping branches and sank. Strong lights and puzzling
shadows played about the camp; there was an
aromatic smell, and the air was keen and bracing. The
turmoil of the river rather emphasized than disturbed
the quietness. It was different from the noisy city
where the big arc-lights burned above the hurrying
crowds, but Agatha did not find it strange. She felt
as if she were revisiting a scene she had known before,
and thought this was an inheritance from her father,
who had loved the wilds. But perhaps she might go
further back; it was, relatively, not long since all Ontario
was a wilderness, and she sprang from pioneering
stock.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then Thirlwell indicated a folding chair and she sat
down beside two logs, rolled close together to make a
cooking hearth. A kettle and two frying-pans stood
on the logs, supported by both, and the space between
was filled with glowing embers, about which flickered
little blue and orange flames. Thirlwell gave her a

plate and a tin mug, and she found the fresh trout and
hot bannocks appetizing. Then she liked the acid
wild-berries he brought on a bark tray, and the strong,
smoke-flavored tea. She smiled as she remembered
that in Toronto she had been fastidious about her meals
and sometimes could not eat food that was roughly-served.</p>

<p class="dgp">When supper was over Thirlwell sat on one of the
hearth-logs and lighted his pipe. Agatha was pleased
that he did so. While they were in the bush their relations
must be marked by an informal friendliness,
as if she were a comrade and partner and not a girl.
Anything that hinted at the difference in their sex
must be avoided.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You'll get used to camp-life in a few days," he
remarked by and by. "At first I expect you'll find it
a change from, the cities. Things are rudimentary in
the bush."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Nothing jars, except the mosquitoes," Agatha replied.
"I have no sense of strangeness; in fact, I feel
as if I had been here before and belonged to the
woods."</p>

<p class="dgp">"After, all, you do know something about them. I
think you said you had camped in the timber."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That was different. It was a summer camp, organized
by the railroad, and supplied with modern
comforts. You bought a ticket and a gasolene launch
took you up the lake. Then the men wore smart flannels
and the girls new summer clothes. In the evenings
one sang and played a banjo, another a mandolin."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell laughed. "You don't like music?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I love it; but not ragtime and modern coon songs

in the bush. No doubt the people who went there had
earned a holiday, but it would have been different had
they gone to fish or hunt. They went to loaf, play
noisy games, and flirt. Indeed, I used to think we
jarred as much as the horrible dump of old fruit and
meat cans among the willows."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think I know what you mean. Man makes
ugly marks on the wilderness unless he goes to farm.
A mine, for example, is remarkably unpicturesque."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But it stands for endeavor, for something useful
done."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not all mines. A number stand for wasted
money."</p>

<p class="dgp">"And vanished hopes," said Agatha. "Do you
think I shall find the lode? I want you to be frank."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell hesitated. "On the whole, I don't think
so, but my judgment mayn't be sound and my employer,
Scott, does not agree. Anyway, I'll help you
all I can."</p>

<p class="dgp">For a moment or two Agatha studied him. His
face was brown and rather thin and had a hint of quiet
force; his easy pose was graceful but virile. Somehow
he did not clash with the austerity of the woods;
nor did the other men, who now sat, smoking, round
the larger fire. Agatha liked their quietness, their
slow, drawling speech and tranquil movements. She
knew she could trust Thirlwell, but remembering a
remark of Mabel Farnam's, she asked herself why
he had offered his help. She could find no satisfactory
answer and thought it better to leave the puzzle
alone.</p>

<p class="dgp">"But you are doubtful," she said. "Confidence is
a strong driving force."</p>


<p class="dgp">"In a way, that's true," he agreed. "Still it sometimes
drives you into mistakes, and when you get to
work in the right way it doesn't matter much if you're
confident or not. Your feelings can't alter Nature's
laws. If you know how the vein dips, you can strike
the ore; if you sink the shot-hole right, and use enough
powder, you split the rock."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's obvious that you are a materialist."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm a mining engineer," Thirlwell rejoined with
a smile.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha gave him a quiet, friendly look. "It's lucky
I have you to help, because I could not have gone far
alone. I've studied Nature's laws in the laboratory,
but in the bush she works on another scale. There's
a difference between a blow-pipe flame and the subterranean
fires. Now if I don't find the ore, it will
be some comfort to know that I have properly tried."
She glanced at her wrist-watch and got up. "It is
later than I thought!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your tent is ready," Thirlwell replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">She turned and saw a light shining through the V-shaped
canvas on the edge of the trees, but although
she was tired, felt reluctant to leave the fire. It had
burned low between the logs, but it gave the lonely spot
a comfortable home-like look, and the bush was dark.
Thirlwell, sitting where the faint light touched him,
somehow added to the charm by a hint of human fellowship.
He looked as if he were resting by his
hearth, and she had spent a happy hour with him in
quiet, half-confidential talk.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thank you. Good-night," she said, and went
away.</p>

<p class="dgp">When she reached the tent she looked about with

surprise. The earth floor was beaten smooth and
sprinkled with pine-sprays that gave out an aromatic
smell; a bed had been cleverly made of thin branches
and packed twigs. Her blankets were neatly folded
and the small canvas bucket was filled. All she was
likely to need was ready, and the boxes that had held
her outfit were arranged to make a seat and wash-stand.
She felt grateful for this thought for her comfort,
and putting out the miner's lamp, sat down on
the twig-bed and hooked the canvas door back.</p>

<p class="dgp">Although there was no moon, she could distinguish
the black pine-trunks across the river, the lines of foam
where the current broke upon the reefs, and the canoes
drawn up on the bank. Thirlwell and his <em>Metis</em> packers
had gone, and as hers was the only tent she wondered
where they slept. The fires were nearly out, and
except for the noise of the river a solemn quietness
brooded over the camp.</p>

<p class="dgp">She began to muse. She had liked Thirlwell when
she met him at the summer hotel, but she liked him
better in the bush. He harmonized with his surroundings;
he was, so to speak, natural, but not at all uncouth.
The woods had made him quiet, thoughtful,
and vigilant. She had noted his quick, searching
glance, and although there was nothing aggressive
about him, he had force. Yet she did not think him
clever; she had met men whose mental powers were
much more obvious, but when she tried to contrast
them with him, he came out best. After all, character
took one further than intellectual subtlety.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha blushed as she admitted that had she wanted
a lover she might have been satisfied with a man of
Thirlwell's type; but she did not want a lover. She

had inherited a duty and must concentrate on finding
the silver vein; the task in a manner set her apart
from other women, who could follow their bent.
Sometimes she envied them their freedom and gave
way to bitterness, but her austere sense of duty returned.
It was strong just now, but the picture of
Thirlwell sitting opposite by the fire had a happy domestic
touch that made her dissatisfied.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then she remembered that if she found the vein
she would be rich. So far, she had not dwelt much
on this, because it was not a longing for money that
animated her. All the same, she saw that success in
the search would give her power and freedom to choose
the life she would lead. Not long since, she had
thought to find happiness in the pursuit of science;
and with wealth at her command she could make costly
experiments and build laboratories. The thought still
pleased her, but it had lost something of its charm.
Besides, it was too soon for such speculations and she
must be practical.</p>

<p class="dgp">Suppose she did find the ore? The claim must be
recorded and developed as the mining laws required,
and she would need a man who understood such matters
to help her; but it must be a man she could trust.
She could trust Thirlwell and admitted that she had
half-consciously allotted him the supposititious post;
for one thing, if he were manager, they would not be
separated by her success. But this was going too far,
and she resolutely pulled herself up. She had not
found the vein and was perhaps thinking about Thirlwell
oftener than she ought. Feeling for the hooks,
she fastened the tent door and soon afterwards went
to sleep.</p>


<p class="dgp">They launched the canoes in the cool of the morning,
while the mist drifted among the pines and the
sun came up behind the forest. The stream ran fast
and as they toiled up river a brawny half-breed waded
through the shallows with the tracking line. Thirlwell
stood in the stern, using the pole, and Agatha noted the
smooth precision of his movements. He wasted no
effort and did not seem to be working hard, but he did
what he meant and the hint of force was plainer than
when he talked. Two <em>Metis</em> were occupied with the
canoe behind and as they poled and tracked they sang
old songs made by the early French <em>voyageurs</em>. Although
the river had shrunk far down the bank, there
was water enough for the canoes, and Agatha remarked
how skilfully the men avoided the rocks in the channel
and drove the craft up angry rapids.</p>

<p class="dgp">When they nooned upon a gravel bank near the end
of a wide lake it was fiercely hot. The calm water,
flashed like polished steel, and Agatha could hardly
see the flames of the snapping fire; the smoke went up
in thin gray wreaths that were almost invisible. A
clump of juniper grew among the stones and she sat
down in the shade and looked about with dazzled eyes.
A line of driftwood, hammered by the ice and bleached
white by the sun, marked the subsidence of the water
from its high, spring level. Small islands broke the
shining surface, some covered with stunted trees and
some quite bare. The rocks about the beach were
curiously worn, but Agatha knew they had been
ground smooth by drifting floes. Behind the beach,
the forest rolled back in waves of somber green to a
bold ridge that faded into leaden thunder-clouds.</p>

<p class="dgp">The landscape was wild, and although it had nothing

of the savage grandeur Agatha expected, she
thought it forbidding. Its influence was insidious; one
was not daunted by a glance, but realized by degrees
its grimness and desolation. The North was not
dramatic, except perhaps when the ice broke up; the
forces that molded the rugged land worked with a
stern quietness. It looked as if they also molded the
character of the men who braved the rigors of the frozen
waste. The <em>Metis</em> were not vivacious like the
French <em>habitants</em>; they were marked by a certain grave
melancholy and their paddling songs had a plaintive
undertone. Yet their vigor and stubbornness were
obvious, and Agatha thought Thirlwell was like his
packers, in a way. He was not melancholy, and indeed,
often laughed, but one got a hint of reserve and
unobtrusive strength. He did not display his qualities,
as some of the professors and business men she
knew had done, but she imagined they would be seen
if there was need.</p>

<p class="dgp">"In a sense, the North is disappointing," she remarked.
"I expected to feel rather overwhelmed,
but I'm not."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Wait," said Thirlwell, smiling. "After a few
hundred miles of lonely trail you'll know the country
better. I don't want you to get to love it; but in the
wilderness love often goes with fear."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Once I thought that impossible," Agatha replied.
"Now I don't know. I'm beginning to recognize that
I'm not as modern as I thought. But have you ever
been frankly afraid of the wilds?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Often. When you meet the snow on the frozen
trail, a hundred miles from shelter, mind and body
shrink. Perhaps it's worse when all that stands for

warmth and life is loaded on the hand-sledge you haul
across the rotten ice. Then it's significant that the
<em>Metis</em> are sometimes more afraid than white men.
They know the country better."</p>

<p class="dgp">"They haven't the civilized man's intellect. Ignorance
breeds superstition that makes men cowards."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's so, to some extent," Thirlwell agreed. "I
suppose superstition is man's fear of dangers he can't
understand and his wish to propitiate the unknown
powers that rule such things. You and I call these
powers natural forces, for which we have our weights
and measures; but I must own that the measures are
often found defective when applied to mining. I've
met rock-borers who would sooner trust a mascot than
a scientific rule."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We are a curious people," Agatha remarked with a
laugh. "But you passed a smooth beach with good
shade where the river runs out. Why did you come
on here?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The other's the regular camping spot. I remembered
that you don't like old provision cans."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha was pleased. He had thought about her and
remembered her dislikes. While she wondered how
she could tactfully thank him, he went on&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">"Besides, I wanted to make another mile or two.
A good day's journey is important."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Would a mile or two make much difference?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You would have to take the distance off at the
other end. The economy of travel in the North is
sternly simple, and transport's the main difficulty.
You can travel a fixed distance on a fixed quantity of
food, and how much you take depends on the skill and
number of your packers. Good men get good wages

and money does not go far. I want to save up as
many miles as possible for our prospecting."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I see," said Agatha. "Yet you stated that you
didn't think we would find the lode!" Then she gave
him a shrewd glance. "Aren't you a little impatient
to get on now?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I am," he admitted, turning to the south.
"There's a threat of thunder and I'd like to cross the
lake before the storm comes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha got up and in a few minutes they launched
the canoes. The heat was overwhelming and Agatha
felt no movement of the air, but the <em>Metis</em> sweated and
panted as they labored at the paddles. The thud of
the blades came back in measured echoes from the motionless
pines and a fan-shaped wake trailed far across
the glassy lake. In the meantime, the cloud bank
rolled up the sky like a ragged arch and covered the
sun. The glare faded and a thick, blue haze crept out
upon the water, until it looked as if the horizon advanced
to meet them, but the heat did not get less.
At the edge of the haze, an island loomed indistinctly
and by and by Thirlwell turned to Agatha.</p>

<p class="dgp">"There's a good beach behind the point and shelter
among the rocks," he said in a breathless voice.
"Would you like to stop?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"How long should we have to stop?"</p>

<p class="dgp">He looked up at the moving cloud, which was fringed
with ragged streamers.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I imagine we wouldn't get off again to-day."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then we'll go on," said Agatha.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell signed to the <em>Metis</em>, who had slackened
their efforts, and the foam swirled up at the bows as
they drove the paddles through the water.</p>
</div>



<hr class="page">

<div class="div">
<a name="toc_23"></a>
<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXII&mdash;Before The Wind</h3>

<p class="noindent">Soon after the island melted into the gloom, a
flash of lightning leaped from the cloud and spread
like a sheet of blue flame across the water. For a
second, Agatha saw black rocks and trees stand out
against an overwhelming glare, and then they vanished
and she saw nothing at all. Lightning is common
in Canada, but this had a terrifying brilliance
unlike any that she had known. While her dazzled
eyes recovered from the shock she was deafened by a
crash that rolled among the cloud-banks in tremendous
echoes, and before it died away another blaze leaped
down. It was rather a continuous stream of light
than a flash, because it did not break off but, beginning
overhead, ran far across the lake. The next enveloped
the canoes in an awful light and she felt her hair
crackle before the thunder came.</p>

<p class="dgp">She was too entranced to feel afraid, and glanced at
Thirlwell with half-closed eyes. His face was set
and his mouth shut tight, but he was paddling hard and
she heard the others' labored breath as they kept time
with him. The reason for their haste, however, was
not plain; the storm was terribly violent, but they
would be no safer in the woods than on the lake. Yet
it was obvious that they wanted to reach land.</p>

<p class="dgp">After a stunning crash, the thunder began to roll

away, the lightning glimmered fitfully farther off, and
a torrent of rain broke upon the canoes. Agatha was
wet before she could put on her slicker, and when she
sat, huddled together, with head bent to shield her
face from the deluge, she could not see fifty yards in
front. The water was pitted by the rain, which rebounded
from its surface with angry splashes. It ran
down the half-breeds' faces and soaked their gray
shirts, but they did not stop paddling to put on their
coats. Agatha wondered with some uneasiness what
they thought was going to happen.</p>

<p class="dgp">The rain got lighter suddenly and a cold draught
touched her forehead. She saw Thirlwell glance
astern, although he did not miss a stroke. His soaked
hat drooped about his head and his thin overalls were
dripping; she thought he saw she was looking at him,
but he did not speak. Then the haze that had shut
them in rolled back and a dark line advanced across the
lake. It had a white edge and there was a curious
humming, rippling noise that got louder. Thirlwell
signed to one of the <em>Metis</em>, who stepped a mast in the
hole through a beam and loosed a small sail. The
sail blew out like a flag, snapping violently, and the
man struggled hard to push up the pole that extended
its peak. Then he hauled the sheet, and the canoe
swayed down until her curving gunwale was in the
water. The half-breed moved to the other side and
Thirlwell beckoned Agatha.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Come aft by me!"</p>

<p class="dgp">She obeyed, although it was difficult to crawl over
the cargo in the bottom of the sharply slanted craft.
The humming noise had changed to a shriek, but it
did not drown the turmoil of the water. Short waves

with black furrows between them rolled up astern and
although they were not high they looked angry. Agatha
saw that Thirlwell wanted to trim the canoe. He
held a long paddle with the handle jambed against the
pointed stern, and the canoe's side rose out of the
water as she paid off before the wind.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We could do nothing with the paddles," he said.
"A sail's no use in a river-canoe, but these heavy
freighters run pretty well. Luckily it's a fair wind to
the river mouth."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha could scarcely hear him, but when she asked
how far it was he nodded as if he understood.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Three or four miles! Not much sweep for the
wind, but it will raise a nasty sea before we get there."</p>

<p class="dgp">Gazing at the driving clouds that blotted out the forest,
she tried to ask if he could find the river, but just
then the canoe rolled and the little spritsail swelled
like a balloon. There was a hiss and a splash, and the
top of a wave that split at the stern and rolled forward
poured in at the waist. Thirlwell bent over the paddle
and slackened the sheet, the canoe swung her bows out,
and leaped ahead. Spray blew about in showers; the
foam stood in a ridge amidships and boiled high about
the stern. It seemed to Agatha that they were traveling
like a toboggan, and she had an exhilarating sense
of speed that banished the thought of danger.</p>

<p class="dgp">"How fast are we going?" she shouted.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know. Five miles an hour, perhaps!"</p>

<p class="dgp">It sounded ridiculous; Agatha had felt as if they
were flying. Then she saw that skill was needed to
keep the canoe before the wind and Thirlwell ran two
risks. If he let the craft fall off too far, the sail would
swing across and she might be capsized by the shock;

if he let her swerve to windward, the following wave
would break on board and she would be swamped.
Thirlwell looked highly strung but very cool. A mistake
would have disastrous consequences; if he gave
way to the strain for a moment, the canoe would sink.
But she knew he would not give way, and it was comforting
to see that the half-breed shared her confidence.
He was, no doubt, a <em>voyageur</em> from his boyhood,
but it was plain that he did not want to take the
steering paddle.</p>

<p class="dgp">Sometimes, when a savage gust screamed about
them and whipped up the spray in clouds, Thirlwell
let the sheet run round a pin; sometimes he sank the
paddle deep and she saw its handle bend and the blood
flush his face. Drops of sweat ran down his forehead,
but his glance was fixed and calm. The strain
on brain and muscle braced without exciting him; he
seemed to accept it as something to which he was used.
He could be trusted in an emergency, and for some
obscure reason she was glad to feel he was the man
she had thought.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then she watched the other canoe, which had
dropped astern. The <em>Metis</em> had set their sail, but she
was not running well. She swerved when she lifted
with the waves and rolled until it looked as if she
would capsize. Now and then a sea broke over the
gunwale and a crouching half-breed desperately threw
out the water. Another sat on a beam in the high
stern and his pose was strangely tense. But for all
Agatha's trust in Thirlwell, it was daunting to watch
the laboring craft and the seas that threatened to
swamp her. They looked worse when one saw their

hollow fronts and raging crests, and Agatha fixed her
eyes ahead.</p>

<p class="dgp">The haze was thinning and now and then the blurred
outline of trees broke through; but one belt of forest
looked like another and she speculated with some uneasiness
about the chance of Thirlwell's finding the
river. If he did not find it, they would run some risk,
because the men could not paddle to windward and the
canoes might be smashed on a steep, rocky beach.
They ran on, and sometimes the trees got plainer and
sometimes vanished, but at length, when a savage gust
rolled the haze away, Agatha saw an unbroken line of
rocks and foam. It looked very forbidding and she
wondered what Thirlwell would do.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sit as far as you can to windward," he shouted,
and while she awkwardly obeyed the half-breed got up
on the side of the canoe.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha understood what this meant. Thirlwell had
missed the river mouth and meant to skirt the coast,
but when he tried to do so the wind would be abeam
and its power to heel the canoe largely increased. So
far, they had run before the gale, but to bring the
craft's side to it was a different thing.</p>

<p class="dgp">She set her lips as she watched Thirlwell haul the
spritsail sheet. He was cautious and for a few moments
brought the craft's head up with the paddle and
kept the small sail fluttering. Then he let her go and
she lurched down until her side amidships was in the
water. To Agatha's surprise, not much came on
board; it looked as if they were going too fast and the
lee bow was the dangerous spot. In the plunges, the
waves boiled up there, and one could feel the canoe

tremble as she lurched over the tumbling foam. Then
Agatha noted that Thirlwell was not steering with the
gale quite abeam; he was edging the craft to windward
as far as he could, but the beach got nearer and
it was plain that they were drifting sideways while
they forged ahead. Agatha began to doubt if he could
keep them off the rocks.</p>

<p class="dgp">He did not look disturbed. His glance was fixed to
windward and his movements were strangely quick.
Agatha saw that he kept the canoe from capsizing by
the skilful use of paddle and sheet. When the craft
could not stand the pressure he let the sail blow slack,
and then hauled the sheet again, dipping his paddle to
help her over a breaking wave. Sound judgment was
plainly needed and the man must instantly carry out
the decision he made. Handling a canoe in a breaking
sea demanded higher qualities than Agatha had
thought. She was getting anxious, for the rocks were
nearer and one could see the angry surges sweep in
tongues of foam far up their sides. It was surprising
that such a sea could rise on a small lake. She
could swim, but not much, and shrank from crawling
out, half-drowned and draggled, from the surf; for
one thing, Thirlwell would see her. She admitted
that this was illogical and she ran worse risks, but it
troubled her. A few moments afterwards, Thirlwell
changed his course with a thrust of the paddle and
slacked the sheet.</p>

<p class="dgp">"All right now!" he shouted. "We'll find smooth
water in a hundred yards."</p>

<p class="dgp">A steep rock, washed by spouting foam, detached
itself from the others and a narrow channel opened
up between it and the beach. Agatha thought it

looked horribly dangerous, but Thirlwell headed for
the gap. They lurched through on the top of a curling
wave, and she saw the mouth of the river behind
the rock. The current rose in crested ridges where
it met the wind, but the ridges were smaller than the
waves on the lake and gradually sank to splashing
ripples as the canoe ran up stream between dark walls
of forest. The trees did not cut off the wind, which
followed the channel, and by and by Thirlwell looked
at Agatha.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We have made a good run, but it isn't often one
gets a fair wind like this, and poling against the stream
is slow work. Still we'll stop and pitch camp when
you like."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Shall we save a day for our prospecting if we go
on until dark?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Thirlwell, "we'll certainly gain a day."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha was cold and wet and cramped. She longed
to stop, but it was important to save time and she
wanted Thirlwell to see that she had pluck.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then go on as far as you can," she replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">She had half expected the <em>Metis</em> to grumble, but
they did not. It looked as if Thirlwell had carefully
chosen his men, and she found out later that no fatigue
she could bear troubled them. After a time, the wind
dropped as they ran round a bend, and getting close to
the high bank, they began to pole. At dusk they ran
the canoe aground on a sheltered beach, and Agatha
landed, feeling very tired and cold. When supper was
over and they sat by the fire she did not want to talk,
and, going to her tent, soon fell asleep.</p>

<p class="dgp">Next day they poled against the current and paddled,
in bright sunshine, across a lake. At noon they

camped among short junipers, and the next morning
carried the empty canoes, upside down, across a rocky
point. It cost twelve hours' labor, relaying the loads,
to make the portage, and then they launched upon another
lake. After two more days they left the canoes,
covered with fir-branches, on a beach, and pushed inland.
A narrow trail led them across a high divide,
seamed by deep gullies, where stunted pines and
juniper grew among the rocks, and they portaged the
loads by stages, carrying part for an hour or two, and
then going back. Agatha was surprised to see how
much a man could carry with the help of properly adjusted
straps.</p>

<p class="dgp">When the divide was crossed they found two canoes
by the bank of a small creek, down which they drifted
with the swift current. Then there was a chain of
lakes, veiled in mist and rain, and after making a
portage they reached a wider stream. They followed
it down through tangled woods and when they camped
late one evening, Agatha sat silent by the fire, trying
to retrace their journey and speculating about what
lay ahead. For the most part, her memory was
blurred, and hazy pictures floated through her mind
of lonely camps among the boulders and small pine-trunks,
of breathless men dragging the canoes up angry
rapids, and carrying heavy loads across slippery
rocks. Their track across the wilderness was marked
by little heaps of ashes and white chips scattered about
fallen trees.</p>

<p class="dgp">But some of the memories were sharp; there was the
evening she found Thirlwell carrying her belongings
a double stage in order that she might have all she

needed when they camped. He panted as he leaned
against a tree and his face and hair were wet; she felt
moved but angry that he had exhausted himself for
her. She did not want him to think she knew what
her comfort cost and was willing to let him buy it at
such a price. She remembered that she had begun
to speculate rather often about what he thought.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then there was the morning they saw a half-covered
rock a few yards off in the foam of a furious rapid.
She had tried to brace herself for the shock, expecting
next moment to be thrown into the water, but Thirlwell
with a sweep of the paddle ran the canoe past.
So far, he had never failed in an emergency, and she
felt that she could not have chosen a better guide and
companion. He was resourceful and overcame difficulties;
he seemed to know when she would sooner be
quiet and when she liked to talk. They had talked
much beside the camp-fires, and although he was not
clever, she remembered what he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">But she had something else to think about that gave
her a sense of loss and a poignant melancholy. Indeed,
she had forced her mind to dwell upon the other
matters in order to find relief, and she was glad when
Thirlwell broke the silence.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We ought to make the Shadow by to-morrow
noon, and the mine in the evening."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think we go down the Grand Rapid before we
reach the mine?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made a sign of agreement, and after a
moment's hesitation she gave him a quick glance.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder if you know what day to-morrow is? I
mean the associations it has for me?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"Yes," he said in a sympathetic voice. "I thought
you would sooner not talk about it; but I remember.
In a way, it's curious you should be here now."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," she said, "I wanted to be in the North when
the day came round, but I did not imagine I should go
down the rapid in the evening. It was in the evening
the canoe capsized!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Dusk was falling; the smoke of a bush fire blew
across the river, and there was a moon."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The moon will be out to-morrow," Agatha said
quietly. "It is strange; I couldn't have arranged that
things should happen like this!"</p>

<p class="dgp">She paused for some moments and then resumed:
"Perhaps it is ridiculous, but I imagine now I am
going to find the lode. The doubts I started with
have gone; I feel calmly confident."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell noted the emotional tremble in her voice
and thought he had better use some tact.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I must see the load that got wet is properly put
up," he said, and moved back into the shadow; but
Agatha sat still, watching the smoke curl among the
dark trunks.</p>

<p class="dgp">She had not exaggerated, for a feeling of quiet confidence
had been getting stronger all day. There was
no obvious reason for it and the difficulties she must
overcome were greater than she had thought; but she
felt that she would succeed. After all, her father had
loved her best, she was making the search for his sake,
and when she reached the scene of his efforts she would
find some help. The hope was, of course, illogical
and she was a teacher of science; but it was unshakable
and comforted her. Then she mused about her
father's life in the wilds. Something had happened to

him, for she had noted Thirlwell's reserve. Perhaps
bitter disappointment had broken him down; she did
not know and would not ask. It was enough that he
had loved her; she was satisfied with this.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXIII&mdash;Strange's Legacy</h3>

<p class="noindent">It was afternoon when the canoes slid out from the
forest on to the broad expanse of the Shadow
River. The day was calm and hot, although the sky
was covered with soft gray clouds, that subdued the
light. The river had shrunk, for the driftwood on
the bank stood high above the water level, and Thirlwell
had only known it sink so low during the summer
when Strange was drowned. For all that, the current
ran fast and the long rows of pines rolled swiftly
back to meet the canoes as they floated down. The
trees had lost their rigid outline and melted gently into
the blue distance, while the savage landscape was softened
by the play of tender light and shadow.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha was glad that Thirlwell did not talk and
thought he knew she wanted to be quiet. This was
a day she set apart from other days when it came
round, for it was in the evening her father's canoe
capsized. Since they drifted out on the Shadow, she
had followed the track of his last voyage, and wondered
with poignant tenderness what he had thought
and felt. Somehow she did not believe he had come
back embittered by disappointment, and it was perhaps
strange that she did not feel sad. Indeed, she felt
nothing of the shrinking she had feared. Although
her eyes filled now and then, her mood was calm, and
sorrow had yielded to a gentle melancholy.</p>


<p class="dgp">In the meantime, the current swept them on, past
rippling eddies and rings of foam about half-covered
rocks, and presently a gray trail of smoke stretched far
along the bank. Thirlwell said the woods were burning;
they often burned in summer, though nobody knew
how the fires were lighted. By degrees the trees got
dimmer, but the water shone with a pale gleam and
presently the moon came out between drifting clouds.
Then as they swept round a bend a throbbing Agatha
had heard for some time got suddenly loud and she
glanced at Thirlwell.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The Grand Rapid," he said. "The water's very
low; it's quite safe."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha knew he did not think she was afraid; he
had tactfully pretended to misunderstand her glance,
and she fixed her eyes ahead. The shadows were
deeper and the forest was indistinct, but it was not
dark. Besides, the moon was getting bright and threw
a glittering beam across the river. She could see for
some distance and not far in front the water was furrowed
and marked by lines of foam. The stream ran
very fast and the throbbing swelled into a deep, sullen
roar. There was a smell of burning, and now and
then a trail of smoke drifted out from the bank, beyond
which a red glow glimmered against the sky. It
was like this, she thought, on that other evening when
her father returned from his last journey, but the melancholy
she had felt had given way to a strange emotional
excitement. Somehow she knew the pilgrimage
she had made for his sake would end as she had
hoped.</p>

<p class="dgp">For all that, she set her lips and grasped the side of
the canoe when they came to the top of the rapid.

Spray that looked like steam rolled across the water,
blurring the tops of the crested waves that ran back
as far as one could see, and here and there in the
smooth black patches a wedge of foam boiled behind
a rock. Outside the furious mid-stream rush of the
current, dark eddies revolved in angry circles and
their backwash weltered along the bank. Thirlwell
seemed to be steering for this belt and Agatha thought
he meant to run down through the slack. As they
swerved towards the rocks she looked round sharply,
for there was a shout from the canoe astern&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>Voici qui ven!</em>"</p>

<p class="dgp">An indistinct figure scrambled along the rough bank,
turning and twisting among the driftwood and boulders.
For the most part, the bank was in shadow,
but in places where the trees were not so thick the
moonlight pierced the gloom.</p>

<p class="dgp">"But he run!" exclaimed the <em>Metis</em> in Thirlwell's
canoe. "Lak' caribou, <em>vent' a terre</em>."</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>Pren' garde!</em>" said Thirlwell warningly, and
thrust hard with his paddle as the canoe drove past a
foam-lapped rock.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It is the chase he make," the half-breed resumed,
and another figure came out of the gloom, a short distance
in front of the one they had seen.</p>

<p class="dgp">The man moved feebly, stumbling now and then,
but it was obvious that he meant to keep ahead of his
pursuer. As he crossed a belt of moonlight one of the
<em>Metis</em> recognized him, for he cried: "<em>Steve le
sauage! Regardez moi l'ivrogne!</em>"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha thought the man was drunk. This would
account for his awkwardness, but as he turned and
staggered down the bank she saw him plainer and he

looked ill. He dragged himself along with an effort,
his gait was uneven, as if one leg was weak, but he
went on towards the water's edge. A moment later
he pushed off a canoe, made a few strokes with the
paddle, and then let her swing out with an eddy until
she was caught by the mid-stream rush. After this he
crouched in the stern and the craft began to drift
down the rapid. The other man stopped and threw
out his arms, as if he meant to protest that he could
do nothing more.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Father Lucien!" said Thirlwell. "Black Steve's
risking a capsize."</p>

<p class="dgp">They sped past the man upon the bank and Agatha
watched the crouching figure in the canoe. The craft
was a short distance in front of, but outside, theirs,
and she could see the danger of her being smashed or
swamped. It was plain that the only safe way down
was through the slack along the bank, but the man
made no effort to reach this smoother belt. He let
the paddle trail in the water while the canoe rocked
among the angry waves. His rashness fascinated
Agatha and she could not look away, although she
knew she might see him drown.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Can't you do something?" she asked Thirlwell.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," he said sternly. "We're loaded and would
be swamped. Steve's drunk and must take his
chance."</p>

<p class="dgp">A few moments later the canoe in front plunged
down a furious rush of the current, lurched up on a
white wave, rolled over, and vanished. Agatha
trembled, and felt cold, and the <em>Metis</em> shouted:
"<em>V'la! C'en est fait&mdash;</em>"</p>

<p class="dgp">A black object that looked like a head rose from

the racing foam and Agatha turned to Thirlwell imperiously&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">"Go and help him."</p>

<p class="dgp">He hesitated and she knew it was on her account.
Then he lifted his paddle.</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>Au secour!</em>"</p>

<p class="dgp">The canoe swerved, swung out from the slack, and
plunged into the foam. She lifted her bows high out
of the water while a white ridge rolled up astern, and
for the next minute or two Agatha saw nothing clearly.
Spray beat upon her, whipping her face; she had a
confused sense of furious speed, but felt that the
canoe was controlled. Water splashed on board; the
<em>Metis</em> bent forward and his shoulders moved in savage
jerks. Behind them, the other canoe plunged
down the rapid, rather bounding than sliding from
wave to wave. In front, the black shape of the overturned
craft washed to and fro like a drifting log.
Thirlwell shouted as they sped past a rock, the canoe
was swung violently sideways, and they were out of
the main rush. There was an eddy behind the rock
and the water ran round in white-lined rings. The
moonlight fell across the center and Agatha saw a
man's dark head.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell backed his paddle and as they swept round
in a semi-circle the <em>Metis</em> stretched out his arm. They
were very near the man in the water and when he
spun round like a cork in the revolving backwash the
moonlight touched his wet face. Agatha, leaning
over the side, saw that he was the man who had broken
into Farnam's house. The half-breed missed him and
he looked up at her as the canoe shot past. He was
so close that she could almost touch him, and she saw

a look of fear in his staring eyes. Then, without
making an effort to reach the canoe, he slipped under
Thirlwell's hand and sank.</p>

<p class="dgp">The canoe turned and an indistinct object broke the
surface. It vanished, the canoe was swept back to
the edge of the main rush, and for a minute or two
Thirlwell and the half-breed struggled desperately.
When they reached the slack again, there was nothing
but angry water and racing foam. The man had
gone and Agatha shivered and felt faint.</p>

<p class="dgp">After that she had a hazy impression of streaming
woods and flying belts of gloom as they swept down
through the slack, until they drove out upon the tail-pool.
For some minutes Thirlwell and the half-breeds
battled with the eddies, and then they floated
on smoothly and a light began to twinkle among the
pines.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell steered for the bank and Scott and some
of the miners met them at the landing. Agatha was
glad to leave the canoe, for her nerves were badly
jarred.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell presented Scott, who took them to the
shack, which looked as if it had been recently cleaned.
He said Agatha must make use of it for a day or two,
and he and Thirlwell would find a berth in the store-shed.
Then they began to talk about the accident and
Scott said, "Driscoll came back from the bush, looking
ill, a week since and shut himself up in his shack.
One of the boys told Father Lucien, who went along
to look after him and found him very sick. That's
all I know."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha asked a few questions and then told them
about the burglary.</p>


<p class="dgp">"I am sure he was the man who opened my trunk,"
she said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" said Scott. "Do you think he knew you?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I believe he did. It's curious, but I thought he
was afraid."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps he was afraid," Scott agreed, with a
meaning look at Thirlwell, who got up.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I had better go to meet Father Lucien. He'll
come down to the landing after us."</p>

<p class="dgp">He found the missionary hurrying along the bank,
and stopping him, sat down.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Driscoll's gone; we did our best to pick him up,"
he remarked and related what had happened. "We
may find him in the tail-pool to-morrow, but I imagine
he'll be washed away down river, like his victim."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you think Strange was his victim?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can't doubt it now. But how did Steve get out
of the shack?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps that was my fault, but he had been delirious
for a day and night; and in the afternoon, when
he was calmer, I went to sleep. One is apt to sleep
too long when one is tired. When I wakened he was
not in bed and a whisky bottle I had taken from him
was nearly empty. I think he must have disturbed me
as he moved about, because when I went outside I saw
him making for the river. I ran, but I came too late,
and you know the rest."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are not to blame," said Thirlwell. "You
have twice taken pity on a man who tried to starve
you. He meant you to die of hunger the night he
stole into your camp."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He is dead. One must be charitable. What
would he gain by leaving me to die?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"Don't you know?" Thirlwell asked. "We can
talk frankly now the matter has been taken out of our
hands. When he got better after the first attack, the
time I kept watch with you, he had probably some remembrance
of his ravings. Anyhow, I expect he remembered
he'd got a fright and may have talked. He
thought you knew too much."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's possible," said Father Lucien, very quietly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell was silent for a few moments and then
resumed: "I hesitated about going to his help. We
were heavily loaded, the risk was great, and I thought
Miss Strange's life worth more than his. She made
me go and I believe I could have saved him, but he
saw her and let himself sink. She declares he looked
afraid!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It is very strange."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't find it strange," said Thirlwell. "There's
a touch of dramatic justice about the thing that appeals
to me. I suppose you know what day it is? <em>Driscoll
knew</em>."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien shook his head. "What is one day
more than another, when all wrongs are put right and
crimes punished in the end? Justice is not theatrical,
but the obstinate offender cannot escape." He paused
and then resumed: "Well, we shall never know all
that happened, and as you have said, the matter is no
longer in our hands. Perhaps for the girl's sake&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Thirlwell, "she has borne enough.
You can imagine the shock she'd get if we found out,
and had to tell her. The thing's done with. It's
some relief to feel that my responsibility has gone."</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien made a sign of agreement. "I will
come to see her to-morrow," he said, but Thirlwell

knew that Agatha would never learn from him that
Strange's canoe had not been accidentally capsized.</p>

<p class="dgp">Early next morning Thirlwell went to the tail-pool,
but nothing except some driftwood washed about in
the eddy. The latter had worn out a deep hollow and
he scrambled over the rocks in order to look down
into its revolving depths. There was nothing there,
and when going back he made his way across some
worn slabs that had been covered until the water sank
to an unusually low level. By and by he stopped at
the edge of a pool. A small round object that was
not the color of the stones lay at the bottom.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell knelt down and rolling up his sleeve got
the object out. It was made of white metal that had
tarnished but not corroded, and looked like an old-fashioned
pocket tobacco-box. The thing was well
made, for he could hardly find the joint of the lid and
below the latter there was some engraving. He rubbed
it with a little fine sand and then started as he read a
name. It was Strange's tobacco-box and a light
dawned on him.</p>

<p class="dgp">He knew now why Driscoll had haunted the reefs
when the water was low, and thought he knew what
was inside the box. This was the thing Strange <em>had
taken with him</em>. But Driscoll had looked in the wrong
place. The box was heavy, but perhaps a flood had
rolled it down the rapid, or it had fallen from Strange's
pocket when the stream washed his rotting clothes
away.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell shook the box and something rattled inside,
after which he noted a dark smear round the
edge of the lid. He scraped this with his knife and
thought the stuff was a waterproof gum the freighters

used to caulk their canoes. It looked as if Strange had
carefully made the joint watertight, and Thirlwell's
curiosity was strongly excited, but the box was not his.
It was too early to look for Agatha, and he waited
with some impatience until she came out of the shack
and sat down in the sunshine after breakfast.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think this was your father's," he said, putting
the box in her hand, and told her how he had found
it.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha started. "Yes; I gave it him on his birthday
long since. It was bright then; old English pewter,
I think. I saw it in a little store where they sold
curiosities, and had it engraved."</p>

<p class="dgp">Somewhat to Thirlwell's annoyance, Scott came up
with Father Lucien, whom he presented to Agatha,
but she did not put the box away.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mr. Thirlwell found this in the river, but the lid
is fast," she said. "Will somebody help me to open
it?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott took the box into the shack, where he had some
tools, and brought it back with the lid just raised
above its socket. He gave it to Agatha and was going
away when she stopped him.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I would like you and Father Lucien to wait. You
knew my father, and I think there is something important
in the box."</p>

<p class="dgp">They came nearer and, pressing back the lid, she
shook out a few small stones.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Specimens!" she said in a strained voice, holding
out two or three to Thirlwell. "Don't you think
they're very like the piece I gave you?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell examined the stones and handed them to
Scott, who nodded.</p>


<p class="dgp">"This stuff and the specimen Thirlwell showed me
came from the same vein."</p>

<p class="dgp">"There's something else," Agatha resumed, taking
out a folded paper. Her hand shook as she opened it
and the tears gathered in her eyes. Then she gave
Thirlwell the paper.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Will you read it for me? I can't see very well."</p>

<p class="dgp">The paper was spotted with mildew, torn at the bottom,
and cut at the folds, but holding it carefully, he
read&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>The Agatha Mine</em>; frontage on the lode staked by
Gordon Strange."</p>

<p class="dgp">Compass bearings, calculated distances, and landmarks
were given next, and then the writing stopped
an inch or two from the bottom of the sheet.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your father found the lode," Thirlwell said, very
quietly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha looked up with a curious smile. "Yes; I
feel as if he had <em>sent</em> me this. I have come into my
inheritance and it is easier than I thought!" She
paused and added: "Once or twice I was afraid and
nearly let it go."</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXIV&mdash;Agatha Resumes Her Journey</h3>

<p class="noindent">There was silence for a minute or two after
Agatha had spoken, and then Father Lucien
said, "Now we know what Driscoll looked for. Few
secrets can be kept."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell gave him a warning glance that Agatha
did not note. She was gazing across the river, her
face towards the North, as if she had forgotten the
others, but she presently roused herself.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Can we start to-morrow?" she asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Thirlwell firmly, "you must rest for
two or three days, and there are a number of things to
be got."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't think I can rest until I have seen the lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You will have to try. It may be some time yet
before we find the spot. For one thing, the directions
aren't complete. You see they stop&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha took the paper. "Yes; I hadn't noticed
that. It begins very clearly and then breaks off. I
wonder why."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell said nothing. It looked as if Strange had
been interrupted; the shakiness of the last few lines
hinted that they had been written in haste. There
was a space between the last and the bottom of the
paper. Perhaps Driscoll had joined him and he had
distrusted the man, who might have come into the
camp while he was writing. Then, when he afterwards

sealed the box, he had forgotten that he had
not finished what he meant to say; but, if the supposition
were correct, this was not remarkable.
Strange might have taken some liquor with him. But
Agatha must not suspect.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The paper states the claim was staked," she resumed.
"So far as that goes, it makes the ore mine.
George must have a share, but I mean to work the
lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm afraid it doesn't go very far," Scott remarked.
"The law requires that the discoverer stakes off the
ground he is entitled to and then registers the claim
at the nearest record office. After this he must do
a certain amount of development work before he gets
his patent and becomes the owner of the mine. The
claim has not been recorded yet."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No; it has lapsed," Agatha agreed. "This means
that any adult British citizen may make a re-discovery
record. Well, we must do so, as soon as we can."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Developing a mine is rough work for a woman."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled. "There's something about the discoverer
being allowed to appoint a deputy, and perhaps
Mr. Thirlwell will look after my interests. But
won't you see about getting us all that he thinks needful?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'll see about it now," said Scott, who took Thirlwell
away, but stopped when they were hidden by the
pines.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Strange has given you a useful clue, but that's
all," he said. "You'll find the lode if you find the
valley, but you may look for a long time."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made a sign of agreement. "Yes; there's
something curiously elusive about this ore."</p>


<p class="dgp">"All the same, it's certainly worth a proper search;
but you'll need a large quantity of truck and one or
two extra packers. I understand Miss Strange insists
upon everything being done at her cost. Has she money
enough?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think not."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You know she has not! Looks as if you had
forgotten you showed me her letter when she stated
the sum. It's hard to see how it covers expenses up
to date."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell looked embarrassed and Scott laughed.
"You seem to have been generous, particularly as you
didn't believe in the lode; but anything you have saved
from your wages won't carry you far. Well, you can
take the truck and tools you need, and I'll give you
two of the boys. Miss Strange can pay me when she
gets her patent, or, if she likes, I'll butt in on a partnership
basis and run my risk. She can decide which
line she'll take after she locates the ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thanks; I'll take the truck," said Thirlwell.</p>

<p class="dgp">He knew Scott wanted to help him and not to gain
something for himself, but it might be an advantage
for Agatha to make an arrangement with him when
she owned the mine.</p>

<p class="dgp">"There's another thing," Scott went on. "Since
the Clermont isn't paying, I might lend you to Miss
Strange if you were anxious to undertake the development
work, but the law doesn't require very much
of this. What are you going to do when the patent's
granted?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made an abrupt movement. Until that
morning he had doubted if Agatha would find the vein,
but he was forced to admit the possibility of her doing

so. When the vein was proved and she owned
the claim she would no longer need him as she needed
him now; nor would he be able to neglect his duties
and follow her about as unpaid adviser.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know what I'm going to do. I haven't
thought about it yet."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Miss Strange must have a manager. If you're
willing to undertake the job, I daresay I could let you
go. Then, if she wouldn't sooner trust her judgment,
I think I could give you a pretty good character."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Thirlwell sharply, and stopped. He
suspected that Scott was amused, and it jarred him to
think of becoming Agatha's hired servant.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Scott, with a twinkle, "exploring the
bush with a charming girl is no doubt very pleasant
while the summer lasts, but it doesn't lead to much.
In fact, so far as I know your views, it leads to nothing.
Anyhow, I must see what we have in the store
that would be useful."</p>

<p class="dgp">He went away and Thirlwell, after sitting still for
some minutes with a frown, got up and moodily followed
the trail to the river bank. Scott had shown
him that his friendship with Agatha could not continue
on the lines it ran on now. In a way, he had
for some time recognized this, but it was not until he
found the tobacco-box the truth became overwhelmingly
plain. Their pleasant relations must either
come to an end very shortly or be built up again on a
new foundation, and the first was unthinkable. He
walked along the bank until he got calmer and then
went back to examine a canoe he meant to caulk.
After all, the lode was not found yet.</p>

<p class="dgp">They stayed three days at the mine, while their outfit

was got ready; and when Drummond was not at
work he followed Agatha about. He said he liked
the woods, spoke of his employers with frank appreciation,
and declared that he was grateful because she
had got him his post. Besides this, he made no secret
of a humble devotion to herself that she sometimes
found embarrassing and sometimes amusing.
On the evening before they left the mine, he joined
the group outside the shack.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Scott, rather dryly, "what do you
want?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Miss Strange pulls out for the North to-morrow,
and if she'll take me I'm going along."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Wait a moment," Scott said to Agatha, and then
asked Drummond: "Why do you want to go?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I mean to get even with Stormont; and I want to
put Miss Strange as wise as I can."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then we are to understand you expect nothing for
the job?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond's black eyes sparkled. "You're my
boss, so far, but I won't stand for being guyed. It's
not <em>your</em> money I'm after."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps the rejoinder's justifiable," Father Lucien
remarked, smiling; and Drummond turned to
Agatha with a touch of dignity.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I meant to make my pile by selling the ore to somebody,
but you treated me like a white man, and I guess
the lode belongs to you. Well, if I help you get rich
and you want to give me something, I won't refuse,
but I'm not out for money. Say, you'll let me go?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Can you help?" Scott interrupted. "If you can,
it looks as if you had kept something back when you
made the other deal."</p>


<p class="dgp">Drummond grinned. "I kept something back from
Stormont; when I put him wise I put him off the
track. But I'm playing straight with Miss Strange
and Thirlwell. You can bet on me!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then we'll take you," said Agatha, with a deprecatory
glance at Thirlwell.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You're not going to be sorry about it," Drummond
declared, and when he went away Agatha turned
to Father Lucien.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's your business to judge men's character: do
you think I have done well?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I imagine the lad will make good. He has two
incentives: he likes you, and hates your adversary."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," said Agatha, smiling, "I wonder which is
the stronger!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Father Lucien spread out his hands and his eyes
twinkled. "I am a priest, Miss Strange, and must
admit that I cannot tell. You have won the young
man's confidence; but his is a primitive nature, and
hate counts for much."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are an honest man," said Agatha. "After
all, the truth is better than compliments."</p>

<p class="dgp">The party broke up soon afterwards, and early next
morning Agatha left the mine with Thirlwell, Drummond,
and a white rock-borer as well as the half-breed
packers. They poled up the Shadow for some distance,
and then followed a small creek, tracking the
canoes, which were heavily loaded. Indeed, when
they carried the freight by relays across the portages,
Agatha was surprised to note the quantity of tools
and stores. Since the cost of transport made such
things dear, it looked as if Thirlwell had made her
money go a long way.</p>


<p class="dgp">As they pushed on the country got wilder. The
rocks were more numerous, the trees smaller, and in
places they crossed wide belts where fires had raged.
The flames had burned off the branches, but left the
trunks, and the long rows of rampikes sprang from the
new brush, shining a curious silver-gray where they
caught the light. The mode of travel, however, did
not change. Sometimes they paddled up sparkling
lakes, and sometimes dragged the canoes over ledges
and gravel-beds in shallow creeks until the water
shrunk and they made a laborious portage across a
rocky height.</p>

<p class="dgp">The journey was made as much by land as water,
and at first Agatha wondered that the men were
capable of such toil, but by degrees she found that she
could carry more than she had thought, and laughing
at Thirlwell's protests, often struggled through the
brush with a heavy load. The hot sunshine that
lasted so long, and the freshness that followed when
the shadows deepened, calmed and strengthened her.
She felt braced in mind and body; her doubts and impatience
had gone. She was quietly confident that
they would find the ore.</p>

<p class="dgp">But they did not find it, and at length the time Agatha
had allowed herself came to an end. It was possible
that she had already lost her post at the school,
but if not and she wanted to keep it, she must return
at once.</p>

<p class="dgp">She did not, however, mean to give up the
search while their food held out and there was no
shortage yet, perhaps because the half-breeds often
went fishing and gathered wild berries. Then one
hot day, when they nooned beside a shining lake and

she sat in the shade of a boulder, she heard the men
talking.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The summer she is good," a <em>Metis</em> remarked.
"Me, I lak' better make the prospect than the freight.
<em>Chercher l'argent, c'est le bo' jeu!</em>"</p>

<p class="dgp">"We haven't struck much argent yet," said the
white miner. "I wonder what the boss thinks and
guess he's up against something. Walked past at an
awkward piece on the last portage as if he didn't see
me, with his forehead wrinkled up. Seen him look
like that when he reckoned the roof was coming down
on us."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha's curiosity was excited, because she thought
she had noted a subtle difference in Thirlwell's manner.
There was a hint of reserve, and sometimes he
looked disturbed. Then Drummond interrupted his
companion.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can't tell what the boss thinks when he
doesn't want, and we're certainly going to find the
lode."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'd like to see you strike it all right, because if you
don't, you're going to be some dollars out," the miner
replied. "Don't know who's paying for this outfit,
but I'd put it pretty high."</p>

<p class="dgp">"What d'you reckon it cost?" Drummond asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">The miner made a calculation and Agatha listened
with strained interest as he enumerated the different
items.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Drummond, "I can't value the tools
and powder, but allowing for transport, you've got the
stores nearly right. Anyhow, I'm going swimming.
If Pierre will give me ten yards, I'll race him to the
island."</p>


<p class="dgp">They went away and Agatha sat still with a hot
face. She had trusted Thirlwell and he had deceived
her; her money had soon been exhausted and the journey
was now being made at his expense. She felt as
if she had been robbed of something to which she had
a sacred right; she had let a stranger undertake the
task that was peculiarly hers. Then she had been
cheated so easily. Thirlwell must think her a fool,
or perhaps that she was willing to be deceived.</p>

<p class="dgp">Getting calmer, she admitted that his object was
good. He wanted to help, but it was unthinkable that
she should trade upon his generosity. She resolved
to talk to him about it, but he had gone into the bush
to look for the best line across the neck between them
and another lake. When he came back the men were
unloading the canoes and he occupied himself with
making up the packs.</p>

<p class="dgp">They had camped and eaten supper before her opportunity
came, and then as they sat by the water's
edge she told him what she had heard. He listened
quietly until she asked: "Was the man's calculation
correct?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Nearly so. He was rather above the mark."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I am in your debt?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Does that hurt?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha, with some hesitation, "in a
way, it hurts very much. I don't mean that it's embarrassing
to take your help, though it <em>is</em> embarrassing.
You see, I felt I must find the lode myself; it's my
duty, and you have taken away the satisfaction I might
have felt. Besides, you cheated me."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell was silent for a few moments, and then
said: "I'm sorry you find it hard to let me help, but

unless I had done so you couldn't have gone far."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You should have been frank and let me wait."</p>

<p class="dgp">"For another year? The North is no place for a
white woman after the rivers freeze."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha said nothing. She had not thought about
this, and it would have been very hard to wait until
summer came again.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," he resumed, "I cheated you, because I
could see no other plan. I think you have waited too
long. If you had gone on thinking about nothing
but the lode, it would have done you harm."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Did it harm my father?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Thirlwell quietly, and Agatha dared
ask nothing more. Besides she knew that he would
not tell her much.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Now," he went on, "I have owned my fault; but
you're rather taking it for granted that my object was
altogether unselfish. After all, the law only gives you
so much frontage on the vein, and there's nothing to
prevent my staking off a claim on the rest."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That is so," said Agatha. "But the paper states
that my father claimed the edge of the cliff, where, for
a time, the ore could be easily worked. As your block
would lie farther back, you would have to sink a shaft
and drive a tunnel. This would cost you much."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The cost wouldn't matter if the ore was rich. I
could get all the capital I wanted."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha gave him a quiet ironical smile. "Then you
really came with me because you meant to stake a
claim? That's curious, Mr. Thirlwell, because I think
you never believed my father found the lode at
all."</p>

<p class="dgp">He colored and hesitated. "We'll let it go; there's

something else. If you turn back now, can you reach
Toronto before the school reopens?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Agatha, with a soft, excited laugh. "I
did not mean to turn back until I was forced. When
I reached Toronto I should find somebody else had got
my post."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell noted her courage, although he thought
she was rash. "Wouldn't it be awkward? But I
suppose your brother&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I should not go to George. He is kind, but believes
I have inherited my father's illusion. He always
hated to hear him talk about the lode, and would
think I was properly punished for my folly. But I
needn't go on. You must understand&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't understand. The only thing I see is that
you're not logical. It's obvious now that you must,
if possible, find the ore; and yet you object to letting
me help. If you give up the search and return to
Toronto, it may be a very long time before you can
make another trip."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No, I suppose I'm not logical," Agatha admitted,
with a mocking smile. "Logic is perhaps a useful
guide for a <em>man</em>, but it doesn't always take him far.
However, I oughtn't to have expected you to understand,
and you're getting impatient&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Let's try to be practical," Thirlwell rejoined. "If
we turn back at once, some of the truck we haven't
used might be sold, and we would save the wages I
promised the boys, but all we have spent would be
thrown away. Well, I'd hate to feel that either of
us must bear a loss like that."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have heard George say that a good business man
cuts his losses."</p>


<p class="dgp">"It's sometimes a better plan to hold on and get
your money back."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But how can we get our money back if we can't
find the lode? You don't think we'll do so."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell frowned. "There's a chance of finding
it; a fighting chance. Now we're near the spot and
have the truck, let's play the chance for all it's worth.
You can pay me when you get your patent, or make
any plan you like. Then Scott really supplied the
stores and made some suggestions that I didn't mean
to talk about unless our search succeeded."</p>

<p class="dgp">He related what Scott had said, and added:
"Anyhow, let's go on for a fortnight. Then if you
insist, we'll take the back trail."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha gave him a quick glance and he thought
her eyes had softened, but she got up.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," she said, and went to her tent.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXV&mdash;The Broken Range</h3>

<p class="noindent">The fortnight Agatha agreed to had nearly gone
when, early one morning, Thirlwell and Drummond
climbed a hill behind the camp and stood on the
summit, looking about. Thin mist drifted across the
low ground in front, but some miles off a forest-covered
ridge rose against the sky. It was hardly a
range of hills, but rather what prospectors call a
height of land; a moderately elevated watershed
marking off two river basins. Running roughly east
and west as far as he could see, it limited Thirlwell's
view and had puzzled him for some days.</p>

<p class="dgp">Since the rivers that drained the country flowed
northeast to Hudson Bay, it was obvious that there
must be an opening in the ridge, but he had been unable
to find one. Moreover, as Strange's creek ran
south before it turned east, he imagined it was on his
side of the heighth of land, but he had seen no stream
flowing in either direction. Strange's notes were incomplete;
and although Thirlwell calculated that he
was about thirty miles from the spot where the ore
outcropped, he had found none of the landmarks. The
creek was not behind him, but a radius of thirty miles
would cover a wide belt of country, and he doubted if
he could persuade Agatha to extend the fortnight.
Her obstinacy was ridiculous, but must be reckoned on.</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by a faint breeze sprang up and the mist

rolled back. Here and there a lake sparkled in the
light of the rising sun and dark pines rose out of the
streaming vapor. But there was no glistening thread
to indicate a creek, and Thirlwell turned to Drummond
with an impatient frown.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Do you see anything that you think you ought to
recognize?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Drummond, rather sulkily, "I don't."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You haven't been of much use to us yet! I
think you stated that when you got here you'd recollect
all your father told you about Strange's talk.
Seeing the places would bring things back!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I haven't seen the places, and the old man was
very sick when he told me. Anyhow, I've tracked
your blamed canoes, and packed your stores across
the divides. Guess I'd have hit the back trail long
since if it wasn't for Miss Strange."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then we had better get down," said Thirlwell.
"The boys don't seem to have started to cook breakfast,
and I want to pull out soon."</p>

<p class="dgp">He was turning away when Drummond stopped
him, stretching out his arm. "Hold on! What's that
yonder?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mist," said Thirlwell, impatiently.</p>

<p class="dgp">"No; it's too dark. Look again!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell started. The mist was drifting past the
detached clump of pines his companion indicated, but
its color was silvery, and he now noted a faint blue
streak. This was something of a shock, for he had
thought there was nobody but his party in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Smoke!" he exclaimed. "Go down as fast as
you can and tell the boys not to make a fire."</p>


<p class="dgp">When Drummond went off Thirlwell sat down and
watched the smoke. It got plainer, and rose in a thick
blue cloud when the mist rolled away. Somebody
was cooking breakfast and the volume of smoke indicated
a large fire. It looked as if there were a number
of men to be fed, and Thirlwell had not expected
to find Indians near the spot just then. After a time,
the smoke died away and he went back to camp, but
told Agatha nothing about what he had seen. When
breakfast was over he took one of the <em>Metis</em> and
plunged into the bush. There was not much need for
caution, because the party would, no doubt, set off
when they had finished their meal, and if they were
Indians, it did not matter if he met them. But he did
not think they were Indians.</p>

<p class="dgp">When he had gone a mile or two, he stopped at
the edge of a muskeg and sent the <em>Metis</em> on to a clump
of pines on the other side. The man, keeping in the
shadow, stole round the swamp, and vanished noiselessly
in the underbrush. After a time, he reappeared,
beckoning, and Thirlwell knitted his brows when he
joined him.</p>

<p class="dgp">The ashes of a fire smoldered between two hearth-logs;
white chips and broken branches were scattered
about. Near his feet were six small round holes,
spaced in a regular pattern, and a cotton flour-bag and
some empty cans lay beneath a bush.</p>

<p class="dgp">"A white man's camp; they had a tent," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sure," agreed the <em>Metis</em>. "Teepee poles they not
mak' hole lak' dat."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, I reckon a sour-dough prospector wouldn't
have bothered about a tent. Looks as if one of them
was a tenderfoot. <em>Qu'en pense-tu?</em>"</p>


<p class="dgp">The <em>Metis'</em> keen eyes had wandered round the camp
and he nodded. "But, yes! Dat man <em>sait vivre</em>; he
lak' it comfortable."</p>

<p class="dgp">"A city man!" Thirlwell remarked, with a frown.
How many packers?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>Quat</em>," said the <em>Metis</em>.</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>Voyageurs?</em>"</p>

<p class="dgp">The <em>Metis</em> laughed scornfully as he indicated the
trampled brush, broken branches, greasy papers, and
scraps of food. "Me, I think no! Railroad outfit.
<em>Voyageur</em> not muss up camp lak' dat."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell agreed. A half-breed <em>voyageur</em> does not
waste food, and with inherited caution seldom disturbs
the bush. It looked as if the city man had engaged a
gang of track-layers, who are used to pioneering and
sometimes carry surveyors' stores through the wilds.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," he said, "we'll follow their trail."</p>

<p class="dgp">The party had obviously left the water for a time,
because their track led away from the creek in the
valley and the bush was too thick to permit the portaging
of canoes. Thirlwell followed the trail until
he satisfied himself that they were going east, and then
went back to his camp. Finding Agatha at the water's
edge he sat down opposite.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm afraid you didn't get much breakfast, but I
didn't want the fire lighted," he said, and told her what
he had seen.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah!" she cried. "Do you think Stormont is
looking for the ore?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think so; I'm not certain."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But he failed to find it once and nearly starved."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell smiled. "I understand the fellow's obstinate.

He may have got a fresh clue or found out
something we don't know."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Do you think he has been following us?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't. If he'd known we were in the neighborhood,
he would not have lighted a fire."</p>

<p class="dgp">"After all," said Agatha thoughtfully, "my father
stated that he had staked the claim."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm afraid that doesn't count for much. You're
not recognized as prospective owner until your record's
filed. I imagine your father's statement would
carry some weight, but going to law about a mine is
generally an expensive job, and it's hard to put up a
good fight against a man with capital."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then what are you going to do about it?" Agatha
asked anxiously.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Get away from here at once, and as far as possible
keep to the lakes; water carries no trail. Then
Stormont has decided a point that has been bothering
me&mdash;since he's gone east, we must go north or west."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes. Unless it's possible that his clue is better
than ours."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I thought about that," Thirlwell replied. "We
don't know if he has a clue, but we'll stick to ours
and take the risk. Your father's directions are plain
enough if we can find the first of his landmarks."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then go west," said Agatha. "I imagine the
creek is on this side of the range."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell got up and went to see the canoes launched,
but he wondered whether Agatha remembered that
there were only two or three days of the fortnight left.
He thought she did remember, but he resolved that
they would not turn back.</p>


<p class="dgp">Soon after they started, a fresh breeze sprang up
from the north-west and the shadows of flying clouds
sped across the lake. The sky between the clouds was
a curious vivid blue, the light was strong, and the
woods along the bank flashed into bright color and
faded to somber green as the gleams of sunshine
passed. For a few minutes, trunks and branches stood
out, sharply distinct, and then melted suddenly into
their background. By degrees the ripples that lined
the lake got larger; there was an angry splashing at the
bows of the canoes, and little showers of spray began
to fly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"This clearness means the wind will hold and it's
right ahead," Thirlwell said to Agatha, "We haven't
had much luck of late!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The luck will change," she answered, smiling.
"I am confident."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Confidence doesn't cost you much effort," Thirlwell
rejoined. "You were persuaded from the beginning
that you would find the ore. It looks as if you
were naturally optimistic."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, no! I had my weak moments when I wanted
to shirk. I hated to feel I wasn't free like other
people, and was willing to throw away my chance of
getting rich. But that wouldn't have helped much; I
couldn't get rid of the duty."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You have pluck. For all that, I think you're indulging
a rather exaggerated sentiment. Anyhow, it's
hard to imagine you have had many doubts since we
left the mine."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I've had none. When you found the tobacco-box
I knew I would succeed. There was something
strangely significant about your finding it."</p>


<p class="dgp">"I happened to look in the right place," said Thirlwell,
dryly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha laughed. "You take a very matter-of-fact
view."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps so," Thirlwell agreed. "If I were
steeped in sentiment, it wouldn't help me drive the
canoe faster against a head-wind or carry a heavier
load across a portage. That's a purely mechanical
proposition. In the meantime, we're slowing up and
will soon begin to drift astern."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then paddle," said Agatha, smiling. "After all,
you're much more of a sentimentalist than I think you
know."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell bent over his paddle and the canoe forged
ahead, but the breeze freshened, and the ripples
changed to crested waves. Agatha's face was wet, her
slicker dripped, and the men breathed hard between the
strokes. They labored on, and at noon ran the canoes
aground in the lee of a rocky island. Thirlwell ordered
the <em>Metis</em> to use nothing but dry driftwood,
which makes little smoke, for the fire, and when they
rested after a meal found Drummond sitting alone outside
the camp. He looked moody and his eyes were
fixed on the height of land.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Feeling bothered about something?" Thirlwell
asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Drummond. "I'm trying to get back
all the old man told me about Strange's tale. He only
talked about it once, when he was sick. Looks as if
he hadn't thought the lode a business proposition, and
I didn't <em>then</em>. Besides, I was anxious and didn't listen
much. Part of it came back afterwards, but not all.
There's something I can't get."</p>


<p class="dgp">"That's unlucky," Thirlwell remarked in a dry tone.
"We need a hint."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I reckoned I'd get it when I saw the country,"
Drummond went on. "I allow we're not far enough
yet."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made a sign of disagreement. "Strange
said the creek ran south and then turned east. I
imagine there isn't another neighborhood where that's
likely to happen. If we cross the divide, I expect
we'll find the water running north."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Drummond moodily, "you'd better
leave me alone. There's something&mdash;if I'm quiet, I
may get what I'm feeling for." He knitted his brows
and a curious fixed look came into his eyes. "I know
it's not far off, but I miss it when I'm just getting on
the track."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell left him and smiled half impatiently as
he went back across the rocks. He had sometimes
been puzzled, and sometimes amused, by Agatha's confidence,
and now Drummond, who had given him no
help so far, talked about an elusive clue. It looked
as if both allowed their imagination too much rein, and
trusted to vague feelings instead of their reasoning
powers. Give him a compass bearing, or a definite
base-line to calculate an angle from, and he would
engage to take the party to the required spot; but he
had frankly no use for the other thing. Yet he sometimes
wondered&mdash;there was a calm assurance in Agatha's
eyes. If this was not founded on superstition,
from what did it spring?</p>

<p class="dgp">They launched again in the afternoon, and reached
the head of the lake wet and tired. Thirlwell did not
talk much after supper, but sat by the fire, smoking,

for some time after Agatha went to her tent. He had,
in fact, been rather silent for the last few days. Now
they were near the end of their journey he did not
know if he wanted Agatha to find the lode or not.
When they started he had imagined that the search
would lead to nothing, and had gone because her society
had a charm and he wanted to free her mind of
a dangerous illusion. But he could no longer think
the lode an illusion. The silver was there, and if one
searched long enough, could, no doubt, be found.</p>

<p class="dgp">This was somehow disturbing, but with a half-conscious
wish to shirk the truth he would not inquire
bluntly why it disturbed him. He wanted the girl
to be happy, and had thought it best for her that she
should give up the attempt to find the lode. Now he
must readjust his views, and it was hard to see what
place there would be for him in her affairs if she became
the owner of a rich mining claim.</p>

<p class="dgp">Next morning they made a difficult portage to another
lake, and launching the canoes at noon found the
wind blowing fresh. The lake was wide, and when by
and by an angry sea got up Thirlwell reluctantly
steered for the shelter of a rocky point. They had
covered very little ground since they started, and there
was only another day of the fortnight left. After supper
some of the men went fishing, and Drummond set
off alone along the beach, while Agatha and Thirlwell
sat among the rocks where the pungent wood-smoke
drifted past and kept the mosquitoes off. The sun
had set and the air was very clear; they could see the
ragged pines across the lake, but the trees on the point
behind them cut off their view to the north.</p>

<p class="dgp">Presently Drummond came back, running fast, and

stopped in front of Agatha. His eyes sparkled and
the sweat ran down his face.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What's the matter?" Thirlwell asked. "Have
the timber wolves got after you?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The <em>broken range</em>!" Drummond gasped. "Get
up, Miss Strange, and come right along!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha looked at Thirlwell, who smiled. "I don't
know what he means, but perhaps we had better go."</p>

<p class="dgp">They followed the lad for some distance, though the
shingle was large and rough. Now and then he turned
and looked back impatiently, as if they were not coming
fast enough; but at length he stopped and indicated
the high ground to the north. Its bold line, colored
a soft blue, stood out against the yellow sky, and
in one place there was a sharply defined gap.</p>

<p class="dgp">"There!" he exclaimed breathlessly. "I guess
that's the <em>broken range</em>!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I see the break," said Thirlwell. "What about
it?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Don't embarrass him," Agatha interrupted. "It's
something he remembers. Perhaps his father talked
about the gap."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He did," said Drummond. "The thing's been
kind of floating in my mind all day, but I couldn't get
it fixed. Then I saw that gap and knew I'd got what
I'd been feeling for."</p>

<p class="dgp">"What did your father say?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The Indian camp he sent Strange to was in thin
bush, close under the broken range, on the north side."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell turned to Agatha. "Then we oughtn't
to have much trouble in locating the ore. We know
where the factory stood, and if we can find the thin
bush, I can follow the line your father took."</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha's eyes shone and her color came and went,
but with an effort she preserved her calm.</p>

<p class="dgp">"After all, the bush may have grown."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think not," said Thirlwell. "It's probably rocky
ground where the trees are small."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But how was it my father did not see the gap?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"That is easily accounted for. The gap's not large,
and I expect you can only see it when you're directly
opposite, at a right angle to the line of the high ground.
If you moved back a mile or two, the rocks and trees
would shut it in. Drummond didn't see it as we came
up the lake."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I suppose we must wait until to-morrow?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Thirlwell. "We must leave the water,
and can't get through the bush in the dark."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha made a sign of agreement. "Very well; I
am glad the nights are very short. But I would like
to start at daybreak."</p>

<p class="dgp">Then they turned and went back silently to camp.
Thirlwell was conscious of a keen disturbance that he
would not analyze and saw that Agatha did not want
to talk. As a matter of fact, Agatha could not talk.
She felt a curious exaltation: her heart was full.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXVI&mdash;The Lode</h3>

<p class="noindent">At daybreak next morning Thirlwell sent the <em>Metis</em>
up the lake to make a <em>cache</em> of the provisions he
did not need, and hide the canoes in the brush. In
the meantime, he scattered the ashes of the fire and
buried the empty cans and all the chips he could find.
There was another party in the neighborhood, and he
wanted to leave nothing to indicate that the spot had
been recently occupied by a camp. When the men
returned the party set off along the beach, loaded with
food and tools. Walking across the stones and ledges
was laborious, but he did not mean to leave a trail, and
kept to the water's edge for some distance before he
plunged into the bush.</p>

<p class="dgp">After this, their progress was very slow. The small
trees grew close together and in places the ground was
covered with rotting trunks and branches. Moreover
the line he took led steadily upwards towards the break
in the range. It did not look very far off when they
started, but dusk was falling and the packers were
nearly exhausted when they threw down their loads
at the bottom of the gap. Thirlwell's back ached and
the straps had galled his shoulders, but he noted with
some surprise that Agatha did not look tired. She
dropped behind as they toiled up the last rough stony
slope, but she helped to pitch camp. Her movements
were not languid and her eyes were bright.</p>


<p class="dgp">By and by she took out the worn paper from the
tobacco-box and asked Thirlwell a few questions. He
answered rather moodily, and as soon as he could
picked up his blanket and went off to the bed he had
made of twigs. The hollow he had found was sheltered
and the twigs were soft, but it was long before
he slept. They were near the spot where Strange
claimed to have seen the ore, and he was now persuaded
that they would find the vein. If the ore carried as
much silver as the specimens indicated, Agatha would
be rich. She would go back to the cities, and if her
riches were not to separate them altogether, he must
enter her employment. Somehow he shrank from
this.</p>

<p class="dgp">But the ore might prove poorer than one thought and
the mine cost much to work. He would not admit
that he hoped so, since he wanted Agatha to enjoy all
the happiness that wealth could give. Indeed, he did
not know what he hoped; he was physically tired and
although he felt strangely restless his brain was dull.
At length his eyes closed and for some hours he slept
brokenly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Getting up at daybreak, he scrambled along the bottom
of the gap until he could look down on the other
side, and presently turned with a start as he heard a
rattle of stones. Agatha, whom he had thought asleep,
advanced with a smile. She looked very fresh, and
although he imagined she was highly strung, her face
was calm. For a few moments she said nothing, but
stood close by, gazing fixedly in front.</p>

<p class="dgp">There was some mist on the low ground, but, for the
most part, the tops of the pines rose above the haze.
The sky in the east was getting red, and here and there

one saw gleams of water and the gray backs of rocks.
That was all, for the landscape was blurred to the
north, where a vague gray line hinted at another range.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The haze is tantalizing," she remarked by and by.
"One could not see when we got here and I have been
waiting for the dawn."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I hoped you slept. We made a long march yesterday."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Did you sleep?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Thirlwell. "Anyhow, not very much."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled. "Yet you haven't been thinking
about the lode as I have&mdash;thinking of nothing else
for ever so long! Can't you imagine what it means to
feel I am near the place at last?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can imagine it to some extent. If the ore carries
as much silver as we think, you can do what you
like when you get your patent; build laboratories,
travel, make friends with clever people. In fact, your
money will buy you anything you want."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Do you really believe that?" Agatha asked, with
a hint of mockery in her voice. "Do you imagine I
have been thinking about the money?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have thought about it," Thirlwell said, and
stopped when she gave him a curious glance. "Of
course," he resumed, "there's some satisfaction in
feeling you have finished a difficult job."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Now you're nearer the mark! But you don't feel
in the mood for philosophizing?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm often dull before breakfast," Thirlwell replied.
"All the same, I'm glad you're happy. In fact,
I'm trying to be sympathetic."</p>

<p class="dgp">"And you find it hard!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell colored, but looked at her steadily.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Anyhow, if the thing's possible, I'm going to find the
lode for you."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," she said, without moving her eyes from his
face, "I know you'll try to find it. You're trustworthy;
you play a straight game!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I cheated once."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That was when you thought the advantage would
be mine. But how far do you think we will have to
go?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps I can tell you when the sun gets up. We
may have to search for three or four days; we may
strike the creek to-night."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," she said, "I hope it will not be three or four
days. Now we are very near, the suspense is keen."
Then she smiled. "However, we will go back and get
breakfast, because you must set your brain to work."</p>

<p class="dgp">It was next morning when they saw the first of
Strange's landmarks; and Thirlwell, taking its bearing
with the compass, changed their line of march.
In the evening they climbed a low hill, and when they
reached its top, which rose like an island from a waste
of short pine-scrub, Drummond stopped and, touching
Agatha, indicated the ridge across the valley.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Look!" he said. "The <em>hollow rock</em>!"</p>

<p class="dgp">A small gray object, dwarfed by the distance, stood
out against a smear of dark green on the crest of the
high ground. After studying it for a few moments
Thirlwell nodded.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes; I think he's right."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond turned to Agatha with a sparkle in his
eyes. "I quit now, Miss Strange. You've got there
ahead of Stormont; I guess I've made good!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You made good when you found the broken

range," Agatha replied, giving him a grateful look,
and Drummond's dark face flushed with color as he
turned away.</p>

<p class="dgp">They lost the rock as they went down hill, but when
they made camp the roar of falling water came faintly
across the woods.</p>

<p class="dgp">"<em>The creek that runs south</em>!" said Thirlwell as he
lighted the fire.</p>

<p class="dgp">They started early next morning, but the ground was
rough and the sun was getting low when they came
down a rocky hill into a small round hollow, through
which shining water flowed. The opposite slope was
in shadow, but the slanting sunbeams touched a belt
of fresh growth that glowed a vivid green against the
somber color of the surrounding trees.</p>

<p class="dgp">"That," said Thirlwell, "is, no doubt, where the
rampikes stood. They've gone, and young willows
have sprung up. Yonder's the low cliff. It looks as
if we had arrived!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha stopped for a few moments and felt her
heart beat. The dream she had first dreamed long
since had come true, but she knew it might not have
done so had she not had Thirlwell's help. In the
meantime, the scene impressed itself upon her brain, so
that she could long afterwards recall it when she
wished&mdash;the nearly level sunbeams falling across the
trees and turning their bark fiery red, the gleam of water,
and the figures of the men plodding slowly downhill
with their loads. Their faces glowed like polished
copper in the searching light, their overalls were ragged
and stained, and one stumbled and lurched wildly
down a slope with a rattle of rolling stones. Then she

glanced at Thirlwell, who stood close by, watching her
with a sympathetic smile, though his pose was rather
strained.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," she said, "you have brought me here! Just
now I cannot thank you as I ought."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We'll go on," he answered quietly. "I'd like to
fire a shot or two before it's dark, and we'll need some
time to drill the holes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha gave him a quick look. "You are nothing
if you're not practical, but perhaps that's fortunate.
One trusts practical people when there are things that
must be done."</p>

<p class="dgp">The sunshine had faded when they reached the bottom
of the hill and the hollow was shadowy and cool.
Thirlwell ordered the men to make camp and then
went with Agatha to the foot of the cliff. The creek
that flowed past the rock ran clear and low, and he
got across by jumping from ledge to ledge. Then,
as he scrambled among the boulders towards a spot
he had marked he heard a splash, and looking round
saw that Agatha had slipped into the stream. She
waded across, with the water rippling round her long
boots, and when she joined him trembled with suspense.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You needn't have come over," he said, smiling as
he indicated a band of darker color that seamed the
ragged face of the gray stone. "That's all there is
to see! Hardly looks as if it was worth your coming
so far to find it? It was a lucky accident the color
caught your father's eye; the vein's only distinct for
a few yards where the frost has brought down the
cliff. I think we'll find it dips."</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha noted that his tone was very matter-of-fact,
although his face was set, and thought she had better
follow his lead.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then the ore must once have outcropped. It's
a good example of denudation."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes; it probably ran out some distance back. You
can see how the creek has cut down the rock, but frost
and snow have helped. One can't tell yet whether the
best or worst has been lost; but to begin with, we'll look
for the discovery post."</p>

<p class="dgp">They found it driven among the gravel; then, climbing
a gully, reached the crest of the rock. Thirlwell
led Agatha through the bush by his compass until he
traced a rough oblong, marked by other posts. She
followed him with confused emotions and once or twice
her eyes filled with tears. Her father had driven these
stakes; she could imagine the thrill it gave him to feel
that at length his faith and labor were justified. His
confidence had never wavered, although he had borne
mockery and contempt and the gentle ridicule of his
anxious wife. Then, when the prize he toiled for was
won and he went back to enjoy it, the river had swept
him away. But after all, love had conquered the angry
flood, for he had left a clue that the rapid could not
destroy.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha thought Thirlwell understood something of
her feelings, because he did not talk except when he
showed her the posts. When they reached the last
he said, "On the whole, I imagine your father's judgment
was good. In fact, he picked his ground like
a mining engineer."</p>

<p class="dgp">"He had twenty years to brood about the vein at

home," Agatha replied. "Are you surprised that he
studied all the books on mining he could get?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell made an apologetic gesture. "I oughtn't
to be surprised: he was your father, and it's obvious
that you have prepared yourself to carry on his work.
Well, I think he has staked off the best of the vein; at
least, his claim covers the part that can best be reached.
But you'll have trouble with the water; it may mean
driving a drainage heading and putting up expensive
pumps. The ore may be rich enough to stand the
extra cost, but I can tell you more when I have fired
a shot."</p>

<p class="dgp">They went back to the camp, where the <em>Metis</em> had
cooked supper, but Thirlwell did not eat much and soon
returned to the cliff. He took the white rock-borer,
but Agatha did not go with him. She felt chilled by
his quietness. It was now plain that, since her father
had marked off the exposed edge of the inclined lode,
Thirlwell must sink a deep shaft if he wished to reach
it farther back. This, however, did not account for
his moodiness; for one thing, he had not expected that
they would find the ore. Besides, he was generous and
would want her to have the best. It would have been
a comfort to give him half the claim, but he would refuse
the gift. She had meant to enjoy her triumph
with him, but this satisfaction had gone. It hurt, her
to see him disturbed, but she colored as she resolved
that her success should not separate them. If he was
obstinate, something must be risked.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the meantime, Thirlwell struck the drill his companion
held. His face was damp with sweat and the
hammer slipped in his hands, but he did not miss a

stroke. He had promised the girl his help, and when
the hole was sunk he chose the best spot for the next
with fastidious care. He meant to play a straight
game, although it would cost him much to let her win.
By and by the miner picked up some of the bits of stone.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Weight's all right; guess the stuff's carrying heavy
metal," he remarked. "Still, I've seen a lode pinch
out. It may be a pocket and the dirt run poor when
you get farther in."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's possible," Thirlwell agreed in a dull voice.</p>

<p class="dgp">The miner gave him a sharp glance. "Looks as if
you wouldn't be much disappointed! Don't you <em>want</em>
the dirt to go rich?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Let's get on," said Thirlwell. "I want to fire the
shot before it's dark."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then watch out for my fingers," the miner rejoined.
"When you pound her as you've been doing
I like to see you keep your eye on the drill."</p>

<p class="dgp">They worked for some time and then Thirlwell sent
for Agatha, and helping her across the creek, held up
the ends of two or three fuses and a match-box.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's proper that you should fire the first shot.
I've put in a heavy charge and we'll know something
about the ore when we see the stuff the blast brings
down."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha lighted the fuses and they hurried back to
the shelter of the trees, where she stood with her heart
beating fast. It was proper that she should be first to
undertake her father's work; Thirlwell's thought was
graceful. She glanced at him, but his brown face was
inscrutable, although his mouth was firm. His quietness
jarred; she felt angry and disappointed, as if she
had been robbed of something.</p>


<p class="dgp">For all that, she thrilled as she watched the faint
sparkle of the fuse. She had won the first battle more
easily than she had thought, and had now begun the
next stage of the struggle. She sprang from a pioneering
stock and knew that the shot she fired would
break the daunting silence of the woods for good. If
she failed to develop the mine somebody else would
succeed. The lonely hollow would soon be covered
with tents and shacks; men's voices and the rattle of
machines would drown the soft splash of the creek.
She was blasting a way for civilization into the wilderness.</p>

<p class="dgp">A flash, springing from different spots, leaped across
the foot of the cliff; gray smoke rolled up, and there
was a roar that rolled in confused echoes across the
woods. The front of the rock seemed to totter behind
the smoke, great stones splashed in the water, and
flying pieces rattled among the trunks. When the
vapor began to clear and she wanted to run forward
Thirlwell put his hand on her arm.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It won't be safe for some time; you're not used
to the fumes," he said. "If you went there now, you
wouldn't be able to get up to-morrow."</p>

<p class="dgp">She followed him back to the camp, where Drummond
and the miner joined them.</p>

<p class="dgp">"In the morning I'll go with you to see where we
ought to stake the other claims," he said to the men.
"You can, of course, locate where you like, but this
job will need some capital and you want to get the best
frontage you can. That will help us later."</p>

<p class="dgp">They agreed without much enthusiasm. Now they
had reached their object, a reaction had begun, and
Agatha was sensible of a curious flatness. She knew

that Drummond and the rock-borer could do nothing
with their claims except sell them to somebody who
could supply the money to develop the mines; but
before they started Thirlwell had outlined a plan by
which the holdings might be consolidated and worked
together. The men had approved and promised to
give her what Thirlwell called an option, if it seemed
worth while to do the work required before the patents
would be granted.</p>

<p class="dgp">When the fumes had cleared they went with him to
the cliff and he came back with a heavy bag. It was
dark, but the firelight shone about him as he poured
out the stones he had brought and gave her one or two.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The stuff looks as good as the specimens we have,"
he said quietly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha agreed as she weighed the pieces, but her
eyes were fixed on his face. He looked stern, but
forced a smile&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your father was not deceived, and what he left
unfinished you can make good. I think you are going
to be rich."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If so, I owe it all to you."</p>

<p class="dgp">He shook his head. "You might have found the
lode without me, but I expect you're tired and you
ought to sleep well to-night. I must begin at daybreak.
The sooner we start back to record the ground we
claim, the better."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then good-night," she said quietly, but when she
moved away through the shadow her face was resolute.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXVII&mdash;THIRLWELL'S DULLNESS</h3>

<p class="noindent">Soon after daybreak, Thirlwell, Drummond, and
the rock-borer pushed their way through the
woods behind the cliff. The vein dipped and in consequence
the farther one went back from the creek, the
greater would be the cost of reaching the ore. Besides,
it was possible that the ore pinched out and the
uncovered part was an unusually rich pocket. His
companions had agreed that he should have the next
best location after Agatha's, and followed his advice
about staking their claims. The half-breeds had, however,
declined to exercise their rights; they were trappers
and <em>voyageurs</em>, and stated that they had no use
for mines.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell thought there was no more ground worth
recording, and doubted, for that matter, if his and the
others' claims were worth much, but it was prudent
to keep intruders out. Disputes often rose about the
application of the mining laws, and it might be dangerous
to have a rich and unscrupulous antagonist. His
companions went away feeling puzzled by his coolness.
On the journey he had encouraged the party with humorous
banter, and made a joke of their difficulties;
now he was quiet and reserved.</p>

<p class="dgp">When they had gone Thirlwell sat down and lighted
his pipe, for he knew he must grapple with his trouble

before it mastered him. Looking back, he saw that
he had been strangely pleased by Agatha's letters, and
when he met her had at once felt her charm. This,
however, was all; he frankly enjoyed her society and
thought she liked his, but he was not romantic and was
satisfied that they should drift into a close and confidential
friendship. It was obvious now that he had
been remarkably dull; Scott had seen how things were
going.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he had taken it for granted that Agatha would
not find the vein, and had helped her because he thought
it better she should convince herself that Strange had
been the victim of his imagination. He had honestly
thought this when they started, but now recognized
that he had unconsciously had another object: he
wanted her society and to earn her gratitude.</p>

<p class="dgp">A light began to dawn on him when he found
Strange's tobacco-box, but he had, so to speak, evaded
full illumination until it became obvious that they
were near the vein. Then the truth could no longer
be denied. He was in love with the girl, and had unconsciously
loved her from the first. In a sense, this
looked ridiculous; but there it was and he must face
it. If she had been poor, he would have urged her to
marry him, although it might have exposed her to
some risk of hardship. But she was rich, and the best
he could hope for was a post at a mine like the Clermont.</p>

<p class="dgp">He had no ground for imagining that Agatha would
be willing to marry him; but if she were, it would look
as if he meant to share her riches when he offered his
help. In fact, it would look as if he meant to take
advantage of her ignorance about mining matters and

her trust. It would not disturb him if outsiders
thought this, but she might come to think so.</p>

<p class="dgp">Besides, he was not going to be supported by his
wife's money. In view of their characters, the situation
would be humiliating for both. Agatha might
learn to despise him, which would be intolerable.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then he felt a touch on his shoulder and got up
with a start. Agatha stood close by and he thought
there was more color in her face than usual, although
her eyes were calm.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Brooding over our good luck?" she said with a
smile. "Isn't that a curious attitude?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The good luck is yours."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you insist on the difference, but I don't know
that it's kind! Besides, I wanted to give you half my
frontage on the vein."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's quite impossible," said Thirlwell firmly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why is it impossible?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It would look as if I'd meant to take advantage
of your generosity."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Does it matter how the thing would look?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Thirlwell, who hesitated. "I want to
keep your good opinion&mdash;if I have it."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled, but her glance was soft. "I won't
flatter you, because I think you ought to know. But
why are you moody? I'd expected you to be sympathetic to
rejoice with me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"For your sake, I am glad."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But not for yours?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I haven't quite got used to the situation yet," Thirlwell
answered awkwardly. "You see, I never expected
to find the ore."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That was rather obvious," Agatha rejoined with

some dryness. "But if you thought we would be
disappointed, why did you come?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell was silent. He did not mean to admit that
he had thought a sharp disappointment would be good
for her and might save her worse pain. It was difficult
to state this properly. Then if he owned that he had
come for the pleasure of her society, she might misunderstand
him and he might say too much. Agatha
was half amused by his embarrassment, but was moved
all the same, for she understood more than he knew.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We'll let it go," she resumed. "Still, I don't see
why you should be disturbed by my success."</p>

<p class="dgp">"One often feels sorry when one finishes a big job.
It means one has come to the end of things one has
got used to and likes."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But this is rather the beginning than the end."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," he said moodily. "We have had a glorious
trip, but it's done with. You will go back to the
cities; there are only two or three months when a
civilized girl can live in the woods. The trail we have
broken stops here."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But what do you mean to do?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Help Scott at the Clermont, until he's forced to
give up."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sit down and light your pipe," said Agatha. "We
must talk about this."</p>

<p class="dgp">He obeyed and picked up his pipe. Although he
did not light it, its touch was soothing and he wanted
to keep cool. Agatha sat down opposite on a fallen
trunk and presently went on: "To begin with, the
mine must be worked, not sold, and I need help."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can get a good manager for the wages you'll
be able to pay."</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha's color was higher, but she gave him a steady
look. "I want a man I know and trust. There are
many ways in which I shall need advice, because I cannot
take this fortune without its responsibility. The
mine must be worked to the best advantage and the
people I employ treated well. I mean to build good
houses for them, not rude shacks, make it possible for
them to lead happy lives, and see they get the best, not
the worst, that our cities can send them when a settlement
springs up."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's a fine ambition," Thirlwell remarked. "However,
it will cost you something, and you'll find some
resistance from the people you want to help; but if the
ore's as good as we think, you'll be able to carry out
your plans."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Do you think I could trust this work to a stranger?
A man hired for wages, who might have no sympathy
with my aims?" Agatha asked. "Then, if when
I've done all I mean, I'm rich, somebody must help
me to use the money well." She turned her head for
a moment, and then resumed: "Can't you see that it's
daunting to feel I may have to struggle alone with a
task I'm hardly fit for&mdash;to know I'll make mistakes?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"There is your brother."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled.</p>

<p class="dgp">"George would see I made prudent investments, and
think I ought to be satisfied with getting ten per cent."
She gave Thirlwell a look that made his heart beat.
"I need help George cannot give, and know nobody
but you."</p>

<p class="dgp">She stopped, for she could go no farther. It was
for him to meet her now, if he wanted, but for a moment
or two he was silent and knitted his brows. His

brown face was resolute, but something in his eyes indicated
that resolution cost him much. Then he said,
"You offer me the post of manager?"</p>

<p class="dgp">She turned her head, for it was difficult to preserve
her calm. He was dull in some respects, but it was
scarcely possible that he was as dull as he now pretended.
Looking up with a forced smile, she said:
"Yes, of course. I want a manager, and if you
would sooner be businesslike&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm afraid I'm very unbusinesslike," he replied
with some grimness. "However, if Scott is willing,
I'll help you to develop the mine and get your patent;
but I think it would be prudent to let him join us. You
may have some trouble to get the money we will need;
then he's straight and a very good sort."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But what will you do when the patent's granted?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"We can talk about that later. It will be some time
before the mine is yours, and I'm not certain that we
have heard the last of Stormont."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," said Agatha. "I like Mr. Scott and
feel I can trust him because he is your friend. Do
what you think best; I leave it all to you."</p>

<p class="dgp">She went away with very mixed feelings, and was
glad to reach the shelter of the woods. Her face was
hot and her nerves were jarred, but when she got
calmer she laughed&mdash;a rather strained laugh. It was
a lover she wanted, not a manager, and unless Thirlwell
was strangely dull she had been firmly repulsed.
She hoped he was dull, but it seemed impossible that
he had not understood. Then it was significant that
he had shown some strain and she found comfort in
this. After all, the line he took had cost him much
and his obstinacy might break down.</p>


<p class="dgp">Besides, when one looked at it dispassionately, the
situation was humorous. She had engaged Thirlwell
for her manager, but nothing had been said about his
wages, which she could not pay; for that matter, she
was in his debt. Although she was the prospective
owner of a valuable mine, she had only a few dollars
left of the money George had given her; hardly enough,
in fact, to pay for a week's board when she reached
Toronto. Her post there had, no doubt, been filled.</p>

<p class="dgp">The ore was rich, but might get poor, and she knew
enough about mining to realize the difficulties that
must yet be overcome. Getting the money she would
need for the preliminary work was perhaps the worst;
and if the money could be raised, it would be a long
time before she could look for much return. Still she
was not alone; Thirlwell had promised to help and
she knew he would not fail her. She meant to let
him help, not because she wanted to get rich, but because
she really knew what had influenced him, and
suspected that he was not as strong as he thought.</p>

<p class="dgp">For all that, she kept out of his way as much as
possible while they camped by the creek, although she
was careful to talk with easy friendliness when they
met at meals. Thirlwell, however, was generally occupied,
and when he had made a rough survey of the
claims they started south. The loads were light now
and he forced the pace because he was anxious, and
felt responsible. There was another prospecting party,
with an unscrupulous leader, not far off, and one's
title to a mineral claim is open to dispute until the
record is filed. Although Agatha's prosperity would
be his loss, he meant to run no risk. He was her
manager and must justify her trust.</p>


<p class="dgp">When they reached the lake he found there would
be some delay. They had covered the canoes with
branches, but the pine-needles had withered off and the
hot sun had opened the seams. Some of the thin
planks were badly split, one had sprung away from
its fastenings, and it would take a few days to repair
the damage without proper tools. The caulking composition
he had brought would not go round, and he
had to send the <em>Metis</em> into the bush to look for gum to
make the Indian pitch. Then it cost him a day's hard
labor to rough out new plans with an ax and saw, and
he afterwards found he must make a steaming-box to
soften the wood so that it would bend into place.</p>

<p class="dgp">On the second night he was tired and disturbed, but
his sleep was light and he wakened shortly before daybreak.
It was not dark; he could see the trunks behind
the camp and Agatha's white tent. The ripples broke
upon the beach with a gentle splash, and there was a
faint sighing in the pine-tops. Except for all this all
was very quiet, and he wondered whether he had heard
a canoe paddle in his dreams. Then, not far off, a
stone rattled as if it had been trodden on.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell got up quietly and glanced about the camp.
The men were asleep. He counted their indistinct figures,
wrapped in blankets; nobody was missing. Still
somebody had disturbed a loose stone and he moved
cautiously into the gloom. One could not creep up
to an Indian, but Thirlwell imagined there were none
about, and if an Indian had meant to steal something,
he would not have crossed the slanting bank strewn
with large gravel, from which the noise had come.
Thirlwell, himself, would not have done so, for he had
learned to be silent, when hunting in the bush. He

suspected a clumsy white man, from the cities. When
he got near the bank he stopped behind a tree. There
was a narrow opening, but he saw nobody and heard
nothing except the wind in the pine-tops.</p>

<p class="dgp">He tried to creep round the opening, but fell among
a clump of wild-berry canes. They were green and
did not rustle much, but he knew that after this it would
be useless to go on with the search. Besides, he was
not certain that a man had disturbed the stone. The
camp-fire had gone out and an animal might have come
down to drink. He grumbled at his awkwardness
and going back to camp, went to sleep again.</p>

<p class="dgp">In the morning he returned to the bank, but found no
tracks. He could account for the stone falling in two
or three natural ways, but the splash of the paddle was
a different thing. Still he had not actually heard the
noise, but, so to speak, wakened with its echo in his
ears, and sitting down, he pondered the matter. Supposing
that somebody from Stormont's gang had
prowled about the camp, it was difficult to see the fellow's
object. Thirlwell did not doubt that Stormont
knew he was the leader of Agatha's party and she could
do nothing without his help. If Driscoll had been with
his former confederate, one could have understood the
thing. Black Steve had an Indian's cunning and the
instincts of a savage animal, but he was dead and
Stormont was a rascal of another kind. Steve's primitive
methods would not appeal to him. Thirlwell
gave up the puzzle and got about his work.</p>

<a name="toc_29"></a>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXVIII&mdash;Stormont Tries A Bribe</h3>

<p class="noindent">When the light began to fade Thirlwell put
W down his tools and went off to try to catch a
trout. He had noted that Drummond was not about
the camp and when he got near the mouth of a creek
where he meant to fish thought he saw an indistinct
figure some distance in front. It vanished, but he
felt he had not been deceived and stopped for a minute
or two.</p>

<p class="dgp">Although he had no grounds for distrusting Drummond,
he had marked certain weaknesses in his character.
The lad might have gone to fish, but Thirlwell
had not seen him make a rod, and remembering the
falling stone resolved to find out. The wood was
thin, but the light was dim, and the turmoil of the
creek would drown any noise he made. After walking
obliquely inland for some distance he stopped
to listen. He heard nothing, but Drummond was
now between him and the lake, and Thirlwell thought
he could not get across the creek. He came down to
the mouth of the latter cautiously, and when he was
close to the lake stopped behind a trunk. The water
glimmered between the trees, and he saw two dark
figures outlined against the pale reflection.</p>

<p class="dgp">There was some risk of his being seen, but he
thought if Drummond was afraid he might be followed,

he would watch the bush along the edge of the
lake, and he advanced cautiously, moving from trunk
to trunk. A thicket of wild-berries grew near the
water, and stealing up behind it, he stopped and
crouched down. Drummond was perhaps a dozen
yards off, and stood, holding a fishing-rod, while Stormont
sat on a fallen log opposite. Thirlwell clenched
his fist and listened. He could hear them talk.</p>

<p class="dgp">"How'd you know you'd find me here?" Drummond
asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I didn't know," said Stormont; "it was good luck.
I wanted to find out if Thirlwell had finished the
canoes. One can see into your camp from the top
of the high ground, and I've brought good glasses."</p>

<p class="dgp">It was plain that Drummond had not gone to meet
the fellow, and Thirlwell saw that he had, to some extent,
misjudged the lad. For all that, Drummond had
reached the spot a few minutes before he did, and
something had obviously been said in the meantime.
If possible, he must find out what they had talked
about.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Take a smoke; this is a pretty good cigar," Stormont
resumed. "You'll let a soft snap go if you don't
do what I want."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You put me on to a soft snap before," Drummond
remarked with a touch of scorn.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think you got fifty dollars&mdash;for nothing. Anyhow,
I want you and I'm willing to pay in advance."</p>

<p class="dgp">"With a cheque that can be stopped!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont laughed. "No. I don't pay for this kind
of job by cheque. You can have it in bills; I've got a
wad in my pocket. Better take your money now than

trust Thirlwell to let you in when he makes good his
claim; but if you like, I'll give you some stock when
we float our company."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'll take the bills," said Drummond in a meaning
tone. "But you want to put it high."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell found it hard to control his anger.
Drummond had professed some liking for him and had
made no secret of his devotion to Agatha, but now he
was coolly bargaining with her antagonist. It looked
as if he was willing to betray her if he could get a
good price. For all that, Thirlwell saw that he must
find out the plot and lay still behind the thicket, watching
the lad. Drummond's pose was easy and his voice
was calm. He had not lighted the cigar Stormont
gave him, and now and then twisted it round carelessly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," Stormont resumed. "As I've got to
bid against Thirlwell, I'll risk five hundred dollars:
two hundred and fifty now. Then, as soon as we make
a good start, you can have a job in the company's
office."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh, shucks!" said Drummond. "Five hundred
dollars for a silver mine? You can't find the lode unless
I put you wise."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's not going to bother us. Thirlwell has left
a trail we can follow without your help. Well, you've
heard my offer. What do you say?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm thinking some. I get two hundred and fifty
dollars now, but what about the rest? Suppose I have
to wait until you put the job over? How are you
going to put it over when Thirlwell holds the
claims?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"They won't be worth much after I get to work.
Going to law's expensive and Thirlwell can't stand up

to the men who are backing me. He'll be glad to sell
out at our price when we put the screw to him."</p>

<p class="dgp">This was illuminating to Thirlwell, since it justified
his fears. The mining regulations were complicated,
and it was not unusual for unscrupulous speculators to
dispute a poor man's claim. He knew of instances
where grave injustice had been done. Moreover, he
noted that Stormont said nothing about Agatha, but
thought him the prospective owner of the minerals.
People obviously took it for granted that he meant to
marry the girl.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your job is to stop Thirlwell," Stormont went on.
"The thing must be done cleverly and look like an
accident. The best plan would be to get at the canoes.
They're hauled up side by side and you might perhaps
set them on fire when he makes his caulking gum. Or
you might knock loose a plank or two in the bottom.
Anyhow, you'll have to hold him up long enough for
me to pull out his stakes."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell, burning with indignation, found it hard
to keep still. It was a cunning plot, because a few
days' delay might enable Stormont to re-stake the
ground and file his record first. If this were done,
Agatha would have to bear the disadvantage of challenging
his claim and, if the law expenses were heavy,
might be forced to compromise. Still, he controlled
his rage.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The thing's not as easy as it looks," Drummond
replied. "Thirlwell's not a fool. If you, want me
to put it over, you'll have to come up."</p>

<p class="dgp">"A good job in our office and six hundred dollars:
three hundred now. If Thirlwell finds out and gets
after you, come along to my camp."</p>


<p class="dgp">"Where is your camp?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Behind some rocks, about two miles up the lake.
Follow the creek and you'll come to a log that has
fallen across."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well; I'll take the money."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont pulled out his wallet, and then Thirlwell
came near to betraying himself, because the dramatic
surprise was almost too much for his self-control.
Drummond snatched the bills from the other's hand
and laughed, a savage, scornful laugh.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You thieving hog; you blasted <em>fool</em>!" he cried.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What d'you mean?" Stormont shouted, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Did you think you could play me for a sucker
<em>twice</em>?" Drummond rejoined. "Three hundred dollars,
for my claim on the lode? That's what it comes
to, and I reckon that's all I'd get!" He flung out his
hand, scattering the crumpled bills. "There's your
dirty money. I've got you corralled!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont was quiet; dangerously quiet Thirlwell
thought, because it was obvious that Drummond had
led him on until he learned his plans. He stooped and
began to pick up the bills, moving about, for the bits
of paper were scattered and indistinct. One had fallen
by a heavy stone, and Thirlwell felt his nerves tingle
as Stormont got nearer. Drummond did not seem to
be suspicious; his pose was careless, and Thirlwell
imagined the lad was enjoying his triumph. Both
thought they were alone and they stood on a ledge that
ran out into deep water.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then Stormont clutched the stone and Thirlwell
sprang to his feet. The fellow's caution had given
way; mocked and cheated by the lad he meant to use,

he had suddenly become primitive in his disappointed
greed and rage. It looked as if Drummond did not
know his danger; but as Thirlwell ran forward Stormont
lifted the stone and the lad leaped upon him like
a wild cat.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell stopped. For the moment he did not see
how he could interfere without doing harm, and
thought Drummond did not need his help. The men
were locked in a savage grapple at the edge of the
ledge and the ripples splashed upon the rocks four or
five feet below. Stormont had been deceived to the
end. It is hard for a white man to match the instinctive
cunning that goes with a strain of Indian blood,
and Drummond had suspected that the other meant to
pick up the stone.</p>

<p class="dgp">Neither saw Thirlwell. They swayed and panted,
striking when they got an arm loose, and then pressing
body against body while each strained for a grip
to lift his antagonist from his feet. Stormont, indeed,
made a better fight than Thirlwell had expected,
but after a time his knees bent, his head went back,
and Drummond threw him heavily. When he struck
the ground he felt for his pocket, but Drummond fell
upon him with a cry that was like a wild beast's howl.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell saw it was time to interfere. An Indian
never forgets an injury, and Drummond had inherited
his father's grim Scottish stubbornness. He rolled
over with Stormont, and then getting uppermost, savagely
bumped his head against the rock. This gave
Thirlwell his opportunity, and seizing the lad's shoulders,
he pressed his knee against the small of his back.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Stop!" he shouted. "Do you mean to kill the
man?"</p>


<p class="dgp">"Sure!" gasped Drummond. "Lemme go!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You'd better quit. I've got you tight."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond struggled furiously, but since he could
not turn round found it impossible to break loose. His
hands, however, were free and he gave Stormont's head
another violent bump. Then Thirlwell, using his knee
as a fulcrum, pulled the lad's shoulders back until he
cried out with pain and let go. Thirlwell threw him
off and stepped between the two before they could get
up.</p>

<p class="dgp">"This has got to stop and I'm fresh and able to see
it does stop. If you try to start again, Drummond,
I'll throw you into the lake," he said, and turned to
Stormont, who did not move. "Get up."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont did so, shakily. "I suppose you had this
thing fixed with him!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I had not. I came along by accident and it might
have been better if I'd left you to Drummond and
gone off again. It was rather for his sake than yours
I butted in. Can you walk?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont said he thought he could, and Thirlwell
indicated the bush. "Then get off and take the hint
that it's prudent to leave the Agatha Mine alone."</p>

<p class="dgp">When Stormont had gone, Thirlwell turned to
Drummond, who was now standing up. "Are you
hurt?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not much. I don't mind if I am hurt, so long as
Stormont is. But why in thunder did you come just
then?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's lucky I did," said Thirlwell dryly. "I think
you saw he wanted to get that stone?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Sure; I meant to let him. Wanted him to fire

the rock and begin the circus. Then, when he'd made
me mad enough, I'd have finished it."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It would have been awkward if he'd brought a
pistol."</p>

<p class="dgp">Drummond smiled. "He thought he had, but he'd
forgot the thing. I'd been studying his clothes; blue
shirt and thin overalls. There wasn't a bulge." Then
he stooped and picked up a crumpled bill. "Five dollars;
don't see much use in leaving money lying
round."</p>

<p class="dgp">He hesitated, and then putting the bill in his pocket,
remarked: "Anyhow, he gave me the wad. Let's
see if I can find another."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell laughed and told him to rest for a few
minutes, because he wanted to think. Stormont had
obviously returned to what he imagined was a good
center to work from in his search for the vein, and
had seen the smoke of Thirlwell's fire. He could
now follow back the latter's trail and then make for
the Record Office after altering the stakes. If he
did so, the probability was that he would arrive too
late, but accidents often happen in the bush and Thirlwell
meant to leave nothing to luck. Moreover, Stormont
had given him a hint when he tried to bribe
Drummond to damage the canoes. In the wilds, travel
depends upon the means of transport, since one cannot
go far without food, and Thirlwell did not see why he
should not carry on the game Stormont had meant to
play. He told Drummond his plan.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said the latter thoughtfully, "I guess his
packers will be asleep in camp, but we want to get
there before he does and he's gone off first."</p>


<p class="dgp">"He'll go round by the log he talked about and I
don't think he's able to walk very fast. Then we'll
save some time by going through the creek."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's so," Drummond agreed. "We'd better
hustle."</p>

<p class="dgp">They crossed the mouth of the creek, wading among
the boulders and swimming a few yards, and then followed
the edge of the lake. They could see for some
distance across the water, but the woods were dark and
Stormont would have some trouble in making his way
through the brush. He would be behind them if he
came down to the lake, but it was obvious that they
must carry out their plans before he arrived.</p>

<p class="dgp">When Thirlwell thought they were near the camp
they left the beach and crept cautiously into the darkness
among the trees that grew upon a rocky point.
Now and then the underbrush rustled and a low branch
cracked, but they heard nothing when they stopped and
listened. After a few minutes they reached the other
side of the point and lay down among the stones. In
front, a narrow bay opened, with the shadowy bush
running round. Two canoes lay on the beach, and
although they were black and indistinct, Thirlwell
imagined they had only been pulled up a few feet.</p>

<p class="dgp">Farther back, the glow of a fire flickered among
the trunks, but it was a small fire and burned low and
red. Stormont had, no doubt, given orders that no
smoke must be made. A tent, half seen in the gloom,
stood at the edge of the bush, but Thirlwell could not
see the packers. It looked as if they were asleep, because
all was quiet except for the wind in the trees and
the distant splash of the creek. The breeze was light
but blew off the shore. This would suit Thirlwell's

plan, but it would be difficult not to make some noise
and he must not be caught. The packers were rough
men and he rather thought he had taken a risk he
ought not to have run.</p>

<p class="dgp">Touching Drummond's arm, he slid down a slab
of rock and crouched in the gloom on the ledge below.
His boots had scratched the stone, and he
listened when Drummond came down, but there was
no movement in the camp. Dropping from the ledge,
he reached the shingle, which rattled sharply, and for
a moment or two he stopped and held his breath. He
heard nothing, and making Drummond a sign to be
cautious, went on again. They were now confronted
by perhaps the most dangerous part of their task, for
one cannot cross a stony beach in silence and men used
to the wilds are easily wakened by a suspicious noise.
Besides, the water glimmered, and Thirlwell would
have liked a darker background.</p>

<p class="dgp">Still he meant to reach the canoes, and moved on,
leaning forward to shorten his height and stepping as
gently as he could. When the stones rattled he and
Drummond sank down and waited, but heard nothing
to alarm them, and at length stopped and lay down beside
the canoes. They could not be seen now, but
what they must do next was risky, and Thirlwell
wanted to get his breath. Although he had not used
much muscular exertion, his nerves tingled and his face
was wet with sweat.</p>

<p class="dgp">After a few moments, he got on his knees and felt
inside the canoe. It had not been unloaded and this
was the craft to launch, although the weight would
make a difference. Lying down again, he felt along
the keel and found that the gravel was small and

mixed with sand. Then he touched something round
and knew that a roller had been put under the canoe
in order that she might be pulled up without disturbing
the cargo. This was a stroke of luck, because it
would help him to run her down.</p>

<p class="dgp">He touched Drummond, and getting up seized the
gunwale. They strained their muscles, but for a moment
or two could not move the craft; then the roller
jarred across a stone, there was a crunch of gravel,
and she stopped, a foot lower down. Thirlwell gasped
and moved his hands to get another grip. He thought
they had made an alarming noise, but it was too late
to be cautious. They must finish the job.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Lift her as you shove!" he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">She went a yard, with the roller jolting in the sand,
and there was a splash as her after-end took the water.
He could not understand why the packers had not wakened,
but there was no movement in the camp, and the
next effort would be easier, since the stern was nearly
afloat.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Again!" he gasped. "Quietly, but with all your
strength!"</p>

<p class="dgp">The roller ran smoothly and they followed the canoe
down. When their feet were in the water they gave
her a last push and small ripples splashed about them
as she slid out on the lake. The impetus would carry
her some distance and the off-shore breeze would do the
rest.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I guess we'll light out now," Drummond remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">They regained the point and the camp was quiet.
The canoe was distinguishable, but Thirlwell thought
he would not have seen her had he not known where to
look; it was plain that she was drifting across the lake.

Five minutes later they heard somebody coming
through the bush, and dropped behind a boulder.
They could not see the man, but heard him push
through a thicket and then stumble among some stones.
He passed, and when they went on again Drummond
laughed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Looks as if he was pretty savage, but he's hitting
up a smarter clip than I thought he could make. Guess
he'll feel worse in the morning."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell agreed. The canoe would be out of sight
when Stormont reached the camp, and it was unlikely
that he would miss her until next day. She was, no
doubt, loaded with food and prospecting tools, and
Thirlwell had gained an important advantage by setting
her adrift, since Stormont would not venture farther
north without supplies. He had probably some stores
in camp and would find the canoe, but if she stranded
on a beach far up the lake, the search might cost some
time. The delay would give Thirlwell a longer start.</p>

<p class="dgp">He had fitted the new planks in his canoes and when
he got back wakened the <em>Metis</em> and melted the caulking
gum. By daybreak the seams were hard and after
a hurried breakfast the party paddled across the lake.
He would sooner have waited to see if Stormont would
try to retaliate, but this would be rash. If the canoes
were damaged or he were injured, it might prevent
him from getting back to record the claims.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXIX&mdash;GEORGE REPROACHES HIMSELF</h3>

<p class="noindent">The days were getting shorter fast, but the evening
was warm when George Strange leaned
against the rails of Farnam's veranda. He had arrived,
looking anxious, as supper was served, but did
not state why he felt disturbed and Mrs. Farnam
waited. She knew he had come to consult her, and
thought she knew what about. Now he gazed moodily
across the orchard, where red and yellow apples
gleamed on the bent branches. The slanting sunbeams
struck across the trees, which melted, farther off, into
the blue shadow of the bush.</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's a great show of fruit," he remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Pretty good," Farnam agreed. "Reports indicate
that packers won't find much surplus for shipping
in the United States, and prices will be high. In fact,
I rather think my speculation is justified. Although
clearing new ground and buying young trees made a
drain on my capital&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Don't tell him he's enterprising! He's too adventurous,"
interrupted Mrs. Farnam, who wanted to give
George a lead. "It's exciting to take chances, but
they don't always turn out as one hopes. But how's
your business? I understand trade is dull."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have known it better, but that's not bothering
me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Still as you don't look serene, I imagine something
is bothering you."</p>


<p class="dgp">"I don't feel serene, and that's why I came. You
know Agatha better than anybody else. Have you
heard from her recently?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not since the letter she sent me when she reached
the mine, and you saw that. I'm getting anxious.
She has stopped some time and the school has reopened."</p>

<p class="dgp">"She has stopped too long," said George, whose
face got red. "It looks as if you didn't know they
had filled her post."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I was afraid they might do so, but it's a shock all
the same. But perhaps you can do something. You
persuaded the principal and managers when Agatha
was ill."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I've come from Toronto and I saw the principal,"
George replied. "Couldn't get at anybody else and
imagine they didn't want to see me."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well?" said Mrs. Farnam when he stopped with
some embarrassment.</p>

<p class="dgp">"She was very polite, with the kind of politeness
that freezes you. Didn't say much&mdash;nothing that I
could get hold of and deny. But she implied a lot."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You can be frank. I believe I'm Agatha's oldest
friend and I trust my husband with all I know."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well; I've got to talk. Miss Southern began
by supposing I had come to explain my sister's neglect
of her duty, which had made things awkward at the
school. I said I had not; I didn't know why Agatha
had not come back, but had no doubt it was because
she found it impossible. She'd gone off on an excursion
into the northern bush, and accidents happened.
One lost one's canoes and provisions ran out.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Miss Southern said it was plain that as Agatha had

important duties she ought not to run such a risk, and
asked what was the object of the excursion.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I said it was a prospecting trip. Agatha had
gone to find some silver ore; and Miss Southern gave
me a look that made me mad. It hinted that she
thought my statement much too thin! Then she remarked
that the managers felt that their teachers must
concentrate on their work and divided interests made
for slackness. In short, as Agatha had not come back,
they had got somebody else to take her post.</p>

<p class="dgp">"That was a knock, but I said I supposed they'd give
her a first-rate testimonial if she applied for another
job.</p>

<p class="dgp">"She looked as if she didn't want to hurt me, but
admitted that they would be willing to state that Agatha
had ability and taught science well. Then she
stopped and I asked if she could go no farther.
Ability wasn't all a teacher needed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"She said she must agree, and hinted that she had
expected much from Agatha, but felt badly disappointed
now. She remarked that managers made
searching inquiries when they engaged a teacher for
young girls and thought I could understand that she
felt responsible&mdash;</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, I'd had enough. I said my sister was fit
for a better job than the best they'd got and wouldn't
bother them for a recommendation. Then I left;
thought I'd better quit before I let myself go."
George paused and wiped his hot face. "You see
how I was fixed? I could have bluffed a man into
making a plain statement and then have knocked him
out; but that cool, polite lady made me hate my helplessness."</p>


<p class="dgp">"You were at a disadvantage," Mrs. Farnam
agreed with a smile that was half amused and half
sympathetic. "But I wonder who told her! Do you
think that fellow Stormont&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm going to find out," George said grimly. "In
the meantime, it's not important. I reckon you understand
what this thing implies? If these people
won't support Agatha's application, she can't get another
post. She'd have made her mark teaching, but
now all that's gone; she's turned down, and I'm responsible!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are not to blame. I wonder whether she
really knew the risk?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"She knew she'd lose her job, but it wouldn't stop
her; Agatha's like that! Anyhow, I am to blame,"
George rejoined. "I'm the head of the family and
ought to have made her cut out the blamed foolish
notion. I knew what the lode meant to my mother
and how she hated to hear the old man talk about it.
It took him&mdash;and now it's got my sister&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">He stopped, struggling with emotion, and Mrs. Farnam
said:</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps I ought to have given Agatha a plainer
hint; but, except for school managers, we're not very
conventional people in this country. Then I liked
her pluck. It's weak to give way to the prejudices of
censorious folks. Besides, in a sense, she really
wasn't rash."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's not the trouble," George replied with heat.
"I know my sister; so do you! But she's got to start
business since she can't teach school, and I hate to
think of her clerking in a store. She has talent and
ambition."</p>


<p class="dgp">"Talent will make its way anywhere," Farnam remarked
consolingly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know! Agatha's proud and has no use for
the cheap tricks that help you get ahead of the other
man. She won't advertise her smartness and she's
too dignified to snatch at chances among the scrambling
crowd. I've pushed through; but it has put
some marks on me, and I'm most afraid my sister's
going to be hurt."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You're taking it for granted she won't find the
lode," Farnam resumed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Shucks!" said George with scorn. "All the comfort
I've got is knowing she won't have the money to
waste on looking for the ore again&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">He stopped and listened to a rattle of wheels.
"Some of your friends coming? Don't mean to be
rude, but I hope they're not. I'm not in a mood to
talk to strangers."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We expect nobody," Farnam replied. "I ordered
some goods from Kingston, and Gordon's man
promised to bring them from the depot if they came."</p>

<p class="dgp">The rattle got louder, but the trees hid the rig,
which was approaching the back of the house. It
stopped, there were steps in the hall, and Mrs. Farnam
turned with an exclamation. Farnam pushed his chair
back and George sprang upright as Agatha came out
on the veranda.</p>

<p class="dgp">She was very brown and thin; her clothes were new,
but obviously cheap and the fit was bad. As she
glanced at the group she smiled and there was nothing
in her tranquil manner to indicate the repentant
prodigal. She kissed Mrs. Farnam and gave George
her hand.</p>


<p class="dgp">"It really looks as if you were rather surprised than
pleased," she remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We're both," said Mrs. Farnam. "But how did
you come? It's some time since the Toronto train got
in. George has been here nearly an hour."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your neighbor's hired man drove me from the
station. I came by Amprior and Prescott; there was
a wash-out on the Sudbury track. But what was
George doing at Toronto?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Looking after your business," George replied.
"I'm afraid you've got to brace up. They told me
you were fired!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha laughed. "I expected something like that!
It really doesn't matter."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It doesn't matter!" George exclaimed, and gasped
with indignation. "Anyhow, it matters to me. I've
been fuming and fretting since I saw your principal."
He turned to the others, as if for support. "What
can you do with a girl who talks in this way? How'm
I to make her understand?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think you had better wait a little," Mrs. Farnam
said and glanced at Agatha. "But did you travel in
those clothes, my dear? Where did you buy them?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"At a bush store," said Agatha, smiling. "They
were not as cheap as they look, and my others had
worn to rags. Besides, I hadn't much time, and it
wasn't worth while to bother about my dress."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You don't seem to bother about much," George
remarked. "In fact, you've come back with a lordly
calm that's as exasperating as it's unjustifiable."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha gave him a thoughtful look. "Is Florence
well?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Quite well. She's disturbed about you."</p>


<p class="dgp">"Then it's probably business! I suppose trade is
bad?"</p>

<p class="dgp">George lost his self-control. He was glad to see her
back, but remembered what he had suffered for her
sake.</p>

<p class="dgp">"My business doesn't occupy all my thoughts and
you have made a blamed poor joke! Here am I and
your friends, trying to grapple with an awkward situation
and puzzling how we're to help you out, and you
<em>laugh</em>. So far as I can see, there's nothing
humorous&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Don't be cross," Agatha interrupted. "I don't
need helping out. If business isn't very good, I can
offer you a post."</p>

<p class="dgp">George made an abrupt movement and looked hard
at her. Farnam laughed softly, and his wife leaned
forward.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You see, I've found the lode. It's richer than I
thought," Agatha resumed.</p>

<p class="dgp">There was silence for a few moments, and then
George said: "I want time to get hold of this. You
found the ore the old man talked about! It's not another
stupid joke?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not at all. Father located the vein on his last
journey and left a paper with directions. Mr. Thirlwell
found it in his tobacco-box. The directions were
not complete and we had some trouble&mdash;but we'll talk
about this later. The claim is recorded and Mr. Thirlwell
has gone back to begin the development. Mr.
Scott, his employer, is coming to see you."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said George dully, "I'll own I've got a
knock. I reckoned if there was a lode, it would never
be found. Looks as if I didn't know as much as I

thought. But that's not all. Since I was old enough
to guess my mother's fears I did the old man wrong.
He's made good. I doubted, but you knew him best
and you believed."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Agatha's tired," Mrs. Farnam broke in. "She
needs a rest and I'm going to get her some food. You
can ask her what you like when I bring her back."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I suppose you want to satisfy your curiosity first,"
Farnam suggested.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We're not going to talk about <em>mining</em>," Mrs. Farnam
rejoined. "However, I must do you justice; you
took Agatha's side from the first. After all, your
judgment's good now and then."</p>

<p class="dgp">She took Agatha away and when they had gone
George remarked: "I can't grip the thing yet. It's
hard to get rid of a fixed idea you've had from boyhood.
Still I ought to have known that Agatha
wouldn't undertake a job she couldn't put over."</p>

<p class="dgp">It was getting dark when Mrs. Farnam and the girl
came back, and George said, "Now I want to know
all about your trip. Begin where you left the cars
and go right on."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That will take some time," Mrs. Farnam interposed.
"Shall I light the lamp in the room?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think not," said Agatha, and smiled. "My
story goes best with the twilight in the open. We had
no lamps and pretty furniture in the bush."</p>

<p class="dgp">She was silent for a few moments, looking across
the orchard. The fruit trees were blurred and dim
and the pines were black, but the sky shone softly red
and green above their ragged tops. Then she began
to talk; disjointedly at first, but the scenes she recalled
got clearer as she went on, and she forgot her

audience. It was her business to make things plain;
she had studied this part of her vocation and unconsciously
used her power to seize and hold the other's
interest, but she did not know that she was drawing a
lifelike portrait of her guide. Mrs. Farnam knew, and
with a tactful question here and there led the girl forward.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was, however, impossible to relate her journey
and leave Thirlwell out. He took the leading part
that belonged to him, and his character was firmly
outlined by her memory of the things he had said and
done. With something besides artistic talent Agatha
unconsciously developed the sketch, dwelling upon his
cheerfulness, courage, and resource. She told the
others how he had nerved her to resolute effort when
they had difficulties to overcome, sympathized when
she was tired, and held the confidence of his men.
Moreover, she made it obvious that there had been no
romantic philandering. He had given her an unselfish,
brotherly protection.</p>

<p class="dgp">The narrative lost something of its force after she
came to the finding of the broken range. She saw
she had been franker than she thought, and the change
in Thirlwell could not be talked about. It was dark
now, the red and green had faded above the trees, and
she was grateful for the gloom. She was not afraid
of George and Farnam, but did not want Mabel to
study her. Only the latter noted that she paused
awkwardly now and then and added a rather involved
explanation. The men were engrossed by Thirlwell's
efforts to find the ore. When she stopped they were
quiet for a few moments.</p>

<p class="dgp">Then George said: "You would never have struck

the lode without that man." He turned to the others.
"Some story of a prospecting trip! What do you
think?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think Agatha was very lucky," Mrs. Farnam
said with meaning. "Perhaps luckier than she deserved."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thirlwell's all right," George bluntly agreed, and
then addressed Agatha: "You have often got after
me about being a business man, and I'll own I don't
let many chances of making a dollar pass. But this
thing goes back of business. Thirlwell's entitled to
half of all you get."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha was moved. She had found out some time
since that she had not always understood George.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I offered him half," she said and paused. "He
wouldn't accept."</p>

<p class="dgp">Mrs. Farnam, seeing the girl was embarrassed, got
up. "I'm cold. We had better go in."</p>

<p class="dgp">When she had lighted the lamp, Farnam went out
and came back with a tray of bottles and glasses.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's not often we celebrate an event like this," he
said as he opened a bottle. "We have no wine, but
this is some of our own hard cider that I meant to send
to the Fruit-Growers' Exhibition. There's nothing
else good enough."</p>

<p class="dgp">He filled the glasses and with a few happy words
wished Agatha success. She thanked him and afterwards
stood up, very straight but silent, and with her
eyes shining softly lifted her glass above her head.
The others lifted theirs, in grave quietness, for they
knew what she meant. The pioneers touch the ridge-pole
of the tent, or the roof-tree of the shack, when
they drink to the memory of comrades who have gone

out on the last lone trail. But George's look was
troubled and his hand shook.</p>

<p class="dgp">"He made good," he said, and added, when they
had drunk and Farnam refilled the glasses: "Here's
to the man who helped you prove it; the man who
did my job!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Mrs. Farnam studied Agatha and noted the softness
of her look. Then she took the girl away and
some time afterwards, when they were talking in her
room, remarked: "There's an obvious end to your
romance, my dear. I suppose you're going to marry
Thirlwell?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha blushed, but gave her a steady glance.
"He has not asked me."</p>

<p class="dgp">Mrs. Farnam pondered this and then made a sign
of understanding. "I think I see; the man is white,
although perhaps he's foolishly proud. In fact, I
imagine he's worth one's taking some trouble about&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">She stopped, seeing Agatha's frown, and then resumed
with a smile: "No; I'm not going to meddle!
It's better to wait. He's a man, after all; you really
have some charm, and human nature's strong."</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXX&mdash;A Change Of Luck</h3>

<p class="noindent">Scott met George at Montreal, and after spending
some days there left for New York. When
he stated the time of his return, George sent for Agatha
and in the evening they went to meet him at the
Grand Trunk Station. As they walked down the hill
and by the Cathedral, Agatha felt excited. She had
soon discovered that it was one thing to find a silver
vein and another to raise the capital one required to
open up the mine and refine the ore. The cost of these
operations, as calculated by Scott, seemed enormous,
and people rich enough to help either wanted the
largest share of the profit or were frankly skeptical.
George had got promises of some support, but much depended
on the result of Scott's visit to his wealthy
friends.</p>

<p class="dgp">It was dark when they walked up and down outside
the platform gates; the train was late, and Agatha tried
to control her nervous impatience. She could trust
George's judgment about money matters and she liked
Scott, but she had got a habit of looking to Thirlwell
when difficulties must be met, and he could not help
her now. He was in the North, where winter would
soon begin, doing her work with drill and giant powder.
It was good work that demanded strength and courage
and knowledge of Nature's laws; she would have liked
to have been there with him, instead of in the city

where one must grapple with commercial subtleties.</p>

<p class="dgp">By and by a bell tolled, there was a harsh rattle as
the cars rolled in, and a few moments later Scott
pushed through the crowd at the gate. Agatha went
to meet him under a big lamp and saw by his look that
he had been successful.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I have fixed things and imagine you'll approve," he
said, as she gave him her hand.</p>

<p class="dgp">"That's a relief," George remarked. "We'll talk
about it when we've got some supper."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott laughed. "I think we'll call it dinner to-night.
I'm suffering from a natural reaction after our
Spartan habits at the mine, and believe the occasion
indicates the Place Viger. In fact, I telegraphed
about a table and rooms."</p>

<p class="dgp">They drove across the city, and Agatha looked about
with some amusement and curiosity as she ate her dinner
among wealthy English and American tourists in
the big dining-room. George had taken her to a hotel
of another kind that catered for small business
men, but she hoped Scott's fastidious choice of the
wines and the late flowers he had ordered were justified.
As she studied some of the other women's
clothes and contrasted them with hers, he looked up
with a twinkle.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's obvious that Toronto can hold its own with
London, Paris, and New York," he said. "However,
if you're fond of diamonds and such ornaments, there's
no reason you should exercise much self-denial."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know if I'm fond of diamonds or not. I
have never had any," Agatha replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well, they're quite unnecessary, but you'll soon
be able to have them if you like. Your brother is

plainly cautious; it will be your privilege to enlarge his
views."</p>

<p class="dgp">George smiled rather grimly. "Agatha and I were
brought up in a shabby frame house behind a store and
learned to think of cents instead of dollars. Our
father made some sacrifice to start us well; I know
what it cost him now."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Perhaps we had better tell Miss Strange what we
have done. When they have brought us our coffee
we'll find a quiet place where we can talk."</p>

<p class="dgp">Some minutes later they sat down at a small table:
behind a pillar in a spacious room, and Scott took out
a bundle of documents.</p>

<p class="dgp">"This is the first meeting of the <em>Agatha Mine Company</em>,
and it's proper that Miss Strange should be our
chairman. To begin with, we must appoint executive
officials and the president comes first. I think the
place belongs to Mr. Strange."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said George, "the treasurer's my job. You
want a business man to keep a tight hand on the
money."</p>

<p class="dgp">They looked at Agatha, who made a sign of agreement.
"Mr. Scott will be president."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well. The next is the general manager.
Thirlwell's the best man I know."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I appointed him some time since," Agatha replied.
"It's his post as long as he likes, and he ought to be
paid better than anybody else."</p>

<p class="dgp">George glanced humorously at Scott. Agatha's
manner was imperious and her voice resolute. It
looked is if she meant to use her new authority. Scott
nodded and gave her a document.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The shareholders may have something to say about

these appointments later. In the meantime, this is a
draft of our constitution. I must state that we could
have kept all the profit if we had borrowed the money
we need, but we should have had to pay high interest.
On the whole, it seemed better to float a small company;
just large enough, in fact, to get the protection
the law allows a registered joint-stock body. We find
we can get the money easier in this way, and it divides
the risk. You will see that a large block of shares is
reserved for yourself and your brother; I take some in
payment for the men and supplies I am sending Thirlwell;
and a number will be allotted at about ninety, to
the people who find the cash."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha studied the document and gave it to George.
"What does issuing the stock at ninety mean?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ninety cents for the dollar's worth of stock,"
George explained. "That's a ten per cent. margin
when it touches face value and it will soon go higher."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I see," said Agatha. "But the mine is ours, and
by parting with these shares we lose control."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not altogether," Scott replied. "Every share carries
a vote. You and your brother hold a large block,
and the friends I've persuaded to join us will vote with
me. Of course, if anybody bought up the most part
of the other shares, he could give us trouble, but that's
not likely. When it's obvious that we're making a
good profit none of the holders will be willing to sell.
In the meantime, some of the people are sending up a
mining expert, and if they're satisfied with his opinion
they'll give us the money."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I suppose it's a good arrangement," said Agatha.
"But before I agree you must send the draft to Thirlwell."</p>


<p class="dgp">"It might mean some delay. However, I expect
he'll come down from the mine to meet the expert, and
if you insist&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I do insist," said Agatha. "I can do nothing until
I know what my manager thinks."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott promised to mail the document, and Agatha
remarked: "When the people have taken up the
shares there will be some left."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That is so," said George. "It may be convenient
later; I dare say we will want more money when
we begin the smelting, but we'll probably be able to
issue the stock at a dollar then. In fact, I reckon we'll
presently have to ask for power to extend our capital."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You must only sell this reserve block to people
you can trust," said Agatha, who began to ask questions
about the mine.</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott was surprised to find how much she knew, but
he told her all he could and it was late in the evening
when the party broke up.</p>

<p class="dgp">The engineer whom the subscribers sent North returned
with a satisfactory report, and Thirlwell got
to work. He had much to do, and although he was
undecided about the future, resolved to stay until he
had opened up the vein. From the beginning he had
to grapple with numerous obstacles, for when he
drove his adit the water broke in and the rock was
treacherous. Still he had tunneled far enough to
escape the frost when winter began, and the snow that
stopped all surface work made transport easier. One
could travel straight across divides and frozen lakes,
and the sledges ran smoothly on the ice. When the
trail south was broken he built shacks at the camping

places and kept a gang of half-breeds felling trees and
improving the road.</p>

<p class="dgp">After some months, he found it necessary to visit
the railroad settlement, and reaching it one evening,
tired and numbed by cold, followed his sledge to the
hotel in a thoughtful mood. For one thing, he must
write to Strange, whose last letter had hinted that he
was anxious, and it would be hard to send an encouraging
report. The ore was good, but the vein was thin
and expensive to work. In fact, the working cost was
much higher than he had thought. When he entered
the hotel he was dazzled by the light, and the sudden
change of temperature made him dizzy. He stopped,
wondering whether his eyes had deceived him, as a
man dressed in clothes that were obviously English
came forward.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Hallo, Jim!" said the latter.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Allott!" exclaimed Thirlwell. "What are you
doing here?"</p>

<p class="dgp">The other laughed. "I left Helen at New York.
She's going to Florida for the winter with her American
friends and I thought I'd look you up before I
followed. I've news, but it will keep until you have
had some food."</p>

<p class="dgp">Had Thirlwell not been an important man, he would
probably have had to wait until next morning for a
meal, but the landlord's wife bustled about and supper
was soon on the table. There were no other guests,
and when Thirlwell's appetite was satisfied he and
Allott pulled their chairs to the stove. The floor was
not covered, the rough board walls were cracked, and
a tarry liquid dripped from the bend where the stovepipe
pierced the ceiling.</p>


<p class="dgp">"The hotel is not luxurious and they have very
crude ideas about cookery, but they tried to suit my
fastidious taste when I told them I was a friend of
yours," Allott remarked. "However, I don't suppose
you are remarkably comfortable at the mine,
and you can change all this when you like."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell looked puzzled and Allott resumed:
"You haven't opened your mail yet and I didn't suggest
it, because I wanted to talk to you first. I wonder
whether it will be a shock to hear that Sir James
is dead?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm sorry," Thirlwell answered. "I think he'd
have been kinder if I'd let him. Perhaps I ought to
have indulged him more than I did; but I was obstinate,
and&mdash;well, you know, he was harsh to my father&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">Allott made a sign of comprehension. "He died
six weeks since and left Helen most of his money;
but he didn't cut you out."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell moved abruptly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I expected nothing!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"That was obvious," Allott remarked with some
dryness. "Sir James was very sore when you refused
to come back, but he came round after a time.
When he was ill he told Helen it was refreshing to
find a man who could not be bought, and you were
probably better fitted for roughing it in Canada than
the career he had planned for you. He added that he
doubted if there were many like you in that country.
Still I think if you had married Evelyn, you'd have
got a larger share."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," said Thirlwell, "I had forgotten Evelyn!
Is she with Helen?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Your admission's significant. Evelyn married

Campbell&mdash;you remember him? However, you don't
seem very curious about your legacy."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I was thinking about my quarrel with Sir James,"
Thirlwell replied. "But I am curious."</p>

<p class="dgp">Allott told him about the will and Thirlwell mused
for some minutes. His share was not very large,
but he had expected nothing, and since he had known
Agatha he had felt the strain of poverty. He was not
rich now, but his handicap was lighter and he began
to see a ray of hope. Then he opened a letter from
the English lawyers and asked Allott some questions.</p>

<p class="dgp">After a time Allott said, "Helen rather felt she
was robbing you when she heard the will and she was
excited when you told us about the mine. I hope the
ore is as good as you thought."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The ore is good, but difficult to work. Then I'm
only manager; I hold no shares."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you wished, you could buy enough to give you
some control."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes; I shall do so, now I'm able."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said Allott, "Helen sent me to look you
up and gave me a message. This money was something
of a surprise, and after building a vinery and
buying a new car, she doesn't know what to do with it.
I pointed out that it could be invested on good security
at three or four per cent., but she declares this is not
enough. In short, she's resolved that you are to use
the money to develop your mine, but she ordered me
to mention that she expects a handsome profit."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell smiled, although he was moved. He
knew Mrs. Allott had tried to help him before, and it
was plain that she had not resented his refusing her
aid.</p>


<p class="dgp">"I think I see," he answered. "Helen's very kind.
We ought to make a profit, but there's a risk."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Helen likes a risk. She's something of a gambler;
for that matter, so am I. Besides, although you
disappointed her once, she has a rather remarkable
confidence in you. Now have you, so to speak, a
sporting chance?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"The situation's much like this," said Thirlwell
thoughtfully; "the ore's rich, but I expect we'll spend
all our money before we get results that would encourage
the subscribers and warrant our asking for more
capital."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then if you and Helen invested, it would enable
your friends to carry on, and perhaps qualify you for
a director's post?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes. I shall invest, but don't know that I'd be
justified in using Helen's money yet. However, suppose
you come up and look at the mine. The journey's
not so rough now we have broken the trail and
put up rest-shacks at the camps."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thanks," said Allott. "I hoped you were going
to ask me."</p>

<p class="dgp">They started in a few days and Allott spent a week
at the mine. On the evening before he left, he sat
talking with Thirlwell in the shack. The frost was
arctic outside, but the night was calm, and the corner
they occupied by the red-hot stove was comfortable.</p>

<p class="dgp">"What about Helen's money?" Allott asked.
"I'm not a miner, but the assay reports look remarkably
good, and I imagine you'll get over your engineering
troubles."</p>

<p class="dgp">"The financial troubles are the worst," Thirlwell rejoined.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Then why not take the money?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell pondered. It was his duty to help Agatha,
and Mrs. Allott's offer, by making this easier,
would enable him to earn the girl's gratitude. He
meant to invest his share of the legacy, but felt that
he ought not to risk his relative's capital for his private
gain.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'll know better how we stand when we get the
new machines to work. Then, if I think it's pretty
safe, I'll buy some shares for Helen."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," said Allott. "I'll open an account for
you at the Bank of Montreal, and Helen will give you
legal power to act for her. This will enable you to
command her proxy if you want to vote at a shareholders'
meeting. If you don't use the money, she
will get better interest than in England."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell thanked him and Allott began to talk about
something else.</p>

<p class="dgp">The latter left the mine next morning and when
he had gone Thirlwell occupied himself in strenuous
and often dangerous work. He felt he had to some
extent misled Agatha and Strange. Expenses had outrun
his calculations and he had encountered obstacles
he had not foreseen. More money would soon be
needed, and he must get results that would encourage
its subscription and warrant his using Mrs. Allott's
capital.</p>

<p class="dgp">Sometimes the adit roof came down and sometimes
the sides crushed in; the inclination of the vein was
irregular and the dip was often awkwardly steep.
Then the pines about the mine were small and damaged
by wind and forest-fires. It was difficult to find
timber that would bear a heavy strain, and Thirlwell

walked long distances in the stinging frost to look
for proper logs, and now and then camped with his
choppers behind a snowbank. For all that, he made
progress, and as he pushed on the adit his confidence in
the vein grew stronger. Expenses were heavy, but the
ore would pay for all.</p>

<p class="dgp">He grew thin and rather haggard. Sleeping in the
snow one night with half-dried moccasins, he found
his foot frozen when he awoke, and the dead part
galled. He limped as he went about the mine, and
soon afterwards his hand was nipped by a machine
and the wound would not heal. He held on, however;
meeting his troubles cheerfully and encouraging
his men, and the ore-dump began to grow.</p>

<p class="dgp">His party was not alone, for soon after he got to
work three men drove in their stakes behind his block
of claims. They went south to file their records, and
returning with several more, began the development
the law required. Others followed, and the neighborhood
was soon dotted with tents and discovery
posts; but, for the most part, the men were satisfied
with blasting a few holes in the surface of their claims.
One or two experienced miners talked to Thirlwell,
and agreeing that the ore could only be reached from
the ground owned by Agatha's Company, abandoned
their holdings and went back; the others waited for a
time, and then returned, disappointed, when their food
was exhausted.</p>

<p class="dgp">The first arrivals, however, stayed and had opened
two or three rude shafts before the frost began. Then,
instead of leaving, as Thirlwell expected, they brought
up provisions and built a log shack. It was plain that
they meant to hold the claims and Thirlwell was

puzzled, because he saw the men were miners and
thought they knew their labor was thrown away. He
imagined that Stormont had sent them, but could not
see the latter's object. The fellow could hardly expect
to reach the inclined vein except at a depth that
would make it extremely expensive to work, and Thirlwell
had improved his own and the adjoining claims
enough to protect them legally from encroachment.
Still Stormont was unscrupulous and it was possible
he had some cunning plan for embarrassing the company.
Thirlwell felt disturbed, but he had no grounds
for interfering with the men, and although their relations
were rather strained when they met, he left
them alone.</p>

<h3 class="dgp">Chapter XXXI&mdash;Thirlwell's Reward</h3>

<p class="noindent">Winter was nearly over when, one evening,
George and Scott arrived at the Farnam homestead
where Agatha was a guest. The house was centrally
heated, and when the party gathered in Mrs.
Farnam's pretty, warm room, Agatha wondered what
Thirlwell was doing in the frozen North. Farnam
had invested some money in the mine, and Agatha
knew George had come to talk about the company's
business.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Things are not going well with us," he said presently.
"Our money's nearly spent and Thirlwell has
not been able to get out much ore. I think I told you
he suspected Stormont sent the men who staked the
claims behind our block, and the fellow's now getting
on our track. He's been to see Gardner, Leeson, and
one or two others."</p>

<p class="dgp">"It would be awkward if they turned us down,"
Farnam remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha waited. She knew Gardner and Leeson
held a number of the shares, but she did not understand
the matter yet.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very awkward," George agreed. "I went to
Leeson, and although he didn't say much, I reckon
Stormont wants to buy his stock. He allowed that he
and Gardner were not satisfied about our prospects,

and I couldn't give him much ground for holding on.
Then I went to Hill, who said he'd got an offer for
his stock and meant to sell, but wouldn't name the
buyer. I suspected Stormont again, but we won't
know until we get the transfer form."</p>

<p class="dgp">"One could head him off by bidding higher for the
shares," Farnam suggested. "Still I suppose it's impossible.
Anyhow, I have no more money."</p>

<p class="dgp">"That applies to all of us," George said dryly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha smiled, for the situation had a touch of
ironical humor. In a sense, she was rich, but she was
forced to practise stern economy and had not the
means to defend her wealth.</p>

<p class="dgp">"But what is Stormont's plan?" she asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know," said George. "That's the worst,
because it's a sure thing he has a plan. When he's
ready he'll get after us."</p>

<p class="dgp">"For revenge?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not altogether, I think," Scott replied. "He has
a pick on you and Thirlwell, but it's money he wants.
If he could let you down when he got the money, it
would, no doubt, add to his satisfaction."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If he bought up a large number of the shares, it
would give him a dangerous power," Agatha said
thoughtfully. "Besides, he might persuade some of
the other people to vote with him. It's unlucky we
issued so many shares, although, of course, we needed
the capital."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott made a sign of agreement. "We kept a block
large enough to give us control unless nearly all the
other holders voted against us, which we could not
expect. The trouble is, that our difficulties at the mine
have made them anxious. Stormont has probably

worked on this, but it's hard to see how he means to
use the people."</p>

<p class="dgp">For some time they puzzled about Stormont's object,
but could not find a clue, and by and by Agatha
said, "You must write to Mr. Thirlwell."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Thirlwell's job is to get out the ore, and we're up
against things now because he hasn't done as much as
we expected," George replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha's eyes sparkled. "He has done all that was
possible. You must write to him."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Very well," said George, and began to talk about
something else.</p>

<br>

<p class="noindent">A week or two later Stormont bought a large number
of shares, but this was all, and the snow was beginning
to melt when George got an ominous hint that the
other's plans had matured. Stormont telephoned asking
if he would meet him and a few of the shareholders
at Montreal to talk about an important matter,
and George fixed a day a week ahead. Then he went
to see Agatha.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's lucky Mr. Thirlwell is coming down," she said.
"Telegraph for somebody to meet him and tell him to
be quick. He must get to Montreal for the meeting."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I doubt if he can get through in time and don't see
what he can do if he comes," George objected.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Don't argue, but send the telegram. He has always
been able to do something when there was a difficulty
to be met," Agatha rejoined; and George did as
she ordered.</p>

<p class="dgp">On the day of the meeting she joined George and
Scott at Montreal and felt a pang of disappointment
when she found Thirlwell had not arrived.</p>


<p class="dgp">"Your messenger couldn't have gone far, and a
number of things may have delayed Thirlwell, but I
know he'll come," she said to George, who smiled.</p>

<p class="dgp">"He'll come if it's possible; he's an obstinate fellow,"
Scott agreed. "There's a train just before the
meeting. Will you go to the station?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha. "I feel he will be there."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you'll hold us up; that train is often late,"
George grumbled.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Have you got a hint about what Stormont
wants?" Agatha asked Scott.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not yet, but we'll know soon. I expect George
told you Stormont has floated a company to work the
claims his men staked behind our block."</p>

<p class="dgp">They had some hours to wait because the meeting
was in the afternoon, and Agatha found the shops
strangely unattractive; moreover, she did not know if
it would be prudent to buy the things she wanted. In
the afternoon she went to the Canadian-Pacific Station,
and being told the train had left Ottawa late, she
sat down in the neighboring square by the Cathedral.
She was surprised to find that she was nervous, but
this was not altogether because of the money at stake.
Thirlwell had not failed her yet and it would be a painful
shock if he did so now. She had a half-superstitious
feeling that it was important he should come. If
he arrived, all would go well; if not&mdash;but she refused
to follow the thought, and looked at her watch. Only
a few minutes had gone since her last glance and she
tried to conquer her impatience.</p>

<p class="dgp">Her heart beat when she stood beside the platform
gate as the long train rolled in. The cars were
crowded, but she thrilled when Thirlwell jumped down

from a vestibule. He looked thin and tired, but
smiled when she gave him her hand.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm here," he said. "A little late, but the train
was held up by a broken trestle."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are always where you are wanted," Agatha
replied, with a touch of color in her face. "One
trusts people like that."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell said he would get a hack in the square, and
Agatha studied him as they drove across the city.
Sometimes his face was stern, but for the most part,
it wore a look of quiet satisfaction, and once or twice
his eyes twinkled, as if he were amused by something.</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's too bad to hurry you off to an important meeting
when you're tired," she said.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell laughed. "I expect to hold out until the
business is finished. In fact, I'm looking forward to
meeting Mr. Stormont."</p>

<p class="dgp">He had made a long and risky journey over a rough
trail and across rotten ice, and after George's messenger
found him had pushed on as fast as possible
through deep, melting snow, but he did not mean to
talk about this. By and by he gave Agatha a humorous
account of a small accident at the mine, and she
followed his lead. She had felt disturbed and
anxious, but now he had come she could smile. For
all that she was silent when they drove up a shabby
street where the company's office was situated at the
top of an old building.</p>

<p class="dgp">The office had two rooms; one very small, where a
wheat-broker had a desk and combined the secretary's
duties with his regular business. The other was
larger, and when George and Scott went in was occupied
by Stormont, Gardner, and two or three other

gentlemen. George imagined they had come early to
arrange their program.</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are punctual, but I'm sorry I must ask you to
wait," he said. "Miss Strange will not be long and
wishes to be present when we begin. She holds the
largest block of shares."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I suppose Miss Strange must be indulged;
but I don't know that her holding is larger than these
gentlemen's and mine," Stormont replied with a meaning
smile.</p>

<p class="dgp">George saw he had been given a hint, but he and the
others began to talk good-humoredly. All knew that
a struggle was coming, but polite amenities were dignified
and marked one's confidence. By and by the door
opened and Stormont frowned as Thirlwell came in
with Agatha.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We are glad to see Miss Strange, but Mr. Thirlwell
owns none of the company's stock," he said.</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell smiled, in a rather curious way, but said
nothing and Agatha replied: "Mr. Thirlwell is the
manager; I asked him to come."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then I take back my objection," Stormont said
with a bow. "I asked you and Mr. Strange to meet
us so that we could talk informally about some business.
Although we must call a shareholders' meeting
if my suggestions are approved, we hold enough stock
between us to force through any decision at which we
arrive."</p>

<p class="dgp">"To begin with, you had better state whose votes
you command," said George.</p>

<p class="dgp">When Stormont gave the names the secretary opened
the register and then nodded. "If all who are present

and the others Mr. Stormont mentions agree, it
would give a larger majority than our constitution requires."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We'll take it for granted that the gentlemen would
vote as Mr. Stormont directs," said George, who looked
disturbed. "We wait his proposition."</p>

<p class="dgp">"My friends and I are dissatisfied with the way
things are going. No ore has been smelted; and, so
far as we can learn, the quantity in the dump is small.
We are working on an unprofitable scale, and need
more labor and better and more expensive machines.
In short, we need more money. I have no doubt Mr.
Thirlwell will admit this."</p>

<p class="dgp">"A larger capital would be an advantage," Thirlwell
assented dryly.</p>

<p class="dgp">"We can't extend our capital," George objected.
"It was hard work to get the stock we have issued
taken up."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I can show you how the difficulty can be got
over," Stormont resumed. "You know I floated the
Adventurers Company to work the back blocks, and as
the claims haven't come up to our expectations, we have
more money than we can use, while the Agatha Company
has not enough. Well, I propose that you combine
with us on the terms I've drafted. If you don't
approve them all, we'll meet you where we can."</p>

<p class="dgp">He gave George a paper, but Agatha interposed:
"You can take it for granted that we will not make
the combine."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont smiled, deprecatingly. "I'm afraid you
cannot help yourselves, Miss Strange."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha looked at George, whose face got red.</p>


<p class="dgp">"I can understand the Adventurers being anxious
to take us in. Your property is worthless, Mr. Stormont,
and ours is rich."</p>

<p class="dgp">"We're willing to pay."</p>

<p class="dgp">George studied the paper and then threw it down.
"You're willing to pay about a quarter of what the
mine is worth! After reading that document, it's
obvious that you mean to put the screw to us; but
we'll fight."</p>

<p class="dgp">Scott, who glanced at the draft of agreement,
nodded, but Stormont said: "You might make some
trouble, but must be beaten."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Why?" Agatha asked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think your brother knows. Each share in your
company carries a vote; I hold a large block, and the
gentlemen who have promised to support me hold more.
If you force us to call a meeting, we will count you
out."</p>

<p class="dgp">"There are some shares in reserve," said Agatha,
whose eyes sparkled defiantly.</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont smiled. "If you have some rich friends,
you might, of course, persuade them to buy the shares
and vote for you; but you can't sell them in the ordinary
way. I imagine Mr. Strange has tried!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha saw that George had tried when she glanced
at his disturbed face. Then she turned to Thirlwell
and noted, with surprise, that he looked amused. She
could see nothing in the way matters were going that
warranted his humorous twinkle. It looked as if
Stormont would win, and she felt that she was being
robbed to satisfy his greed; but the mine meant more
to her than the money she had expected to get. She
had resolved to make it famous as a monument to her

father; its success was to prove that his life had not
Been wasted in empty dreams.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Investors are a suspicious lot," Stormont went on.
"They don't like to lose their money, and you must
admit that there's not much to encourage buyers of
your shares to run the risk. The ore is rich, but we
are up against obstacles that your manager is obviously
unable to remove. In fact, my scheme ought to work
out for your benefit."</p>

<p class="dgp">The sneer at Thirlwell roused Agatha. "The obstacles
will not vanish if you get control, and you
cannot find a manager who will do as well. Then
the scheme will not benefit me; it is meant to benefit
nobody but you. If your friends are foolish enough
to support it, you will find a way of overreaching
them."</p>

<p class="dgp">George frowned. Agatha's indignation was warranted,
but this was not the line to take at a business
meeting. Then Gardner looked up, rather sharply, as
if the girl's remarks had excited some suspicion that
was already in his mind.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I think you must see that any advantage Mr. Stormont
gains will be shared by the rest."</p>

<p class="dgp">"If you believe this, you are very dull," Agatha
replied.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Anyhow, you'll admit that we are short of money
and don't know where to get it, while to combine with
the Adventurers would supply the needed capital."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Yes," said Agatha. "But Mr. Stormont wants to
take your shares for much less than they are worth.
You can let him have yours, if you like; he shall not
get mine!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you must try to sell them, and you'll find it

difficult," Leeson interposed. "If you force us to call
a meeting, we can carry our scheme."</p>

<p class="dgp">"You are all against me!" Agatha exclaimed, looking
at the others. "You have let Mr. Stormont cajole
you!"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I don't know that we have been <em>cajoled</em>," Leeson
answered with a doubtful smile. "In a sense, however,
we are against you. We are business men and
must protect our interests in the best way we can."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Trusting Mr. Stormont is not the best way," Agatha
rejoined, without regarding Scott's amusement and
George's frown.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I'm afraid we must call the meeting," Gardner
broke in. "We hoped you would have met us, Miss
Strange, because you are bound to lose when we take a
formal vote."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha felt desperate and glanced at Thirlwell; if
he could do nothing else, he could sympathize. He
gave her an encouraging smile as he got up, for he
knew his time had come and had been silent because he
wanted to let Stormont reveal his plans. The latter,
however, obviously meant to leave the argument to his
dupes. Agatha, noting his confidence, remembered
that when they reached the office he had asked her
to wait a few minutes while he talked to the secretary.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mr. Stormont made two rash statements," he said.
"He told us the reserved shares could not be sold, and
that he could count upon a majority."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I object to Mr. Thirlwell's speaking," Stormont
said with some alarm. "We allowed him to stay at
Miss Strange's request, but the manager has no vote."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I imagine Mr. Stormont doesn't know I am a

shareholder. Perhaps the secretary will enlighten
him."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont started, Scott smiled, and George looked
surprised. The others waited anxiously.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Mr. Thirlwell holds a quantity of our stock."</p>

<p class="dgp">"How much?" Stormont asked, and when the secretary
told him, struggled to preserve his calm.</p>

<p class="dgp">"The reserved block is sold," Thirlwell resumed.
"I bought the shares half an hour since for myself and
a friend of mine." He paused and put a stamped
document on the table. "Here's my authority to use
the proxy votes."</p>

<p class="dgp">He sat down and Scott remarked: "I think Mr.
Stormont will admit that the majority has, so to speak,
changed sides!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont examined the register, and then stood by
his chair with his fist clenched. He said nothing, his
supporters looked embarrassed, and Agatha saw that
Thirlwell had saved the situation. Her heart beat
with confused emotion; she had known he would not
fail her.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Well," said George, rather dryly, "do you still
demand a meeting?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Certainly not," said Gardner with frank relief,
and the others murmured agreement. Then he turned
to Agatha: "I'd like you to understand that we took
the line we did because it seemed the only plan. Now,
however, there's no necessity for making the combine."</p>

<p class="dgp">Stormont gave him a savage look. "This means
that you and the others turn me down?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It means that we want to save our money," Gardner
replied, and Stormont, who said nothing, walked
out of the room.</p>


<p class="dgp">His friends seemed relieved when he left and began
to talk to Agatha and George in apologetic tones.
One or two, however, looked thoughtful, and presently
Gardner said: "Mr. Thirlwell has removed the
obstacle that bothered us most and I mean to keep my
stock, although I expect it will be some time before I
get a dividend."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not as long as you think!" Thirlwell remarked.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then you have something to tell us?" said another.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Not yet; I'll make a full report at the shareholders'
meeting. In the meantime, do you think Stormont
will sell out?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"It's possible," said Gardner. "He wanted control.
We knew that, but backed him because it seemed
the safest plan. I guess he knows he's beaten."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then if he offers you his stock, you had better
buy," said Thirlwell, smiling.</p>

<p class="dgp">Gardner looked hard at him, and nodded. "I can
take a hint. What you say goes."</p>

<br>

<p class="noindent">After this the party broke up and Scott gently
pushed George out when he saw that Agatha was waiting
while Thirlwell picked up some papers he had got
from the secretary. When the others had gone, she
gave him her hand and her face flushed.</p>

<p class="dgp">"I wonder whether you know how much you have
helped?"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell kept her hand. "I got some satisfaction
from beating your antagonist."</p>

<p class="dgp">"But you wanted to help me?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"I did," said Thirlwell, with a steady look. "I
was anxious to do something that would make you
happy."</p>


<p class="dgp">Agatha turned her head. "Yet you once refused;
the morning after we found the lode&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"Ah," said Thirlwell, "I fought a pretty hard battle
then! But, you see, I was a poor engineer, and
you&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">She looked up with a smile and blushed. "Do you
think I didn't <em>know</em>? But you were foolish; ridiculously
stupid!"</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell took her other hand. "Perhaps I was,
but I thought I was right. Things, however, are different
now&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">He drew her to him, but she resisted. "Wait! If
things had not been different, would your resolution
have held out?"</p>

<p class="dgp">"No," said Thirlwell, "I'm afraid not; I'm not as
strong as I imagined."</p>

<p class="dgp">"Oh!" she said, "perhaps that's the nicest thing I
have heard you say! But you really didn't often try to
be very nice."</p>

<p class="dgp">"I was afraid I might say too much if I began."</p>

<p class="dgp">"No!" she protested, as his grasp got firmer.
"There's something else! How long have you
really&mdash;"</p>

<p class="dgp">"How long have I wanted you? Well, I think I
began to feel the need a day or two after I met you at
the summer hotel."</p>

<p class="dgp">Agatha blushed, but smiled with shining eyes.</p>

<p class="dgp">"Then if the need hasn't gone, you can take me."</p>

<p class="dgp">Thirlwell said nothing, but took her in his arms.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
