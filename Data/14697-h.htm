<h3>THE ROAD TO RICHMOND</h3>


<p>The tobacco-roller and his son pitched their camp
beneath a gum tree upon the edge of the wood. It
was October, and the gum was the colour of blood.
Behind it rolled the autumn forest; before it stretched a level
of broom-sedge, bright ochre in the light of the setting sun.
The road ran across this golden plain, and disappeared in
a league-deep wood of pine. From an invisible clearing
came a cawing of crows. The sky was cloudless, and the
evening wind had not begun to blow. The small, shining
leaves of the gum did not stir, and the flame of the camp-fire
rose straight as a lance. The tobacco cask, transfixed by the
trunk of a young oak and drawn by strong horses, had come
to rest upon the turf by the roadside. Gideon Rand unharnessed
the team, and from the platform built in the front of
the cask took fodder for the horses, then tossed upon the
grass a bag of meal, a piece of bacon, and a frying-pan. The
boy collected the dry wood with which the earth was strewn,
then struck flint and steel, guarded the spark within the
tinder, fanned the flame, and with a sigh of satisfaction stood
back from the leaping fire. His father tossed him a bucket,
and with it swinging from his hand, he made through the
wood towards a music of water. Goldenrod and farewell-summer
and the red plumes of the sumach lined his path,
while far overhead the hickories and maples reared a fretted,
red-gold roof. Underfoot were moss and coloured leaves,
and to the right and left the squirrels watched him with
bright eyes. He found the stream where it rippled between
banks of fern and mint. As he knelt to fill the pail, the red
haw and the purple ironweed met above his head.</p>

<p>Below him was a little mirror-like pool, and it gave him
back himself with such distinctness that, startled, he dropped
the pail, and bending nearer, began to study the image in
the water. Back in Albemarle, in his dead mother's room,
there hung a looking-glass, but it was cracked and blurred,
and he seldom gazed within it. This chance mirror of the
woods was more to the purpose. The moments slipped away
while he studied the stranger and familiar in the pool below
him. The image was not formed or coloured like young
Narcissus, of whom he had never heard, but he observed
it with interest. He was fourteen, and old for his years.
The eyes reflected in the stream were brooding, the mouth
had lost its boyish curves, the sanguine cheek was thin, the
jaw settling square. His imagination, slow to quicken, had,
when aroused, quite a wizard might. He sank deeper amid
the ironweed, forgot his errand, and began to dream. He
was the son of a tobacco-roller, untaught and unfriended,
but he dreamed like a king. His imagination began to paint
without hands images of power upon a blank and mighty
wall, and it painted like a young Michael Angelo. It used
the colours of immaturity, but it conceived with strength.
&quot;When I am a man&mdash;&quot; he said aloud; and again, &quot;When
I am a man&mdash;&quot; The eyes in the pool looked at him yearningly;
the leaves from the golden hickories fell upon the
water and hid him from himself. In the distance a fox
barked, and Gideon Rand's deep voice came rolling through
the wood: &quot;Lewis! Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>The boy dipped the pail, lifted it brimming, and rose
from his knees. As he did so, a man parted the bushes on the
far side of the stream, glanced at the mossed and slippery
stones rising from its bed, then with a light and steady foot
crossed to the boy's side. He was a young man, wearing a
fringed hunting-shirt and leggins and a coonskin cap, and
carrying a long musket. Over his shoulder was slung a wild
turkey, and at his heels came a hound. He smiled, showing
very white teeth, and drew forward his bronze trophy.</p>

<p>&quot;Supper,&quot; he said briefly.</p>

<p>The boy nodded. &quot;I heard your gun. I've made a fire
yonder beneath a black gum. Adam Gaudylock, I am well-nigh
a man!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you be, so you be,&quot; answered the other; &quot;well-nigh
a man.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy beat the air with a branch of sumach. &quot;I want
to be a man! But I don't want to be a tobacco-roller like
my father, nor&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor a hunter like me,&quot; the other finished placidly. &quot;Be
the Governor of Virginia, then, or come with me and make
yourself King of the Mississippi! I've watched you, boy!
You're growing up ambitious, ambitious as What's-his-name&mdash;him
that you read of?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lucifer,&quot; answered the boy&mdash;&quot;ambitious as Lucifer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, don't spill the water, my kingling,&quot; said the hunter
good-naturedly. &quot;Life's not so strange as is the way folk
look at it. You and I, now,&mdash;we're different! What I care for
is just every common day as it comes naturally along, with
woods in it, and Indians, and an elk or two at gaze, and a
boat to get through the rapids, and a drop of kill-devil rum,
and some shooting, and a petticoat somewhere, and a hand
at cards,&mdash;just every common day! But you build your house
upon to-morrow. I care for the game, and you care for the prize.
Don't go too fast and far,&mdash;I've seen men pass the prize on
the road and never know it! Don't you be that kind, Lewis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't,&quot; said the boy. &quot;But of course one plays to win.
After supper, will you tell me about New Orleans and the
Mississippi, and the French and the Spaniards, and the moss
that hangs from the trees, and the oranges that grow like
apples? I had rather be king of that country than Governor
of Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>The sun set, and the chill dusk of autumn wrapped the
yellow sedge, the dusty road, and the pines upon the horizon.
The heavens were high and cold, and the night wind had
a message from the north. But it was warm beneath the
gum tree where the fire leaped and roared. In the light the
nearer leaves of the surrounding trees showed in strong
relief; beyond that copper fretwork all was blackness. Out
of the dark came the breathing of the horses, fastened near
the tobacco-cask, the croaking of frogs in a marshy place,
and all the stealthy, indefinable stir of the forest at night. At
times the wind brought a swirl of dead leaves across the ring
of light, an owl hooted, or one of the sleeping dogs stirred
and raised his head, then sank to dreams again. The tobacco-roller,
weary from the long day's travel, wrapped
himself in a blanket and slept in the lee of his thousand
pounds of bright leaf, but the boy and the hunter sat late
by the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;We crossed that swamp,&quot; said Gaudylock, &quot;with the
canes rattling above our heads, and a panther screaming in
a cypress tree, and we came to a village of the Chickasaws&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the night-time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the night-time, and a mockingbird singing like mad
from a china tree, and the woods all level before us like a
floor,&mdash;no brush at all, just fine grass, with flowers in it
like pinks in a garden. So we smoked the peace pipe with
the Chickasaws, and I hung a wampum belt with fine words,
and we went on, the next day, walking over strawberries so
thick that our moccasins were stained red. At noon we
overtook a party of boatmen from the Ohio,&mdash;tall men
they were, with beards, and dark and dirty as Indians,&mdash;and
we kept company with them through the country of
the Chickasaws and the Choctaws until we came to a high
bluff, and saw the Mississippi before us, brown and full and
marked with drifting trees, and up the river the white houses
of Natchez. There we camped until we made out the flat-boat,&mdash;General
Wilkinson's boat, all laden with tobacco
and flour and bacon, and just a few Kentucks with muskets,&mdash;that
the Spaniards at Natchez had been fools enough
to let pass! We hailed that boat, and it came up beneath
the cottonwoods, and I went aboard with the letters from
Louisville, and on we went, down the river, past the great
woods and the strange little towns, and the cotton-fields
and the sugar-canes, and the moss hanging like banners
from taller trees than this gum, to New Orleans. And there
the Intendant would have laid hands on our cargo and sent
every mother's son of us packing, but Miro, that was governor,
stood our friend, being frightened indeed of what
Kentucky might do if put to it! And there, on the levee,
we sold that tobacco and flour and bacon; and the tobacco
which we sold at home for shillings and pence, we sold at
New Orleans for joes and doubloons. Ay, ay, and not one
picayune of duty did we pay! Ay, and we opened the
Mississippi!&quot;</p>

<p>The speaker paused to take from his pouch several leaves
of tobacco, and to roll them deftly into a long cigar. The
boy rose to throw more wood upon the fire, then sat again
at the trader's feet, and with his chin in his hand stared into
the glowing hollows.</p>

<p>&quot;The West!&quot; said Gaudylock, between slow puffs of
smoke. &quot;Kentucky and the Ohio and the Mississippi, and
then Louisiana and all that lies beyond, and Mexico and its
gold! Ha! the Mississippi open from its source&mdash;and the
Lord in Heaven knows where that may be&mdash;to the last levee!
and not a Spaniard to stop a pirogua, and right to trade in
every port, and no lingo but plain English, and Mexico like a
ripe apple,&mdash;just a touch of the bough, and there's the gold
in hand! If I were a dreamer, I would dream of the West.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Folk have always dreamed of the West,&quot; said the boy.
&quot;Sailors and kings, and men with their fortune to make.
I've read about Cortez and Pizarro,&mdash;it would be fine to
be like that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you wanted to study law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do; but I could be a great soldier, too.&quot;</p>

<p>Gaudylock laughed. &quot;You would trap all the creatures
in the wood! Well, live long enough, and you'll hear a drum
beat. They're restless, restless, yonder on the rivers! But
they'll need the lawyers, too. Just see what the lawyers did
when we fought the British! Mr. Henry and Mr. Jefferson&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The boy put forth a sudden hand, gathered to him a pine
bough, and with it smote the red coals of the fire. &quot;Oh!&quot;
he cried, &quot;from morn till night my father keeps me in the
fields. It's tobacco! tobacco! tobacco! And I want to go
to school&mdash;I want to go to school!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a queer wanting,&quot; said the other thoughtfully.
&quot;I've wanted fire when I was cold, and venison when I
was hungry, and liquor when I was in company, and money
when I was gaming, and a woman when the moon was shining
and I wished to talk,&mdash;but I have never wanted to go
to school. A schollard sees a wall every time he raises his
head. I like the open.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are walls in the forest,&quot; answered the boy, &quot;and
I do not want to be a tobacco-roller! I want to study law!&quot;</p>

<p>The hunter laughed. &quot;Ho! A lawyer among the Rands!
I reckon you take after your mother's folk!&quot;</p>

<p>The boy looked at him wistfully. &quot;I reckon I do,&quot; he
assented. &quot;But my name is Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are worse folk than the Rands,&quot; said the woodsman.
&quot;I've never known one to let go, once he had man
or beast by the throat! Silent and holdfast and deadly to
anger&mdash;that's the Rands. If Gideon wants tobacco and
you want learning, there'll be a tussle!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My father's a tyrant!&quot; cried the boy passionately.
&quot;If he doesn't keep his hands off me, I'll&mdash;I'll <i>kill</i> him!&quot;</p>

<p>Gaudylock took the cigarro from his lips. &quot;You're too
fond of that word,&quot; he exclaimed, with some sternness. &quot;All
the wolves that the Rands ever hunted have somehow got
into their blood. Suppose you try a little <i>un</i>learning?
Great lawyers and great men and great conquerors and
good hunters don't kill their fathers, Lewis,&mdash;no, nor any
other man, excepting always in fair fight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know&mdash;I know!&quot; said Lewis. &quot;Of course he's my
father. But I never could stand for any one to get in my
way!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just what the rattlesnake says&mdash;and after a
while nobody does get in his way. But he must be a lonely
creature.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think,&quot; asked the boy oddly,&mdash;&quot;do you think
I am really like that,&mdash;like a rattlesnake?&quot;</p>

<p>Adam gave his mellow laugh. &quot;No, I don't. I think you
are just a poor human. I was always powerfully fond of
you, Lewis,&mdash;and I never could abide a rattler! There's
the moon, and it's a long march to-morrow, and folks sit up
late in Richmond! Unroll the blankets, and let's to bed.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy obeyed, and the two lay down with the fire between
them. The man's thoughts went back to the Mississippi,
to cane-brakes and bayous and long levees; and the
boy's mind perused the road before him.</p>

<p>&quot;When I get to Richmond,&quot; he suddenly announced, &quot;I am
going to find a place where they sell books. I have a dollar.&quot;</p>

<p>The hunter put his hand in his pouch, drew out a shining
coin, and tossed it across the fire. &quot;There's another,&quot; he
said. &quot;Good Spanish! Buy your <i>C&aelig;sars</i> and your <i>Pompeys</i>,
and when you are a lawyer like Mr. Jefferson, come
West&mdash;come West!&quot;</p>

<p>Men and beasts slumbered through the autumn night,
waked at dawn, and, breakfast eaten, took again the road.
Revolving cask, horses, dogs, and men, they crossed the wet
sedge and entered the pine wood, left that behind and traversed
a waste of scrub and vine, low hills, and rain-washed
gullies. Chinquapin bushes edged the road, the polished nut
dark in the centre of each open burr; the persimmon trees
showed their fruit, red-gold from the first frosts; the black
haw and cedar overhung the ravines; there was much sassafras,
and along the plashy streams the mint grew thick and
pungent-sweet. In the deep and pure blue sky above them,
fleecy clouds went past like galleons in a trade-wind.</p>

<p>The tobacco-roller was a taciturn man, and the boy, his
son, never thought of disburdening his soul to his father.
Each had the power to change for the other the aspect of the
world, but they themselves were strangers. Gideon Rand,
as he rode, thought of the bright leaf in the cask, of the
Richmond warehouse, and fixed the price in his mind. His
mind was in a state of sober jubilation. His only brother,
a lonely, unloved, and avaricious merchant in a small way,
had lately died, and had left him money. The hundred acres
upon the Three-Notched Road that Gideon had tilled for
another were in the market. The money would buy the land
and the small, dilapidated house already occupied by the
Rands. The purchase was in train, and in its own fashion
Gideon's sluggish nature rejoiced. He was as land-mad as
any other Virginian, but he had neither a lavish hand nor a
climbing eye. What he loved was the black earth beneath
the tobacco, and to walk between the rows and feel the thick
leaves. For him it sufficed to rise at dawn and spend the
day in the fields overseeing the hands, to come home at dusk
to a supper of corn bread and bacon, to go to bed within the
hour and sleep without a dream until cockcrow, to walk the
fields again till dusk and supper-time. Church on Sunday,
Charlottesville on Court Days, Richmond once a year, varied
the monotony. The one passion, the one softness, showed in
his love for horses. He broke the colts for half the county;
there was no horse that he could not ride, and his great form
and coal-black locks were looked for and found at every
race. The mare that he was riding he had bought with his
legacy, before he bought the land on the Three-Notched
Road. He was now considering whether he could afford to
buy in Richmond a likely negro to help him and Lewis in the
fields. With all the stubbornness of a dull mind, he meant
to keep Lewis in the fields. Long ago, when he was a handsome
young giant, he had married above him. His wife was
a beautiful and spirited woman, and when she married the
son of her father's tenant, it was with every intention of
raising him to her own level in life. But he was the stronger,
and he dragged her down to his. As her beauty faded and
her wit grew biting, he learned to hate her, and to hate
learning because she had it, and the refinements of life
because she practised them, and law because she came of a
family of lawyers. She was dead and he was glad of it,&mdash;and
now her son was always at a book, and wanted to be
a lawyer! &quot;I'll see him a slave-driver first!&quot; said Gideon
Rand to himself, and flecked his whip.</p>

<p>On the other side of the cask Adam Gaudylock whistled
along the road. He, too, had business in Richmond, and
problems not a few to solve, but as he was a man who never
sacrificed the present to the past, and rarely to the future,
he alone of the three really drank the wine of the morning air,
saw how blue was the sky, and admired the crimson trailers
that the dewberry spread across the road. When his gaze
followed the floating down from a milkweed pod, or marked
the scurry of a chipmunk at a white oak's root, or dwelt upon
the fox-grape's swinging curtain, he would have said, if
questioned, that life in the woods and in an Indian country
taught a man the use of his eyes. &quot;Love of Nature&quot; was a
phrase at which he would have looked blank, and a talisman
which he did not know he possessed, and it may be doubted
if he could have defined the word &quot;Romance.&quot; He whistled
as he rode, and presently, the sun rising higher and the
clear wind blowing with force, he began to sing,&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;From the Walnut Hills to the Silver Lake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Row, boatmen, row!</span><br />
Danger in the levee, danger in the brake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Row, boatmen, row!</span><br />
Yellow water rising, Indians on the shore!&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>Lewis Rand, perched upon the platform before the cask,
his feet dangling, his head thrown back against the wood,
and his eyes upon the floating clouds, pursued inwardly and
with a swelling heart the oft-broken, oft-renewed argument
with his father. &quot;I do not want to go to the fields. I want
to go to school. Every chance I've had, I've learned, and I
want to learn more and more. I do not want to be like you,
nor your father, nor his father, and I do not want to be like
Adam Gaudylock. I want to be like my mother's folk.
You've no right to keep me planting and suckering and
cutting and firing and planting again, as though I were a
negro! Negroes don't care, but I care! I'm not your slave.
Tobacco! I hate the sight of it, and the smell of it! There's
too much tobacco raised in Virginia. You fought the old
King because he was a tyrant, but you would make me
spend my life in the tobacco-field! You are a tyrant, too.
I'm to be a man just as you're a man. You went your way;
well, I'm going mine! I'm going to be a lawyer, like&mdash;like
Ludwell Cary at Greenwood. I'm not afraid of your horse-whip.
Strike, and be damned to you! You can break every
colt in the country, but you can't break me! I've seen you
strike my mother, too!&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;Way down in New Orleans,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath an orange tree,</span><br />
Beside the lapping water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the old levee,</span><br />
A-laughing in the moonlight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There sits the girl for me!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>sang Gaudylock.</p>

<p>
&quot;She's sweeter than the jasmine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her name it is Delphine.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>The day wore on, the land grew level, and the clearings
more frequent. Stretches of stacked corn appeared like
tented plains, brown and silent encampments of the autumn;
and tobacco-houses rose from the fields whence the weed
had been cut. Blue smoke hung in wreaths above the high
roofs, for it was firing-time. Now and then they saw, far
back from the road and shaded by noble trees, dwelling-houses
of brick or wood. Behind the larger sort of these
appeared barns and stables and negro quarters, all very
cheerful in the sunny October weather. Once they passed
a schoolhouse and a church, and twice they halted at cross-road
taverns. The road was no longer solitary. Other
slow-rolling casks of tobacco with retinue of men and boys
were on their way to Richmond, and there were white-roofed
wagons from the country beyond Staunton. Four
strong horses drew each wagon, manes and tails tied with
bright galloon, and harness hung with jingling bells. Whatever
things the mountain folk might trade with were in the
wagons,&mdash;butter, flour, and dried meat, skins of deer and
bear, hemp, flaxseed, wax, ginseng, and maple sugar. Other
vehicles used the road, growing more numerous as the day
wore into the afternoon, and Richmond was no longer far
away. Coach and chaise, curricle and stick-chair, were
encountered, and horsemen were frequent.</p>

<p>In 1790 men spoke when they passed; moreover, Rand
and Gaudylock were not entirely unknown. The giant figure
of the one had been seen before upon that road; the other
was recognized as a very able scout, hunter, and Indian
trader, restless as quicksilver and daring beyond all reason.
Men hailed the two cheerily, and asked for the news from
Albemarle, and from Kentucky and the Mississippi.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Jefferson is coming home,&quot; answered Rand; and
&quot;Spain is not so black as she is painted,&quot; said the trader.</p>

<p>&quot;We hear,&quot; quoth the gentleman addressed, &quot;that the
Kentuckians make good Spanish subjects.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you hear a damned lie,&quot; said Gaudylock imperturbably.
&quot;The boot's on the other foot. Ten years from
now a Kentuckian may rule in New Orleans.&quot;</p>

<p>The gentleman laughed, settled back in his stick-chair,
and spoke to his horse. &quot;Mr. Jefferson is in Richmond,&quot;
he remarked to Rand, and vanished in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>The tobacco-cask and its guardians kept on by wood and
stream, plantation, tavern, forge, and mill, now with companions
and now upon a lonely road. At last, when the frogs
were at vespers, and the wind had died into an evening stillness,
and the last rays of the sun were staining the autumn
foliage a yet deeper red, they came by way of Broad Street
into Richmond. The cask of bright leaf must be deposited
at Shockoe Warehouse; this they did, then as the stars were
coming out, they betook themselves to where, at the foot of
Church Hill, the Bird in Hand dispensed refreshment to
man and beast.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II" />CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>MR. JEFFERSON</h3>


<p>By ten of the Capitol clock Gideon Rand had sold his
tobacco and deposited the price in a well-filled wallet.
&quot;Eighteen shillings the hundred,&quot; he said, with
grim satisfaction. &quot;And the casks I sent by Mocket sold as
well! Good leaf, good leaf! Tobacco pays, and learning
don't. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Lewis Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>Father and son came out from the cool, dark store, upon
the unpaved street, and joined Adam Gaudylock where he
lounged beneath a sycamore. Up and down the street were
wooden houses, shops of British merchants, prosperous
taverns, and dwelling-houses sunk in shady gardens. An
arrow-flight away brawled the river among bright islands.
The sky above the bronze sycamores was very blue, the air
crystal, the sunshine heavenly mild. The street was not
crowded. A Quaker in a broad-brimmed hat went by, and
then a pretty girl, and then a minister talking broad Scotch,
and then a future chief justice who had been to market
and had a green basket upon his arm. Gideon drew another
breath of satisfaction. &quot;I've been thinking this long time
of buying a negro, and now I can do it! Mocket says there's
a likely man for sale down by the market. Lewis, you go
straight to Mocket now, and tell him I'll wait for him there!
Are you coming with me, Adam Gaudylock?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Gaudylock, with candour, &quot;I have business
presently in Governor Street, and a man to meet at the Indian
Queen. And I think I'll go now with Lewis. Somehow,
the woods have spoiled me for seeing men bought and sold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're black men,&quot; said Rand indifferently. &quot;I'll see
you, then, at dinner-time, at the Bird in Hand. I'm going
home to-morrow.&mdash;Lewis, if you want to, you can look
around this morning with Tom Mocket!&quot; He glanced at
his son's flushing face, and, being in high good humour,
determined to give the colt a little rein. &quot;Be off, and spend
your dollar! See what sights you can, for we'll not be in
Richmond again for many a day! They say there's a brig
in from Barbadoes.&quot;</p>

<p>He put up his wallet, and with a nod to Gaudylock strode
away in the direction of the market, but presently halted
and turned his head. &quot;Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you be buying any more books! You hear me?&quot;</p>

<p>He swung away, and his son stood under the sycamore
tree and looked after him with a darkened face. Gaudylock
put a hand upon his shoulder. &quot;Never mind, Lewis! Before
we part I'm going to talk to Gideon.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Do
you know what the Cherokees call me? They call me Golden-Tongue.
Because, you see, I can persuade them to 'most
anything,&mdash;always into the war-path, and sometimes out
of it! Gideon may be obstinate, but he can't be as obstinate
as an Indian. Now let's go to Mocket's.&quot;</p>

<p>The way to Mocket's lay down a steep hillside, and along
the river-bank, under a drift of coloured leaves, and by the
sound of falling water. Mocket dwelt in a small house, in
a small green yard with a broken gate. A red creeper mantled
the tiny porch, and lilac bushes, clucked under by a dozen
hens, hedged the grassy yard. As the hunter and Lewis
Rand approached, a little girl, brown and freckled, barefoot
and dressed in linsey, sprang up from the stone before the
gate, and began to run towards the house. Her foot caught
in a trailing vine, and down she fell. Adam was beside her
at once. &quot;Why, you little partridge!&quot; he exclaimed, and
lifted her to her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Vinie Mocket,&quot; said his companion. &quot;Vinie,
where's your father?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, thir,&quot; answered Vinie. &quot;Tom knows.
Tom's down there, at the big ship. I'll tell him.&quot;</p>

<p>She slipped from Gaudylock's clasp and pattered off
toward the river, where the brig from Barbadoes showed
hull and masts. The hunter sat down upon the porch step,
and drew out his tobacco pouch. &quot;She's like a partridge,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p>&quot;She's just Vinie Mocket,&quot; answered the boy. &quot;There's
a girl who stays sometimes at Mrs. Selden's, on the
Three-Notched Road. She's not freckled, and her eyes are
big, and she never goes barefoot. I reckon it's silk she
wears.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's her name?&quot; asked the hunter, filling his pipe.</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline&mdash;Jacqueline Churchill. She lives at Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fontenoy's a mighty fine place,&quot; remarked Gaudylock.</p>

<p>&quot;And the Churchills are mighty fine people.&mdash;Here's the
partridge back, with another freckle-face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's Tom Mocket,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;If Vinie's a partridge,
Tom's a weasel.&quot;</p>

<p>The weasel, sandy-haired and freckled, came up the path
with long steps. &quot;Hi, Lewis! Father's gone toward the
market looking for your father. That's a brig from the
Indies down there, and the captain's our cousin&mdash;ain't
he, Vinie? I know who you are, sir. You're Adam Gaudylock,
the great hunter!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I am, so I am!&quot; quoth Adam. &quot;Look here, little
partridge, at what I've got in my pouch!&quot;</p>

<p>The partridge busied herself with the beaded thing, and
the two boys talked aside. &quot;I've till dinner time to do what
I like in,&quot; said Lewis Rand. &quot;Have you got to work?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not unless I want to,&quot; Young Mocket answered blissfully.
&quot;Father, he don't care! Besides&quot;&mdash;he swelled with
pride&mdash;&quot;I don't work now at the wharf. I'm at Chancellor
Wythe's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chancellor Wythe's! What are you doing there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Helping him. Maybe, by and by, I'll be a lawyer,
too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heugh!&quot; said the other. &quot;Do you mean you're reading
law?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No-o, not just exactly. But I let people in&mdash;and I hear
what they talk about. I like it better than the wharf, anyhow.
I'll go with you and show you things. Is Mr. Gaudylock
coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Adam. &quot;I'll finish my pipe, and take a
look at the ship down there, and then I'll meet a friend
at the Indian Queen. Be off with you both! Vinie will stay
and talk to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir,&quot; said Vinie, her brown arm deep in the
beaded pouch.</p>

<p>The two lads left behind the scarlet-clad porch, the hunter
and Vinie, the little green yard and the broken gate. &quot;Where
first? demanded Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the best place in Richmond to buy books?&quot;</p>

<p>Young Mocket considered. &quot;There's a shop near the
bridge. What do you want with books?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to read them. We'll go to the bridge first.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom hung back. &quot;Don't you want to see the brig from
Barbadoes? She's a beauty. There's a schooner from Baltimore,
too, at the Rock Landing. You won't? Then let's go
over to Widewilt's Island. Well, they whipped a man this
morning and he's in the pillory now, down by the market.
Let's go look at him.&mdash;Pshaw! what's the use of books!
Don't you want to see the Guard turn out at noon, and hear
the trumpet blow? Well, come on to the bridge! Nancy,
the apple-woman, is there too.&quot;</p>

<p>The shop near the bridge to which they resorted was
dark and low, but learning was spread upon its counter, and
a benevolent dragon of knowledge in horn spectacles ran
over the wares for Lewis Rand. &quot;De Jure Maritimo, six
shillings eightpence, my lad. Burnet's History and Demosthenes'
Orations, two crowns, Mr. Gibbon's Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire, a great book and dear!
Common Sense&mdash;and that's Tom Paine's, and you may
have it for two pistareens.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. &quot;I want a law-book.&quot;</p>

<p>The genie put forth The Principles of Equity, and
named the price.</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis too dear.&quot;</p>

<p>A gentleman lounging against the counter closed the book
into which he had been dipping, and drew nearer to the
would-be purchaser.</p>

<p>&quot;Equity is an expensive commodity, my lad,&quot; he said
kindly. &quot;How much law have you read?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have read The Law of Virginia,&quot; answered the boy.
&quot;I borrowed it. I worked a week for Mr. Douglas, and read
The Law of Nations rest-hours. Mrs. Selden, on the Three-Notched
Road, gave me The Federalist. Are you a lawyer,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p>The gentleman laughed, and the genie behind the counter
laughed. Young Mocket plucked Lewis Rand by the sleeve,
but the latter was intent upon the personage before him and
did not heed.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the gentleman, &quot;I am a lawyer. Are you
going to be one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Will you tell me what books I
ought to buy? I have two dollars.&quot;</p>

<p>The other looked at him with keen light eyes. &quot;That
amount will not buy you many books,&quot; he said. &quot;You should
enter some lawyer's office where you may have access to
his library. You spoke of the Three-Notched Road. Are you
from Albemarle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir. I am Gideon Rand's son.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed! Gideon Rand! Then Mary Wayne was your
mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I remember,&quot; said the gentleman, &quot;when she married
your father. She was a beautiful woman. I heard of her
death while I was in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy's regard, at first solely for the books, had been
for some moments transferred to the gentleman who, it
seemed, was a lawyer, and had known his people, and had
been to Paris. He saw a tall man, of a spare and sinewy
frame, with red hair, lightly powdered, and keen blue eyes.
Lewis Rand's cheek grew red, and his eyes at once shy and
eager. He stammered when he spoke. &quot;Are you from Albemarle,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p>The other smiled, a bright and gracious smile, irradiating
his ruddy, freckled face. &quot;I am,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;From&mdash;from Monticello?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From Monticello.&quot; The speaker, who loved his home
with passion, never uttered its name without a softening of
the voice. &quot;From Monticello,&quot; he said again. &quot;There are
books enough there, my lad. Some day you shall ride over
from the Three-Notched Road, and I will show you them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will come,&quot; said Lewis Rand. The colour deepened
in his face and a moisture troubled his vision. The shop, the
littered counter, the guardian of the books, and President
Washington's Secretary of State wavered like the sunbeam
at the door.</p>

<p>Jefferson ran his hand over the row of books. &quot;Mr. Smith,
give the lad old Coke, yes, and Locke on Government, and
put them to my account.&mdash;Where do you go to school?&quot;</p>

<p>The boy swallowed hard, straightened his shoulders, and
looked his questioner in the face. &quot;Nowhere, sir&mdash;not now.
My father hates learning, and I work in the fields. I am very
much obliged to you for the books,&mdash;and had I best buy
Blackstone with the two dollars?&quot;</p>

<p>The other smiled. &quot;No, no, not Blackstone. Blackstone's
frippery. You've got old Coke. Buy for yourself
some book that shall mean much to you all your life.&mdash;Mr.
Smith, give him Plutarch's Lives&mdash;Ossian, too. He's rich
enough to buy Ossian.&mdash;As for law-books, my lad, if you
will come to Monticello, I will lend you what you need. I
like your spirit.&quot; He looked at his watch. &quot;I have to dine
at the Eagle with the Governor and Mr. Randolph. When
do you return to Albemarle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrow, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I may overtake you on the road. Once I did your
father a good turn, and I shall be glad to have a word with
him now. He must not keep the son of Mary Wayne in the
fields. Some day I will ride down the Three-Notched Road,
and examine you on old Coke. Don't spare study; if you will
be a lawyer, become a good one, not a smatterer. Good-day
to you!&quot;</p>

<p>He left the shop. The bookseller gazed after him, then
nodded and smiled at the boy. &quot;You look transfigured, my
lad! Well, he's a great man, and he'll be a greater one yet.
He's for the people, and one day the people will be for him!
I'll tie up your books&mdash;and if you can make a friend of Mr.
Jefferson, you do it!&quot;</p>

<p>Lewis Rand came out into the sunlight with &quot;old Coke&quot;
and Locke, Plutarch and Ossian, under his arm, and in his
soul I know not what ardour of hero-worship, what surging
resolve and aspiration. Young Mocket, at his elbow, regarded
him with something like awe. &quot;That was Mr. Jefferson,&quot;
he said. &quot;He knows General Washington and Marquis
Lafayette and Doctor Franklin. He's just home from
Paris, and they have made him Secretary of State&mdash;whatever
that is. He wrote the Declaration of Independence.
He's a rich man&mdash;he's a lawyer, too. He lives at a place
named Monticello.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Lewis Rand, &quot;I've been to Monticello.
When I am a man I am going to have a house like it, with a
terrace and white pillars and a library. But I shall have a
flower garden like the one at Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ho! your house! Is Fontenoy where Ludwell Cary
lives?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; he lives at Greenwood. The Churchills live at
Fontenoy.&mdash;Now we'll go see the Guard turn out. Is that
the apple-woman yonder? I've a half-a-bit left.&quot;</p>

<p>An hour later, having bought the apples, and seen the pillared
Capitol, and respectfully considered the outside of
Chancellor Wythe's law office, and having parted until the
afternoon with Tom Mocket, who professed an engagement
on the Barbadoes brig, young Lewis Rand betook himself
to the Bird in Hand. There in the bare, not over clean chamber
which had been assigned to the party from Albemarle,
he deposited his precious parcel first in the depths of an ancient
pair of saddle-bags, then, thinking better of it, underneath
the straw mattress of a small bed. It was probable, he
knew, that even there his father might discover the treasure.
What would follow discovery he knew full Well. The beating
he could take; what he wouldn't stand would be, say,
Gideon's flinging the books into the fire. &quot;He shan't, he
shan't,&quot; said the boy's hot heart. &quot;If he does, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Through the window came Gaudylock's voice from the
porch of the Bird in Hand. &quot;You Stay-at-homes&mdash;you
don't know what's in the wilderness! There's good and
there's bad, and there's much beside. It's like the sea&mdash;it's
uncharted.&quot;</p>

<p>Lewis Rand closed the door of the room, and went out
upon the shady porch, where he found the hunter and a lounging
wide-eyed knot of listeners to tales of Kentucky and the
Mississippi. The dinner-bell rang. Adam fell pointedly silent,
and his audience melted away. The hunter rose and
stretched himself. &quot;There is prime venison for dinner, and
a quince tart and good apple brandy. Ha! I was always
glad I was born in Virginia. Here is Gideon swinging down
the hill&mdash;Gideon and his negro!&quot;</p>

<p>The tobacco-roller joined them, and with a wave of the
hand indicated his purchase of the morning. This was a tall
and strong negro, young, supple, and of a cheerful countenance.
Rand was in high good-humour. &quot;He's a runaway,
Mocket says, but I'll cure him of that! He's strong as an
ox and as limber as a snake.&quot; Taking the negro's hand in
his, he bent the fingers back. &quot;Look at that! easy as a willow!
He'll strip tobacco! His name is Joab.&quot;</p>

<p>The namesake of a prince in Israel looked blithely upon
his new family. &quot;Yaas, marster,&quot; he said, with candour.
&quot;Dat is my name dat sho' is! Jes' Joab. An' I is strong
as en ox,&mdash;don' know 'bout de snaik. Marster, is you gwine
tek me 'way from Richmond?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Albemarle,&quot; said the tobacco-roller briefly. &quot;To-morrow
morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Joab studied the vine above the porch. &quot;Kin I go tell my
ole mammy good-bye? She's washin' yonder in de creek.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand nodded, and the negro swung off to where, upon
the grassy common sloping to Shockoe Creek, dark washer-women
were spreading clothes. The bell of the Bird in Hand
rang again, and the white men went to dinner.</p>

<p>Following the venison, the tart, and apple brandy came
the short, bright afternoon, passed by Lewis Rand upon the
brig from the Indies with Tom Mocket and little Vinie and
a wrinkled skipper who talked of cocoanuts and strange
birds and red-handkerchiefed pirates, and spent by Gideon
first in business with the elder Mocket, and then in conversation
with Adam Gaudylock. Lewis, returning at supper-time
to the Bird in Hand, found the hunter altered no whit from
his habitual tawny lightness, but his father in a mood that
he knew, sullen and silent. &quot;Adam's been talking to him,&quot;
thought the boy. &quot;And it's just the same as when Mrs.
Selden talks to him. Let me go&mdash;not he!&quot;</p>

<p>In the morning, at six of the clock, the two Rands, the
negro Joab, the horses, and the dogs took the homeward road
to Albemarle. Adam Gaudylock was not returning with
them; he had trader's business with the merchants in Main
Street, hunter's business with certain cronies at the Indian
Queen, able scout and man-of-information business in Governor
Street, and business of his own upon the elm-shaded
walk above the river. Over level autumn fields and up and
down the wooded hills, father and son and the slave travelled
briskly toward the west. As the twilight fell, they came up with
three white wagons, Staunton bound, and convoyed by mountaineers.
That night they camped with these men in an expanse
of scrub and sassafras, but left them at dawn and went
on toward Albemarle. A day of coloured woods, of infrequent
clearings, and of streams to ford, ended in an evening
of cool wind and rosy sky. They descended a hill, halted,
and built their fire in a grassy space beside a river. Joab
tethered the horses and made the fire, and fried the bacon
and baked the hoecake. As he worked he sang:&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;David an' Cephas, an' ole brer Mingo,<br />
Saul an' Paul, an' de w'ite folk sinners&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh, my chillern, follow de Lawd!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Supper was eaten in silence. When it was over, Gideon Rand
sat with his back against a pine and smoked his pipe. His
son went down to the river and stretched his length upon a
mossed and lichened boulder. The deep water below the
stone did not give him back himself as had done the streamlet
five days before. This was a river, marred with eddies
and with drifting wood, and red with the soil. The evening
wind was blowing, and the sycamore above him cast its bronze
leaves into the flood which sucked them under, or bore them
with it on its way to the larger river and the ultimate sea.
This stream had no babbling voice; its note was low and
grave. Youth and mountain sources forgotten, it hearkened
before the time to ocean voices. The boy, idle upon the
lichened stone, listened too, to distant utterances, to the
sirens singing beyond the shadowy cape. The earth soothed
him; he lay with half shut eyes, and after the day's hot communion
with old wrongs, he felt a sudden peace. He was at
the turn; the brute within him quiet behind the eternal bars;
the savage receding, the man beckoning, the after man
watching from afar. The inner stage was cleared and set for
a new act. He had lowered the light, he had rested, and he
had filled the interval with forms and determinations beautiful
and vague, vague as the mists, the sounds, the tossed
arms of the Ossian he had dared to open last night, before
his father, by the camp-fire of the mountaineers. In the twilight
of his theatre he rested; a shadowy figure, full of mysteries,
full of possibilities, a boy in the grasp of the man within
him, neither boy nor man unlovable, nor wholly unadmirable,
both seen, and seeing, &quot;through a glass darkly.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned on his side, and the light went up sharply. A
man riding a beautiful and spirited horse was coming over
the hilltop. Horse and rider paused a moment upon the
crest, standing clear against the eastern sky. In the crystal
air and the sunset glow they crowned the hill like a horse and
rider nobly done in bronze. A moment thus, then they began
to pick their way down the rocky road. Lewis Rand looked,
and started to his feet. That horse had been bred in Albemarle,
and that horseman he had met in Richmond. The
boy's heart beat fast and the colour surged to his cheek.
There was little, since the hour in the bookshop, that he would
not have done or suffered for the approaching figure. All
along the road from Richmond his imagination had conjured
up a score of fantastic instances, in each of which he had
rescued, or died for, or had in some impossibly romantic
and magnificent fashion been the benefactor of the man who
was drawing near to the river and camp-fire. As superbly
generous as any other youth, he was, at present, in his progress
through life, in the land of shrines. He must have his
idol, must worship and follow after some visible hero, some
older, higher, stronger, more subtle-fine and far-ahead adventurer.
Heretofore, in his limited world, Adam Gaudylock
had seemed nearest the gates of escape. But Adam, he
thought, was of the woods and the earth, even as his father
was, and as the tobacco was, and as he himself was. His
enormous need was for some one to follow whose feet were
above the fat, red fields and the leafy trails. All this was
present with him as he watched the oncoming figure. Great
men kept their word. Had not Mr. Jefferson said that he
would overtake them?&mdash;and there he was! He was coming
down to the camp-fire, he was going to stop and talk
to the surly giant, like Giant Despair, who sat and smoked
beside it.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand left the river and the windy sycamore and
hastened across the sere grass. &quot;Father, father!&quot; he cried.
&quot;Do you know who that is?&quot; In his young voice there was
both warning and appeal. Adam Gaudylock, he knew, had
spoken to his father, but Gideon had given no sign. Suppose,
no matter <i>who</i> spoke, his father would give, forever, no other
sign than that oft seen and always hated jerk of the head
toward the tobacco-fields?</p>

<p>Gideon Rand took his pipe from his lips. &quot;It's Mr.
Jefferson,&quot; he answered laconically. &quot;He's the one man in
this country to whom I'd listen.&quot;</p>

<p>Jefferson rode up to the group about the camp-fire, checked
his horse, and gave the tobacco-roller and his son a plain
man's greeting to plain men. The eagerness of the boy's face
did not escape him; when he dismounted, flung the reins of
Wildair to his groom, and crossed the bit of turf to the fire
beneath the pines, he knew that he was pleasing a young
heart. He loved youth, and to the young he was always
nobly kind.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-evening, Mr. Rand,&quot; he said. &quot;You are homeward
bound, as I am. It is good to see Albemarle faces after
years of the French. I had the pleasure of making your son's
acquaintance yesterday. It is a great thing to be the father
of a son, for so one ceases to be a loose end and becomes a
link in the great chain. Your son, I think, will do you honour.
And, man to man, you must pay him in the same coin. We
on a lower rung of the ladder must keep our hands from the
ankles of the climbers above us! Make room for me on
that log, my lad! Your father and I will talk awhile.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus it was that an able lawyer took up the case of young
Lewis Rand. It was the lawyer's pleasure to give aid to
youth, and to mould the mind of youth. He had many
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, to all of whom he was invariably kind, invariably
generous. The only return he exacted was that of homage.
The yoke was not heavy, for, after all, the homage was to
Ideas, to large, sagacious, and far-reaching Thought. It
was in the year 1790 that he broke Gideon Rand's resistance
to his son's devotion to other gods than those of the Rands.
The year that followed that evening on the Albemarle road
found Lewis Rand reading law in an office in Charlottesville.
A few more years, and he was called to the bar; a
little longer, and his name began to be an oft-spoken one in
his native county, and not unknown throughout Virginia.</p>

<h3>FONTENOY</h3>


<p>In the springtime of the year 1804 the spectacle of
human conduct ranged from grave to gay, from gay to
grave again much as it had done in any other springtime
of any other year. In France the consular chrysalis was about
to develop imperial wings. The British Lion and the Russian
Bear were cheek by jowl, and every Englishman turned
his spyglass toward Boulogne, where was gathered Buonaparte's
army of invasion. In the New World Spanish troops
were reluctantly withdrawing from the vast territory sold
by a Corsican to a Virginian, while to the eastward of that
movement seventeen of the United States of America pursued
the uneven tenor of their way. Washington had been
dead five years. Alexander Hamilton was yet the leading
spirit of the Federalist party, while Thomas Jefferson was
the idol of the Democrat-Republicans.</p>

<p>In the sovereign State of Virginia politics was the staple
of conversation as tobacco was the staple of trade. Party
feeling ran high. The President of the Union was a Virginian
and a Republican; the Chief Justice was a Virginian
and a Federalist. Old friends looked askance, or crossed the
road to avoid a meeting, and hot bloods went a-duelling.
The note of the time was Ambition; the noun most in use the
name of Napoleon Buonaparte. It seemed written across
the firmament; to some in letters of light and to others in
hell fire. With that sign in the skies, men might shudder and
turn to a private hearth, or they might give loosest rein to
desire for Fame. In the columns of the newspapers, above
the name of every Roman patriot, each party found voice.
From a lurid background of Moreau's conspiracy and
d'Enghien's death, of a moribund English King and Premier,
of Hayti aflame, and Tripoli insolent, they thundered, like
Cassandra, of home woes. To the Federalist, reverencing the
dead Washington, still looking for leadership to Hamilton,
now so near that fatal Field of Honour, unconsciously nourishing
love for that mother country from which he had
righteously torn himself, the name of Democrat-Republican
and all that it implied was a stench in the nostrils. On the
other hand, the lover of Jefferson, the believer in the French
Revolution and that rider of the whirlwind whom it had bred,
the far-sighted iconoclast, and the poor bawler for simplicity
and red breeches, all found the Federalist a mete burnished
fly in the country's pot of ointment. Nowhere might be
found a man so sober or so dull as to cry, &quot;A plague o' both
your houses!&quot;</p>

<p>In the county of Albemarle April was blending with May.
The days were soft and sunshiny, apt to be broken by a
hurry of clouds, of slanting trees, and silver rain. When the
sun came out again, it painted a great bow in the heavens.
Beneath that bright token bloomed a thousand orchards;
and the wheat and the young corn waved in the wet breeze.
The land was rolling and red in colour, with beautiful trees
and narrow rivers. Eastward it descended to misty plains,
westward the mountains rose, bounding a noble landscape
of field and forest. For many years the axe had swung and
trees had fallen, but the forest yet descended to the narrow
roads, observed itself in winding streams, gloomed upon
the sunlit clearings where negroes sang as they tilled the
soil. In the all-surrounding green the plantations showed
like intaglios. From pleasant hillsides, shady groves, and
hamlets of offices and quarters, the sedate red-brick, white-porticoed
&quot;great houses&quot; looked easily forth upon a world
which interested them mightily.</p>

<p>Upon a morning in late April of the year 1804, the early
sunshine, overflowing such a plantation, dipped at last into
a hollow halfway between the house and the lower gates,
and overtook two young creatures playing at make-believe,
their drama of the moment being that of the runaway servant.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the sun!&quot; wailed Deb. &quot;We can't pretend it's dark
any longer! God has gone and made another day! We'll
see you running away,&mdash;all of us white folk, and the overseer
and Mammy Chloe! If you climb this willow, the dogs
will tree you like they did Aunt Dinah's Jim! Lie down and
I'll cover you with leaves like the babes in the wood!&quot;</p>

<p>Miranda, a slim black limb of Satan in a blue cotton
gown, flung herself with promptitude upon the ground.
&quot;Heap de beech leaves an' de oak leaves upon dis heah po'
los' niggah. Oh, my lan'! don' you heah 'um comin'?&quot;</p>

<p>Dead leaves fell upon her in a shower, and her accomplice
gathered more with frantic haste. &quot;Oh, it's the ghost in
the tobacco-house! it's a rock rolling down the mountain!
it's&mdash;it's something splashing in the swamp!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is I a-hidin' in de swamp? Den don' th'ow no oak leaves
on dis niggah, for dey don' grow dyar. Gawd A'moughty,
lis'en to de river roarin'! I's hidin' by de river&mdash;I's hidin'
by de river! I's hidin' by de river Jordan!&quot;</p>

<p>Deb swayed to and fro, beating her hands in her excitement.
&quot;I see a boat&mdash;a great big boat! It's as big as the
Ark! The finders are in it, and the dogs and the guns! Let
us pray! O Jesus, save Miranda, even though it is a scarlet
sin to run away! O Jesus, don't let them take her to the
Court House! O Jesus, let them take me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Miranda reared herself from her leafy bed. &quot;Humph!
what you gwine do at de Co'te House? Answer me dat!
I knows what de Lawd gwine say. He gwine say, 'Run for
it, niggah!' Yaas, Lawd, I sholy gwine do what <i>you</i> say&mdash;I
gwine run to de very aidge of de yearth.</p>

<p>
&quot;Oh, I fool you, Mister Oberseer Man!<br />
Oh, I fool you, my ole Marster!<br />
Cotch de mockin'bird co'tin' in de locus',<br />
Cotch de bullfrog gruntin' in de ma'sh,<br />
Cotch de black snake trabellin' 'long his road,<br />
But you ain' gwine see dis niggah enny mo'!<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Deb, ef I gets to de big gate fust, you gwine lemme
hol' dat doll baby Marse Edward gin you?&quot;</p>

<p>Deb brushed the last oak leaf from the skirt of her green
gown, tossed her yellow hair out of her brown eyes, and
scrambled up the steep side of the dell to a level of lawn and
flowers. Her handmaiden followed her, and they paused
for breath beneath the white blooms of a mighty catalpa.
A hundred yards away, across an expanse of dewy turf, rose
the great house, bathed in sunlight. Box, syringa, and honeysuckle
environed it, and a row of poplars made a background
of living green. It had tall white pillars, and shallow
steps leading down to a gravelled drive. The drive was over-arched
by elm and locust, and between the trees was planted
purple lilac. All of fresh and fair and tender met in the late
April weather, in the bright and song-filled morning, in the
dew and in the flowers. Upon the steps, between the white
pillars, were gathered several muslined figures, flowery
bright to match the morning. In the drive below, two horsemen,
booted and spurred, clad in many-caped riding-coats
and attended by a negro groom, were in the act of lifting tall
hats to the ladies of the house they were quitting.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi!&quot; panted Miranda. &quot;Marse Ludwell Cary, Marse
Fairfax Cary, an' dat brack niggah Eli! Whar dey gwine dis
mawnin'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the Court House&mdash;to the election,&quot; answered Deb.
&quot;I know all about it, for I asked Uncle Edward. If the
Federalists win, the crops will be good, and General Washington
and my father and my grandfather will lie quiet in their
graves. We are Federalists. If the Republicans win, the
country will go to the devil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, dat so?&quot; said Miranda. &quot;Le's run open de big gate.
Dey two gent'men moughty free wid dey money.&quot;</p>

<p>Racing over the jewelled turf, mistress and maid arrived
at the big gate in time to swing it open before the approaching
riders. Young Fairfax Cary laughed and tossed a coin to
Miranda, who bobbed and showed her teeth, while his elder
brother stooped gallantly to the pretty child of the house he
was leaving. &quot;Do you know what you are like in your narrow
green gown and your blowing, yellow hair? You are like
a daffodil in your sister's garden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you were to swing me up from the ground,&quot; said Deb
meditatively, &quot;I could stand upon the toe of your boot, and
hold by Pluto's mane, and ride with you as far as the creek.&mdash;What
flower is Jacqueline like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like no flower that blooms,&quot; said Mr. Ludwell Cary.
&quot;Ah, well sprung, Proserpina! Now shall we go fast as the
wind?&quot;</p>

<p>They went fast as the wind to the creek, and then went
like the wind back to the gate, where Ludwell Cary swung
the child down to earth and the waiting Miranda.</p>

<p>Deb curtsied to him. &quot;Wish me good luck, Daffy-down-Dilly!&quot;
he said, with his charming smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; she answered earnestly. &quot;I hope that you will
kill the Devil.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. &quot;Is that feasible? I don't know where
to find him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you going to fight him at the Court House?
Uncle Edward said that you were going to put down
Lucifer.&quot;</p>

<p>The two brothers broke into laughter. &quot;I say, Fair!&quot;
cried the elder. &quot;Has Lewis Rand a cloven hoof? I've
scarcely seen him, you know, since I went to England!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's all cloven hoof, damn him!&quot; the other answered
cheerfully. &quot;Best ride on. He'll have been at the Court
House this hour!&quot;</p>

<p>Ludwell Cary glanced at his watch. &quot;Early or late, the
result will be the same. The county's going for him twice
over!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A damned tobacco-roller's son!&quot; growled the other.</p>

<p>The elder brother laughed. &quot;'A man's a man for a' that,'
Fair. I dare say old Gideon rolled tobacco with all his might.
As for his son, his worst enemy&mdash;and I don't know that I
am that&mdash;couldn't deny him courage and energy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a dangerous man&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most men are who have won by fighting. But I don't
think he loves violence. Well, well, I'm coming! Good-bye,
little one!&quot;</p>

<p>Deb curtsied and Miranda bobbed, the gentlemen touched
their hats, black Eli grinned, the horses began to canter,
and, the leafy road bending sharply, the party for the Court
House passed suddenly from view as though the earth had
swallowed them up.</p>

<p>Miranda bent her eyes upon her mistress. &quot;Hit's time you
wuz in de schoolroom. An' Lan' o' Goshen! Jes' look at yo'
wet shoes! I reckon Mammy Chloe gwine whup me!&quot;</p>

<p>Deb considered her stockings and slippers. &quot;There's no
school to-day. Mr. Drew's going to the Court House to
vote. Uncle Edward says it is the duty of every gentleman
to vote against this damned upstart and the Democrat-Republican
party. The damned upstart's other name is
Lewis Rand. I'll ask Jacqueline to beg Mammy Chloe not
to whip you. I like wet feet.&quot;</p>

<p>The parlour at Fontenoy was large and high and cool,
hung with green paper, touched with the dull gold of old
mirrors, of a carved console or two, of oval frames enclosing
dim portraits. Long windows opened to the April breeze,
and from above the high mantel a Churchill in lovelocks
and plumed hat looked down upon Jacqueline seated at her
harp. She was playing Water parted from the Sea, playing
it dreamily, with an absent mind. Deb, hearing the music
from the hall, came and stood beside her sister. They were
orphans, dwelling with an uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline,&quot; said the child, &quot;do you believe in the
Devil?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline played on, but turned a lovely face upon her
sister. &quot;I don't know, honey,&quot; she said. &quot;I suppose we must,
but I had rather not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Edward doesn't. He says 'What the Devil!'
but he doesn't believe in the Devil. Then why do he and
Uncle Dick call Mr. Lewis Rand the Devil?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline's hands left the strings. &quot;They neither say
nor mean that, Deb. Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward are
Federalists. They do not like Republicans, nor Mr. Jefferson,
nor Mr. Jefferson's friends. Mr. Lewis Rand is Mr.
Jefferson's friend, and he is his party's candidate for the
General Assembly, and so they do not like him. But they
do not call him such names as that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Ludwell Cary doesn't like him either,&quot; said Deb.
&quot;Why, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Ludwell Cary is his political opponent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Mr. Fairfax Cary called him a damned tobacco-roller's
son.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline reddened. &quot;Mr. Fairfax Cary might be thankful
to have so informed a mind and heart. It is well to blame
a man for his birth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Ludwell Cary said, 'A man's a man for a' that.'
What does that mean, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It means,&quot; said Jacqueline, &quot;that&mdash;that man stamps
the guinea, but God sees the gold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you tell me a story?&quot; demanded Deb. &quot;Tell
me about the time when you were a little girl and you used to
stay at Cousin Jane Selden's. And about the poor boy who
lived on the next place&mdash;and the apple tree and the little
stream where you played, and the mockingbird he gave you.
And how his father was a cruel man, and you cried because
he had to work so hard all day in the hot fields. You haven't
told me that story for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have forgotten it, Deb.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then tell me about summer before last, when you were
at Cousin Jane Selden's again, and you were grown, and
you saw the poor boy again&mdash;only he was a man&mdash;and
his father was dead, and he talked to you in Cousin Jane
Selden's flower garden. You never told me that story but
once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have forgotten that one too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why does your breath come long like that, Jacqueline?
I have gotten my feet wet. Will you tell Mammy Chloe not
to whip Miranda? Here is Uncle Edward!&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward Churchill entered from the garden, for
which he had an attachment almost comparable to his love
for the old Fontenoy library and the Fontenoy stables. He
was a gentleman of the old school, slight, withered, high-nosed
and hawk-eyed, dressed with precision and carrying
an empty sleeve. The arm he had lost at Yorktown; a temper
too hot to hold he daily lost, but he had the art to keep
his friends. There were duels to his account, as well as a
reputation for great courage and coolness during the late
war. Under the name of Horatius he contributed to The
Virginia Federalist diatribes of a polished ferocity against
the Democrat-Republicans and their chief, and he owned
Mustapha, the noblest race-horse of the day. He was a bachelor,
a member of the Cincinnati, a Black Cockade, a friend
of Alexander Hamilton, a scholar, and a sceptic; a proud,
high, fiery man, who had watched at the death-bed of many
things. He made his home with his brother, the master of
Fontenoy; and his niece Jacqueline, the daughter of a younger,
long dead brother, was to him youth, colour, music, and romance.</p>

<p>&quot;The moss-rose is in bloom,&quot; he announced, standing in
the parlour door. &quot;Come see it, Jacqueline.&quot;</p>

<p>They went out into the garden and stood before the moss-rose
bush. &quot;Oh, beautiful!&quot; exclaimed Jacqueline, and
touched the rose with her lips. It was sunny in the garden,
and the box smelled strong and sweet. The Major plucked
a sprig and studied it as though box were a rarity. &quot;I have
found,&quot; he said, &quot;Ludwell Cary's visit highly agreeable. He
has come home to Virginia as likely a man as one could
find in a summer day. He adorns the state. I predict for
him a long and successful career.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; assented Jacqueline. &quot;I like him very
much. How well he talks! And travel has not made him
forget the old days here.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major plucked another sprig of box. &quot;In the old
days, my dear, your father and your Uncle Dick and I used
to plan&mdash;well, well, castles in Spain! castles in Spain! But
he's a handsome fellow!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is indeed,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;His eyes are especially
fine. I like that clear grey&mdash;frank and kind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has sense and principle&mdash;he has mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is evident,&quot; answered his niece. &quot;He does everything
admirably. Last night after supper he read to Unity
and me. He reads extremely well. The book was the Death
of Wallenstein. He made me see that murder! My heart
stood still.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is to be admired for standing up to-day against that
damned demagogue, Lewis Rand! No matter if he is defeated.
Every gentleman applauds him. You women adore
victory, but let me tell you, a vanquished Federalist is still
the conqueror of any ranting Republican!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I tell you,&quot; asked Jacqueline, &quot;that Mr. Pincornet
holds the dancing class at Fontenoy this week?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The dancing class be damned! Ludwell Cary is a man
and a gentleman, Jacqueline&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jacqueline.</p>

<p>The Major threw away his sprig of box. &quot;The Sphinx
was a woman, and every woman is an incarnate riddle!
Why don't you care for him, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do care for him. I like him very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pshaw!&quot; said the Major irritably. &quot;Don't look at that
rose any longer! It's cankered! And it's time that Dick and
I were off. We vote&mdash;&quot; he put his shapely, nervous hand
upon his niece's shoulder&mdash;&quot;we vote, Jacqueline, for Ludwell
Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, uncle,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;I know&mdash;I know.&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Dick Churchill, large and beaming, and Major
Edward Churchill, thin and saturnine, rode away, and from
between the white pillars Deb and Jacqueline watched them
go. Colonel Dick's wife was an invalid, and lay always in the
cool and spacious &quot;chamber,&quot; between dimity bed curtains,
with her key basket on the counterpane.</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline,&quot; said Deb, &quot;whom do you vote for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Women do not vote, honey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if you <i>did</i> vote, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember,&quot; asked Jacqueline, &quot;how Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu offended Mr. Alexander Pope?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Deb. &quot;I'm little, and I ask questions, but
I'm not crooked! Will Mr. Lewis Rand ever come to Fontenoy,
Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are going to wear your blue gown to the dancing
class,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;Unity is going to wear her yellow
jaconet, and I shall wear white. I will make you a wreath
of syringa like stars. And you may wear your gloves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh-h!&quot; breathed Deb. &quot;And my cornelian ring&mdash;and
the flowered scarf&mdash;and&mdash;and your fan, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;I am tired this morning, Deb.
The sunlight is so strong. I think I'll go darken my room,
and lie down upon my bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does your head ache?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my head,&quot; said Jacqueline, and went into the house.</p>

<h3>THE TWO CANDIDATES</h3>


<p>The town, established forty years before this April
morning, had been named for a Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
lately become Queen of England. During
the Revolution it had been the scene of a raid of Tarleton's
and a camp of detention for British prisoners. It was
the county seat to which three successive presidents of the
United States must travel to cast their votes; and somewhat
later than the period of this story it was to rub elbows with a
great institution of learning. No city even in our own time, it
was, a hundred years ago, slight enough in size to suit the
genius for tempered solitude characteristic of a tobacco-growing
State.</p>

<p>A few dwelling-houses of frame and brick rose from an
emerald mist of gardens, and there were taverns, much at the
service of all who came to town with money in their purse.
The Swan allured the gentlefolk of the county, the coach-and-four
people, Jehus of light curricles, and riders of blooded
horses. The Eagle had the stage-coach patronage, and thrice
a week blew a lusty horn. Besides the inns and the dwelling-houses
there were stores and a half-built church, the Court
House, and the shady Court House yard.</p>

<p>For a great part of the time, the Court House, the centre
of gravity for the county, appeared to doze in the sunshine.
At stated intervals, however, it awoke, and the drowsy town
with it. Once awake, both became very wide awake indeed.
Court days doubled the population; an election made a beehive
of the place.</p>

<p>It was the fourth Wednesday in April, and election day.
A man was to be sent to the House of Delegates at Richmond.
All likelihood was upon the side of the candidate of
the Democrat-Republicans, but the Federalists had a fighting
chance. There were reasons why this especial election
was of great interest to the county, and the motto of both
parties was &quot;No malingering!&quot; Early in the morning, by
the Three-Notched Road, the Barracks Road, and the Secretary's
Road, through the shady Thoroughfare, over the
misty Rivanna, the Hardware, and the Rapidan, the county
began to pour electors into Charlottesville. They came upon
wheels, on horseback, and afoot; the strong and the weak,
the halt and the blind, the sick and the well, the old and the
young, all the free men of Albemarle, all alert, all pleasurably
excited over the prospect of the fight.</p>

<p>Without the Court House yard, under the locust trees to the
right of the open gate, were placed long tables, and on them
three mighty punch-bowls, flanked by drinking-cups and
guarded by house servants of venerable appearance and stately
manners. Here good Federalists refreshed themselves. To the
left of the gate, upon the trampled grass beneath a mulberry,
appeared other punch-bowls, and in addition a barrel of
whiskey, ready broached for all good Democrat-Republicans.
The sunny street was filled with horses, vehicles, and
servants; the broad path between the trees, the turf on either
hand, and the Court House steps were crowded with riotous
voters. All ranks of society, all ages, occupations, and opinions,
met in the genial weather, beneath the trees where sang
every bird of spring.</p>

<p>Within the Court House the throng, slight at first, was
rapidly increasing. The building was not large, and from
end to end, and on the high window-sills beneath the long
green blinds, the people pushed and shoved and stood a-tiptoe.
It was yet early morning, and for some unexplained reason
the Federalist candidate had not arrived.</p>

<p>Upon the Justice's Bench, raised high above the crowded
floor, sat the candidate of the Democrat-Republicans&mdash;the
Republicans, pure and simple, as they were beginning to
be called. Near him stood the sheriff and the deputy-sheriff;
around him pressed committee-men, heelers with tallies,
vociferous well-wishers, and prophets of victory, and a few,
a very few, personal and private friends. On the other hand,
strongly gathering and impatiently awaiting their candidate,
his foes gloomed upon him. Everywhere was a buzzing of
voices: farmers and townspeople voting loudly, the sheriff
as loudly recording each vote, the clerk humming over his
book, the crowd making excited comment. There was no
ballot-voting; it was a <i>viva voce</i> matter, and each man knew
his fellow's creed.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand sat at ease, a tall and personable man, with
the head of a victor, and a face that had the charm of strength.
The eye was keen and dark, the jaw square, the thick brown
hair cut short, as was the Republican fashion. His dress was
plain but good, worn with a certain sober effect, an &quot;it
pleases me,&quot; that rendered silk and fine ruffles superfluous.
He was listening to a wide-girthed tavern-keeper and old
soldier of the Revolution's loud declaration that Lewis Rand
was the coming man, and that he was for Lewis Rand. The
old county wanted no English-thinking young Federalist in
Richmond. &quot;Too many Federalists there a'ready! Mr. Lewis
Rand, Mr. Sheriff!&quot;</p>

<p>The Republicans applauded. The custom of the time
required that the man voted for should thank the man who
voted, and that aloud and aptly, with no slurring acknowledgment
of service. Lewis Rand, a born speaker and familiar
with his audience, was at no loss. &quot;I thank you, Mr.
Fagg! May your shadow never grow less! The old county&mdash;Mr.
Jefferson's county, gentlemen&mdash;may be trusted to
hold its own, in Richmond or in Washington, in Heaven or
in Hell! Mr. Fagg, I will drink your health in punch of the
Eagle's brewing! Your very obliged friend and servant!&quot;</p>

<p>From street and yard without came a noise of cheering,
with cries of &quot;Black Cockade! Black Cockade! The party
of Washington&mdash;Washington forever!&mdash;The old county
for Cary!&mdash;Albemarle for Cary!&mdash;The county for a <i>gentleman!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Ludwell Cary has arrived,&quot; announced the sheriff.</p>

<p>&quot;Here comes the gentleman!&quot; cried a man from a windowsill.
&quot;Stand up, Lewis Rand, and show him a man!&quot;</p>

<p>The throng at the door parted, and with a Federalist and
distinguished following the two Carys entered, the elder
quiet and smiling, the younger flushed, bright-eyed, and
anxious. The attachment between these two brothers was
very strong; it was to be seen in every glance that passed between
them, in every tone of voice used by each to the other.
The elder played fond Mentor, and the younger thought
his brother a demi-god. They were men of an old name, an
old place, an inherited charm. &quot;Ludwell Cary!&quot; cried a
mail. &quot;Long live Ludwell Cary!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand left the Justice's Bench, stepped forward, and
greeted his opponent. The two touched hands. &quot;I trust I
see you in health, Mr. Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Rand, I thank you, I am very well. You are early
in the lists!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am accustomed to early rising,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;This
morning I have ridden from the Wolf Trap. Will you sit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Cary, &quot;I rode from Fontenoy. After you, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>They sat down, side by side, upon the Justice's Bench, the
Federalist very easy, the Republican, lacking the perfection of
the other's manner, with a stiffness and constraint of which he
was aware and which he hated in himself. He knew himself
well enough to know that presently, in the excitement of the
race, the ugly mantle would slip from the braced athlete,
but at the moment he felt his disadvantage. Subtly and
slowly, released from some deep, central tarn of his most
secret self, a vapour of distaste and dislike began to darken
the cells of clear thought. As a boy he had admired and
envied Ludwell Cary; for his political antagonist, pure and
simple, he had, unlike most around him, often the friendliest
feeling; but now, sitting there on the Justice's Bench, he
wondered if he were going to hate Cary. Suddenly an
image came out of the vapour. &quot;How long has he been at
Fontenoy? Does he think he can win there, too?&quot;</p>

<p>The younger Cary marched to the polls with his head held
high, and voted loudly for his brother. The latter smiled
upon him, and said with simplicity, &quot;Thank you, Fair!&quot;
The Republican candidate looked attentively at the young
man. The spirit and the fire, subdued in the elder brother,
was in the younger as visible as lightning. Rand was quick
at divining men, and now he thought, &quot;This man would
make a tireless enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>Following Fairfax Cary came another of the group who
had entered with the Carys. &quot;Mr. Peyton votes for Mr.
Ludwell Cary!&quot; cried the sheriff. The Federalists applauded,
the Republicans groaned, the tallymen took note,
and Cary bowed his thanks. &quot;Mr. Peyton, your very humble
servant! Mount Eagle and Greenwood are old comrades-at-arms!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll kill <i>your</i> vote, Craven Peyton!&quot; came a voice. &quot;I
vote, Mr. Sheriff, for Lewis Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwell Cary!&quot; cried another, &quot;and there's a killer
killed, Dick Carr!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll draw a bead on you, Gentry!&quot; put in a third. &quot;The
best shot in the county, Mr. Sheriff, and that's Lewis Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis Rand stands ten ahead!&quot; cried a committee-man;
and the sheriff, &quot;Gentlemen, gentlemen! order at the polls!&quot;</p>

<p>A small, wizened man, middle-aged and elaborately
dressed in much ancient and tarnished finery, came bowing
through the crowd. A curled wig shadowed a narrow face,
and lace ruffles fell over long-fingered hands, yellow as old
ivory. The entire figure was fantastic, even a little grotesque,
though after a pleasant fashion. In a mincing voice and
with a strong French accent, M. Achille Pincornet, dancing-master
and performer on the violin, intimated that he wished
to vote for Mr. Ludwell Cary. Lewis Rand glanced sharply
up, then made a sign to a sandy-haired and freckled man who,
tally in hand, stood near him.</p>

<p>&quot;I challenge that vote!&quot; cried the man with the tally.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Pincornet's vote is challenged!&quot; shouted the sheriff.</p>

<p>&quot;Order, order, gentlemen! Your reason, Mr. Mocket?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The gentleman is a Frenchman and not a citizen of the
United States! He is not even a citizen of the French Republic!
He is an &eacute;migr&eacute;. He has no vote. Mark off his
name!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir!&quot; cried the challenged voter, &quot;I am a de Pincornet,
cadet of a house well known in Gascony! If I left France,
I left it to find a great and free country, a country where one
gentleman may serve another!&quot;</p>

<p>A roar of laughter, led by Mocket, arose from the younger
and lower sort of Republicans. &quot;But you do serve, Mr.
Pincornet! You teach all the 'Well-born' how to dance!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you teach the Carys? They dance beautifully.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are brocaded coats still worn in Gascony?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ne sutor supra crepidam judicaret!</i> Caper all you please
on a waxed floor, but leave Virginians to rule!&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary, hot and angry, put in an oar. &quot;Mr. Sheriff,
Mr. Sheriff! Mr. Pincornet has lived these twelve years in
Albemarle! We have no more respected, no more esteemed
citizen. His vote's as good as any man's&mdash;and rather
better, I may remark, than that of some men!&quot; He looked
pointedly at Mocket.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand gave his henchman a second guiding glance.</p>

<p>&quot;It is merely,&quot; said Mocket promptly, &quot;a question of
that Alien Law of which the 'Well-born' are so proud. Show
your papers, Mr. Pincornet. If you are a citizen of the United
States, you have papers to show for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; agreed the sheriff. &quot;That's right, Mr. Mocket.
Let me see your papers, Mr. Pincornet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Papers, papers! I have no papers!&quot; cried Mr. Pincornet.</p>

<p>&quot;But every gentleman here&mdash;and I have no care for the
canaille&mdash;knows that I live in Albemarle, in a small house
between Greenwood and Fontenoy! I have lived there since
I left France in the abhorred year of '92, with tears of rage
in my eyes! I came to this land, where, seeing that I must
eat, and that my dancing was always admired, I said to myself,
'<i>T'enez</i>, Achille, my friend, we will teach these Virginians
to dance!' Mr. Fairfax Cary has been my pupil, and it
gives me pleasure to vote for his brother to go make the laws
for my adopted country&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Mr. Pincornet,&quot; interrupted the sheriff, &quot;but
you have no vote. I'll have to ask you to stand aside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come up here, Mr. Pincornet,&quot; said Cary, from the Justice's
Bench. &quot;I want to ask you about a gentleman of your
name whom I had the honour to meet in London&mdash;M. le
Vicomte de Pincornet, a very gallant man&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; said the dancing master, &quot;would be my cousin
Alexandre. He escaped during the Terror hidden under a
load of hay, his son driving in a blouse and red nightcap.
Will Mr. Cary honour me?&quot; and out came a tortoise-shell
snuff-box.</p>

<p>The voting quickened. &quot;Rand is ahead&mdash;Rand is winning!&quot;
went from mouth to mouth. Fairfax Cary, caring
much where his brother cared little, welcomed impetuously
the wave of Federalists which that rumour brought in from
the yard and street. &quot;Ha, Mr. Gilmer, Mr. Carter, you are
welcome! Who votes? Who votes as General Hamilton
and Mr. Adams and Judge Marshall vote? Who votes as
<i>Washington</i> would have voted?&quot;</p>

<p>So many crowded to vote as Washington would have
voted, that it almost seemed as though his shade might lead
the Federalists to victory. But the dead Washington must
cope with the living Jefferson; mild monarchism and stately
rule with a spirit born of time, nursed by Voltaire and Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, grown articulate in the French Revolution,
and now full swing toward majority. When thrown,
the Democrat-Republicans rose from the earth like Ant&aelig;us.
Much of the gentle blood and many of the prominent men
of the county voted for Lewis Rand. Jefferson's personal
following of friends and kinsmen was large; these accepted
his man as a matter of course, while to the plain men of the
county Lewis Rand was more even than the coming man:
he was of them; he was a plain man. The clamour and
excitement grew. &quot;Here come the Three-Notched Road
people!&quot; cried a voice. &quot;They all rolled tobacco with Gideon
Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>The Three-Notched Road people voted to a man for the
son of Gideon Rand, and were promptly reinforced by a
contingent of hot Republicans from the Ragged Mountains.
At ten o'clock Lewis Rand was again well ahead, but at this
hour there was a sharp rally of the Federalists. A cheering
from without announced the arrival of some popular voter,
and Colonel Churchill and his brother, Major Edward, and
an array of Federalists from the Fontenoy district, entered
the Court House.</p>

<p>&quot;The Churchills are coming, Oho! Oho!&quot; sang out a wag
perched on the window-sill.</p>

<p>&quot;Not to that tune,&quot; roared a Scot from the gallery. &quot;Mon,
they're Tories!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlemen, gentlemen! order at the polls!&quot; shouted
the sheriff. &quot;Colonel Churchill, for whom do you vote?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I vote, sir,&quot; cried the Colonel, &quot;for Mr. Ludwell Cary,
for a gentleman and a patriot, sir, and may the old county
never be represented but by such!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Order, order at the polls! Colonel Churchill votes for
Mr. Ludwell Cary! Major Edward Churchill, whom do you
vote for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For whom do you suppose, Mr. Sheriff?&quot; said the Major.
&quot;For Mr. Ludwell Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary rose from the bench and stepped forward to the edge
of the platform. &quot;Colonel Dick, Major Edward, I thank
you both. May I deserve your confidence and your favour!
Fontenoy is as dear to me as Greenwood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By God, you shall win, Ludwell!&quot; cried Colonel Dick.
&quot;Here's a regiment of us to see you through!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rome hasn't fallen yet,&quot; added Major Edward. &quot;I don't
hear the geese cackling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One's cackling now,&quot; smiled Cary, and Mr. Tom Mocket
stepped up to the polls.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a goose; it's a turkey buzzard!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not feathered at all,&quot; said Fairfax Cary. &quot;It's a
mangy jackal to a mangy lion.&quot;</p>

<p>The young man had spoken loudly and contemptuously.
Rand, on the Justice's Bench, and Mocket, in the act of voting,
both heard, and both looked his way. Ludwell Cary
knit his brows, and meeting his brother's eyes, slightly shook
his head. Look and gesture said, &quot;Leave abuse alone,
Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket voted for Rand. &quot;I challenge that vote!&quot; cried
Major Edward Churchill. &quot;The man's been in prison.&quot;</p>

<p>Amid the noise that followed, the Jackal was heard to
cry, &quot;It's a lie! Lewis, tell them it's a lie! Major Churchill,
you'd better be careful! I was acquitted, and you know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do I?&quot; answered the Major coolly. &quot;I know that you
ought to be making shoes in the penitentiary! Mr. Sheriff,
you should really have this courtroom sprinkled with vinegar.
There's gaol fever in the air.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see, Mr. Sheriff,&quot; came Rand's voice from the
Justice's Bench, &quot;that any more vinegar is needed. Gentlemen,
all&mdash;whether Federalist or Republican&mdash;I was Mr.
Mocket's lawyer in the case referred to. Twelve good men
and true&mdash;men of this county&mdash;pronounced him innocent.
It is not surprising that my friends the Federalists
should wish to gain time,&mdash;they are leagued with old Time,&mdash;but
I protest against their gaining it by such means. This
is not a matter of parties; it is a matter of a man being
held innocent till he is proved guilty. A hundred men here
can testify as to the verdict in this case. Mr. Mocket, gentlemen&mdash;&quot;
He paused and regarded the sandy-haired and
freckled Tom, the brother of little Vinie, the sometime door-boy
in Chancellor Wythe's law office, with a smile so broadly
humorous, humane, and tolerant, that suddenly the courtroom
smiled with him. &quot;Tom Mocket, gentlemen, is a
scamp, but he's not a scoundrel! The election proceeds,
Mr. Sheriff.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I vote for Lewis Rand!&quot; shouted the scamp out of the
uproar. &quot;Richmond now, then Washington! We'll send
Lewis Rand as high as he can go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As high as the gallows!&quot; growled Major Edward
Churchill.</p>

<p>&quot;Send him,&quot; said a voice in the doorway, &quot;out West. Mr.
Jefferson gained Louisiana, but 'twill take a stronger man
to gain Mexico. Mexico wants a Buonaparte.&quot;</p>

<p>The day wore on with no lessening of heat and clamour.
The Court House becoming too full, men betook themselves
to the yard or to the street, where, mounted on chairs or on
wagons from which the horses had been taken, they harangued
their fellows. Public speaking came easily to this race. To-day
good liquor and emulation pricked them on, and the
spring in the blood. Under the locusts to the right of the
gate Federalists apostrophized Washington, lauded Hamilton,
the Judiciary, and the beauty of the English Constitution,
denounced the French, denounced the Louisiana Purchase,
denounced the Man of the People, and his every tool
and parasite, and lifted to the skies the name of Ludwell
Cary. To the left of the gate, under the locusts, the Republicans
praised the President of the United States and all his
doings, and poured oblation to Lewis Rand. From side to
side of the path there were alarms and incursions. Before
noon there had occurred a number of hand-to-hand fights,
one, at least, accompanied by &quot;gouging,&quot; and a couple of
duels had been arranged.</p>

<p>In the courtroom the parties jostled each other at the
polls, and the candidates, side by side upon the Justice's
Bench, watched the day go now this way and now that.
Their partisans they must acceptably thank, and they must
be quick of wit with their adversaries. Fatigue did not count,
nor hoarseness from much speaking, nor an undercurrent
of consciousness that there were, after all, more parties than
two, more principles than those they advocated, more colours
than black and white, more epithets than hero and villain.
They must act in their moment, and accept its excitement.
A colour burned in their cheeks, and the hair lay damp upon
their foreheads. They must listen and answer to men saying
loudly to their faces and before other men, &quot;I hold with
you, and your mind is brother to my mind&quot;; or saying, &quot;I
hold not with you, and you and your mind are abominable
to me! To outer darkness with you both!&quot;</p>

<p>Sometimes they consulted with their committee-men, and
sometimes punch was brought, and they drank with their
friends. Occasionally they spoke to each other; when they
did this, it was with extreme courtesy. Cary used the buttoned
foil with polished ease. Rand's manner was less assured;
there was something antique and laboured in his determined
grasp at the amenities of the occasion. It was the only
heaviness. To the other contest between them he brought an
amazing sureness, a suppleness, power, and audacity beyond
praise. He directed his battle, and at his elbow Tom Mocket,
sandy-haired and ferret-eyed, did him yeoman service.</p>

<p>At one o'clock there was an adjournment for dinner. The
principal Federalists betook themselves to the Swan; the principal
Republicans to the Eagle. The commonalty ate from
the packed baskets upon the trampled grass of the Court
House yard. An hour later, when the polls were reopened,
men returned to them flushed with drink and in the temper
for a quarrel, the Republicans boisterous over a foreseen
victory, the Federalists peppery from defeat. In the yard
the constable had to part belligerents, in the courtroom the
excitement mounted. The tide was set now for Lewis Rand.
The Federalists watched it with angry eyes; the Republicans
greeted with jubilation each new wave. The defeated found
some relief in gibes. &quot;Holoa! here's Citizen Bonhomme&mdash;red
breeches, cockade, and Brutus crop!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Ah, &ccedil;a ira, &ccedil;a ira, &ccedil;a ira!&quot;</p></div>

<p>&quot;That man ran away from Tarleton!&mdash;yes, you did,
the very day that Mr. Jefferson&mdash;a-hem!&mdash;<i>absented</i> himself
from Monticello!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Challenge that man&mdash;he deserted in the Indian War!</p>

<p>
&quot;November the fourth, in the year ninety-one,<br />
We had a sore engagement near to Fort Jefferson!&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Here's a traveller who has seen the mammoth and
climbed the Salt Mountain!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here's a tobacco-roller! Hey, my man, don't you miss
old friends on the road?&quot;</p>

<p>Under cover of the high words, laughter, and vituperation
which made a babel of the courtroom, Cary spoke to his
opponent. &quot;Mr. Rand, do you remember that frosty morning,
long ago, when you and I first met? I came upon you
in the woods, and together we gathered chinquapins. Does
it seem long to you since you were a boy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Long enough!&quot; answered Rand. &quot;I remember that day
very well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We told each other our names, I remember, and what
each meant to do in the world. We hardly foresaw this day.&quot;
&quot;It is not easy to foresee,&quot; said Rand slowly. &quot;If we
could, we might&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We might foresee our last meeting,&quot; smiled Cary, &quot;as
we remember our first.&quot; He took a glass of wine from a
passing servant and put it to his lips, &quot;To another meeting,
in the wood!&quot; he said, &quot;since I may not quite drink to your
victory.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my victory!&quot; answered Rand. &quot;When I have it,
I don't know that I shall care for it! That's a handsome
youth, your brother&mdash;and he has worked for you like a
Trojan! I'll drink to your brother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here are the Green Spring folk!&quot; cried a voice. &quot;They
always vote like gentlemen!&quot;</p>

<p>The Green Spring folk were a squadron, and they voted
Cary again within sight of the goal. A man who had been
standing just without the open door rested his long musket
against the wall and advanced to the polls. &quot;Last time I
voted here,&quot; he said, &quot;'twas for Mr. Jefferson. I reckon
I'll have to vote to-day for Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>A tumult arose. &quot;Adam Gaudylock belongs upon the
Mississippi!&mdash;He isn't an Albemarle man!&mdash;He's a
Kentuck&mdash;He's a Louisianian&mdash;He's a subject of Jefferson's
new kingdom!&mdash;Challenged!&mdash;He can't vote in Albemarle!&quot;</p>

<p>The hunter waited for the uproar to cease. &quot;You Federalists
are mighty poor shots!&quot; he exclaimed at last. &quot;You make
no account of the wind. I am subject of no man's kingdom.
I trade in New Orleans, and I travel on the great rivers, and
I've friends in Kentucky, and I hunt where the hunting's
good, but when I want to vote I come back to my own county
where I was born, and where I grew up among you all, and
where I've yet a pretty piece of land between here and the
mountains. I voted here before, and I'll vote here again.
The Gaudylocks may wander and wander, but their home
is on the Three-Notched Road, and they vote in Albemarle.&quot;</p>

<p>The vote standing, and Adam being followed by a string
of hunters, traders, and boatmen, the Republican candidate
was again and finally in advance. The winds blew for him
from the four quarters. In the last golden light of the afternoon
there was a strong and sudden muster of Republicans.
From all directions stragglers appeared, voice after voice
proclaiming for the man who, regarded at first as merely a
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Jefferson, had come in the last two years to be
regarded for himself. The power in him had ceased to be
latent, and friend and foe were beginning to watch Lewis
Rand and his doings with intentness.</p>

<p>As the sun set behind the Ragged Mountains, the polls
closed, and the sheriff proclaimed the election of the Republican
candidate.</p>

<p>The Court House was quickly emptied, nor was the Court
House yard far behind. The excitement had spent itself.
The result, after all, had been foreknown. It drew on chilly
with the April dusk, and men were eager to be at home,
seated at their supper-tables, going over the day with captured
friends and telling the women the news. On wheels,
on horseback or afoot, drunk and sober, north, south, east, and
west, they cantered, rolled, and trudged away from the brick
Court House and the trampled grass, and the empty bowls
beneath the locust trees.</p>

<p>The defeated candidate and the successful shook hands:
Cary quiet and smiling, half dignified and half nonchalant;
Rand with less control and certainty of himself. The one
said with perfection the proper things, the other said them
to the best of his ability. Young Fairfax Cary, standing by,
twisting his riding-whip with angry fingers, curled his lip
at the self-made man's awkwardness of phrase. Rand saw
the smile, but went on with his speech. Colonel Churchill,
who had been talking with Adam Gaudylock, left the hunter
and came up to Cary. &quot;Ludwell, you and Fair are not going
to Greenwood to-night! I have orders from the ladies to
bring you back to Fontenoy&mdash;alive or dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I find myself very much alive, Colonel!&quot; answered Cary.
&quot;Thank you, I'll gladly spend the night at Fontenoy. Fontenoy
would draw me, I think, if I <i>were</i> dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dick has a middling Madeira,&quot; remarked Major Edward.
&quot;And after supper Jacqueline shall sing to us. Good-evening,
Mr. Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-evening to you, Major Churchill,&quot; said Rand.
&quot;Good-evening, Mr. Cary. Good-evening, gentlemen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here are Eli and Mingo with the horses,&quot; said Fairfax
Cary, his back to the Republican. &quot;Let's away, Ludwell!&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Churchill laughed. &quot;Fontenoy draws you too,
Fairfax? Well, my niece Unity is a pleasing minx&mdash;yes, by
gad! Miss Dandridge is a handsome jade! Come away,
come away, gentlemen!&quot;</p>

<p>Federalists and Republicans exchanged the stiffest of bows,
and the party for Fontenoy mounted and took the road. The
Republicans whom they left behind had a few moments of
laughter and jubilation, and then they also quitted the Court
House yard and called to the servants for the horses.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll spend the night at Edgehill, I hope, Mr. Rand?&quot;
cried one. &quot;Mrs. Randolph expects you&mdash;she will wish
to write to her father of your day&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, come with me!&quot; put in another. &quot;There's all
this business to talk over&mdash;and I've a letter to show you
from Mr. Madison&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Best come to the Eagle!&quot; cried a third. &quot;No end of
jolly fellows, and bumpers to next year&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Rand shook his head. &quot;Thank you, Colonel Randolph&mdash;but
I am riding to Monticello. Mr. Jefferson has written
for some papers from the library. Burwell will care for me
to-night. Present, if you will, my humble services to Mrs.
Randolph and the young ladies. By the same token I cannot
go with you, Mr. Carr, nor to the Eagle, Mr. Jones.&mdash;My
grateful thanks to you, one and all, gentlemen! I am a
plain man&mdash;I can say no more. We will ride together as
far as the creek.&quot;</p>

<p>The negro Joab brought his horse, a magnificent animal,
the gift of Jefferson. He mounted and the party kept together
as far as the creek, where their ways parted. Rand
checked his horse, said good-bye, and watched the gentlemen
who had given him their support ride cheerfully away
toward the light of home. He himself was waiting for Adam
Gaudylock, who was going with him to Monticello. After
a moment's thought he decided not to wait there beside
the creek, but to turn his horse and leave a message for
Tom Mocket at a house which he had passed five minutes
before.</p>

<h3>MONTICELLO</h3>


<p>The house, a low frame one, stood back from the
road, in a tangle of old, old flowering shrubs. Rand
drew rein before the broken gate, and a young
woman in a linsey gown rose from the porch step and came
down the narrow path toward him. She carried an earthenware
pitcher and cup. &quot;It's water just from the well,&quot; she
said, &quot;fresh and cool. Won't you have some?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;Vinie, why don't you
mend that gate?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, thir,&quot; said Vinie. &quot;Tom's always going
to.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand laughed. &quot;Don't call me 'thir'! Vinie, I'm elected.&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie set down her pitcher beside a clump of white phlox
and wiped her hands on the skirt of her linsey dress. &quot;Are
you going away to Richmond?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Not until October. When I do I'll go see the little old
house you used to live in, Vinie!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's torn down,&quot; remarked Vinie soberly. &quot;Here's Tom
now, and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Adam Gaudylock. Don't you remember Adam?&quot;</p>

<p>The hunter and Tom Mocket came up together. &quot;We beat
them! we beat them, hey, Lewis!&quot; grinned the scamp; and
Gaudylock cried, &quot;Why, if here isn't the little partridge
again! Don't you want to see what I've got in my pouch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir,&quot; said Vinie.</p>

<p>Rand and his lieutenant talked together in a low voice,
Mocket leaning against black Selim's neck, Rand stooping
a little, and with earnestness laying down the law of the case.
They talked for ten minutes, and then Rand gathered up
the reins, asked for another cup of water, and with a friendly
&quot;Good-bye, Vinie!&quot; rode off toward Monticello, Adam
Gaudylock going with him.</p>

<p>Brother and sister watched the riders down the road until
the gathering dark and the shadow of the trees by the creek
hid them from sight. &quot;Just wait long enough and we'll see
what we see,&quot; quoth Tom. &quot;Lewis Rand's going to be a
great man!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How great?&quot; asked Vinie. &quot;Not as great as Mr. Jefferson?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; the scamp answered sturdily. &quot;He
might be. One thing's certain, anyhow; he's not built like
Mr. Madison or Mr. Monroe. He'll not be content to travel
the President's road always. He'll have a road all his
own.&quot; The scamp's imagination, not usually lively, bestirred
itself under the influence of the day, of wine, and the
still audible sound of horses' hoofs. &quot;By George, Vinie! it
will be a Roman road, hard, paved, and fit for triumphs!
He thinks it won't, but he's mistaken. He doesn't see himself!&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie took the pitcher from beneath the white phlox.
&quot;It's getting dark. Tom, aren't we ever going to have
that gate mended?&mdash;He's going away to Richmond in
October.&quot;</p>

<p>The successful candidate and Adam Gaudylock, followed
by Joab on a great bay horse, crossed Moore's Creek, and
took the Monticello road. A red light yet burned in the west,
but the trees were dark along the way, and the hollows filled
with shadow. The dew was falling, the evening dank and
charged with perfume.</p>

<p>&quot;I asked you to come with me,&quot; said Rand, &quot;because I
wanted to talk to some one out of the old life. Mocket's out
of the old life too, he and Vinie. But&mdash;&quot; he laughed.
&quot;They're afraid of me. Vinie calls me 'thir.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm not afraid of you,&quot; Adam said placidly. &quot;No
one at home at Monticello?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but Burwell keeps a room in readiness. I am often
there on errands for Mr. Jefferson. Well, how go matters
west of the mountains?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Christmas I spent at Louisville,&quot; answered Gaudylock,
&quot;and then went down the river to New Orleans. The city's
like a hive before swarming. There are more boats at its
wharves than buds on yonder Judas tree. And back from
the river the cotton's blooming now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Rand, &quot;I should like to see that land! When
you have done a thing, Adam, a thing that you have striven
with all your might to do, does it at once seem to you a small
thing to have done? It does to me&mdash;tasteless, soulless, and
poor, not worth a man's while. Where lies the land of satisfaction?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; answered Adam, &quot;I don't look at things that way.
But then I'm not ambitious. Last year, in New Orleans, I
watched a man gaming. He won a handful of French crowns.
'Ha!' says he, 'they glittered, but they do not glitter now!
Again!'&mdash;and this time he won doubloons. 'We'll double
these,' says he, and so they did, and he won. 'This is a small
matter,' he said. We'll play for double-eagles,' and so they
did, and he won. 'Haven't you a tract of sugar-canes?' says
he. 'Money's naugh. Let us play for land!' and he won
the sugar-canes. 'That girl, that red-lipped Jeanne of thine,
that black eye in the Street of Flowers&mdash;I'll play for her!
Deal the cards!' But he never won the girl, and he lost the
sugar-canes and the gold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man walks forward, or he walks backward. There's
no standing still in this world or the next. Where were you
after New Orleans, before you turned homeward?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At Mr. Blennerhassett's island in the Ohio. And that's
a pleasant place and a pleasant gentleman&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye,&quot; answered the other; &quot;I heard it some moments
back. Some one is fiddling beyond that tulip tree.&quot;</p>

<p>They were now ascending the mountain, moving between
great trees, fanned by a cooler wind than had blown in the
valley. The road turned, showing them a bit of roadside
grass, a giant tulip tree, and a vision of a moon just rising
in the east. Upon a log, beneath the tree, appeared the dim
brocade and the curled wig of M. Achille Pincornet, resting
in the twilight and solacing his soul with the air of &quot;Madelon
Friquet.&quot; Around him sparkled the fireflies, and above were
the thousand gold cups of the tulip tree. His bow achieved
a long tremolo; he lowered the violin from his chin, stood up,
and greeted the travellers.</p>

<p>&quot;That was a pretty air, Mr. Pincornet,&quot; said Rand. &quot;Why
are you on the Monticello road? Your next dancing class is
at Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how did you know that, sir?&quot; demanded the Frenchman
in his high, thin voice. As he spoke, he restored his
fiddle to its case with great care, then as carefully brushed
all leaf and mould from his faded silken clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;I know&mdash;I know,&quot; replied Rand. He regarded the figure
in dusty finery with a certain envy of any one who was
going to Fontenoy, even as dancing master, even as a man
no longer young. Mr. Pincornet looked, in the twilight, very
pinched, very grey, very hungry. &quot;Come on with me to
Monticello,&quot; said the young man. &quot;Burwell will give us
supper, and find us a couple of bottles to boot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; answered the Frenchman stiffly, but with an
inner vision of Monticello cheer, &quot;I would not vote for
you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Rand laughed. &quot;I bear no malice, Mr. Pincornet. Opinion's
but opinion. I'll cut no traveller's throat because he
likes another road than mine! Come, come! Fish from the
river, cakes and coffee, Mr. Pincornet&mdash;and afterwards wine
on the terrace!&quot;</p>

<p>The road climbed on. Between the stems of the tall trees,
feathered with the green of mid-spring, the dogwood displayed
its stars, and the fringe tree rose like a fountain.
Everywhere was the sound of wind in the leaves. When the
riders and the dancing master, who was afoot, reached the
crest of the little mountain, shaven and planed by the hand
of man into a fair plateau, the moon was shining brightly.
In the silver light, across the dim lawns, classically simple,
grave, and fair, rose the house that Jefferson had built. The
gate clanged behind the party from Charlottesville, a dog
barked, a light flared, voices of negroes were heard, and
hurrying feet from the house quarter. Upon the lawn to the
right and left of the mansion were two toy houses, tiny brick
offices used by Jefferson for various matters. The door of
one of these now opened, and Mr. Bacon, the overseer,
hastening across the wet grass, greeted Rand and Gaudylock
as they dismounted before the white portico.</p>

<p>&quot;Evening, evening, Mr. Rand! I knew you'd be coming
up, so I hurried on afore ye. C&aelig;sar and Joab, you take the
horses round! Glad to see you, Adam; you too, Mr. Pincornet!
Well, Mr. Rand, you spoiled the Egyptians this day!
I never saw a finer election! Me and Mr. Fagg were talking
of you. 'His father was a fighter before him,' says Mr. Fagg,
says he, 'and he's a fighter, too, damn him!' says he, 'and
we'll send him higher yet. Damn the Federalists!' says he.
'He's a taller man than Ludwell Cary!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a mighty hungry man, Mr. Bacon,&quot; said Rand.
&quot;And so is Adam, and so is Mr. Pincornet! You'll take supper
with us, I hope? We'll make Adam Gaudylock tell us
stories of Louisiana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank'ee, Mr. Rand, I will. Your room's all ready,
sir, and Burwell shall bring you a julep. I reckon you're
pretty tired. Lord! I'd rather clear a mountain side and
then plough it, than to have to sit there all day on that there
Justice's Bench and listen to them Federalists! They're a
lot! And that Fairfax Cary&mdash;he's a chip of the old block,
he surely is! He'd have gone through fire to-day to see his
brother win. This way, gentlemen! Sally'll have supper
ready in a jiffy. I smell the coffee now. Well, well, Mr.
Rand! to think of the way you used to trudge up here all
weathers, snow or storm or hot sun, just for a book&mdash;and
now you come riding in on Selim, elected to Richmond, over
the heads of the Carys! Life's queer, ain't it? We'll hear
of you at Fontenoy next!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand smiled. &quot;Life's not so queer as that, Mr. Bacon.
I wish you might&mdash;&quot; he broke off.</p>

<p>&quot;Might what?&quot; asked Bacon.</p>

<p>&quot;Hear of me at Fontenoy,&quot; answered Rand, and entered
the wide hall as one who was at home there. &quot;I'll go bathe
my face and hands,&quot; he said, and turned into the passage
that led to the bedrooms.</p>

<p>A tall clock struck the hour, a bell rang cheerfully, and
Burwell flung open the dining-room door. Rand, entering a
moment later, found the overseer, the hunter, and the dancing
master awaiting him. With a nod and a &quot;Ha, Burwell!&quot;
for the old servant, he took his place at the table, and he took
it like a prince, throwing his tall, vigorous figure into the
armchair which marked the head of the board, seating himself
before the other and older men. In the wave of his hand
toward the three remaining places there was a condescension
not the less remarkable that it was entirely unconscious.
The life within him was moving with great rapidity. It was
becoming increasingly natural for him to act, simply, without
thought, as his inner man bade. What yesterday was uneasiness,
and to-day seemed assurance, was apt by to-morrow
to attain convincingness. It was not that he appeared to value
himself too highly. Instead, he made no attempt at valuation;
he went his way like wind or wave. He took the armchair
at the head of the Monticello table with the simplicity of a
child, and the bearing of a general who sups with his officers
after a victorious field.</p>

<p>The unfolding of the petal was not missed by his companions.
Adam Gaudylock, with a glance, half shrewd and
half affectionate, for the man whom he had known from
boyhood, sank into the opposite seat with a light and happy
laugh. It mattered little to Adam where he sat in life, provided
that it was before a window. The overseer, a worthy,
plain man, had a thought of old Gideon Rand, but, remembering
in time Mr. Jefferson's high opinion of the man now
occupying his chair, sat down and unfolded his damask napkin
with great care. Mr. Pincornet, indeed, raised his eyebrows
and made a backward movement from the table, but
at that moment a mulatto boy appeared with a plate of waffles.
The light from the wax candles burned, too, in certain
crimson decanters. &quot;Sit down, sit down, Mr. Pincornet!&quot;
said Rand, and the dancing master took the remaining place.</p>

<p>An hour later Rand pushed back his heavy chair and rose
from the table, ending the meal with as little ceremony as he
had used in beginning it. &quot;I shall go write to Mr. Jefferson,&quot;
he announced, as the four passed into the hall. &quot;You,
Adam, what will you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First I'll smoke and then I'll sleep,&quot; said Adam. The
moonlight streamed in upon them through the open hall
door. &quot;I'll smoke outside. That's a southern moon.</p>

<p>
&quot;Kiss me, kiss me, flower o' night!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Madelon!</span><br />
'Ware the voices, 'ware the light!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Madelon!</span><br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Will you smoke with me, Mr. Bacon? I'd like to try the
Monticello leaf.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have to go to the quarters for a bit,&quot; answered the
overseer. &quot;There's sickness there. I'll join you later, Mr.
Gaudylock.&quot;</p>

<p>He went whistling away. Adam sat down upon the broad
steps whitened by the moon, filled his pipe, struck a spark
from his flint and steel, and was presently enveloped in fragrant
smoke. The dancing-master, hesitating somewhat disconsolately
in the hall, at last went also into the moonlight,
where he walked slowly up and down upon the terrace, his
thin, beruffled hands clasped behind his old brocaded coat.
What with the moonlight and the ancient riches of his apparel,
and a certain lost and straying air, he had the seeming of a
phantom from some faint, bewigged, perfumed, and painted
past.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand paused for a moment before the door, and
looked out upon the splendid night, then turned and passed
into the library, where he called for candles, and, sitting down
at a desk, began to write. His letter was to the President of
the United States, and it was written freely and boldly.
&quot;'Twas thus they did&mdash;'twas so I did. We won, and I am
glad; they lost, and that also is to my liking. As the party
owes its victory to your name and your power, so I owe my
personal victory to your ancient and continued kindness.
May my name be abhorred if ever I forget it! The Federalists
mustered strongly. Mr. Ludwell Cary is extremely 'well
born,' and that younger brother of his is&mdash;I know not why,
he troubles me. There is a breath of the future about him,
and it breathes cold. Well! I have fought and I have won.
'Let the blast of the desert come: I shall be renowned in my
day!' To-night, you see, I quote Ossian. The moon is
flooding the terrace. Were you here in your loved home, we
would talk together. Adam Gaudylock is with me. Lately
he was in Louisiana, and then with a Mr. Blennerhassett
upon the Ohio. General Wilkinson is at New Orleans. The
Spaniards are leaving, the French well affected. The mighty
tide of our people has topped the mountains and is descending
into those plains of the Mississippi made ours by your
prophetic vision and your seizure of occasion. The First
Consul is a madman! He has sold to us an Empire! Empire!
Emperor&mdash;Emperor of the West! The sound is stately.
You laugh. We are citizens of a republic. Well! I am content.
I aspire no higher. I am not Buonaparte. Your
lilies are budding beneath the windows; the sweet williams
are all in bloom. I have little news for you of town or country&mdash;Mrs.
Randolph, doubtless, sends you all. Work goes on
upon the church. For me, I worship in the fields with the
other beasts of burden or of prey. The wheat looks well,
and there will be this year a great yield of apples. Major
Churchill's Mustapha won at Winchester. Colonel Churchill
has cleared a large tract of woods behind Fontenoy and
will use it for tobacco. I rode by his plant bed the other day,
and the leaf is prime. I am a judge of tobacco. They are
bitter, the Fontenoy men. Mr. Ludwell Cary will, I suppose,
remain in the county. He is altering and refurnishing Greenwood.
I suppose that he will marry. The rains have been
frequent this spring, the roads heavy and the rivers turbid.
The stream is much swollen by my house on the Three-Notched
Road. We hear that the feeling grows between
General Hamilton and Aaron Burr. Should the occasion
arise, pray commend me to the latter, whose acquaintance I
had the honour to make last year when I visited New York.
There, if you please, is a spirit restless and audacious!
The mill on the Rockfish is grinding this spring. The
murder case of which I wrote you will be tried next court
day. One Fitch killed one Thomas Dole in North Garden;
knocked at his door one night, called him out, and shot him
down. Dole had thwarted Fitch in some project or other.
I am retained by the State, and I mean to hang Fitch.
Adam Gaudylock says there is a region of the Mississippi
where the cotton grows taller than a man's head. We may
find our gold of Ophir in that plant. To-night I am a victor.
I salute you, so much oftener than I a victor! But victory
is a mirage: this that I thought so fair is but a piece of
the desert; the <i>magnum bonum</i> shines, looms, and beckons
still ahead! Had I been defeated, I believe I should have
been in better spirits. Now to the papers which you desired
me to read and comment upon: I find&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The quill travelled on, conveying to sheet after sheet the
opinion upon certain vexed questions of a very able lawyer.
The analysis was keen, the reasoning just, the judgment
final, the advice sound. The years since that determinative
hour in the Richmond book-shop had been well harvested.
The paper when he had finished it would have pleased
the ideal jurist.</p>

<p>He wrote until the clock struck ten; then folded, sealed,
and superscribed his letter, pushed back the heavy hair from
his forehead, and rose from the desk. The long windows
opened upon the terrace, and through them came the moonbeams
and the fragrance of the April night&mdash;music too, for
Mr. Pincornet was playing the violin. The young man extinguished
the candles, and stepped into the silvery world
without the room. Adam Gaudylock had disappeared, and
the overseer was gone to bed. Lights were out in the quarters;
the house was as still and white as a mansion in a fairy tale.
Mr. Pincornet was no skilled musician, but the air he played
was old and sweet, and it served the hour. Below their
mountain-top lay the misty valleys; to the east the
moon-flooded plains; to the west the far line of the Blue Ridge.
The night was cloudless.</p>

<p>Rand stood with his hands upon the balustrade, then
walked down the terrace and paused before the dancing
master. &quot;Before he hurt his hand Mr. Jefferson played
the violin beautifully,&quot; he said. &quot;When I was younger, in
the days when I tried to do everything that he did, I tried
to learn it too. But I have no music in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a solace,&quot; answered Mr. Pincornet. &quot;I learned
long ago, in the South.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like the harp,&quot; announced Rand abruptly.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a becoming instrument to a woman,&quot; replied
Mr. Pincornet, and in a somewhat ghostly fashion became
vivacious. &quot;Ah, a rounded arm, a white hand, the rise and
fall of a bosom behind the gold wires&mdash;and the notes like
water dropping, sweet, sweet! Ah, I, too, like the harp!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have never heard it but twice,&quot; said Rand, and turned
again to the balustrade. Below him lay the vast and shadowy
landscape. Here and there showed a light&mdash;a pale earth-star
shining from grey hill or vale. Rand looked toward
Fontenoy, and he looked wistfully. Behind him the violin
was telling of the springtime; from the garden came the smell
of the syringas; the young man's desire was toward a woman.
&quot;Is she playing her harp to-night? is she playing to Ludwell
Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>
&quot;Belle saison de ma jeunesse&mdash;<br />
Beaux jours du printemps!&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>sang the violin. A shot sounded near the house. Adam
Gaudylock emerged from the shadow of the locust trees and
crossed the moonlit lawn below the terrace. &quot;I've shot that
night-hawk. He'll maraud no more,&quot; he said, and passed on
toward his quarter for the night.</p>

<p>Rand made a motion as if to follow, then checked himself.
It was late, and it had been a day of strife, but his iron frame
felt no fatigue and his mood was one of sombre exaltation.
What was the use of going to bed, of wasting the moonlit
hours? He turned to the Frenchman. &quot;Play me,&quot; he commanded,
&quot;a conquering air! Play me the Marseillaise!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Pincornet started violently. Down came the fiddle
from his chin, the bow in his beruffled hand cut the air with
a gesture of angry repudiation. When he was excited he
forgot his English, and he now swore volubly in French;
then, recovering himself, stepped back a pace, and regarded
with high dudgeon his host of the night. &quot;Sir,&quot; he cried,
&quot;before I became a dancing master I was a French gentleman!
I served the King. I will teach you to dance, but&mdash;Morbleu!&mdash;I
will not play you the Marseillaise!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Rand. &quot;I forgot that you could
not be a Republican. Well, play me a fine Royalist air.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you so indifferent?&quot; asked the dancing master, not
without a faded scorn. &quot;Royalist or Republican&mdash;either
air?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indifferent?&quot; repeated Rand. &quot;I don't know that I
am indifferent. Open-minded, perhaps,&mdash;though I don't
know that that is calling it rightly. The airs the angels sing,
and the thundering march of the damned through hell&mdash;why
should I not listen to them both? I don't believe in
hell, nor much in angels, save one, but I like the argument.
Mr. Pincornet, I don't want to sleep. Suppose&mdash;suppose
you teach me a minuet?&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed as he spoke, but he spoke in earnest. &quot;Knowledge!
I want all kinds of knowledge. I know law, and I
know what to do with a jury, and I know tobacco&mdash;worse
luck!&mdash;but I don't know the little things, the little gracious
things that&mdash;that make a man liked. If I were a Federalist,
and if I didn't know so much about tobacco, I would
go, Mr. Pincornet, to your dancing class at Fontenoy!&quot;
He laughed again. &quot;I can't do that, can I? The Churchills
would all draw their swords. Come! I have little time and
few chances to acquire that which I have longed for always,&mdash;the
grace of life. Teach me how to enter a drawing-room;
how to&mdash;how to dance with a lady!&quot;</p>

<p>His tone, imperious when he demanded the Marseillaise,
was now genial, softened to a mellow persuasiveness. Mr.
Pincornet shrugged his shoulders. He had been offended, but
he was not unmagnanimous, and he had a high sense of the
importance of his art. He had seen in France what came of
uncultivated law-givers. If a man wanted knowledge, far be it
from Achille de Pincornet to withhold his handful! &quot;You cannot
learn in a night,&quot; he said, &quot;but I will show you the steps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can manage a country dance, a reel or Congo,&quot; said
Rand simply. &quot;I want to know politer things.&quot;</p>

<p>They left the terrace, went into the drawing-room, and lit
the candles. The floor, rubbed each morning until it shone,
gave back the heart-shaped flames. The slight furniture they
pushed aside. The dancing master tucked his violin under his
chin, drew the bow across the strings, and began the lesson.</p>

<p>The candles burned clear, strains of the <i>minuet de la cour</i>
rose and fell in the ample room, the member from Albemarle
and Mr. Pincornet stepped, bent, and postured with the gravity
of Indian sachems. The one moved through the minuet
in top-boots and riding-coat, the other taught in what had
been a red brocade. Rand, though tall and largely built,
moved with the step and carriage, light and lithe, of one who
has used the woods; the Frenchman had the suppleness
of his profession and of an ancient courtier. Now they bowed
one to the other, now each to an imaginary lady. Mr. Pincornet
issued directions in the tone of a general ordering a
charge, his pupil obeyed implicitly. In the silent house,
raised high on a mountain-top above a sleeping world, in
the lit room with many open windows, through which poured
the fragrance of spring, they practised until midnight the
<i>minuet de la cour.</i> The hour struck; they gravely ceased to
dance, and after five minutes spent in mutual compliments,
closed the long windows and put out the superfluous lights,
then said good-night, and, bedroom candle in hand, repaired
each to his own chamber. Rand had risen at dawn, and his
day had been a battlefield, but before he lay down in the
dimity-hung, four-post bed he sat long at the window of his
small, white, quiet room. The moon shone brightly; the air
was soft and sweet. In the distance a lamb bleated, then all
was still again. The young man rested his chin on his hand,
and studied the highest stars. That day a milestone had
been passed. He saw his road stretching far, far before him,
and he saw certain fellow travellers, but the companion whom
his heart cried for he could not see.</p>

<p>&quot;Her way and mine are far apart&mdash;are far apart. I had
better marry Vinie Mocket.&quot; He spoke half aloud and with
bitterness, looking from the window toward Fontenoy. Suddenly
the water smarted in his eyes, and he stretched out his
arms. &quot;Oh, pardon, love!&quot; he whispered, &quot;I love but you&mdash;and
I'll love you to the end!&quot; His fancy dwelt on
Fontenoy. It was for him enchanted land, the sleeping
palace, strongly hedged. &quot;But I am not the appointed
man,&quot; he thought. &quot;I am a pauper, and no prince. It is
Ludwell Cary that goes in and out.&quot;</p>

<h3>RAND COMES TO FONTENOY</h3>


<p>&quot;I never dance but by candlelight,&quot; remarked Unity.
&quot;A Congo in the heat of the afternoon, a jig before
sunset,&mdash;la! I had rather plough by moonlight. As
well be a grasshopper in a daisy field! Elegance by waxlight
becomes rusticity in the sunshine,&mdash;and of all things I would
not be rustic! Oh, Mr. Cary, I've caught my gown in this
rosebush!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Fairfax Cary knelt to release the muslin prisoner.
&quot;Rusticity becomes you so that if I were a king, you should
dance with me the livelong day. But I'll not grumble if
only you'll dance with me as soon as the candles are lit!
Last night you were all for that booby, Ned Hunter!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's no booby,&quot; said Miss Dandridge. &quot;He is bashful&mdash;though,
indeed, I think he is only bashful in company!
We sat on the porch, and he told me the long history of his
life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Confound his impudence&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it was interesting as&mdash;as the Mysteries of Udolpho!
You are a long time over that briar, Mr. Cary. There!
thank you! Listen to Mr. Pincornet's fiddle. Scrape, scrape,
scrape! The children are dancing, and Jacqueline is helping
them. Jacqueline is always helping some one. But Mr.
Pincornet thinks it is because she is in love with him. He
is sorry for her because he rather prefers me. I am in love
with him too. So is Molly Carter, so is Anne Page, and so
will be little Deb as soon as she is old enough. He is fifty,
and French, and a dancing master, and he wears an old, old,
lace cravat and a powdered wig! When are we going back
to the house, Mr. Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us walk a little farther!&quot; pleaded the gentleman.
&quot;It is cool and pleasant, with no fuss, and no Ned Hunter,
with the history of his life, confound him! Other men have
histories as well as he! Your gown looks so pretty against
the leaves. Let us walk down to the lower gate.&quot;</p>

<p>Unity pursed her red lips, and considered the distance
with velvety black eyes. &quot;I have on my dancing shoes,&mdash;but
perhaps you will help me across the brook!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will,&quot; declared Fairfax Cary, and, when the brook
was reached, was as good as his word.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall tell Uncle Dick to put safer stepping-stones,&quot;
quoth Miss Dandridge, with heightened colour. &quot;How thick
the mint grows here! We are at the gate, Mr. Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us walk to the bend of the road! The wild honeysuckle
is in bloom there; I noticed it riding to Charlottesville
the other morning. It is just the colour of your gown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it must be beautiful,&quot; said Miss Dandridge, &quot;for
this rose-coloured muslin came from London. Ah, you
looked so angry and so beaten on Wednesday, when you came
back from Charlottesville!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was not angry, and I was not beaten.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fie! You mean that your brother was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean nothing of the kind!&quot; cried the younger Cary
hotly. &quot;My brother, at the importunity of his friends, and
for the good of the county, consented to stand against this
pet of Jefferson's, this&mdash;this <i>vaurien</i> Lewis Rand. Some
one had to stand. He knew what the result would be. 'Twas
but a skirmish&mdash;just a seat in a tri-colour Republican House
of Delegates! My faith! the honour's not great. But wait
awhile, Miss Dandridge! The real battle's not yet. Beaten!
Rands, Miss Dandridge, don't beat Carys!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;La, so warm!&quot; exclaimed Unity. &quot;I have never seen
a man love a brother so!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwell Cary is worthy of any man's love&mdash;or any
woman's either!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The pair of you ought to be put in the wax-works, and
labelled 'The Loving Brothers.' When you marry, there'll
be no love left for your wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just you try and see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man whom I marry,&quot; said Miss Dandridge, &quot;must
have no thought but for me. He must swoon if I frown, laugh
if I smile, weep if I sigh, be altogether desperate if I look
another way. I am like Falkland in The Rivals. Heigho!
this is the bend of the road, Mr. Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am altogether desperate when you look another way.
When you looked at Ned Hunter last night, I wanted to blow
his brains out. He hasn't any, but I should like to try.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you would have been hanged for murder,&quot; remarked
Miss Dandridge. &quot;Think how terrible that would be for us
all!&mdash;Did you know that Mr. Hunter once dined with
General Washington?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a royal coquette. See, there is the honeysuckle!
If I gather it for you, will you wear one spray to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a very stiff flower,&quot; said Unity thoughtfully, &quot;and
I have an idea that Mr. Hunter will bring me violets. But&mdash;I
will see if I can find a place for one small spray.&quot;</p>

<p>She sat down upon a fallen tree, took her round chin into
her hand, and studied the point of her morocco shoe, while
her cavalier, not without detriment to his pumps and silk
stockings, scrambled up the red bank to the rosy flowers.</p>

<p>The honeysuckles did not grow upon the main road, but
upon a rough and narrow cross-country track, little used except
by horsemen pressed for time. Now, clear through the
still afternoon, a sound of hoofs gave warning that riders
were coming down the steep and dangerous hill beyond the
turn. Unity looked up with interest, and Fairfax Cary paused
with his hand upon a coral bough. Suddenly there was a
change in the beat, then a frightened shout, and a sound of
rolling stones and a wild clatter of hoofs. Unity sprang to
her feet; Cary came down the bank at a run, tossed her his
armful of blossoms, and was in the middle of the road in
time to seize by the bridle the riderless horse which came
plunging around the bend.</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary was strong, the black horse not quite mad
with terror, and the man mastered the brute. &quot;Whose is
he?&quot; he asked. &quot;If you will hold him&mdash;he is quite quiet
now&mdash;I will go see.&quot;</p>

<p>A negro came panting around the turn. &quot;Gawd-a-moughty,
marster! did you cotch dat horse? You, Selim, I's gwine
lam' you, I's gwine teach you er lesson&mdash;dancin' roun'
on yo' two foots 'cause you sees er scrap of paper! R'arin'
an' pitchin' an' flingin' white folks on er heap of stones! I'll
larn you! Yo' marster was a-dreamin', or you'd never th'owed
him! You jes wait twel I git you home! Marse Fairfax
Cary, dis debbil done th'owed my marster, an' he lyin' by
de roadside, an' I don' know whether he live or daid!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know you now,&quot; exclaimed the younger Cary. &quot;You're
Mr. Lewis Rand's servant. Hadn't you better stay here,
Miss Dandridge, until I see what really is the matter?
Here, boy, stop chattering your teeth! Your master's not
killed. Was it at the top of the hill?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Halfway down, Marse Fairfax, whar de footpath goes
down through de papaw bushes. Joab'll show you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm coming too,&quot; said Miss Dandridge. &quot;I'll lead Selim.&quot;</p>

<p>Without more ado the four rounded the bend of the road
and began to climb the hill. Halfway up, as Joab had stated,
they found their man. He lay beside the papaw bushes,
among the loose stones, and he lay very still. One arm was
doubled under him. His head was thrown back, and his
brown hair was matted with blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Unity pitifully, and went down upon her
knees beside the unfortunate.</p>

<p>Cary examined the cut in the head. &quot;Well, he's not
dead, but he's had a pretty fall! What's to be done?
Joab&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joab,&quot; commanded Miss Dandridge, &quot;ride straight to
Fontenoy and tell Colonel Dick to send Big Jim and a
couple of men with the old litter!&mdash;and then ride to Charlottesville
and bring Dr. Gilmer&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to take him to Fontenoy?&quot; asked the
younger Cary.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; flashed Miss Dandridge. &quot;Would you leave
him to bleed to death by the roadside? 'My enemy's
dog&mdash;' and so forth. Hurry, Joab!&quot;</p>

<p>The negro mounted his horse that had been grazing by
the papaw bushes, and was off at a gallop, leaving Unity and
Cary with the luckless rider. Cary brought water from the
brook that brawled at the foot of the steep hillside, and Unity
wet the brow and lips of the unconscious man, but he had
given no sign of life when the relief party arrived from Fontenoy.
This consisted of four stout negroes bearing the litter,
and of Colonel Dick Churchill and Mr. Ned Hunter.</p>

<p>&quot;Tut, tut!&quot; cried Colonel Dick. &quot;What's this? what's
this? Damn this place! My mare Nelly threw me here
thirty years ago!&mdash;I was coming home from a wedding.
Senseless and cut across the head!&mdash;and I don't like the
way that arm's bent.&mdash;Ned Hunter, you take Big Jim's
corner of the litter for a minute. Now, Big Jim, you lift Mr.
Rand.&mdash;So! we'll have him at Fontenoy in a jiffy, and in
bed in the blue room. Run ahead, Unity, and tell Jacqueline
and Mammy Chloe to make ready. His boy's gone for
Gilmer. Easy now, men! Yes, 'twas at this very spot
my mare Nelly threw me!&mdash;it was Maria Erskine's wedding.&quot;</p>


<p>The sun was low in the heavens when the good Samaritans
and the unconscious man arrived at the foot of the
wide, white-pillared Fontenoy porch. The arrival had many
witnesses; for on hearing of the accident the large party
assembled for the dancing class had at once dropped all
employment and flocked to various coigns of vantage. A bevy
of young girls looked from one parlour window, and another
framed Mr. Pincornet's face and wig and flowered coat.
In the hall and on the porch the elders gathered, while on
the broad porch steps young men in holiday dress waited to
see if they might be of help. Around the corner of the house
peered the house negroes, pleasurably excited by any catastrophe
and any procession, even that of a wounded man
borne on a litter.</p>

<p>The cort&egrave;ge arrived. In the midst of much ejaculation,
and accompanied by a fire of directions from Colonel Dick,
Lewis Rand was borne up the steps and across the porch
into the cool, wide hail. Here the litter was met by Jacqueline
Churchill. She came down the shadowy staircase in
a white gown, with a salver and a glass in her hand. &quot;The
room is ready, Uncle Dick,&quot; she said, in a steady voice.
&quot;The blue room. Aunt Nancy says you must make him take
this cordial. I have lint and bandages all ready. This way,
Big Jim. Mind the wall!&quot;</p>

<p>She turned and preceded the men up the stair, along a
hallway and into a pleasant chamber hung with blue and
white. &quot;Turn down the sheet, Mammy Chloe,&quot; she directed
a negro woman standing beside the bed. &quot;Quick! quick!
he is bleeding so.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand was laid upon the bed, and as the men drew their
arms from beneath him, he moved his head, and his lips
parted. A moment later he opened his eyes. Colonel Dick
heaved a sigh of relief. &quot;He'll do now! Gilmer shall come
and bleed him, and he'll be out again before you can say
Jack Robinson! I'll have that place in the road mended
to-morrow. Yes, yes, Mr. Rand, you've had an accident.
Lie still! you're with friends. Hey, what did you
say?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand had said nothing articulate. His eyes were upon
Jacqueline, standing at the foot of the bed. The room was
in the western wing of the house, and where she stood she was
bathed in the light of the sinking sun. It made her brown
hair golden and like a nimbus. Rand made a straying motion
with his hand. &quot;I did not believe in heaven,&quot; he muttered.
&quot;If I have erred&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lie still, lie still!&quot; said Jacqueline. In a moment she
turned, left the room, and went downstairs. &quot;He is better,&quot;
she told her cousin Unity, who with Fairfax Cary was waiting
in the lower hall; then went on to the library, opened the
door, and closed it softly behind her.</p>

<p>The room was dim, and she thought it vacant. There was
an old leather chair which she loved, which had always stood
beside the glass doors that gave upon the sunset, in whose
worn depths she had, as a child, told herself fairy tales, and
found escape from childish woes. She went straight to it
now, sank into its old arms, and pressed her cheek against
the cool leather. She closed her eyes, and sat very still, and
tried to ease the throbbing of her heart. Some one coughed,
and she looked up to find her Uncle Edward regarding her
from his own favourite chair.</p>

<p>&quot;I did not know you were there,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I
thought the room was empty. What are you reading?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Treatise on Hospitality,&quot; answered Major Churchill,
with great dryness. &quot;I suppose Dick is making posset in his
best racing cup? How is the interesting patient?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline coloured. &quot;Uncle Dick&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Dick,&quot; interrupted the Major, &quot;is the best of fellows,
but he is not perspicacious. I am, and I say again, why
the deuce did this damned Republican get himself thrown at
our very gates? In my day a horse might act a little gaily,
but a man kept his seat!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline coloured more deeply. &quot;It was that bad place
on the hill road. I do not suppose that Mr. Rand is a poor
horseman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who said that he was?&quot; demanded the Major testily.
&quot;A poor horseman! He and his old wolf of a father used
to break all the colts for twenty miles round! That place
in the road! Pshaw! I've ridden by that place in the road
for forty years, but I never had the indecency to be brought
on a litter into a gentleman's house who was not of my way
of thinking! And every man and woman on the place&mdash;barring
poor Nancy&mdash;out to receive him! I am not at home
among fools, so I came here&mdash;though the Lord knows there's
many a fool to be found in a library!&mdash;Well, are any bones
broken?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dr. Gilmer will tell us&mdash;oh, he looked like death!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&mdash;William Gilmer?&quot; demanded Uncle Edward
with asperity. &quot;Your pronoun 'he' stands for your antecedent
'Gilmer.' But what's the English tongue when we
have a Jacobin in the house! Women like strange animals,
and they are vastly fond of pitying. But you were always
a home body, Jacqueline, and left Unity to run after the sea
lions and learned pigs! And now you sit there as white as
your gown!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline smiled. &quot;Perhaps I am of those who pity. I
hear a horse upon the road! It may be Dr. Gilmer!&quot; and
up she started.</p>

<p>&quot;The horse has gone by,&quot; said Uncle Edward. &quot;Gilmer
cannot possibly be here for an hour. Sit down, child, and
don't waste your pity. The Rands are used to hard knocks.
I've seen old Gideon in the ring, black and blue and blind
with blood, demanding proof that he was beaten. The gentleman
upstairs will take care of himself. Bah!&mdash;Where
is Ludwell Cary this afternoon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He rode, I think, to Charlottesville.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think! Don't you know?&mdash;What woman was ever
straightforward!&quot;</p>

<p>Major Churchill opened his book, looked at it, and tossed
it aside; took The Virginia Federalist from the table, and
for perhaps sixty seconds appeared absorbed in its contents,
then with a loud &quot;Pshaw!&quot; threw it down, and rising walked
to a bookcase. &quot;I am reading Swift,&quot; he said, and brought
a calf-bound volume to the window. &quot;There was a man
who knew hatred and the <i>risus sardonicus</i>! Listen to this,
Jacqueline.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Churchill read well, and it was his habit to read
aloud to Jacqueline, whose habit it was to listen. Now she
sat before the window, in the old leather chair, her slender
face and form in profile, and her eyes upon the sunset sky.
It was her accustomed attitude, and Uncle Edward read on
with growing satisfaction, finding that he was upon a passage
which gave Democracy its due. He turned a page, then
another, glanced from the book, and discovered that his
niece was not attending. &quot;Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline withdrew her eyes from the fading gold, and,
turning in her chair, faced her uncle with a faint smile. She
loved him dearly, and he loved her, and they had not many
secrets from each other. Now she looked at him with a
wavering light upon her face, shook her head as if in answer
to some dim question of her own, and broke into silent weeping.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless my soul!&quot; cried Uncle Edward, and started up
in alarm. He had a contemptuous horror of women's tears;
but Jacqueline was different, Jacqueline was not like other
women. He could not remember having seen Jacqueline
cry since she was a child, and the sight troubled him immensely.
She wept as though she were used to weeping.
He crossed to the chair by the window and touched her
bowed head with his wrinkled hand. &quot;What is it, child?&quot;
he asked. &quot;Tell Uncle Edward.&quot;</p>

<p>But Jacqueline, it appeared, had nothing to tell. After
a little she wiped her eyes, and brokenly laughed at herself;
and then, a sound coming through the window, she started
to her feet. &quot;That is Dr. Gilmer! I hear his horse at the
gate. Joab must have met him upon the road!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joab?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Rand's servant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You appear,&quot; said the Major, &quot;to know a deal more
than I do about Mr. Rand. Where did you learn so much?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline, halfway to the door, turned upon him her candid
eyes. &quot;Don't you remember?&quot; she answered, &quot;the month
that I spent, summer before last, at Cousin Jane Selden's,
on the Three-Notched Road? I saw Mr. Rand very often
that summer. Cousin Jane liked him, and he was welcome
at her house. And when I used to stay there as a child I saw
him then, and&mdash;and was sorry for him. Don't you remember?
I told you at the time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't remember,&quot; replied Uncle Edward grimly.
&quot;I have other things to think of than the Rands. There
should have been no association&mdash;though I am surprised
at nothing which goes on beneath Jane Selden's roof. Jane
Selden has a most erratic mind.&mdash;Don't sympathize too
much, Jacqueline, with that damned young Republican
upstairs! He's an enemy.&quot; The Major walked to the window.
&quot;It is Gilmer, sure enough, and&mdash;ah, it is Ludwell
Cary with him, riding Prince Rupert. Come look, Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>Receiving no answer, he turned to find that his niece had
vanished and he was alone in the library. Presently he
heard from the hail, through the half-open door, the doctor's
voice and Ludwell Cary's expressions of concern, Jacqueline's
low replies, a confusion of other voices, and finally,
from the head of the stairs, Colonel Dick's hearty &quot;Come up,
Gilmer, come up! D'ye remember that damned place in
the hill road where my mare Nelly threw me, coming home
at dawn from Maria Erskine's wedding?&quot;</p>

<p>Steps and voices died away. The evening shadows lengthened,
and filled the library where Uncle Edward sat, propping
his lean old chin upon his lean old hand, and staring at a
dim old clock in the corner, as if it could tell him more than
the time of day. He heard Mr. Pincornet's fiddle from the
long parlour in the other wing. Since the doctor was come,
the younger part of the gathering at Fontenoy had cheerfully
returned to its business. The dancing class was not
long neglected. Uncle Edward disliked France, disliked
even monarchical and &eacute;migr&eacute; France. And he disliked all
music but Jacqueline's singing, and disliked the fiddle because
Thomas Jefferson played it. He half rose to shut the
door and so keep out Mr. Pincornet's Minuet from Ariadne,
but reflected that the door would also keep out the doctor's
descending voice and final dicta delivered at the stair-foot.
Uncle Edward was as curious as a woman, and the door remained
ajar. He tried to read, but the words conveyed no
meaning to his mind, which became more and more frowningly
intent upon the fact of Jacqueline's weeping. What
had the child to weep for? He determined to send to
Richmond to-morrow for a certain watch which he had in
his mind,&mdash;plain gold with J.C. upon it in pearls. He reflected
with satisfaction that Cary as well as Churchill began
with a C.</p>

<p>The glass door led by a flight of steps down to the flower
garden. Deb came up the steps and into the library. &quot;Kiss
me good-night, Uncle Edward. It's mos' seven o'clock.
I've had my supper at the Quarter with Aunt Daphne. The
scarlet beans over her door are in bloom, and Uncle Mingo
told me about the rabbit and the fox. Miranda is going to put
me to bed because Mammy Chloe is busy in the blue room
with the doctor and the man whose horse threw him.&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Edward put his one arm around the child and drew
her close to his chair. Deb touched with her brown fingers
the sleeve that was pinned across his coat. &quot;Does your arm
that is buried at Yorktown hurt you to-day, Uncle Edward?
Tell me a story about General Washington.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; you tell me a story.&quot;</p>

<p>Deb considered. &quot;I'll tell you a story about the man upstairs
in the blue room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you know about the man in the blue room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline told me. She knows,&quot; answered Deb. &quot;I am
going to begin now, Uncle Edward.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am listening,&quot; said the Major.</p>

<p>&quot;Once upon a time there lived on the Three-Notched Road
a boy, a poor boy. He lived in a log house that was not so
good as an overseer's house, and there were pine trees all
around it, and wild flowers, but no other kinds of flowers.
And in the trees there were owls, and in the bushes there
were whip-poor-wills, and sometimes a mockingbird, but
no other kinds of birds, and at night the fireflies were all
about. And outside the pine trees, all around the house,
the tobacco grew and grew. It grew so broad and high that
the children might have played I-spy in it,&mdash;only there
weren't any children. There was only the boy, and he hated
tobacco. He was poor, and his father was a hard man. He
had no time to play or to learn&mdash;he worked all day in the
fields like a hand. He had to work like the men at the lower
Quarter, like Domingo and Cato and Indian Jim. He worked
all the time. I never saw the sun get up, but he saw it every
day. In the long afternoons when it was hot, and we make
the rooms cool and dark, and rest with a book, he was working,
working like a friendless slave. And at night, when the
moon rises, and we sit and watch it, and wonder, and remember
all the battles that were ever won and lost, and all
the songs that ever were sung, he could only stumble to his
own poor corner, and sleep, and sleep, with a hot and heavy
heart, and the blisters on his poor, poor hands!&quot;</p>

<p>Major Churchill sank back in his chair and stared at his
niece. &quot;Good God, child! whose words are you using?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline's,&quot; answered Deb, staring in her turn. &quot;Jacqueline
told it to me just that way, one hot night when I
could not sleep, and there was heat lightning, and she took
me in her lap and we sat by the window. Are you tired,
Uncle Edward? Does your arm hurt? Suppose I finish the
story to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm not tired,&quot; said Uncle Edward. &quot;Finish it now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The boy,&quot; went on Deb, using now her own and now Jacqueline's
remembered words,&mdash;&quot;the boy did not want to
work all his life long in the tobacco-fields, working from
morning to night, with his hands, at the thing he hated. He
wanted books, he wanted to learn, and to work with his mind
in the world beyond the Three-Notched Road. The older he
grew the more he wanted it. And Jacqueline said that the
mind finds a way, and that the boy got books together, and
he studied hard. You see, Jacqueline knows, for when she
was a little girl, she used to stay sometimes with Cousin Jane
Selden on the Three-Notched Road. And Cousin Jane Selden's
farm was next to where the boy lived. There was just a
little stream between them. There were no children at Cousin
Jane Selden's, and Jacqueline was lonely. And she used
to sit under the apple tree on the bank of the little stream
and send chip boats down it, just as Miranda and I do.
Only she didn't have Miranda, and she was all by herself.
And she could see the boy working on the other side of
the stream, and there wasn't any shade in the tobacco-field,
and Jacqueline was so sorry for him. And one day he came
down to the stream for water and they talked to each other.
And Jacqueline told Cousin Jane Selden, and Cousin Jane
Selden did not mind. She said she was sorry for the boy,
and that she had given his father a piece of her mind,&mdash;only
he wouldn't take it. So Jacqueline used to see the boy
often and often, for she always played under the apple tree by
the stream, and he had a little time to rest every day at noon,
and he would come down to the shade on his side of the
stream, and Jacqueline told him all about Fontenoy. And
he told Jacqueline what he was going to do when he was a
man, and he asked her if she had ever read C&aelig;sar, and she
had not, and he told her all about it. And Jacqueline told
him fairy tales, but he said they were not true, and that a
harp could not sing by itself, nor a hen lay golden eggs, nor
a beanstalk grow a mile. He said he did not like lies,&mdash;which
wasn't very polite. He was older, you see, than Jacqueline,
ever so much older. But she knew how to dance,
and she was taking music lessons, and so she seemed older,
and he liked Jacqueline very much. What is the matter,
Uncle Edward?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. Go on, child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then the summer was over, and Jacqueline came back
to Fontenoy. But the next summer, when she went to Cousin
Jane Selden's, there was the boy working in the tobacco on
the other side of the stream. And Jacqueline called to him
from under the apple tree. And then the month that she
was to stay with Cousin Jane Selden went by, and she came
back to Fontenoy. And the next summer she didn't go to the
Three-Notched Road, but one day the boy came to Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the Major.</p>

<p>&quot;The boy's father sent him to pay some money that he
owed to Uncle Dick. Jacqueline says his father was an
honest man, though he was so unkind. And Uncle Dick
sent for Jacqueline and said, 'Jacqueline, this is young Lewis
Rand. Take him and show him the garden while I write
this receipt!' So Jacqueline and the boy went into the flower
garden, and she showed him the roses and the peacock and
the sundial. And then he went away, and she didn't see
him any more for years and years, not till she was grown,
and everything was changed. And&mdash;and that is the end of
the story. But the boy's name was Lewis Rand, and the
man's name, up in the blue room, is Mr. Lewis Rand, and
I heard Mr. Fairfax Cary say that Lewis Rand was the Devil,&mdash;but
Jacqueline wouldn't have liked the Devil, would she,
Uncle Edward?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, child, no, no!&quot; exclaimed Uncle Edward, with violence.
He rose so suddenly from his chair, and he looked so
grim and grey, that Deb was almost frightened.</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you like the story, Uncle Edward? I did like it
so much when Jacqueline told it to me&mdash;only she would
never tell it to me again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I liked it, honey. Don't I like all your stories?
But I don't like Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will he stay always upstairs in the blue room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Lord forbid!&quot; cried Major Churchill.</p>

<p>The door opened wide, and Mr. Ned Hunter put in an
important face. &quot;Are you there, Major? Here's the devil
to pay. Rand's arm is broken and his ankle wrenched and
his head cut open! The doctor says he mustn't be moved
for at least a fortnight. I thought you'd like to know.&quot;
He was gone to spread the news.</p>

<p>Major Churchill stood still for a moment, then turned to
the table, placed with deliberation a marker between the
leaves of Swift, took up the volume, and restored it to its
proper shelf.</p>

<p>&quot;It is getting dark&mdash;I must go to bed,&quot; said Deb. &quot;Uncle
Edward, who pays the devil?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His hosts, child,&quot; answered Uncle Edward, looking very
grim and very old.</p>

<h3>THE BLUE ROOM</h3>


<p>The news of the accident to Lewis Rand spread far
and wide. Both as a lawyer and as Mr. Jefferson's
adjutant he had become in two years' time a marked
man. Federalist and Republican were agreed that the recent
election was but a foot in the stirrup. Another two years
might see him&mdash;almost anywhere. He was likely to ride
far and to ride fast. To the Federalists his progress from the
tobacco-fields to the Elysian Heights of office was but another
burning sign of the degeneracy of the times and the
tendencies of Jefferson. On the other hand, the Republicans
quoted the Rights of Man and the Declaration of Independence,
and made the name of Lewis Rand as symbolic as a
liberty pole. He was <i>bon enfant, bon R&eacute;publicain</i>. Virginia,
like Cornelia, numbered him among her starry gems. He
was of the Gracchi. He was almost anything Roman, Revolutionary,
and Patriotic that the mind of a perfervid poet
could conjure up and fix in a corner of the Argus or the
Examiner. Every newspaper in the state mentioned the
accident, and in a letter from a Gentleman of Virginia, an
account of it was read by the subscribers to the Aurora.</p>

<p>All this was somewhat later, when the stage-coach and
the mail-rider had distributed the slow-travelling news. In
the mean time Lewis Rand lay in the curtained bed in the
blue room at Fontenoy, and wondered at that subtle force
called Chance. The blue roses upon the hangings, the blue
willows and impossible bridges of the china, the apple-cheeked
moon surmounting the face of the loud-ticking clock
were not more fantastically unnatural than that he, Lewis
Rand, should be lying there between the linen sheets, in the
sunny morning stillness of the fourth day after his fall, listening
for the stir of the awakening house, for one step upon
the stair, and for one voice. He was where he had desired
to be; he was at Fontenoy; but the strangeness of his being
there weighed upon him. He would hear the step and the
voice; chance had brought him past every ward of a hostile
house, and had laid him there in the blue room to be generously
pitied and lavishly cared for; chance had given him
leverage. To each the chaos of his own nature; if, with Rand,
the Spirit brooded none too closely over the face of the deep,
yet was there light enough to tread by. As he lay in the blue
room, watching the early sunlight steal through the window
and lay a golden finger on his bed, he had no sense of triumph,
no smugness of satisfaction over the attainment of his
dream. He thought of how often as a boy, working under the
glare of the sun, in the shadeless tobacco-fields, he had
dreamed of the poplars of Fontenoy, the cool porches, the
cool rooms, the rest from labour, and the books, of all that
the little girl named Jacqueline had told him, sitting under
the apple tree beside the stream that flowed between a large
and a small farm on the Three-Notched Road. As a boy,
he would have been puzzled to choose between &quot;Will you
go to Heaven?&quot; and &quot;Will you go to Fontenoy?&quot; The one
seemed as remote, as unattainable, and as happy as the other.
The advantage was possibly with Fontenoy, for he could
picture that to himself. He could not have described the
mansions in the skies, but, thanks to Jacqueline, he knew
every room at Fontenoy. Before he was laid in it, he had
known the blue room, the roses on the curtains, and the
peacock-feathered mandarin forever climbing a dull yellow
screen. The library should be below, with the bookshelves,
and the glass door opening on the snowball bushes. Outside
his window was the flower garden. He had seen the garden
with his bodily eyes, for there was the morning he had spent
at Fontenoy. In the desert of his hardly-treated, eager,
and longing youth the place and the life of which the girl
who came to Mrs. Selden's had told him was become the
vision of an oasis and a paradise. The magic word was
Fontenoy. If Gideon Rand or Adam Gaudylock chanced to
pronounce it, it was as though the Captain of the Thieves
had said, &quot;Open Sesame!&quot; The cave door opened, and he
saw strange riches.</p>

<p>That day at Fontenoy! He tried to recall it, but it did not
stand out in his memory; it was curiously without edge.
Trying to remember was like remembering a dream, delicious
and evasive. The child named Jacqueline had changed to
a girl named Jacqueline. She had spoken to him shyly, and
he had answered with much greater shyness, with a reddening
cheek and a stumbling tongue. He remembered her dress,
a soft blue stuff that he was afraid of touching, and he remembered
how burning was his consciousness of his coarse
shoes, his shirt of osnaburg, the disreputable hat upon his
sunburnt hair. Then they had walked in the garden, and
sat on the steps of a summer house, and he had been very
happy after all. And then a black boy had come to tell him
that the Colonel was ready with the receipt he was to carry
back to the Three-Notched Road. He said good-bye with
great awkwardness, and went away, and he saw the girl no
more for a long, long time, for so long a time that insensibly
her image faded. It was in the October of that year that he
went to Richmond with Gideon, and met Mr. Jefferson in
the bookshop by the bridge.</p>

<p>The years that followed that meeting! Rand, lying still
upon his pillows, with his eyes upon the yellow mandarin,
passed them in review,&mdash;well, they had not been wasted!
Usually he saw the approximate truth about himself, and he
knew that these years of toil and achievement were honourable
to him. He thought of all those years, and then he turned
his head upon the pillow and faced through widely opened
windows the misty, fragrant morning. His mind turned with
suddenness to a morning two summers past. His father, who
had lived to take grim pride in the son he had been used to
thwart, was six months dead, and he himself was living
alone, as he yet lived alone, in the small house upon the
Three-Notched Road. He lived there with his ambitions,
which were many. That morning he had gone, without knowing
why, down through the tobacco-field to the stream which
parted his patrimony from his neighbour's grassy orchard.
And there, beneath the apple tree, across the clear, brown
water stood Jacqueline. He forgot her no more. &quot;Fontenoy&quot;
was again the magic word, the &quot;Open Sesame,&quot; but
Jacqueline was the wealth of all the world. He was young,
and he was a man of strong passions who had lived, perforce,
a rigid, lonely, and ascetic life. He had dreamed of most
things, and he had dreamed of love. It was the hectic vision
of a hued pool. Love, entered, proved to be the sea, boundless
and strong, salt, clean, and the nurse of life. He loved
Jacqueline to the end of his life; he never swerved from
allegiance to the sea.</p>

<p>For a summer month he saw her almost every day,&mdash;twice
or thrice beneath the apple tree beside the stream, and at
other times in Mrs. Jane Selden's parlour, porch, or little
friendly garden. He did not tell Jacqueline that he loved
her; he had not dared so much. The fact that he was the son
of Gideon Rand while she was a Churchill mattered little
to his common sense and his Republicanism. His blood was
clean. He had never heard of a Rand in prison or a beggar.
Moreover, he meant to make his name an honoured one.
But he was a poor man, though he meant also to become
a rich man, and he was a Republican, with no thought of
changing his party. Politics might not matter, perhaps, to
Miss Churchill, but they mattered decidedly to her uncles
and guardians, whom she loved and obeyed. Wealth and
birth mattered too, to them. Lewis Rand set no great store
upon obedience for obedience' sake, but he divined that
Miss Churchill rarely vexed those she loved. He had an
iron will, and he set his lips, and resolved that this was not
the time to speak of that ocean on whose shore he stood.
He meant that the time should come. The probability of a
rejection he looked full in the face, and found that he did
not believe in it, though when he looked as fully at his assurance,
that, too, became incredibly without foundation. Jacqueline's
spirit might dwell in the mountains, and never
dream of the sea; she gave him no sign, and he could not
tell. The summer month went by; she returned to Fontenoy,
and he saw her no more for a long time. When she was
gone, he fell upon work like a bereaved lion upon his prey.
As best he might, he would make that hunting do. He
worked at first with lonely fury, though at last with zest.
Only by this road, he knew, could he enter the gates of
Fontenoy. Success begets success; let him make himself a
name, and the gates might open! When he was not in court,
or not most diligently preparing a case, or not instructing
Tom Mocket, who was on the way to become his partner, or
not busied with affairs of his patron, or not keenly observant
of the methods of the poor whites whom he hired to tend
his tobacco, he read. He read history: Clarendon, Gibbon,
and Hume; Aristotle, Bacon, Machiavelli, Shakespeare,
and Voltaire, Rousseau, and Tom Paine. His Ossian, C&aelig;sar,
and Plutarch belonged to his younger days. A translation
of the Divina Commedia fell into his hands, and once he
chanced to take up, and then read with the closest attention,
Godwin's Caleb Williams. From Monticello he received
the hot and clamorous journals of the day, Federalist and
Republican. He studied the conditions they portrayed with
the intentness of a gladiator surveying his arena. The Examiner,
the Argus, the Aurora, the Gazette gave, besides
the home conflict, the foreign news. He missed no step of
Buonaparte's.</p>

<p>Thrice in these two years he had seen Jacqueline. Once
he rode to church at Saint Anne's that he might see her.
She had been at the great race when Major Churchill's
Mustapha won over Nonpareil and Buckeye. The third
time was a month ago in Charlottesville. She was walking,
and Ludwell Cary was with her. When she bowed to Rand,
Cary had looked surprised, but his hat was instantly off.
Rand bowed in return, and passed them, going on to the
Court House. He had not seen her again until four days ago,
when he opened his eyes upon her face. The golden finger
on his bed became a shining lance that struck across to the
wall. There were ivy and a climbing rose about the window
through which he looked to the shimmering poplars and
the distant hills. Many birds were singing, and from the
direction of the quarters sounded the faint blowing of a horn.
A bee came droning in to the pansies in a bowl. Rand's dark
eyes made a journey through the room, from the flowered
curtains to the mandarin on the screen, from the screen to
the willowed china and the easy chair, from the chair to the
picture of General Washington on the wall, the vases on the
mantel-shelf, and the green hemlock branches masking for
the summer the fireplace below. Over all the blue room
and the landscape without was a sense of home, of order and
familiar sweetness. It struck to the soul of a too lonely and
too self-reliant man. Suddenly, without warning, tears were
in his eyes. Raising his uninjured arm, he brushed them
away, settled his bandaged head upon the pillows, and stared
at the clock. The half-shut door of a small adjoining room
opened very slowly and softly, and Joab entered on tiptoe,
elaborate caution surrounding him like an atmosphere.</p>

<p>&quot;You, Joab,&quot; said Rand. &quot;It's time you were in the field.&quot;</p>

<p>Joab's preternaturally lengthened countenance became
short, broad, and genial. He threw back his head and breathed
relief. &quot;Dar now! What I tell em? Cyarn Selim nor no
urr boss kill you, Marse Lewis! Mornin', sah. I reckon hit
is time I wuz in de field, but I reckon I got to stay heah to
tek care of you. How yo ahm, Marse Lewis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not so bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You sho wuz ressless in yo sleep&mdash;a-talkin' an' a-turnin'
an' sayin' you mustn't keep de cote waitin'. I done sit by
you ter keep de kivers on twill de cock crow. What you
reckon you said to me? You said, 'Is dat you, Gineral Buonaparte?'&quot;</p>

<p>Rand laughed, &quot;Did you say, 'Yes, sire my brother?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sah, I say, 'Hit's Joab, Marse Lewis.' I gwine now
ter git de water to shave you ef dar's fire in de kitchen. Folks
git up moughty late at Fontenoy. I don' know when I gwine
git yo breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p>An hour later appeared the master of the house, red and
jovial, solicitous for his guest's comfort, and prodigal of
suggestions for his ease and entertainment. Not until Rand was
well and gone from Fontenoy would Colonel Dick let his
mind rest upon the indubitable fact that here had been an
upstart and an enemy. Hard upon the Colonel's steps came
the doctor. Arm and ankle and wounded head were doing
well&mdash;there was no fever to speak of&mdash;Mr. Rand had an
unabused constitution and would make a rapid recovery.
For precaution's sake, best let a little blood. Rest, gruel, and
quiet, and in a few days Mr. Rand would be downstairs
with the ladies. The blood was let, and the doctor rode
away. Joab and the culprit Selim went on Rand's errands
to the town and to the home on the Three-Notched Road.
Mammy Chloe, in white apron and kerchief and coloured
turban, presented herself with a curtsy, delivered kindly
messages from the ladies of the house, and sat down with
her sewing in the little adjoining room. The morning advanced,
sunny and peaceful, with vague sounds, faint
laughter from distant rooms, droning of bees, and rustling
of cool poplar leaves.</p>

<p>Rand, lying high upon his pillows, stopped his work of
writing with his left hand to listen to a step coming up the
polished stairway and along the passage leading to his room.
His ear was almost as quick and accurate as was Adam
Gaudylock's, and he rightly thought he knew the step. A
somewhat strange smile was on his lips when Ludwell Cary
knocked lightly at the blue room door. &quot;Come in!&quot; called
Rand, and Cary, entering, closed the door behind him and
came up to the bed with an outstretched hand and a pleasant
light upon his handsome face.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Mr. Rand,&quot; he said, smiling, &quot;I see my revenge.
I shall sit each day by your bedside, and read you the Federalist!
How is the arm? Your right! That's bad!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will heal,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;Will you not take a
chair?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary pushed the easy chair nearer the bed, and sat down.
&quot;The ladies charge me,&quot; he said pleasantly, &quot;with more
messages of sympathy and hopes for your recovery than I
can remember. Miss Dandridge vows that you have supplanted
in her affections the hero of her favourite romance.
'Twas she and my brother, you know, who found you upon
the road. Colonel Churchill and the county must mend
that turn where you came to grief. It is a dangerous
place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was not attentive,&quot; said Rand, &quot;and my horse is a
masterful brute. Pray assure Miss Dandridge and your
brother of my gratitude. I am under deep obligation to all
at Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a kindly place,&quot; said Cary simply. He looked about
him. &quot;The blue room! When I was a boy and came a-visiting,
they always put me here. That screen would set me
dreaming&mdash;and the blue roses and the moon clock. I
used to lie in that bed and send myself to sleep with more
tales than are in the Arabian Nights. There's a rift in
the poplars through which you can see a very bright star&mdash;Sirius,
I believe. May you have pleasant dreams, Mr. Rand,
in my old bed!&quot; He glanced from Rand's flushed face to
the papers strewn upon the counterpane. &quot;You have been
writing? Would Dr. Gilmer approve?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand looked somewhat ruefully at the scrawled sheets
and the ink upon his fingers. &quot;It is a necessary paper of
instructions,&quot; he said. &quot;I was retained by the State for the
North Garden murder case. It is to be tried next week&mdash;and
here am I, laid by the heels! My associate must handle
it.&quot; He made a movement of impatience. &quot;He's skilful
enough, but he's not the sort to convince a jury&mdash;especially
in Albemarle, where they don't like to hang people. If
he's left to himself, Fitch may go free.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The murderer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, the murderer. These,&quot; he laid his hand upon the
papers, &quot;are the points that must be made. If Mocket follows
instructions, the State will win. But I wish that Selim
had not chosen to break my right arm&mdash;it is difficult to
write with the left hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Could not Mr. Mocket take his instructions directly from
you?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand moved again impatiently, and with a quick sigh.
&quot;I sent him word not to come. I will not bring a friend or
ally where I myself must seem an intruder and a most
unwelcome guest. There's a fine irony in human affairs!
Selim might have thrown me before Edgehill or Dunlora&mdash;but
to choose Fontenoy!&quot; He looked at Cary with a certain
appeal. &quot;I shall, of course, remove myself as soon as possible.
In the meantime, if you could assure me that Colonel
Churchill and his family understand&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Set your mind at rest,&quot; said Cary at once. &quot;Colonel
Churchill is the soul of kindness and hospitality, and the ladies
of Fontenoy are all angels. You must not think yourself an
unwelcome guest.&quot; He glanced again at the papers. &quot;I am
sure you should not try to write. Will you not accept me
as amanuensis? The matter is not private?&quot;</p>

<p>Not at all: but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let me write from your dictation. I have nothing
at all to do for the next two hours,&mdash;I am staying in the
house, you know,&mdash;and it will give me genuine pleasure
to help you. You have no business with such labour. Dr.
Gilmer, I know, must have forbidden it. Come! I write a
very fair clerkly hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't know the imposition,&quot; said Rand, with an
answering smile. &quot;It is nothing less than a Treatise on
Murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be glad,&quot; replied Cary, &quot;to hear what you have
to say on the subject. Come! here are blank sheets and a
new quill and an attentive secretary!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand smiled. &quot;It's the strangest post for you!&mdash;but all
life's a dream just now. I confess that writing is uphill
work! Well&mdash;since you are so good.&quot;</p>

<p>He began to dictate. At first his words came slowly, with
some stiffness and self-consciousness. This passed; he forgot
himself, thought only of his subject, and utterance became
quiet, grave, and fluent. He did not speak as though
he were addressing a jury. Gesture was impossible, and his
voice must not carry beyond the blue room. He spoke as
to himself, as giving reasons to a high intelligence for the
invalidity of murder. For an infusion of sentiment and
rhetoric he knew he might trust Mocket's unaided powers,
but the basis of the matter he would furnish. He spoke of
murder as the check the savage gives to social order, as the
costliest error, the last injustice, the monstrousness beyond
the brute, the debt without surety, the destruction by a fool
of that which he knows not how to create. He spoke for
society, without animus and without sentiment; in a level
voice marshalling fact and example, and moving unfalteringly
toward the doom of the transgressor. Turning to the
case in hand, he wove strand by strand a rope for the guilty
wretch in question; then laid it for the nonce aside and spoke
of murder more deeply with a sombre force and a red glow of
imagery. Then followed three minutes of slow words which
laid the finished and tested rope in the sheriff's hand. Rand's
voice ceased, and he lay staring at the poplar leaves without
the window.</p>

<p>Cary laid the pen softly down, sat still and upright in his
chair for a minute, then leaned back with a long breath.
&quot;The poor wretch!&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor enough,&quot; assented Rand abruptly. &quot;But Nature
does not, and Society must not, think of that. As he brewed,
so let him drink, and the measure that he meted, let it be
meted to him again. There is on earth no place for him.&quot;
He fell silent again, his eyes upon the dancing leaves.</p>

<p>&quot;You will make your mark,&quot; said Cary slowly. &quot;This
is more than able work. You have before you a great
future.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand looked at him half eagerly, half wistfully. &quot;Do
you really think that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot think otherwise,&quot; Cary answered. &quot;I saw it
plainly in the courtroom the other day.&quot; He smiled. &quot;I deplore
your political principles, Mr. Rand, but I rejoice that
my conqueror is no lesser man. I must to work against the
next time we encounter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have been long out of the county,&quot; said Rand. &quot;I
had the start of you, that is all. You were trained to the law.
Will you practise it, or will Greenwood take all your time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall practise. A man's life is larger than a few acres,
a house, and slaves. But first I must put Greenwood in order,
and I must&mdash;&quot; He did not finish the sentence, but sat looking
about the blue room. &quot;The old moon clock! I used to
listen to it in the night and dream of twenty thousand things,
and never once of what I dream of now! What a strange
young savage is a boy!&quot; He gathered the written sheets
together. &quot;You will want to look these over? I shall be
very glad to see that they reach Mr. Mocket safely, or to
serve you in any way. Just now I am very idle, and I will be
your secretary every day with pleasure.&quot; He rose. &quot;And
now you must rest, or we will have a rating from Dr.
Gilmer. Is there any message I may take for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My devotion and my thanks to the ladies of the house,&quot;
replied Rand&mdash;&quot;to Mrs. Churchill and Miss Dandridge and
to Miss Churchill. For these&quot;&mdash;he put his hand upon the
papers&mdash;&quot;I shall look them over, and Joab will take them to
Charlottesville to Mocket. I cannot sufficiently thank you
for your aid and for your kindness.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary went, and Rand lay back upon his pillows, weary
enough, though with a smile upon his lips. He valued Cary's
visit, valued the opinion of his fellow lawyer and fellow
thinker. He valued praise from almost any source, though
this was a hidden thirst. Where he loved, there he valued
good opinion most; but also he strongly desired that his
enemies should think highly of him. To be justly feared
was one thing, to be contemned quite another. Apparently
Ludwell Cary neither feared nor contemned. As, a few days
before on the Justice's Bench, Rand had wondered if he
were going to hate Cary, so now, lying in the quiet blue room,
weakened by pain and loss of blood, softened by exquisite
kindness, and touched by approbation, he wondered if he
were going to like Cary. Something of the old charm, the
old appeal, the old recognition, with no mean envy, of a
golden nature moving in harmonious circumstance, stirred
in Lewis Rand's breast. He sighed and lay still, his eyes
upon the pansies on the table beside his bed. The moon
clock ticked; the sunshine entered softly through the veil of
poplar leaves; upon the bough that brushed the window,
a cicada shrilled of the approaching summer. Rand put out
his uninjured arm and took a pansy from the bowl. The little
face, brave and friendly, looked at him from the white counterpane
where he laid it. He studied it for a while, touching
it gently, with the thought in his mind that Jacqueline might
have gathered the pansies, and then he left it there, took up
his papers, and turned to the argument which must hang
Fitch.</p>

<h3>CARY AND JACQUELINE</h3>


<p>At supper table that evening at Fontenoy, Ludwell
Cary said something complimentary to the prisoner
in the blue room. Fairfax Cary fired up. &quot;You are
too easy, Ludwell! Lewis Rand, I warn you, is a dangerous
man! Serve him once, and you serve him once too often!&mdash;begging
your pardon, Colonel Churchill!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We could hardly have left him, you know,&quot; reasoned his
host good-naturedly, &quot;on the roadside, and Dick Wood's
the nearest house! And once within a man's doors, every
attention, of course, must be shown. But, as you say, he is
a dangerous fellow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dangerous fiddlesticks!&quot; growled Major Churchill from
the other side of the table, where he sat at Jacqueline's right
hand. &quot;I would have as soon called old Gideon Rand dangerous!
Like father, like son. You may be sure that this
fellow's spirit rolls tobacco. Maybe now and then it breaks
a colt.</p>

<p>&quot;Dangerous' implies power to be dangerous,&quot; said Cary,
&quot;and conversely power to be humane. A turn, and all the
strength of the man may flow toward good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A fool and his doctrine!&quot; snapped Major Edward. &quot;I
do not expect grapes from thistles, or a silk purse from a
sow's ear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tut, tut, Ned! The man who carries this county may
be a damned Republican, but he is not a fool,&quot; pronounced
Colonel Dick. &quot;Jacqueline, my dear, another cup of
coffee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we were all as good as gold,&quot; said Unity pensively,
&quot;and as wise as&mdash;as Socrates, and wore black cockades, and
cared only for the Washington March, and hated Buonaparte,
and the Devil, how tiresome life would be!&mdash;Myself,
I like variety and the Marseillaise!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you differ from the other rogues only in liking the
Rogue's March,&quot; said Uncle Edward. &quot;Jacqueline, more
sugar!&quot;</p>

<p>The younger Cary rushed to Miss Dandridge's defence.
&quot;Well, sir, in itself the Marseillaise is a very noble air. It
is better than Jefferson's March!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, a very good air to go to the gallows by!&quot; snapped
Uncle Edward. &quot;Jacqueline, some cream!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; said his brother amicably, from the head of
the table, &quot;we must care for a man when he's wounded
at our door, friend or foe, Federalist or damned Republican.
Noblesse oblige. I was glad enough the night my mare Nelly
threw me, coming home from Maria Erskine's wedding,
to hear Bob Carter's voice behind me! And if Gideon Rand
was a surly old heathen, he broke colts well, and he rolled
tobacco well. We'll treat his son like a Christian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he'll repay you like a Turk!&quot; broke out Major
Edward. &quot;I tell you it is bred in the bone&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Rand is our guest,&quot; said Jacqueline, in a clear voice,
from her place behind the coffee urn. Her hands made a
little noise amid the rosebud china. &quot;Mr. Cary, may I not
pour you another cup?&mdash;Caleb, Mr. Cary's cup.&mdash;Bring
more waffles, Scipio.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The work at Greenwood is nearly finished, sir,&quot; remarked
Ludwell Cary, addressing his host. &quot;I rode over this afternoon,
and the men assure me that the house will soon be
habitable. Fair and I have no excuse for staying longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then stay without excuse,&quot; answered Colonel Dick
heartily. &quot;Fontenoy will miss you&mdash;eh, Unity, eh, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will indeed,&quot; said Jacqueline, with a smile; and Unity,
&quot;Will I have time to order a black scarf from Baltimore?
Will you leave us mourning rings?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If Miss Dandridge would accept another fashion of
ring!&quot; cried Fairfax Cary, and all at table laughed.
Scipio took away the rosebud china, and laid the purple
dessert service for the strawberries and floating island and
Betty Custis cake. Caleb placed the decanters of claret and
Madeira, and the Fontenoy men began to talk of horse-racing,
of Mustapha, Nonpareil, York, and Victor.</p>

<p>Jacqueline and Unity, leaving the gentlemen at their
wine, came out into the broad hall and stood at the front
door looking out at the coloured clouds above the hills.
They supped early at Fontenoy, and the evening was yet
rosy.</p>

<p>&quot;He is going to speak to-night,&quot; said Unity, with conviction.
&quot;It is written in his eye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you mean Mr. Cary&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whom else should I mean? What are you going to say
to him, Jacqueline? I want you to say Yes, and I want you
to say No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't, Unity&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you say Yes, you will have Greenwood and the most
charming husband in the world, and be envied of every girl
in the county; and if you say No, I'll have you still&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall say No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What ails you, Jacqueline? I could swear that you're
in love, and yet I don't believe you are in love with Ludwell
Cary!&mdash;though I am sure you ought to be. It's not Mr.
Lee, nor Mr. Page, nor Jack Martin, nor&mdash;you're never
in love with Fairfax Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed, &quot;How absurd, Unity!&mdash;though may
be some day I shall love him as a cousin!&quot;</p>

<p>Unity regarded her with a puzzled gathering of black brows.
&quot;There's no one else that by any stretch of imagination I
can believe you in love with&mdash;unless it's Mr. Pincornet!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, now you certainly have it!&quot; cried Jacqueline, with
another tremulous laugh. She released herself from her
cousin's arm. &quot;I am going to tell Deb good-night. And
Unity&mdash;I don't want Mr. Cary to speak to-night, nor to-morrow
night, nor any other night! I'll stay at Fontenoy&mdash;I'll
stay at Fontenoy and care for Aunt Nancy and Deb
and Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward. I'll dance at your wedding,
Unity, but you'll not dance at mine!&quot;</p>

<p>She was gone. Unity sat down upon the porch steps and
began to name upon her fingers the eligible young men of
three counties. In her anxiety to account for Jacqueline's
pallor and the dark beneath her eyes, she went far afield,
but she met with no success. &quot;It's not one of them!&quot; she
sighed at last. &quot;And yet, she's changed&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline went slowly upstairs, a slender figure in white,
touching with her hand the polished balustrade. When she
reached the long and wide upper hall, she passed steadily
along it, but she turned her eyes upon a door at the far end,
the door of the blue room. Arrived in her own cool and
fragrant chamber, she found Deb already asleep in the small
bed, her yellow hair spread upon the pillow, her gown open
at the throat, a rag doll in the hollow of her arm. Upon the
floor, with her head against the bed, sat Miranda, as fast
asleep as her mistress. At Jacqueline's touch she awoke,
smiled widely, and was on her feet with a spring. &quot;Yaas,
Miss Jacqueline, I done put Miss Deb to bed. Mammy
Chloe say dat niggah Joab don' know nothin' 'bout er broken
ahm, an' she too busy in de blue room. Yaas'm, I done
mek Miss Deb wash her face an' say her prayers. Kin I go
now?&quot;</p>

<p>Alone, Jacqueline stood for a minute beside the sleeping
child, then bent and kissed Deb's brown neck. Moving
to a window, she sat down before it, resting her arm upon
the sill and her head upon her arm. Outside the window
grew a giant fir tree, shading the room, and giving it
at times an aspect too cold and northern. But Jacqueline
loved the tree, and loved and fed the birds that in winter
perched upon the dark boughs. Now, between the needles,
the eastern sky looked blue and cold. Jacqueline, sitting
idle, felt her eyes fill with slow tears. They did not fall.
She was not lacking in self-control, and she told herself that
of late she had wept too often. She sat very still, her head
bowed upon her listless arm, while the moments passed,
bearing with them pictures seen through unshed tears.
She was living over the days of the Three-Notched Road,
and she beheld each shifting scene by the light of a passion
that she believed to be unreasonable, unnatural, secret, and
without hope. Her uncle's voice came to her from the hall
below. &quot;Jacqueline, Jacqueline!&quot; She arose, bathed her
eyes, and went downstairs.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the family to gather after supper
upon the great white pillared porch, and to sit through the
twilight. The men smoked slowly and reflectively, the women
sat with folded hands, watching the last glow upon the hills,
and the brightening of the evening star; dreamily listening
to the choir of frogs, the faint tinkle of cowbells, the bleating
of folded lambs, and the continual rustle of the poplar leaves.</p>

<p>Jacqueline took her seat beside Unity. Colonel Churchill,
in his especial chair, was smoking like a benevolent volcano;
at a small table Major Edward was playing Patience. On
the broad porch steps below Jacqueline and Unity half sat,
half lay, the two Carys. The fireflies were beginning to show,
and out of the distance came a plaintive <i>Whip-poor-will&mdash;Whip-poor-will!</i></p>

<p>&quot;I shall have,&quot; said Ludwell Cary, &quot;the vines at Greenwood
trained like these. There could be no better way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is the drawing-room finished?&quot; asked Unity.</p>

<p>&quot;Almost finished. The paper came to-day from Baltimore.
The ground is silver, and there are garlands of roses
and a host of piping shepherds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, lovely!&quot; cried Unity. &quot;But no shepherdesses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, in among the roses. It is quite Arcadian. When
will the princesses come to see the shepherdesses?&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at them both. &quot;The Princess and her waiting-maid,&quot;
said Unity demurely, &quot;will come very soon.&quot; She
rose from the green bench. &quot;The waiting-maid is going now
to her harpsichord!&quot; Her eyes rested upon the younger
Cary. &quot;Will you be so very good as to turn the leaves for
me?&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary embracing with alacrity the chance of goodness,
the two went into the house. The dusk deepened; the
odour of honeysuckle and syringa grew heavier, and white
moths sailed by on their way to the lighted windows.</p>

<p>
&quot;Since love&mdash;since love is blissful sorrow,<br />
Then bid the lad&mdash;then bid the lad&mdash;<br />
Then bid the lad a fair good morrow!&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>flowed in soprano from the parlour.</p>

<p>Colonel Churchill laid down his pipe and lifted his burly
figure from the great chair. &quot;I forgot,&quot; he remarked to
Jacqueline, &quot;to tell your Aunt Nancy that Charles Carter
is going to marry Miss Lewis,&quot; and he left the porch.
The rose in the sky turned to pearl, the fireflies grew brilliant,
and the wind brought the murmur of streams and the louder
rustling of the poplar leaves. &quot;It is too dark to see the cards,&quot;
said Major Edward. &quot;I'll go read what the Gazette has to
say of Burr and the Massachusetts secession fools. Don't
move, Cary!&quot; He deftly gathered up the cards, and went
indoors.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;When I was green in years, and every month was May&quot;&mdash;sang
Unity.</p>

<p>
&quot;With Phyllis and with Chloe made I holiday!&quot;<br />
</p></div>

<p>&quot;It is dark night,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;Shall we not go in?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary put out an appealing hand. &quot;Don't rise! May we
not stay like this a little longer?&mdash;Miss Churchill, there is
something that I ardently wish to say to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is too soon to speak, I know,&mdash;it must seem too soon
to you. But to-day I said, 'The spring is flying&mdash;I'll put my
fortune to the touch!' I think that you must guess the thing
I wish to say&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know. I wish that you would leave it unsaid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you. On the day, three months ago, when I saw
you after my return and found the lovely child I remembered
changed into the loveliest of all women, I loved you. If then,
what now, when I have seen you, day by day?&mdash;I love
you, and I shall never cease to love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, with all my heart I wish that you did not!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ask you to be my wife. I beg you to let me prove
throughout my life the depth of my love, of my solicitude for
your happiness&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, happiness!&quot; cried Jacqueline sharply. &quot;I do not
see it in my life. The best that you can do is to forget
me quite.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will remember you when I draw my dying breath.
And if we remember after death, I will remember you then.
With all my strength I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry&mdash;I am sorry!&quot; she cried. &quot;Oh, I hoped
'twas but a fancy, and that you would not speak! I do not
love you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me wait,&quot; said Cary, after a pause. &quot;I said that I
was speaking too soon. Let me wait&mdash;let me prove to you.
Your heart may turn.&quot;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &quot;It will not change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there,&quot; asked Cary, in a low voice, &quot;is there another
before me?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him strangely. &quot;You have no right to question
me. I do not think that I shall ever marry. For you,
you will live long and be happy. You deserve happiness.
If I have wounded you, may it soon heal! Forget this night,
and me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forget!&quot; said Cary. &quot;I am not so lightly made! But
neither will I despair. I will wait. If there is no man before
me, I will win you yet! There is little reason, God knows,
why you should care for me, but I shall strive to make
that reason greater!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is reason,&quot; answered Jacqueline. &quot;I think highly,
highly of you! You would make a woman happy;&mdash;all
her life she would travel a sunny road! I prize your friendship&mdash;I
am loth to lose it. But as for me,&quot;&mdash;she locked her
hands against her breast,&mdash;&quot;there is that within me that
cries, <i>The shadowed road!&mdash;the shadowed road!&quot;</i></p>

<p>She rose, and Cary rose with her. &quot;Forgive me,&quot; she
said. &quot;Is it not cruel that we hurt each other so? Forgive&mdash;forget.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would forgive you,&quot; he answered, with emotion, &quot;the
suffering and the sorrow of a thousand lives. But forget
you&mdash;never! I'll love you well and I'll love you long. Nor
will I despair. To-night is dark, but the sun may shine to-morrow.
Think of me as of one who will love you to the end.&quot;
He took her hand and kissed it, then stood aside, saying,
&quot;I will not face the lights quite yet.&quot; She passed into the
hail and up the stairway, and he turned and went down
the porch steps into the May night.</p>

<h3>EXPOSTULATION</h3>


<p>The next morning Ludwell Cary rose early, ordered
his horse, and opened the door of his brother's room.
&quot;Fair,&quot; he said, as the younger Cary sat up in
bed, with a nightcap wonderfully askew upon his handsome
head, &quot;I am off for Greenwood. Make my excuses, will
you, to Colonel Churchill and the ladies? I will not be back
till supper-time.&quot; He turned to leave the room. &quot;And Fair&mdash;if
you have anything to say to Miss Dandridge, this is
the shepherd's hour. We go home to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the Devil?&quot;&mdash;began the younger Cary.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not the Devil,&quot; said the other, with a twist of the lip
half humorous, half piteous. &quot;Just woman.&quot;</p>

<p>He was gone. Fairfax Cary looked at his watch, then rose
from his bed and looked out of the window at the rose and
dew of the dawn. &quot;What the Devil!&quot; he said again to himself;
and then, with a forehead of perplexity, &quot;He was up
late last night&mdash;out in the garden alone. He rides off to
Greenwood with the dawn, and we go home to-morrow.
She can't have refused him&mdash;that's not possible!&quot; He
went back to bed to study matters over. At last, &quot;The
jade!&quot; he exclaimed with conviction, and two hours later,
when he came down to breakfast, wished Miss Churchill
good-morning with glacial courtesy.</p>

<p>Jacqueline, behind the coffee urn, had heavy-lidded eyes,
and her smile was tremulous. Unity, brilliant and watchful,
regarded the universe and the hauteur of young Mr. Cary
with lifted brows. Major Churchill, when he appeared,
shot one glance at the place that was Ludwell Cary's, another
at his niece, then sat heavily down, and in a querulous
voice demanded coffee. Colonel Dick wore a frown. Deb,
who before breakfast had visited a new foal in the long pasture,
kept for a time the ball of conversation rolling; but the
dulness and the chill in the air presently enwrapped her
also. The meal came to an end with only one hazard as to
what could have taken Ludwell Cary to Greenwood for the
entire day. That was Unity's, who remarked that pains
must be bestowed upon the hanging of a drawing-room
paper, else the shepherds and the shepherdesses would not
match.</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary asked after Lewis Rand and his broken arm,
and Colonel Dick responded with absent-mindedness that
the arm did very well, and that its owner would soon be going
about his business with all the rest of the damned Republican
mischief-makers: then, &quot;Scipio, did you take that julep
and bird up to the blue room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yaas, marster,&quot; answered Scipio. &quot;The gent'man say
tell you 'Thank you.' He say he ain't gwine trouble you
much longer, an' he cyarn never forgit what Fontenoy's
done fer him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Deb!&quot; said Uncle Edward, with great sharpness, &quot;you
are spilling that cup of milk. Look what you are doing,
child!&quot;</p>

<p>The uncomfortable meal came to an end. Outside the
dining-room door Uncle Dick mentioned to Unity that her
aunt wanted her in the chamber to cut off linsey gowns for
the house servants, and Uncle Edward inquired if it would
be troublesome to Fairfax Cary to ride over to Tom Wood's
and take a look at that black stallion Tom bragged of. Unity
went to her aunt's chamber; the younger Cary walked away
somewhat stiffly to the stables; Uncle Edward sent Deb to
her lessons, and Uncle Dick told Jacqueline to come in half
an hour to the library. Edward and he wanted to speak to
her.</p>

<p>Jacqueline gave her directions, or her aunt's directions,
to Scipio, then crossed the paved way to the kitchen and
talked of dinner and supper with the turbaned cook; opened
with her keys the smokehouse door, and in the storeroom
superintended the weighing of flour and sugar and the
measuring of Java coffee, and finally saw that the drawing-room
was properly darkened against the sunny morning, and
that the water was fresh in the bowls of flowers. She leaned
for a moment against her harp, one hand upon its strings,
her forehead resting upon her bare arm; then she turned from
the room and entered the library, where she found her uncles
waiting for her, Uncle Dick upon the hearth rug and Uncle
Edward at the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline,&quot; began the first, then, &quot;Edward, I never
could talk to a woman! Ask her what all this damned nonsense
means!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your uncle doesn't mean that it is all damned nonsense,
Jacqueline,&quot; said Uncle Edward, with gentleness.
&quot;Not perhaps from your point of view, my dear. But both
he and I are greatly grieved and disappointed&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was all arranged ages ago!&quot; broke in the elder brother.
&quot;Fauquier Cary and your dear father, my brother Henry,
settled it when you were born and Fauquier's son was a lad
at Maury's school! When Henry died, and Fauquier Cary
died, my brother Edward here and I said to each other that
we would see the matter out! So we will, by God!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gently, Dick! Jacqueline, child, you know how dear you
are to us, and how the future and the happiness of you and
of Unity and of Deb is our jealous care&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fauquier Cary was as noble a man as ever breathed,&quot;
cried the other, &quot;and his son's his image! There's no better
blood in Virginia&mdash;and the land beside&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It does not matter about the land, Jacqueline,&quot; said
Uncle Edward, &quot;though God forbid that I should depreciate
good land&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Land's land,&quot; quoth Colonel Dick, &quot;and good blood's
gospel truth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bah! it's nature's truth!&quot; said Uncle Edward. &quot;Jacqueline,
my dear, our hearts are set on this match. Mr. Ludwell
Cary asked your uncle's permission to speak to you, and your
uncle gave it gladly, and neither he nor I ever dreamed&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course we didn't,&quot; broke in the other. &quot;We didn't
dream that Jacqueline could be unreasonable or ungrateful,
and we don't dream it now! Nor blind. Ludwell Cary's
a man and a gentleman, and the woman who gets him is
lucky!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We approved his suit, Jacqueline, and we hoped to be
happy to-day in your happiness&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And in he comes at midnight last night, with his father's
own look on his face, and what does he say to Edward and me,
sitting here, waiting, with a thousand fancies in our heads?
'Miss Churchill will not have me,' says he, 'and you who
have been so good to me, are to be good still, and not by
word or look reproach her or distress her. The heart goes
its own way, and loves where it must. She is an angel, and
to-night I am a poor beaten and weary mortal. I thank
you again, both of you, and wish you good-night.' And off
he goes before a man could say Jack Robinson! Those were
his very words, weren't they, Edward?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Edward. &quot;He is a brave and gallant
gentleman, Jacqueline. I love you, child, more than my old
tongue can say. My Castle in Spain is Greenwood with you
and Ludwell Cary and the children of you both.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, cruel!&quot; cried Jacqueline. &quot;He is brave and good&mdash;He
is all that you say. But I shall never live at Greenwood!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was your father's dearest wish,&quot; said the Major. &quot;It
is ours&mdash;Richard's and mine. We are not men who give
up easily. God forbid, child, that I should hint to you, who
are the darling of us all, of obligation&mdash;and yet I put it
to you if obedience is not owed&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; answered Jacqueline. &quot;It is owed. I am
not ungrateful&mdash;I am mad&mdash;perhaps I am wicked! I
wish that I were dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Churchills,&quot; said Uncle Edward, &quot;have never in
their marriages set vulgar store by money. Blood we ask,
of course, and honourable position, and the right way of
thinking. Individually I am a stickler for mind. To his
wealth and to his name and his great personal advantages
Ludwell Cary adds intellect. He may become a power
in his country and his time. You would so aid him, child!
I am called a woman-hater, but once, Jacqueline, I loved
too well. For all that I am a sorry old bachelor, I know
whereof I speak. With a man, a woman to fight for is not
half the battle&mdash;it is all the battle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is all that you say,&quot; answered Jacqueline. &quot;But I
do not love him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You like him. You admire him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes. That is not love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is mighty near kin,&quot; said Uncle Dick. &quot;No end of
happy folk begin with esteem and go on like turtle doves.
My little Jack, you shall have the prettiest wedding gown!
It's all a mistake and a misunderstanding, and the good Lord
knows there's too much of both in this old world! You'll
think better of it all, and you'll find that you didn't know
your own mind,&mdash;and there'll be a smile for poor Cary
when he comes riding back to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; cried Jacqueline. &quot;There is no mistake and
no misunderstanding. Love cannot be forced, and I'll not
marry where I do not love!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't,&quot; said Colonel Churchill slowly, &quot;you don't
by any chance love some one else? What does that colour
mean, Jacqueline? Don't stammer! Speak out!&quot;</p>

<p>But Jacqueline, standing by the old leather chair, bowed
her head upon its high green back, and neither could nor
would &quot;speak out.&quot; The two men, grey and withered, obstinate
and imperious in a day and generation that subordinated
youth to the councils of the old, gazed at their niece
with perplexity and anger. With the simpler of the two the
perplexity was the greater, with the other anger. A fear was
knocking at Major Churchill's heart. He would not admit
it, strove not to listen to it, or to listen with contemptuous
incredulity. &quot;It's not possible,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Not
a thousand summers at Jane Selden's would make her so
forget herself! Jacqueline in love with that damned Jacobin
demagogue upstairs! Pshaw!&quot; But the fear knocked on.</p>

<p>Jacqueline lifted her head. &quot;Be good to me, Uncle Dick!
If I could love, if I could marry Mr. Cary, I would&mdash;I
would indeed! But I cannot. Please let me go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not till I know more than I know now,&quot; said Colonel
Churchill. &quot;If it's George Lee, Jacqueline, I'll not say a
word, sorry as I am for Cary. But if it's Will Allen, I'll
see you dead before I give my consent! He's a spendthrift
and a Republican!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I care neither for Mr. Lee nor Mr. Allen,&quot; said Jacqueline,
with a burning cheek. &quot;Oh, Uncle Edward, make
Uncle Dick let me go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not wise,&quot; Major Churchill considered within himself,
&quot;to push a woman too far. I'm a suspicious fool to
think this thing of Jacqueline. It's all some girl's fancy or
other, and if we go easily Cary will yet win&mdash;by God, he
shall win! This damned Yahoo upstairs is neither here nor
there!&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke aloud to his brother. &quot;Best let the child go
think it over, Dick. She knows her duty&mdash;and that we
expect her compliance. She doesn't want to wound us
cruelly, to make us unhappy, to prove herself blind and
ingrate. Give her a kiss and let her go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You come down and sing to us to-night, my little Jack,
in your blue gown,&quot; quoth Uncle Dick. &quot;Don't you ever
let a time come when your singing won't be the sweetest
sound in the world to me! Now go, and think of what we
have said, and of poor Cary, ridden off to Greenwood!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline gazed at the two for a moment, and made as
if to speak, but the words died in her throat. She uttered
a broken cry, turned, groped a little for the door, found
and opened it, and was gone. They heard the click of her
slippers upon the stairs, and presently the closing of a blind
in the room that was hers.</p>

<p>The brothers sat heavily on in the sunshine-flooded library,
the elder red and fuming, the younger silent and
saturnine. At last Colonel Dick broke out, &quot;What the devil
ails her, Edward? Every decent young fellow in the county
comes to Fontenoy straight as a bee to the honey-pot! I've
heard them sighing for her and Unity, but I never could see
that she favoured one man more than another,&mdash;and she's
no coquette like Unity! Except for that fine blush of hers,
I'd never have thought. What do you think, Edward?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ways of women are past my finding out,&quot; said Edward.
&quot;Let it rest for a while, Dick.&quot; He rose from his chair
stiffly, like an old man. &quot;Let Cary go home to-morrow as
he intends. 'Absence makes the heart grow fonder,' they
say. She may find that she misses him, and may look for
him when he comes riding over. Never fear but he'll ride
over often! He mustn't guess, of course, that you have
spoken to her. And that's all we can do, Dick, except&mdash;&quot;
Major Edward walked stiffly across the floor and paused before
the portrait of his brother Henry, dead and gone these
many years. The face looked imperiously down upon him.
Henry had stood for something before he died,&mdash;for grace
and manly beauty, pride and fire. The Major's eyes suddenly
smarted. &quot;Poor white trash,&quot; he said between his teeth,
&quot;and Henry's daughter!&quot; He turned and came back to the
table. &quot;Dick! just as soon as you can, you clear the house
of old Gideon Rand's son!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's he got to do with it?&quot; asked Colonel Dick.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said the other. &quot;But I want him out
of the blue room, and out of Fontenoy! and now, Dick, I've
got a piece to write this morning on the designs of Aaron
Burr.&quot;</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon Cary returned, quiet and handsome,
ready with his account of matters at Greenwood, from
the stable, upon which Major Churchill must pronounce, to
the drawing-room paper, which awaited Miss Dandridge's
sentence. His behaviour was perfection, but &quot;He's hard
hit,&quot; said his brother to himself. &quot;What, pray, would Miss
Churchill have?&quot; And Unity, &quot;The shepherds and shepherdesses
don't match. How can she have the heart?&quot; And
Major Churchill, &quot;Are women blind? This is Hyperion to
a satyr.&quot; And Jacqueline, &quot;Oh, miserable me! Is he writing
or reading, or is he lying thinking, there in the blue
room?&quot;</p>

<h3>TO ALTHEA</h3>


<p>Adam Gaudylock came, when his leisure served
him, to Fontenoy as he went everywhere, by virtue
of his quality of free lance and golden-tongued narrator
of western news. The stress of thought at the moment
was to the West and the empire that had been purchased
there; and a man from beyond Kentucky, with tales to tell
of the Mississippi Territory, brought his own welcome to town,
tavern, and plantation. If this were true of all, it was trebly true
of Adam, who had been born open-eyed. As the magnet draws
the filings, so he drew all manner of tidings. News came to
him as by a thousand carrier pigeons. He took toll of the solitary
in the brown and pathless woods, of the boatmen upon
fifty rivers, of the Indian braves about the council-fire, of hunters,
trappers, traders, and long lines of Conestoga wagons, of
soldiers on frontier posts, Jesuit missionaries upon the Ohio,
camp-meeting orators by the Kentucky and the upper James,
martial emissaries of three governments, village lawyers,
gamblers, dealers in lotteries, and militia colonels, Spanish
intendants, French agents, American settlers, wild Irish,
thrifty Germans, Creoles, Indians, Mestizos, Quadroons,
Congo blacks,&mdash;from the hunter in the forest to the slave in
the fields, and from the Governor of the vast new territory
to the boatman upon a Mississippi ark, not a type of the
restless time but imparted to Adam something of its view of
life and of the winds that vexed its sea. He was a skilful
compounder, and when, forever wandering, he wandered
back by wood and stream to the sunny, settled lands east
of the Blue Ridge, he gave to the thirsty in plantation and
town bright globules of hard fact in a heady elixir of fancy.
While he talked all men were adventurers, and all women
admired him. Adam liked this life and this world; asked
nothing better than to journey through a hundred such.</p>

<p>Now, sitting at his ease in the blue room, a fortnight after
Rand's accident, he delivered a score of messages from the
Republicans of the county, gentle and simple, whom he
had chanced to encounter since the accident to their representative.</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel Randolph says the President has bad luck with
the horses he gives&mdash;young Mr. Carr was thrown by a bay
mare from Shadwell. Old Jowett swears that a trooper
of Tarleton's broke his neck at that identical place&mdash;says
you can hear him any dark night swearing like the Hessian
he was. They drank your health at the Eagle, the night
they heard of the accident, with bumpers&mdash;drank it just
after Mr. Jefferson's and before the memory of Washington.
'Congress next!' they said. 'Hurrah! He'll scatter the Black
Cockades&mdash;he'll make the Well-born cry King's Cruse!
Hip, hip, hurrah! What's he doing at Fontenoy? They'll
put poison in his cup! Hurrah!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fontenoy will not put poison in my cup,&quot; said Rand.
&quot;I hope some one was there to say as much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said it,&quot; answered Adam. &quot;They are a noisy lot.
Tom Mocket made a speech and compared you to Moses. He
wept when he made it, and they had to hold him steady on
his feet. When they broke up, I took him home to the Partridge.
I'll tell you one speech that he never made by himself,
and that's the speech that's going to hang Fitch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Rand. &quot;I wrote it. You were at the trial?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay. It would have hung Abel, so poor Cain had no
chance. Mr. Eppes says Mr. Jefferson counts upon your
becoming a power in the state. I don't know&mdash;but it seems
to me there's power enough in these regions! It's getting
crowded. First thing you know, you'll be jealous of Mr.
Jefferson, or he'll be jealous of you. If I were you, I'd look
to the West.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The old song!&quot; exclaimed Rand. &quot;What should I do
in the West?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rule it,&quot; said Adam.</p>

<p>Rand shot a glance at the hunter where he lounged against
the window, a figure straight and lithe as an Indian, not tall,
but gifted with a pantherish grace, and breathing a certain
tawny brightness as of sunshine through pine needles.
&quot;You're daft!&quot; he said; then after a moment, &quot;Are you
serious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should I not be serious?&quot; asked Adam. &quot;My faith!
it's a restless land, the West, and it's a far cry from the
Mississippi to the Potomac. The West doesn't like the East
anyhow. But it wants a picked man from the East. It will
get one too! The wind's blowing hard from the full to the
empty, from the parcelled-out to the virgin land!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rand.</p>

<p>&quot;Why shouldn't you be the man?&quot; demanded Gaudylock.
&quot;Just as well you as Claiborne&mdash;Wilkinson's naught,
I don't count him&mdash;or any one still East, like&mdash;like&mdash;Aaron
Burr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aaron Burr?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I just instance him. He's ambitious enough,
and there doesn't seem much room for him back here.
If Adam Gaudylock was ambitious and was anything but
just an uneducated hunter with a taste for danger&mdash;I tell
you, Lewis, I can see the blazed trees, I can see them with
my eyes shut, stretching clean from anywhere&mdash;stretching
from this room, say&mdash;beyond the Ohio, and beyond the
Mississippi, and beyond Mexico to where the sun strikes the
water! It's a trail for fine treading and a strong man, but
it leads&mdash;it leads&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It might lead,&quot; said Rand, &quot;to the Tarpeian Rock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's where they put to death a sort of folk called traitors&mdash;Benedict
Arnolds and such.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pshaw!&quot; exclaimed Adam. &quot;Traitors! Benedict Arnold
<i>was</i> a traitor. This is not like that. America's large enough for
a mort of countries. All the states are countries&mdash;federated
countries. Say some man is big enough to <i>make</i> a country
west of the Mississippi&mdash;Well, one day we may federate
too. Eh, Lewis, 'twould be a powerful country&mdash;great as
Rome, I reckon! And we'd smoke the calumet with old
Virginia&mdash;and she'd rule East and we'd rule West. D'you
think it's a dream?&mdash;Well, men make dreams come
true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes: Corsicans,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;Aaron Burr is not a
Corsican.&quot; He looked at his left hand, lying upon the arm of
his chair, raised it, shut and opened it, gazing curiously at
its vein and sinew. &quot;You are talking midsummer madness,&quot;
he said at last. &quot;Let's leave the blazed trees for a while&mdash;though
we'll talk of them again some time. Have you been
along the Three-Notched Road?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Adam, turning easily. &quot;Your tobacco's
prime, the wheat, too, and the fencing is all mended and
white-washed. It's not the tumble-down place it was in Gideon's
time&mdash;you've done wonders with it. The morning-glories
were blooming over the porch, and your white cat washing
itself in the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's but a poor home,&quot; said Rand, and he said it wistfully.
He wished for a splendid house, a home so splendid
that any woman must love it.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not so fine as Fontenoy,&quot; quoth Adam, &quot;nor Monticello,
nor Mr. Blennerhassett's island in the Ohio, but a man
might be happy in a poorer spot. Home's home, as I can
testify who haven't any. I've known a Cherokee to die
of homesickness for a skin stretched between two saplings.
How long before you are back upon the Three-Notched
Road?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand moved restlessly. &quot;The doctor says I may go downstairs
to-day. I shall leave Fontenoy almost immediately.
They cannot want me here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you seen Mr. Ludwell Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He and his brother left Fontenoy some time ago. But
he rides over nearly every day. Usually I see him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is making a fine place of Greenwood. And he has
taken a law office in Charlottesville&mdash;the brick house by
the Swan.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He told me he would not be idle.&quot;</p>

<p>Adam rose, and took up the gun which it was his whim to
carry. &quot;I'll go talk ginseng and maple sugar to Colonel
Churchill for a bit, and then I'll go back to the Eagle. As
soon as you are on the Three-Notched Road again I'll come
to see you there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Adam,&quot; said Rand, &quot;in the woods, when chance makes
an Indian your host, an Indian of a hostile tribe, an Indian
whom you know the next week may see upon the war-path
against you&mdash;and there is in his lodge a thing, no matter
what, that you desire with all your mind and all your heart
and all your soul, and he will not barter with you, and the thing
is not entirely his own nor highly valued by him, while it is
more than life to you, and moreover you believe it to be
sought by one who is your foe&mdash;would you, Adam, having
eaten that Indian's bread, go back into the forest, and leave
behind, untouched, unspoken of, that precious thing your
soul longed for? The trail you take may never lead again
to that lodge. Would you leave it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Adam. &quot;But my trail <i>should</i> lead that
way again. It is a hostile tribe. I would come back, not in
peace paint, but in war paint. I would fairly warn the Indian,
and then I would take the bauble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here is Mammy Chloe,&quot; said the other. &quot;What have
you there, mammy&mdash;a dish of red pottage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sah,&quot; said Mammy. &quot;Hit's a baked apple an'
whipped cream an' nutmeg. Ole Miss she say Gineral
Lafayette sho' did favour baked apples wunst when he wuz
laid up wid a cold at her father's house in Williamsburgh.
An' de little posy, Miss Deb she done gather hit outer her
square in de gyarden. De Cun'l he say de fambly gwine
expect de honour of yo' company dis evenin' in de drawin'-room.&quot;</p>

<p>Adam said good-bye and went away. An hour later, going
down the Fontenoy road, he came upon a small brown
figure, seated, hands over knees, among the blackberry bushes.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you partridge!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You little brown
prairie-hen, what are you doing so far from home? Blackberries
aren't ripe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Vinie. &quot;I was just a-walking down the road,
and I just walked on. I wasn't tired. I always think the
country's prettier down this way. Did you come from Fontenoy,
Mr. Adam?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Adam, sitting down beside her. &quot;I went to
see Lewis Rand&mdash;not that I don't like all the people there
anyway. They're always mighty nice to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie dug the point of her dusty shoe into the dusty
road.</p>

<p>&quot;How ith Mr. Rand, Mr. Adam?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He 'ith' almost well,&quot; answered Adam. &quot;He's going
down into the parlour to-night, and pretty soon he's going
home, and then he'll be riding into town to his office.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked kindly into the small, freckled, pretty face.
The heat of the day stood in moisture on Vinie's brow, she
had pushed back her sunbonnet, and the breeze stirred the
damp tendrils of her hair. &quot;Tom must miss him,&quot; said the
hunter.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, Tom does.&quot; Vinie drew toward her a blackberry
branch, and studied the white bloom. &quot;Which do
you think is the prettiest, Mr. Adam,&mdash;Miss Unity or Miss
Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I don't know,&quot; answered Adam. &quot;They are both
mighty pretty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think Miss Unity's the prettiest,&quot; said Vinie. &quot;It's
time I was walking back to Charlottesville.&quot; She rose and
stood for a moment in the dusty road below the blackberry
bushes, looking toward Fontenoy. &quot;I don't suppose he asked
after Tom and me, Mr. Adam?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, surely!&quot; protested Adam, with cheerful mendacity.
&quot;He asked after you both particularly. He said he certainly
would like a cup of water from your well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he?&quot; asked Vinie, and grew pink. &quot;That water's
mighty cold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like a cup of it myself,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Since we are
both walking to town, we might as well walk together. Don't
you want me to break some cherry blossoms for your
parlour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, if you please,&quot; replied Vinie, and the two went up
the sunny road to Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Back at Fontenoy, in the blue room, Rand, resting in the
easy chair beside the window, left the consideration of Adam
and Adam's talk, and gave his mind to the approaching hour
in the Fontenoy drawing-room. He both desired and dreaded
that encounter. Would Miss Churchill be there? Aided by
the homely friendliness of her cousin's house on the Three-Notched
Road, he had met her and conversed with her without
being greatly conscious of any circumstance other than
that she was altogether beautiful, and that he loved her. But
this was not Mrs. Selden's, this was Fontenoy. He had
stood here hat in hand, within Miss Churchill's memory&mdash;certainly
within the memory of the men of her family. Well!
He was, thank God! an American citizen. The hat was now
out of his hand and upon his head. The conditions of his
boyhood might, he thought, be forgotten in the conditions
of his manhood. But&mdash;they would all be gathered in the
drawing-room. Should he speak first to Colonel Churchill
as his host, or first to the ladies of the house, to Miss Churchill
and Miss Dandridge? If Miss Churchill or Miss Dandridge
were at the harpsichord, should he wait at the door until
the piece was ended? He had a vision of a great space of polished
floor reflecting candlelight, and of himself crossing
that trackless desert beneath the eyes of goddesses and men.
The colour came into his face. There were twenty things
he might have asked Mr. Pincornet that night at Monticello.
He turned with hot impatience from the consideration of
the usages of society, and fell to building with large and
strong timbers the edifice of his future. He built on while
the dusk gathered, and he built while Joab helped him to
dress, and he was yet busy with beam and rafter when at
eight o'clock, with some help from the negro, he descended
the stairs and crossed the hall to the parlour door. How was
he dressed? He was dressed in a high-collared coat of blue
cloth with eagle buttons, in cloth breeches and silk stockings,
in shoes with silver buckles, and a lawn neckcloth of many
folds. His hair was innocent of powder, and cut short in
what the period supposed to be the high Roman fashion. It
was his chief touch of the Republican. In the matter of
dress he had not his leader's courage. Abhorring slovenliness
and the Jacobin motley, he would not affect them. He
was dressed in his best for this evening; and if his attire was
not chosen as Ludwell Cary would have chosen, it was yet
the dress of a gentleman, and it was worn with dignity.</p>

<p>Music was playing, as he paused at the half-open door,&mdash;he
could see Miss Dandridge at the harpsichord. The room
seemed very light. For a moment he ceased to be the master-builder
and sank to the estate of the apprentice, awkward and
eaten with self-distrust; the next, with a characteristic abrupt
motion of head and hand, he recovered himself, waved Joab
aside, and boldly crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>Unity, at the harpsichord, was playing over, very rapidly,
one after another, reels, hornpipes, jigs, and Congos, and
looking, meanwhile, slyly out of velvet eyes at Fairfax Cary,
who had asked for a particularly tender serenade. He stood
beside her, and strove for injured dignity. It was a day of
open courtship, and polite Albemarle watched with admiration
the younger Cary's suit to Miss Dandridge. He had
ridden alone to Fontenoy; his brother, who had business in
Charlottesville, promising to join him later in the evening.
Mr. Ned Hunter, too, was at Fontenoy, and he also would
have been leaning over the harpsichord but for the fact that
Colonel Dick had fastened upon him and was demonstrating
with an impressive forefinger the feasibility of widening into a
highway fit for a mail-coach a certain forest track running
over the mountains and through the adjoining county. They
stood upon the hearth, and Mr. Hunter could see Miss Dandridge
only by much craning of the neck. &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he said
vaguely, &quot;it can easily be widened, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Churchill, playing Patience at the small table,
raised his head like a war-horse. &quot;Nonsense! widen on one
side and you will fall into the river; on the other, and a pretty
cliff you'll have to climb! You could as well widen the way
between Scylla and Charybdis&mdash;or Mahomet's Bridge to
Paradise&mdash;or Thomas Jefferson's Natural Bridge! Pshaw!&quot;
He began to build from the five of clubs.</p>

<p>&quot;A detour can be made,&quot; said Colonel Dick.</p>

<p>&quot;Around the Blue Ridge?&quot; asked the Major scornfully.
&quot;Pshaw! And it passes my comprehension what a stage-coach
would do in that country. There are not ten houses
on that cart track.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense! there are fifty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fifty-three, I assure you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major laid down his cards and turned in his chair. &quot;I
counted every structure the last time I was on that road.
Taking in Fagg's Mill and Brown's Ferry and the Mountain
Schoolhouse, there are just ten houses. It is my habit, sir,
to reckon accurately.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter grew red. &quot;But, sir, the count was taken before
the last election, and fifty-three&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ten, sir!&quot; said the Major, and placed the queen of
diamonds.</p>

<p>&quot;When did you ride that way, Edward?&quot; queried his
brother. &quot;I don't believe you've been across the mountain
since the war.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was on that road in '87,&quot; said the Major. &quot;I rode
that way on the sixth of April with Clark. And there are
ten houses; I counted them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But good Lord, sir, this is 1804!&quot;</p>

<p>The Major's hawk eyes, dark and bright beneath shaggy
brows, regarded Mr. Ned Hunter with disfavour. &quot;I am
aware, sir, that this is 1804,&quot; he said, and placed the king
of diamonds.</p>

<p>Jacqueline arose from her chair beside the open window,
softly crossed the floor, and touched Colonel Churchill upon
the arm. &quot;Uncle Dick,&quot; she murmured, and with the slightest
of gestures indicated Rand standing in the door.</p>

<p>Colonel Churchill started, precipitantly left Mr. Hunter,
and crossed the floor to his guest of two weeks. &quot;My dear
sir, you came in so quietly! I welcome you downstairs.
Gilmer says you're a strong fighter. When I was thrown at
that same turn coming home from a wedding, I believe I
was in bed for a month!&mdash;Allow me to present you to my
nieces&mdash;Miss Churchill, Miss Dandridge. My poor wife,
you know, never leaves her chamber. Mr. Ned Hunter,
Mr. Rand. Mr. Fairfax Cary I think you know, and my brother
Edward.&quot;</p>

<p>The young men's greeting, if somewhat constrained, was
courteous. Major Churchill played the card which he held
in his hand, then slowly rose, came stiffly from behind the
small table, and made an elaborate bow. There was in his
acknowledgment of the honour of Mr. Rand's acquaintance
so much accent, cruelty, and hauteur that the younger man
flushed. &quot;This is an enemy,&quot; said a voice within him. He
bowed in return, and he no longer felt any distrust of himself.
When Miss Dandridge, leaving the harpsichord, established
herself upon the sofa before him and opened a lively fire of
questions and comment, he answered with readiness. He
thought her pretty figure in amber lutestring, and the turn
of her ringleted head, and the play of her scarlet lips all
very good to look at, and he looked without hesitation. The
account which she demanded of the accident which had
placed him there he gave with a free, bold, and pleasing touch,
and the thanks that were her due as the immediate Samaritan
he chivalrously paid. Unity made friends with all parties,
and she now found, with some amusement, that she was
going to like Lewis Rand.</p>

<p>Rand looked too, freely and quietly, at the young men,
his fellow guests. Each, he knew, was arrogantly impatient
of his presence there. Well, they had nothing to do with it!
His sense of humour awoke, and Federalist hauteur ceased
to fret him. Colonel Churchill, the most genial of men,
pushed his chair into the Republican's neighbourhood, and
plunged into talk. Conversation in Virginia, where men
were concerned, opened with politics, crops, or horseflesh.
Colonel Dick chose the second, and Rand, who had a first-hand
knowledge of the subject, met him in the fields. The
trinity of corn, wheat, and tobacco occupied them for a while,
as did the fruit and an experiment in vine-growing. The
horse then entered the conversation, and Rand asked after
Goldenrod, that had won the cup at Fredericksburg. &quot;I
broke him for you, you know, sir, seven years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Churchill, who in his own drawing-room would
not for the world have mentioned this little fact to his guest,
suddenly thought within his honest heart, &quot;This is a man,
even if he is a damned Republican!&quot; He gave a circumstantial
account of Goldenrod, and of Goldenrod's brother,
Firefly, and he said to himself, &quot;I'll keep off politics.&quot;
Presently Rand began to speak of Adam Gaudylock's account
of New Orleans.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, ay,&quot; said the Colonel, &quot;there's a city! But it's not
English&mdash;it is Spanish and French. And all that new land
now! 'twill never be held&mdash;begging your pardon, Mr.
Rand&mdash;by Thomas Jefferson and a lot of new-fangled
notions! No Spaniard ever did believe that all men are
born equal, and no Frenchman ever wanted liberty long&mdash;not
unadorned liberty, anyway. As for our own people who
are pouring over the mountains&mdash;well, English blood
naturally likes pride and power and what was good enough
for its grandparents! Louisiana is too big and too far away.
It takes a month to go from Washington to New Orleans.
Rome couldn't keep her countries that were far away, and
Rome believed in armies and navies and proper taxation,
and had no pernicious notions&mdash;begging your pardon again,
Mr. Rand&mdash;about free trade and the abolishment of slavery!
I tell you, this new country of ours will breed or import a
leader&mdash;and then she'll revolt and make him dictator&mdash;and
then we'll have an empire for neighbour, an empire without
any queasy ideas as to majorities and natural rights!
And Thomas Jefferson&mdash;begging your pardon, Mr. Rand&mdash;is
acute enough to see the danger. He's not bothering
about majorities and natural rights either&mdash;for the country
west of the Ohio! He's preparing to govern the Mississippi
Territory like a conquered province. Mark my words, Mr.
Rand, she'll find a Buonaparte&mdash;some young demagogue,
some ambitious upstart without scruple or a hostage to fortune
some common soldier like Buonaparte or favourite like&mdash;like&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like&mdash;&quot; queried Rand. But the Colonel, who had suddenly
grown very red, would not or could not continue his comparison.
He floundered, drew out his snuff-box and restored
it to his pocket, and finally was taken pity on by Unity, who
with dancing eyes re&euml;ntered the conversation, and asked
if Mr. Rand had read The Romance of the Forest. Fairfax
Cary left the harpsichord, where he had been impatiently
turning over the music, and, strolling to one of the long
windows, stood now looking out into the gloomy night, and
now staring with a frowning face at the lit room and at
Miss Dandridge, in her amber gown, smiling upon Lewis
Rand! Near him, Major Churchill, preternaturally grey
and absorbed, played Patience. The cards fell from his
hand with the sound of dead leaves. Beside a second window
sat Jacqueline, looking, too, into the night. She sat in a low
chair covered with dull green silk, and the straight window
curtains, of the same colour and texture, half enshadowed
her. Her dress was white, with coral about her throat and
in her hair. She leaned her elbow on her knee, and with
her chin in her hand looked upon the dark mass of the
trees, and the stars between the hurrying clouds.</p>

<p>The younger Cary, at his window, leaned out into the night,
listened a moment, then turned and left the room. &quot;It is my
brother, sir,&quot; he announced, as he passed Colonel Churchill.
&quot;I hear him at the gate.&quot;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Ludwell Cary entered. He was in riding-dress,
his handsome face a little worn and pale, but smiling,
his bearing as usual, quiet, manly, and agreeable. &quot;It is a
sultry night, sir,&quot; he said to Colonel Churchill. &quot;There is a
storm brewing.&mdash;Miss Dandridge, your very humble servant!&mdash;Mr.
Rand&mdash;&quot; He held out his hand. &quot;I am rejoiced
to see you recovered!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand stood up, and touched the extended hand. &quot;Thank
you,&quot; he said, with a smile. &quot;I were a Turk if I did not
recover here amidst all this goodness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, there's goodness,&quot; answered Cary, and moved
on to the window where Jacqueline sat in the shadow of the
curtains. Rand, looking after him, saw him speak to her,
and saw her answer with a smile.</p>

<p>A pang ran through him, acrid and fiery. It was not like
the vapour of distaste and dislike, of which he had been
conscious on the day of the election. That had been cold
and clinging; this was a burning and a poisoned arrow. It
killed the softening, the consciousness of charm, the spell
of Cary's kindness while he lay there helpless in the blue
room. Not since the old days when his heart was hot against
his father, had he felt such venom, such rancour. That had
been a boy's wild revolt against injustice; this passion was
the fury of the adolescent who sees his rival. He looked at
Cary through a red mist. This cleared, but a seed that was
in Rand's nature, buried far, far down in the ancestral earth,
swelled a little where it lay in its dim chasm. The rift closed,
the glow as of heated iron faded, and Rand bitterly told himself,
&quot;He will win; more than that, he deserves to win! As
for you, you are here to behave like a gentleman.&quot; He turned
more fully to Unity, and talked of books and of such matters
as he thought might be pleasing to a lady.</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary entered, brushing the drops from his coat-sleeve.
&quot;The rain is coming down,&quot; he said, and with deliberation
seated himself beside Miss Dandridge.</p>

<p>&quot;That's good!&quot; exclaimed the Colonel. &quot;Now things will
grow!&mdash;Jacqueline, child, aren't you going to sing to us?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline rose, left the window, and went to her harp,
Cary following her. She drew the harp toward her, then
raised her clear face. &quot;What shall I sing?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>Cary, struck by a note in her voice, glanced at her quickly
where she now sat, full in the light of the candles. She had
no colour ordinarily, but to-night the fine pale brown of her
face was tinged with rose. Her eyes were lustrous. As she
spoke she drew her hands across the strings, and there followed
a sound, faint, far, and sweet. Cary wondered. He
was not a vain man, nor over-sanguine, but he wondered, &quot;Is
the brightness for me?&quot; The colour came into his own cheek,
and a vigour touched him from head to heel. &quot;I don't care
what you sing!&quot; he said. &quot;Your songs are all the sweetest
ever written. Sing To Althea!&quot;</p>

<p>She sang. Rand watched her from the distance&mdash;the
hands and the white arm seen behind the gold strings, the
slender figure in a gown of filmy white, the warm, bare throat
pouring melody, the face that showed the soul within. All
the room watched her as she sang,&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;Stone walls do not a prison make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor iron bars a cage;</span><br />
Minds innocent and quiet take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That for a hermitage.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Through the window came the sound of rain, the smell of
wet box and of damask roses. Now and then the lightning
flashed, showing the garden and the white bloom of locust
trees.</p>

<p>
&quot;Minds innocent and quiet take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That for a hermitage.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Rand's heart ached with passionate longing, passionate
admiration. He thought that the voice to which he listened,
the voice that brooded and dreamed, for all that it was so
angel-sweet, would reach him past all the iron bars of time
or of eternity. He thought that when he came to die he
would wish to die listening to it. The voice sang to him
like an angel voice singing to Ishmael in the wilderness.</p>

<p>The song came to an end, but after a moment Jacqueline
sang again, sonorous and passionate words of a lover to his
mistress. It was not now the Cavalier hymning of constancy;
it was the Elizabethan breathing passion, and his cry was
the more potent.</p>

<p>
&quot;The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth ask a drink divine&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Blinding lightning, followed by a tremendous crash, startled
the singer from her harp and brought all in the room to their
feet. &quot;That struck!&quot; exclaimed the Colonel. &quot;Look out,
Fairfax, and see if 't was the stables! I hear the dogs howling.</p>

<p>&quot;'Twas the big pine by the gate, I think, sir,&quot; answered
Fairfax Cary, half in and half out of the window. &quot;Gad! it
is black!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You two cannot go home to-night,&quot; cried Colonel
Churchill, with satisfaction. &quot;And here's Cato with the decanters!
We might have a hand at Loo&mdash;eh, Unity? you
and Fairfax, Ned Hunter and I.&mdash;The card-table, Cato!&quot;</p>

<p>The four sat down, the card-table being so placed as to
quite divide Jacqueline and Ludwell Cary, at the harp, from
Major Edward's small table and Rand beside the sofa.
&quot;Edward!&quot; said the Colonel. His brother nodded, gathered
up his cards, and turned squarely to the entertainment of
the Republican. &quot;So, Mr. Rand, Mr. Monroe goes to
Spain! What the Devil is he going to do there? I wish that
your party, sir, would send Mr. Madison to Turkey and
Colonel Burr to the Barbary States! And what, may I ask,
are you going to do with the Mississippi now that you've
got it? It's a damned expensive business buying from
Buonaparte. Sixty millions for a <i>casus belli</i>! That's what
you have paid, and that's what you have acquired, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think you can be certain that it's a <i>casus belli</i>,
sir&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; retorted the Major, &quot;I may not know much, but
what I know, I know damned well! You cry peace, but
there'll be no peace. There'll be war, sir, war, war, war!&quot;</p>

<p>Unity glanced from the card-table. &quot;Sing again, Jacqueline,
do! Sing something peaceful,&quot; and Jacqueline, still
with a colour and with shining eyes, laughed, struck a sounding
chord, and in her noble contralto sang Scots wha hae
wi' Wallace bled.</p>

<h3>IN THE GARDEN</h3>


<p>In the forenoon of the next day Rand closed, for the
second time that morning, the door of the blue room
behind him, descended the stairs, and, passing through
the quiet house, went out into the flower garden. He was
going away that afternoon. Breakfast had been taken in his
own room, but afterward, with some dubitation, he had gone
downstairs. There Colonel Churchill met him heartily enough,
but presently business with his overseer had taken the Colonel
away. Rand found himself cornered by Major Edward and
drawn into a discussion of the impeachment of Judge Chase.
Rand could be moved to the blackest rage, but he had no
surface irritability of temper. To his antagonists his self-command
was often maddening. Major Churchill was as
disputatious as Arthur Lee, and an adept at a quarrel, but
the talk of the impeachment went tamely on. The Republican
would not fight at Fontenoy, and at last the Major
in a cold rage went away to the library&mdash;first, however,
watching the young man well on his way up the stairs and
toward the blue room. But Rand had not stayed in the blue
room. Restless and unhappy, the garden, viewed through
his window, invited him. He thought: &quot;I'll walk in it once
again; I'll find the summer-house where I sat beside her,&quot;
and he had acted upon his impulse. No one was about.
Within and without, the house seemed lapped in quiet. He
had been given to understand that the ladies were busy with
household matters, and he believed the Carys to have ridden
to Greenwood. That afternoon he would mount Selim,
and with Joab would go home to the house on the Three-Notched
Road.</p>

<p>After the rain of the night before the garden was cool and
sweet. The drops yet lay on the tangle of old-fashioned flowers,
on the box and honeysuckle and the broad leaves of the trees
where all the birds were singing. The gravel paths were
wet and shining. Rand walked slowly, here and there, between
the lines of box or under arching boughs, his mind
now trying to bring back the day when he had walked there
as a boy, now wondering with a wistful passion if he was to
leave Fontenoy without again seeing Jacqueline. He meant
to leave without one word that the world might not hear,
but he thought it hard that he must go without a touch of the
hand, without a &quot;From my heart I thank you for your kindness.
Good-bye, good-bye!&quot; That would not be much;
Fontenoy might give him that.</p>

<p>He reached an edge of the garden where a thread-like
stream trickled under a bank of periwinkle, phlox, and ivy,
and on through a little wood of cedars. The air was cool beneath
the trees, and Rand raised his forehead to the blowing
wind. The narrow pathway turned, and he came upon Deb
and Miranda seated upon the bare, red earth and playing with
flower dolls.</p>

<p>Deb had before her a parade of morning-glories, purple and
white, pink and blue, while Miranda sat in a ring of marigolds
and red columbines. Each was slowly swaying to and
fro, murmuring to herself, and manipulating with small,
darting fingers her rainbow throng of ladies. Rand, unseen,
watched the manoeuvres for a while, then coughed to let
them know he was there, and presently sat down upon a
root of cedar, and gave Deb his opinion of the flower people.
Children and he were always at their ease together.</p>

<p>&quot;Hollyhocks make the finest ladies,&quot; he announced
gravely. &quot;Little Miss Randolph puts snapdragon caps upon
them and gives them scarfs of ribbon grass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hollyhocks are not in bloom,&quot; said Deb. &quot;I use snapdragon
for caps, too.&mdash;Now she has on a red and gold cap.
This is a currant-leaf shawl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you name them?&quot; asked Rand, poising a columbine
upon the back of his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; answered Deb. &quot;All people have names.
That is Sapphira.&quot;</p>

<p>Miranda advanced a flourishing zinnia. &quot;Dishyer Miss
Keren-Happuch&mdash;Marse Job's daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>Deb regarded with shining eyes a pale blue morning-glory
with a little cap of white. &quot;This is Ruth&mdash;I love her!
The dark one is Hagar&mdash;she was dark, you know&mdash;and
those two are Rachel and Leah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ol' Miss Babylon!&quot; said Miranda succinctly, and put
forth a many-petalled red lady.</p>

<p>
&quot;Babylon, Babylon,<br />
Red an' sinnin' Babylon,<br />
Wash her han's in Jordan flood,<br />
Still she's sinnin' Babylon!&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;And, these three?&quot; asked Rand.</p>

<p>&quot;Faith, Hope, and Charity,&quot; answered Deb. &quot;Faith is
blue, Hope is pink, and that white one is Charity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She has a purple edge to her gown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Deb, &quot;and I am going to give her a crown,
'for the greatest of these is Charity!' That yellow lily
is the Shulamite. Miranda and I are going now to gather
more ladies.&quot; She looked at Rand with large child's eyes.
&quot;If you want somebody to talk to, my sister Jacqueline is
reading over there in the summer-house.&quot;</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Rand's face. His heart beat so loud
and fast that it stifled a voice within him. He did not even
hear the voice. He rose at once, turned, and took the path
that Deb's brown finger indicated. Had he been another man,
had he been, perhaps, Ludwell Cary, he might not have
gone. But he was Lewis Rand, the product and effect
of causes inherited and self-planted, and his passion, rising
suddenly, mastered him with a giant's grip. The only voice
that he heard was the giant's urgent cry, and he went without
protest.</p>

<p>The summer-house was a small, latticed place, overgrown
with the Seven Sisters rose, and set in a breast-high ring of
box opening here and there to the garden paths. A tulip tree
towered above the gravel space before it, and two steps led
to a floor chequered with light and shade, and to a rustic
chair and table. Jacqueline was not within the summer-house;
she sat in the doorway, upon the step. She was not reading.
She sat bowed together, her head upon her folded arms, a
figure still and tragic as a sphinx or sibyl. Rand's eyes
upon her roused her from her brooding. She lifted her
head, saw him, and her face, which had been drawn and
weary, became like the face of the young dawn.</p>

<p>As Rand crossed the space between them, she rose. He
saw the colour and the light, and he uttered only her name&mdash;&quot;Jacqueline,
Jacqueline!&quot; A moment, and they were in
each other's arms.</p>

<p>It was their golden hour. Neither thought of right or
wrong, of the conditions of life beyond their ring of box, of
wisdom or its contrary. It was as though they had met in
the great void of space, the marvel called man and the
wonder that is woman, each drawn to each over the endless
fields and through the immeasurable ages. Each saw the
other transfigured, and each wished for lover and companion
the other shining one.</p>

<p>They moved to the summer-house, and sat down upon the
step. About them was the Seven Sisters rose, and above
towered the tulip tree with a mockingbird singing in its
branches. The place was filled with the odour of the box.
To the end of their lives the smell of box brought back that
hour in the Fontenoy garden. The green walls hid from view
all without their little round. They had not heard step or
voice when suddenly, having strolled that way by accident,
there emerged from the winding path into the space about
the summer-house Colonel Churchill and Ludwell Cary.
There was a second's utter check, then, &quot;Sir!&quot; cried the
Colonel, in wrathful amazement.</p>

<p>The hands of the lovers fell apart. Rand rose, but Jacqueline
sat still, looking at her uncle with a paling cheek
and a faint line between her brows. The mockingbird sang
on, but the garden appeared to darken and grow cold. The
place seemed filled with difficult breathing. Then, before a
word was spoken, Cary turned, made a slight gesture with
his hand, and went away, disappearing between the lines
of box. The sound of his footsteps died in the direction of
the stream and the dark wood. Colonel Churchill moistened
his lips and spoke in a thick voice. &quot;You scoundrel! Was
it for this? You are a scoundrel, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have asked Miss Churchill to be my wife,&quot; said Rand,
with steadiness. &quot;She has consented. I love your niece,
sir, with all my heart, most truly, most dearly! I will ask
you to believe that it was not in my mind to speak to her to-day,
or to speak at all without your knowledge. I confess
the impropriety of my course. But we met unawares. It
is not to be helped. In no way is she to blame.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline rose, came to her uncle, and tried to take his
hand. He repulsed her. &quot;Is this true&mdash;what this man says?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;It is true. Oh, forgive
him!&quot;</p>

<p>The Colonel struck down her outstretched hands. &quot;I do
not believe you are Henry's child! Your mother was
a strange woman. You are not a Churchill. My God!
Henry's child talking of marrying this&mdash;this&mdash;this <i>gentleman</i>.
You are mad, or I am mad. Come away from him,
Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love him!&quot; cried Jacqueline. &quot;Oh, Uncle Dick, Uncle
Dick!&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I loved your niece, sir, when I was a boy,&quot; said Rand;
&quot;and I love her now that I am a man. I grant that I should
not have spoken to her to-day. I ask your pardon for what
may seem to you insult and thanklessness. But the thing
itself&mdash;is it so impossible? Why is it impossible that I
should wed where I love with all my heart?&quot; He broke a
piece of the box beside him and drew it through his hands,
then threw it away, and squarely faced the elder man. &quot;I
had my way to make in life. Well, I am making it fast.
I am making it faster, perhaps, than any other man in the
county, be he who he may! I am poor, but I am not so
poor as once I was, and I shall be richer yet. My want
of wealth is perhaps the least&mdash;why should I not say that
I know it is the least objection in your mind? My party?
Well, I shall become a leader of my party&mdash;and Republicans
are white as well as Federalists. It is not forgery or murder
to detest Pitt and George the Third, or to believe in France!
Is it so poor a thing to become a leader of a party that has
gained an empire, that has put an end to the Algerine piracy,
that has reduced the debt, that has made easier every man's
condition, and that stands for freedom of thought and deed
and advance of all knowledge? Party! Now and then, even
in Virginia, there is a marriage between the parties! My
family&mdash;or my lack of family? The fact that my father
rolled tobacco, and that now and then I broke a colt for
you?&quot; He smiled. &quot;Well, you must allow that I broke them
thoroughly&mdash;and Goldenrod was a very demon! Pshaw!
This is America, and once we had an ideal! For the
rest, though I do not go to church, I believe in God, and
though I have been called an unscrupulous lawyer, I take no
dirty money. Some say that I am a demagogue&mdash;I think
that they are wrong. I love your niece, sir, and more
than that&mdash;oh, much more than that!&mdash;she says that she
loves me. She says that she will share my life. If I make
not that sharing sweet to her, then indeed&mdash;But I will!
I will give her wealth and name and place, and a heart to
keep. Again I say that the fault of this meeting is all mine.
I humbly beg your pardon, Colonel Churchill, and I beg
your consent to my marriage with your niece&mdash;&quot;</p>

<b>YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL, SIR!</b>
<br /></div>

<p>The Colonel, who had heard so far in stormy silence, broke
in with, &quot;Marry my niece, sir! I had rather see my niece
dead and laid in her grave! Consent! I'd as soon consent
to her death or dishonour! Name and place! you neither
have them nor will have them!&quot; He turned upon Jacqueline.
&quot;I'll forgive you,&quot; he said, breathing heavily, &quot;there
in the library, when you have written and signed a letter to
Mr. Lewis Rand explaining that both he and you were mistaken
in your sentiments towards him. I'll forgive you
then, and I'll do my best to forget. But not else, Jacqueline,
not else on God's earth! That's sworn. As for you, sir, I
should think that your awakened sense of propriety might
suggest&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am going, sir,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;I return to the
house but to take my papers from the blue room. Joab
shall saddle my horse at once. You shall not anger me,
Colonel Churchill. I owe you too much. But your niece
has said that she will be my wife, and before God, she
shall be! And that's sworn, too, sir! I leave Fontenoy at
once, as is just, but I shall write to your niece. Part us you
cannot&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline,&quot; cried the Colonel, &quot;the sight of you there
beside that man is death to my old heart. You used to care&mdash;you
used to be a good child! I command you to leave
him; I command you to say good-bye to him now, at once
and forever! Tell him that you have been dreaming, but
that now you are awake. God knows that I think that I
am dreaming! Come, come, my little Jack!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you tell me that?&quot; asked Rand. &quot;Will you tell me
that, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; cried Jacqueline; &quot;I will tell you only the truth!
I love you&mdash;love you. Oh, my heart, my heart!&quot; She
turned from them both, sank down upon the summer-house
step, and lay with her forehead on her arm.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then, &quot;You see,&quot; said Rand,
not without gentleness, to the elder man.</p>

<p>Colonel Churchill leaned on his walking-stick, and his
breath came heavily. He wondered where Edward was&mdash;Edward
could always find words that would hurt. At last,
&quot;We part, Mr. Rand,&quot; he said, with dignity. &quot;In parting
I have but to say that your conduct has been such as I might
have expected, and that I conceive it to be my duty to protect
my misguided niece from the consequences of her folly.
I warn you neither to write to her nor to attempt to see her.
If she writes to you otherwise than as I shall dictate; if she
does not, when she has bethought herself, break with you
once and forever,&mdash;all's over between us! She is no niece
of mine. She is dead to me. I'll not speak to her, nor
willingly look upon her face again. I am a man of my word.
I have the honour, sir, to bid you a very good-day.&quot;
He drew out and looked at his ponderous watch. &quot;I shall
remain here with my niece for an hour. Perhaps in that time
she will awaken to her old truth, her old duty; and perhaps
you will require no more in which to gather your papers and
remove yourself from Fontenoy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not need the hour,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;I will be
gone presently. God knows, sir, I had not thought to go this
way.&quot; He turned from his host and bent for a moment over
Jacqueline. &quot;Good-bye,&quot; he said. &quot;Good-bye for a little
while! My heart is in your hands. I trust you for constancy.
Good-bye&mdash;good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>He was gone, moving rapidly toward the house. Colonel
Churchill drew a long sigh, wiped his face with his handkerchief,
and looked miserably up to the green boughs where
the mockingbird was singing. He wished again for Edward,
and he wished that Henry had not died. He believed in
Heaven, and he knew that Henry was there, but then the
thought came into his mind that Henry was here, too, in
the person of his child, prone on the summer-house steps.
Henry, also, had been a man of his word, had known his
own mind, and exercised his will. There, too, had been
the veil of sweetness! The Colonel sighed more heavily,
wished again impatiently for Edward, then marched to the
summer-house, and, sitting down, began to reason with
Henry's daughter.</p>

<p>Rand passed through the Fontenoy garden, in his heart a
pain that was triumph, an exaltation that was pain. Mounting
the porch steps, he found himself in the presence of Major
Edward playing Patience in the shade of the climbing rose.
The player started violently. &quot;I thought, sir,&quot; he said,
wheeling in his chair, &quot;I thought you yet in the blue room!
How the deuce!&mdash;I was on guard&mdash;&quot; the Major caught
himself. &quot;I was waiting to renew our very interesting discussion.
Where have you been?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been in the garden,&quot; said Rand. He hesitated,
standing by the table. There was a debate in his mind.
&quot;Should I speak to him, too? What is the use? He'll be no
kinder to her!&quot; He put out his hand uncertainly, and touched
one of the Major's cards. &quot;Is it an interesting game?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I find it so,&quot; answered the other dryly. &quot;Else I should
not play it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you like it? It is poor amusement to play
against yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like it, sir,&quot; snapped the Major, &quot;because I am assured
of playing against a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand let his hand fall from the table. &quot;Major Churchill,
I am leaving Fontenoy immediately. Perhaps I ought to
tell you what I have just told your brother: I love Miss
Churchill&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The Major rose from his chair. &quot;Have you spoken to her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I have asked her to marry me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said the Major huskily. &quot;May I ask what
Miss Churchill replied?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Churchill loves me,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;She will
do what I wish.&quot;</p>

<p>The silence grew painful. The words, acid and intolerable,
that Rand expected, did not seem to come easily to the Major's
dry lips. He looked small, thin, and frozen, grey and drawn
of face, as though the basilisk had confronted him. When
at last he spoke, it was in a curiously remote voice, lucid and
emotionless. &quot;Well, why not? All beliefs die&mdash;die and rot!
A vain show&mdash;and this, too, was of the charnel!&quot;</p>

<p>He turned upon Rand as if he would have struck him,
then drew back, made in the air an abrupt and threatening
gesture, and with a sound like a stifled cry passed the other
and entered the house. Rand heard him go down the hall,
and the closing of the library door.</p>

<p>The young man's heart was hot and sore. He went up
to the blue room, where he found Joab packing his portmanteau.
A few peremptory words sent the man to the
stables, while his master with rapid fingers collected and laid
together the papers with which the room was strewn. The
task finished, he threw himself for a moment into the great
chair and looked about him. He was capable of great attachment
to place, and he had loved this room. Now the mandarin
smiled obliquely on him, and the moon-clock ticked
the passing moments, the impossible blue roses flowered on
thornless stems, and the picture of Washington looked calmly
down from the opposite wall. He put his hand over his eyes,
and sat still, trying to calm the storm within him. There
were in his mind joy and gratitude, hurt pride and bitter
indignation, and a thousand whirling thoughts as to ways
and means, the overcoming of obstacles, and the building
of a palace fit to shelter his happiness. The clock struck,
and he started up. Not for much would he have overstayed
his hour.</p>

<p>He left the room and passed through the silent house,
mounted his horse, and rode away. A crowd had witnessed
his arrival there; only a few wondering servants were gathered
to see him depart. He gave them gold, but though they
thanked him, they thanked him with a difference. He felt
it, and that more keenly than he might have felt a greater
thing. Could he not even give largesse like one to the manner
born, or was it only that all the air was hostile? He rode
away. From the saddle he could have seen the distant summer-house,
but he forced himself not to look. The lawn fell
away behind him, and the trees hid the house. The gleam
of a white pillar kept with him for a while, but the driveway
bent, and that too was hidden. With Joab behind him on the
iron grey, he passed through the lower gate, and took the way
that led to Mrs. Jane Selden's on the Three-Notched Road.</p>

<h3>A MARRIAGE AT SAINT MARGARET'S</h3>


<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Unity. &quot;That is just what the Argus
says. 'On Thursday M. J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Buonaparte, the
younger brother of the First Consul, passed through
Annapolis with his bride&mdash;lately the lively and agreeable
Miss Elizabeth Patterson of Baltimore. M. Buonaparte's
Secretary and Physician followed in a chaise, and the valets
and <i>femmes-de-chambre</i> in a coach. The First Consul's
brother wore&mdash;' I protest I don't care what the First Consul's
brother wore! The Argus is not gallant. If you were
the First Consul's brother&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Argus should describe the bride's dress, not mine,&quot;
said Fairfax Cary. &quot;How lovely you would look, in that
gown you have on, in a curricle drawn by grey horses!
What is the stuff&mdash;roses and silver?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heigho!&quot; sighed Unity. &quot;'Tis a bridesmaid's gown.
I am out with men. I shall never wear a bride's gown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't jest&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jest! I never felt less like jesting! I laugh to keep from
crying. Here is the coach.&quot;</p>

<p>The great Fontenoy coach with the Churchill arms on
the panel drew up before the porch. It was drawn by four
horses, and driven by old Philip in a wig and nosegay. Mingo
was behind, and Phyllis's Jim and a little darky ran alongside
to open the door and let down the steps. &quot;All alone in
that!&quot; exclaimed Cary. &quot;I shall ride with you as far as the
old road to Greenwood. Don't say no! I'll hold your
flowers.&quot;</p>

<p>Unity looked down upon the roses in her arms. &quot;They
should all be white,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel as though I were
going to see them bury Jacqueline.&quot; Her voice broke, but she
bit her lip, forced back the tears, and tried to laugh. &quot;I'm
not. I'm going to her wedding&mdash;and people know their
own business best&mdash;and she may be as happy as the day
is long! He is fascinating,&mdash;he is dreadfully fascinating,&mdash;and
we have no right to say he is not good&mdash;and everybody
knows he is going to be great! Why shouldn't she be happy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; answered Cary. &quot;But I know she won't
be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You say that,&quot; cried Unity, turning on him, &quot;because
you are a Federalist! Well, women are neither Federalists
nor Republicans! They have no party and no soul of their
own! They are just what the person they love is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not so,&quot; said Cary.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know it's not so!&quot; agreed Miss Dandridge, with
impatience. &quot;It's just one of those things that are said!
But it remains that Jacqueline must be happy. I'll break
my heart if she's not! And as long as I live, I'll say that
Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward are to blame&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Dick is in the long field watching the threshing,
and Uncle Edward is in the library reading Swift! And
Aunt Nancy has ordered black scarfs to be put above the
pictures of Uncle Henry and of Great-Aunt Jacqueline that
Jacqueline's named for. Oh, oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Deb?&quot; asked the young man gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Deb is at Cousin Jane Selden's. She has been there
with Jacqueline a week&mdash;she and Miranda. Oh, I know&mdash;Uncle
Dick is a just man! He does what he thinks is the
just thing. Deb shall go visit her sister&mdash;every now and
then! And all that Uncle Henry left Jacqueline goes with
her&mdash;there are slaves and furniture and plate, and she
has money, too. The Rands don't usually marry so well&mdash;There!
I, too, am bitter! But Uncle Dick swears that he will
never see Jacqueline again&mdash;and all the Churchills keep
their word. Oh, family quarrels! Deb's coming back to
Fontenoy to-morrow&mdash;poor little chick! Aunt Nancy's got
to have those mourning scarfs taken away before she comes!&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Dandridge descended the porch steps to the waiting
coach. The younger Cary handed her in with great care of
her flowers and gauzy draperies, and great reluctance in
relinquishing her hand. &quot;I may come too?&quot; he asked,
&quot;just as far as the old Greenwood road? I hate to see you
go alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, yes!&quot; answered Miss Dandridge absently, and,
sinking into a corner, regarded through the window the July
morning. &quot;Those black scarfs hurt me,&quot; she said, and the
July morning grew misty. &quot;It's not death to marry the
man one loves!&quot;</p>

<p>The coach rolled down the drive to the gate, and out
upon the sunny road. The dust rose in clouds, whitening the
elder, the stickweed, and the blackberry bushes. The locusts
shrilled in the parching trees. The sky was cloudless and
intensely blue, marked only by the slow circling of a buzzard
far above the pine-tops. There were many pines, and the
heat drew out their fragrance, sharp and strong. The moss
that thatched the red banks was burned, and all the ferns
were shrivelling up. Everywhere butterflies fluttered, lizards
basked in the sun, and the stridulation of innumerable insects
vexed the ear. The way was long, and the coach lumbered
heavily through the July weather. &quot;I do not want to
talk,&quot; sighed Unity. &quot;My heart is too heavy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My own is not light,&quot; said Cary grimly. &quot;I am sorry
for my brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are all sorry for your brother,&quot; Unity answered gently,
and then would speak no more, but sat in her silver and roses,
looking out into the heat and light. The Greenwood road
was reached in silence. Cary put his head out of the window
and called to old Philip. The coach came slowly to a stop
before a five-barred gate. Mingo opened the door, and the
young man got out. &quot;Unless you think I might go with you
as far as the church&mdash;&quot; he suggested, with his hand on the
door. Unity shook her head. &quot;You can't do that, you know!
Besides, I am going first to Cousin Jane Selden's. Good-bye.
Oh, it is going to be a happy marriage&mdash;it must be
happy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is going to make it happy?&quot; demanded Cary
gloomily. &quot;It's a match against nature! When I think of
your cousin in that old whitewashed house, and every night
Gideon Rand's ghost making tobacco around it! I am glad
that Ludwell has gone to Richmond. He looks like a ghost
himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the world!&quot; sighed Unity. &quot;Tell Philip, please,
to drive on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll ride over to Fontenoy to-morrow,&quot; said Fairfax
Cary. &quot;'Twill do you good to talk it over.&quot;</p>

<p>The coach went heavily on through the dust of the Three-Notched
Road. The locusts shrilled, the pines gave no shade,
in the angle of the snake fences pokeberry and sumach
drooped their dusty leaves. The light air in the pine-tops
sounded like the murmur of a distant sea, too far off for
coolness. Unity sighed with the oppression of it all. The
flowers were withering in her lap. After a long hour the road
turned, discovering yellow wheat-fields and shady orchards,
the gleam of a shrunken stream and a brick house embowered
in wistaria. Around the horse-block and in the shade of a
great willow were standing a coach or two, a chaise, and several
saddle-horses. &quot;All of them Republican,&quot; commented
Unity.</p>

<p>At the door she was met by Cousin Jane Selden herself,
a thin and dark old lady with shrewd eyes and a determined
chin. &quot;I'm glad to see you, Unity, though I should have
been more glad to see Richard and Edward Churchill! 'Woe
to a stiff-necked generation!' says the Bible. Well! you
are fine enough, child, and I honour you for it! There are a
few people in the parlour&mdash;just those who go to church
with us. The clock has struck, and we'll start in half an
hour. Jacqueline is in her room, and when she doesn't look
like an angel she looks like her mother. You had best go
upstairs. Mammy Chloe dressed her.&quot;</p>

<p>Unity mounted the dark, polished stairs to an upper hall
where stood a tall clock and a spindle-legged table with a
vast jar of pot-pourri. A door opened, framing Jacqueline,
dressed in white, and wearing her mother's wedding veil.
&quot;I knew your step,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, Unity, you are good to
come!&quot;</p>

<p>In the bedroom they embraced. &quot;Wild horses couldn't
have kept me from coming!&quot; declared Unity with resolute
gaiety. &quot;Whichever married first, the other was to be bridesmaid!&mdash;we
arranged that somewhere in the dark ages! Oh,
Jacqueline, you are like a princess in a picture-book!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward?&quot; asked Jacqueline,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the Churchills are obstinate folk, as we all know!&quot;
answered Unity cheerfully. &quot;But I think time will help.
They can't go on hating forever. Uncle Dick is in the
fields, and Uncle Edward is in the library reading. There,
there, honey!&quot;</p>

<p>Mammy Chloe bore down upon them from the other end
of the room. &quot;Miss Unity, don' you mek my chile cry on
her weddin' mahnin'! Hit ain't lucky to cry befo' de ring's
on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not crying, Mammy,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;I wish that I
could cry. It is you, Unity, that are like a princess in your rose
and silver, with your dear red lips, and your dear black eyes!
Isn't she lovely, Mammy?&quot; She came close to her cousin
and pinned a small brooch in the misty folds above the white
bosom. &quot;This is my gift&mdash;it is mother's pearl brooch. Oh,
Unity, don't think too ill of me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Think ill!&quot; cried Unity, with spirit. &quot;I think only good
of you. I think you are doing perfectly right! I'll wear your
pearl always&mdash;you were always like a pearl to me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even pearls have a speck at heart,&quot; said Jacqueline.
&quot;And there's nothing perfectly right&mdash;or perfectly wrong.
But most things cannot be helped. Some day, perhaps, at
home&mdash;at Fontenoy&mdash;they will think of the time when
they were young&mdash;and in love.&quot; She turned and took up
her gloves from the dressing-table. &quot;I have had a letter from
Ludwell Cary,&quot; she said, then spoke over her shoulder with
sudden lire. &quot;He is the only one of all I know, the only one
of all my people, who has been generous enough, and just
enough, to praise the man I marry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Jacqueline!&quot; cried Unity, &quot;I will praise him to the
skies, if only he will make you happy! Does not every one
say that he has a great future? and surely he deserves all
credit for rising as he has done&mdash;and he is most able&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And <i>good</i>,&quot; said Jacqueline proudly. &quot;Don't praise him
any more, Unity.&quot; She put her hands on her cousin's shoulders
and kissed her lightly on the forehead. &quot;Now and then,
my dear, will you come to see me on the Three-Notched
Road? I shall have Deb one week out of six.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall come,&quot; answered Unity. &quot;Where is Deb?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is asleep. She cried herself to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chillern cry jes' fer nothin' at all,&quot; put in Mammy
Chloe. &quot;Don' you worry, honey! Miss Deb's all right. I's
gwine wake her now, an' wash her face, an' slip on her li'l
white dress. She's gwine be jes' ez peart an' ez happy! My
Lawd! Miss Deb jes' gainin' a brother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jacqueline,&quot; came Cousin Jane Selden's voice at the
door. &quot;It is almost time.&quot;</p>

<p>The coach of the day was an ark in capacity, and woman's
dress as sheathlike as a candle flame. Jacqueline, Unity,
Deb, Cousin Jane Selden, and a burly genial gentleman of
wide family connections and Republican tenets travelled
to church in the same vehicle and were not crowded. The
coach was Cousin Jane Selden's; the gentleman was of
some remote kinship, and had been Henry Churchill's
schoolmate, and he was going to give Jacqueline away. He
talked to Cousin Jane Selden about the possibilities of olive
culture, and he showed Deb a golden turnip of a watch with
jingling seals. Jacqueline and Unity sat in silence, Jacqueline's
arm around Deb. Behind their coach came the small
party gathered at Mrs. Selden's. The church was three
miles down the road. It was now afternoon, and the heat
lay like a veil upon wood and field and the foot-hills of the
Blue Ridge. The dust rose behind the carriage, then sank
upon and further whitened the milkweed and the love vine
and the papaw bushes. The blaze of light, the incessant
shrilling of the locusts, the shadeless pines, the drouth, the
long, dusty road&mdash;all made, thought Unity, a dry and fierce
monotony that seared the eyes and weighed upon the soul.
She wondered of what Jacqueline was thinking.</p>

<p>The Church of Saint Margaret looked forth with a small,
white-pillared face, from a grove of oaks. It had a flowery
churchyard, and around it a white paling, keeping in the
dead, and keeping out all roaming cattle. There was a
small cracked bell, and the swallows forever circled above
the eaves and in and out of the belfry. Without the yard,
beneath the oaks, were a horserack and a shed for carriages.
To-day there were horses at the rack and tied beneath
the trees; coaches, chaises, and curricles, not a few, beneath
the shed and scattered through the oak grove. The
church within was all rustle and colour. Saint Margaret's
had rarely seen such a gathering, or such a wholly amicable
one, for to-day all the pews were of one party. The wedding
was one to draw the curious, the resolutely Republican,
the kindred and friends of Jefferson,&mdash;who, it was known,
had sent the bride a valuable present and a long letter,&mdash;the
interested in Rand, the inimical, for party and other
reasons, to the Churchills and the Carys. The county knew
that Miss Churchill might have had Greenwood. The
knowledge added piquancy to the already piquant fact that
she had chosen the house on the Three-Notched Road.
Colonel Churchill and Major Edward, the county knew,
would not come to the wedding; neither, of course, would
the two Carys; neither, it appeared, would any other Federalist.
The rustling pews looked to all four corners and saw
only folk of one watchword. True, under the gallery was
to be seen Mr. Pincornet, fadedly gorgeous in an old green
velvet, but to this English stock Mr. Pincornet might give
what word he chose; he remained a French dancing master.
The rustling pews nodded and smiled to each other, waiting
to see Jacqueline Churchill come up the aisle in bridal lace.
Under the gallery, not far from Mr. Pincornet, sat Adam
Gaudylock, easy and tawny, dressed as usual in his fringed
hunting-frock, with his coonskin cap in his hand, and his
gun at his feet. Beside him sat Vinie Mocket, dressed in her
best. Vinie's eyes were downcast, and her hands clasped in
her lap. She wondered&mdash;poor little partridge!&mdash;why she was
there, why she had been so foolish as to let Mr Adam persuade
her into coming Vinie was afraid she was going to cry.
Yet not for worlds would she have left Saint Margaret's; she
wanted, with painful curiosity, to see the figure in bridal lace
She wondered where Tom was Tom was to have joined
Mr. Adam and herself an hour ago The bell began to
ring, and all the gathering rustled loudly. &quot;She's coming&mdash;she's
coming?&quot; whispered Vinie, and Adam, &quot;Why, of
course, of course, little partridge. Now don't you cry&mdash;you'll
be walking up Saint Margaret's aisle yourself some
day!&quot;</p>

<p>The bell ceased to ring. Lewis Rand came from the vestry
and stood beside the chancel rail. A sound at the door, a
universal turning as though the wind bent every flower in
a garden&mdash;and Jacqueline Churchill came up the aisle between
the coloured lines. Her hand was upon the arm of her
father's schoolmate; Unity and Deb followed her. Rand
met her at the altar, and the old clergyman who had baptized
her married them. It was over, from the &quot;Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here together,&quot; to the &quot;Until Death
shall them part!&quot; Lewis and Jacqueline Rand wrote their
names in the register, then turned to receive the congratulations
of those who crowded around them, to smile, and say
the expected thing. Rand stooped and kissed Deb, wrung Mrs.
Selden's hand, then held out his own to Unity with something
of appeal in his gesture and his eyes. Miss Dandridge
promptly laid her hand in his, and looked at him with her
frank and brilliant gaze. &quot;Now that we are cousins,&quot; she
said, &quot;I do not find you a monster at all. Make her happy,
and one day we'll all be friends.&quot; &quot;I will&mdash;I will!&quot; answered
Rand, with emotion, pressed her hand warmly, and was
claimed by others of his wedding guests. Jacqueline, too,
had clung at first to Unity and Deb and Cousin Jane Selden,
but now she also turned from the old life to the new, and
greeted with a smiling face the people of her husband's
party. Many, of course, she knew; only a difference of opinion
stood between them and the Churchills; but others were
strangers to her&mdash;strangers and curious. She felt it in the
touch of their hands, in the stare of their eyes, and her
heart was vaguely troubled. She saw her old dancing
master, tiptoeing on the edge of the throng, and her smile
brought Mr. Pincornet, his green velvet and powdered wig,
to her side. He put his hand to his heart and bowed as to
a princess.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! Mr. Pincornet,&quot; exclaimed Rand, &quot;I remember our
night at Monticello. Now I have a teacher who will be
with me always!&mdash;Jacqueline, I want you to speak to my
old friend, Adam Gaudylock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I know Mr. Gaudylock,&quot; answered Jacqueline, and
gave the hunter both her hands. &quot;We all know and admire
and want to be friends with Adam Gaudylock!&quot;</p>

<p>The picture that she made in her youth and beauty and
bridal raiment was a dazzling one. Adam looked at her so
fully and so long that she blushed a little. She could not
read the thought behind his blue eyes. &quot;You shall be my
Queen if you like,&quot; he said at last, and Jacqueline laughed,
thinking his speech the woodsman's attempt to say a pretty
thing.</p>

<p>Rand drew forward with determination a small brown
figure. &quot;Jacqueline, this is another good friend of mine&mdash;Miss
Lavinia Mocket, the sister of my law partner.&mdash;Vinie,
Vinie, you <i>are</i> shyer than a partridge! You shan't scuttle
away until you have spoken to my wife!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir,&quot; said Vinie, her hand in Jacqueline's. &quot;I
wish you well, ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand and Adam laughed. Jacqueline, with a sudden soft
kindliness for the small flushed face and startled eyes, bent
her flower-crowned head and kissed Vinie. &quot;Oh!&quot; breathed
Vinie. &quot;Yeth, yeth, Mith Jacqueline, I thertainly wish you
well!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's Tom?&quot; asked Rand. &quot;Tom should be here&mdash;&quot;
but Vinie had slipped from the ring about the bride. Adam
followed; Mr. Pincornet had already faded away. More important
folk claimed the attention of the newly wedded pair,
and Mr. Mocket had not yet appeared when at last the
gathering, bound for the wedding feast at Mrs. Selden's,
deserted the interior of the church and flowed out under
the portico and down the steps to the churchyard and the
coaches waiting in the road. Lewis and Jacqueline Rand
came down the path between the midsummer flowers. They
were at the gate when the sight and sound of a horse coming
at a gallop along the road drew from Rand an exclamation.
&quot;Tom Mocket&mdash;and his horse in a lather! There's news
of some kind&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>It was so evident, when the horse and rider came to a stop
before the church gate, that there was news of some kind,
that the wedding guests, gentle and simple, left all talk and
all employment to crowd the grassy space between the gate
and the road and to demand enlightenment. Mocket's horse
was spent, and Mocket's face was fiery red and eager. He
gasped, and wiped his face with a great flowered handkerchief.
&quot;What is it, man?&quot; cried a dozen voices.</p>

<p>Mocket rose in his stirrups and looked the assemblage
over. &quot;We're all Republicans&mdash;hip, hip, hurrah! Eh,
Lewis Rand, I've brought you a wedding gift! The stage
had just come in&mdash;I got the news at the Eagle! Hip,
hip&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tom,&quot; said Rand at his bridle rein, &quot;you've been
drinking. Steady, man. Now, what's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A wedding gift! a wedding gift!&quot; repeated Tom, taken
with his own conceit. &quot;And I never was soberer, gentlemen,
never 'pon honour! Hip, hip, hurrah! we're all good Republicans&mdash;but
you'll never guess the news!&mdash;The Creole's
dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; cried Rand.</p>

<p>There arose an uproar of excited voices. &quot;Yes, yes, it's
true!&quot; shouted Mocket. &quot;The stage brought it. He was
challenged by Aaron Burr. They met at a place named
Weehawken. Burr's first shot ended it.&mdash;Sandy'll trouble
us no more!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's rumour&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, it's gospel truth! There's a messenger from the
President, and letters from all quarters. He's dead, and
Burr's in hiding! Gad! We'll have a rouse at the Eagle
to-night! Blue lights for Assumption and Funding and the
Sedition Bill and Taxes and Standing Armies and the British
Alliance&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;Oh, Alexander, King of Macedon,<br />
Where is your namesake, Andy Hamilton?<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;In a hotter place, I hope, than Saint Kitts!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; said Rand. &quot;Don't be ranting like a Mohawk!
When a man's dead, it's time to let him rest.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned to the excited throng, and as he did so, he was
aware that Jacqueline was standing white and frozen, and
that Unity was trying to take her hand. He felt for her an
infinite tenderness, and he promised himself to give Tom
Mocket an old-time rating for at least one ill-advised expression.
Such wedding gifts were not for Jacqueline. But as
for the news&mdash;Rand felt his cheek grow hot and his eyes
glow. In all the history of the country this was the decade
in which political animosity, pure and simple, went its greatest
length. Each party thought of the struggle as a battlefield;
the Federalist strength was already broken, and now
if the leader was down, it was not in fighting and Republican
nature to restrain the wild cheer for the rout that must
follow. Rand was a fighter too, and a captain of fighters, and
the hundred whirling thoughts, the hundred chances, the
sense of victory, and the savage joy in a foe's defeat&mdash;all the
feeling that swelled his heart left him unabashed. But
he thought of Jacqueline, and he tried to choose his words.
There would be now, he knew, no wedding feast at Mrs.
Selden's. Randolphs, Carrs, Coles, Carters, Dabneys, Gordons,
Meriwethers, and Minors&mdash;all would wish to hurry
away. Plantation, office, or tavern, there would be letters
waiting, journals to read, men to meet, committees, clamour,
and debate. Of the ruder sort who had crowded to the
church, many were already on the point of departure,
mounting their horses, preparing for a race to the nearest
tavern and newspaper. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; exclaimed Rand, &quot;if
it's true news&mdash;if we have indeed to deplore General
Hamilton's death&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Deplore!'&quot; cried Mocket.</p>

<p>&quot;'Deplore!'&quot; echoed bluntly a Republican of prominence.
&quot;Don't let's be hypocrites, Mr. Rand. We'll leave
the Federalists to 'deplore'&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'll deplore him with pleasure!&quot; cried a third. &quot;It
won't hurt to drop a tear&mdash;but for all that it's the greatest
news since 1800!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hip, hip, hurrah!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weehawken! where's Weehawken? What's Burr in
hiding for? Can't a gentleman fight a duel? Let him come
down here, and we'll give him a triumph!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Deplore!'&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I chose my word badly,&quot; said Rand, with the good-nature
that always disarmed; &quot;I shall not weep over my enemy, I
only mean that I would not ignobly exult. Of course, sir,
it is great news&mdash;the very greatest! And all here will now
want the leisure of the day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell them, Lewis, that I'll excuse them,&quot; said Cousin
Jane Selden. &quot;We won't have a feast on the day of a funeral.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A little later, deep in the embrace of the old Selden coach,
husband and wife began their journey to the house on the
Three-Notched Road. In the minutes that followed the disposal
of their wedding guests it had been settled that they
would not return to Mrs. Selden's&mdash;it was best to go home
instead. Cousin Jane would take Deb; Unity must return
at once to Fontenoy. Hamilton and Edward Churchill had
served together on Washington's staff; of late years they had
seldom met, but the friendship remained. Unity knew, but
would not speak of it, that Uncle Edward had finished, only
the night before, a long letter to his old comrade-at-arms.
With the exception of Deb, all the little party were aware
that Jacqueline Rand's chances for forgiveness from her
uncles were measurably slighter for this day's tidings. She
seemed dazed, pale as her gown, but very quiet. She held
Deb in her arms, and kissed Unity and Cousin Jane Selden.
Her husband lifted her into the coach, wrung the others'
hands, and followed her. &quot;Good-bye, Lewis,&quot; said Mrs.
Selden at the door. &quot;I'll send a bowl of arrack to your men,
and I'll ride over to-morrow to see Jacqueline. Good-bye,
children, and God bless you both!&quot;</p>

<p>The coach and four took the dusty road. A turn, and Saint
Margaret's was hidden, another, and they were in a wood of
beech and maple. The heat of the day was broken, and a
wind was blowing. Rand took Jacqueline's hands, unclasped
and chafed them. &quot;So cold!&quot; he said. &quot;Why could we not
have heard this news to-morrow!&quot;</p>

<p>She shuddered strongly. &quot;The noble&mdash;the great&mdash;&quot; her
voice broke.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it so you think of him?&quot; he asked. &quot;Well&mdash;I, too,
will call him noble and great&mdash;to-day.</p>

<p>
&quot;No more for him the warmth of the bright sun;<br />
Nor blows upon his brow the wind of night!<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;He's gone&mdash;and we all shall go. But this is our wedding
day. Let us forget&mdash;let us forget all else but that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I grieve for the country,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He kissed her hand. &quot;Poor country! But her Sons die
every day. She is like Nature&mdash;she takes no heed. Let us,
too, forget!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, his poor wife&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Rand drew her to him. &quot;Will you mourn for me when I
am dead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered. &quot;We will die together.&mdash;Oh, Lewis,
Lewis, Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You promised that you would be happy,&quot; he said, and
kissed her. &quot;You promised you would not let Fontenoy and
the things of Fontenoy stand like a spectre between us.
Forget this, too. Everywhere there is dying. But it is our
wedding day&mdash;and I love you madly&mdash;and life and the
kingdoms of life lie before us! If you are not happy, how
can I be so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I am!&quot; she cried, and showed him a glowing face.
&quot;I am happier than the happiest!&quot;</p>

<p>The wood thinned into glades where the shadows of beech
and maple were beginning to be long upon the grass; then,
in the afternoon light, the coach entered open country, fields
of ox-eyed daisies, and tall pine trees standing singly.</p>

<p>&quot;I never came this far,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;I never saw
the house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is there where the smoke rises beyond that tobacco-field,&quot;
answered Rand. &quot;All the tobacco shall be changed
into wheat.&quot;</p>

<p>They came in sight of the house,&mdash;a long storey-and-a-half
structure of logs, with two small porches and a great
earthen chimney. Pine trees gave a scanty shade. House and
outbuildings and fencing had all been freshly whitewashed;
over the porches flourished morning-glory and Madeira vines,
and the little yard was bright with hollyhock and larkspur.
Jacqueline put her hand in her husband's. Rand bent and
kissed it with something in touch and manner formal and
chivalrous. &quot;It is a poor house for you. Very soon I shall
build you a better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want no better,&quot; she answered. &quot;Have you not lived
here all these years?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Adam called you Queen. You should have a palace&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I am Queen, then you must be a King. I think it is a
lovely palace. What is that tree by the gate&mdash;all feathery
pink?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A mimosa. Mr. Jefferson gave it to me. It is like you&mdash;it
does not belong on the Three-Notched Road. It should
stand in a palace garden with dim alleys, fountains, and
orange groves.&quot; He ended in a deeper tone, &quot;Why not?
One day we may plant a mimosa in such a garden, and smile
and say, 'Do you remember the tree&mdash;do you remember our
wedding day?' Who knows&mdash;who knows?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall stay in that palace all alone,&quot; said Jacqueline.
&quot;I like this one best.&quot;</p>

<p>The house stood back from the road in its clump of pines.
The coach stopped, and Rand and Jacqueline, descending,
crossed a strip of short grass tufted with fennel and velvet
mullein to the gate beneath the mimosa, entered the gay
little yard, and moved up the path to the larger of the two
porches. They were at home. On the porch to welcome
them they found the white man who worked on shares and
oversaw the farm, Joab and three other slaves of Rand's,
Mammy Chloe, Hannah, and the negro men who belonged
to Jacqueline. These gave a noisy greeting. Rand put
money into the hands of the slaves and sent them away
happy to the tumble-down quarter behind the house. The
white man took his leave, and Mammy Chloe and Hannah
retired to the kitchen, where supper was in preparation.
Rand and Jacqueline entered together the clean, bare
rooms.</p>

<p>Later, when Hannah's supper had been praised and barely
touched, the two came again to the porch, and presently,
hand in hand, moved down the steps, and over the dry summer
grass to the mimosa at the gate. Here they turned, and
in the gathering dusk looked back at the house, the sleeping
pines, and all the shadowy surrounding landscape.</p>

<p>&quot;Hear the frogs in the marsh!&quot; said Rand. &quot;They are
excited to-night. They know I have brought a princess
home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to the cow-bells,&quot; she said. &quot;I love to hear them,
faint and far like that. I love to think of you, a little barefoot
boy, bringing home the cows&mdash;and never, never dreaming
once of me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When could that have been?&quot; he asked. &quot;I have
always dreamed of you&mdash;even when 'twas pain to dream!&mdash;There
is the first whip-poor-will. <i>Whip-poor-will!</i> Once
it had the loneliest sound! The moon is growing brighter.
The dark has come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, Lewis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Darling, darling! Listen! that is the night horn. The
lights are out in the quarter. Do you hear the stream&mdash;our
stream&mdash;hurrying past the apple tree? It is hurrying to the
sea&mdash;the great sea. We've put out to sea together&mdash;you
and I, just you and I!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just you and I!&quot; she echoed. &quot;Oh, bliss to be together!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us go,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Let us go back to the
house,&quot; and with his arm around her, they moved up the
path between the flowers that had closed with the night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII" />CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE THREE-NOTCHED ROAD</h3>


<p>Lewis Rand and his wife dwelt that summer and
autumn in the house on the Three-Notched Road,
and were happy there. If the ghost of Gideon Rand
walked, the place, renovated, clean, bright, and homely
sweet, showed no consciousness of any influence of the dark.
Passers-by on the dusty road looked curiously at the gay
little yard and the feathery mimosa and the house behind
the pines. &quot;Lewis Rand lives there,&quot; they said, and made
their horses go more slowly.</p>

<p>The pines hid the porch where Jacqueline sat with her
work, or, hands about her knees, dreamed the hours away.
She was much alone, for after the first week Rand rode daily
to his office in Charlottesville. There was no reconciliation
with her people. All her things had been sent from Fontenoy.
Linen that had been her mother's lay with bags of lavender
in an old carved chest from Santo Domingo, and pieces of
slender, inlaid furniture stood here and there in the room they
called the parlour. Her candlesticks were upon the mantel,
and her harp made the room's chief ornament. Her fortune,
which was fair, had been formally made over to her and to
Rand. She was glad it was no less; had it been vastly greater,
she would only have thought, &quot;This will aid him the more.&quot;
The little place was very clean, very sweet, ordered, quiet,
and lovable. She was a trained housewife as well as the
princess of his story, and she made the man she loved believe
in Paradise. Each afternoon when he left the jargon and
wrangling of the courtroom his mind turned at once to his
home and its genius. All the way through the town, beckoning
him past the Eagle and past every other house or office
which had for him an open door, he saw Jacqueline waiting
beneath the mimosa at the gate, clad in white, her dark hair
piled high, about her throat a string of coral or of amber.
Out on the road, beneath the forest trees, in the radiance of
the evening, he rode with his head high and a smile within his
eyes. All the scheming, all the labour and strife of the day, fell
from him like rusty armour, and his spirit bathed itself in the
thought of that meeting. She did not always await him at the
gate; sometimes he found her half a mile from home, sitting
in the sunset light upon a stone beside the road. Then he dismounted,
kissed her, and they walked together back to their
nest in the tree of life. Supper-time would follow, with the
lighted candles and the fragrance from Hannah's kitchen,
and the little humorous talk with the old, fond, familiar
servants, and the deeper words between husband and wife of
things done or to be done; then quiet upon the porch, long
silences, broken sentences of deep content, while the glow
faded and the stars came out; then the candles again and
his books and papers, while she read or sewed beside him.
When his task was done she sang to him, and so drew on the
hour when they put out the lights and entered the quiet, spotless
chamber where the windows opened to the east.</p>

<p>Rand worked as he had not worked before. All the springs
were running, all the bitter wells were sweet; to breathe was
to draw in fulness of life, and all things were plastic to his
touch. Love became genius, and dreaming accomplishment.
In Albemarle, in Virginia, in the country at large, the time
was one of excitement, fevered labour, and no mean reward.
The election for President was drawing on. Undoubtedly
the Republicans and Jefferson would sweep the country, but
it behooved them to sweep it clean. The Federalist point of
view was as simple. &quot;Win! but we'll not make broad the
paths before you! Winning shall be difficult.&quot; The parties
worked like Trojans, and he who could speak spoke as often
as any leader of heroic times.</p>

<p>At court house and at tavern banquets, at meetings
here and meetings there, barbecues, dinners, races, militia
musters, gatherings at crossroads and in the open fields, by
daylight and by candlelight and by torchlight, Republican
doctrine was expounded, and Federalist doctrine made
answer. The clash of the brazen shields was loud. It was a
forensic people and a plastic time. He who could best express
his thought might well, if there were power in the thought,
impress it so deeply that it would become the hall-mark of his
age. His chance was good. Something more than fame of
a day shone and beckoned before every more than able man.
To stamp a movement of the human mind, to stamp an
age, to give the design to one gold coin from the mint of
Time,&mdash;what other prize worth striving for? The design?&mdash;one
thought of moderate Liberty and the head of Washington,
another thought of Liberty and the head of Jefferson,
another of License and a head like Danton's, another
of Empire and a conqueror's head.</p>

<p>In Albemarle, at all Republican gatherings the man most
in demand was Lewis Rand; and the surrounding counties
of Fluvanna, Amherst, Augusta, and Orange considered
themselves happy if he could be drawn to this or that mass
meeting. It was not easy to attract him. He never consciously
said to himself, &quot;Be chary of favours; they will be the more
prized&quot;; he said instead, &quot;I'll not waste an arrow where
there's no gold to hit.&quot; When he saw that it was worth his
while to go, he went, and sent an arrow full into the gold.
Amherst and Augusta, Fluvanna and Orange, broke into
applause and prophecy, while upon each return home Republican
Albemarle welcomed him with added rapture, and
Federalist Albemarle hurled another phrase into its already
comprehensive anathema. His reputation grew amain, both
in his native section and in the state at large. Before the
autumn his election to the House of Delegates, which in
April seemed so great a thing, began to assume the appearance
of a trifle in his fortunes. He would overtop that,
and how highly no man was prepared to say. Through all
the clashing of shields, through Republican attack and
Federalist resistance, through the clamour over Hamilton's
death, the denunciation and upholding of Burr, the impeachment
of Chase, the situation in Louisiana, the gravitation
towards France, and the check of England, the consciousness
of Pitt and the obsession of Napoleon,&mdash;through all
the commotion and fanfaronade of that summer Rand kept a
steady hand and eye, and sent his arrows into the gold. In the
law, as in politics, he was successful. A comprehensive knowledge
and an infinite painstaking, a grasp wide and firm, a
somewhat sombre eloquence, a personal magnetism virile and
compelling,&mdash;these and other attributes began to make his
name resound. He won his cases, until presently to say of
a man, &quot;He has Lewis Rand,&quot; was in effect to conclude the
matter. He had no Federalist clients; that rift widened
and deepened. Federalist Albemarle meant the Churchills
and the Carys, their kinsmen, connections, and friends. The
gulf seemed fixed.</p>

<p>Jacqueline, keeping at home in the house on the Three-Notched
Road, saw very few from out her old life. Those
who had been her girlhood friends kept aloof. If their defection
pained her, she gave no sign&mdash;she had something of
her father's pride. Among the Republican gentry she was
of course made much of, and she saw something of the plainer
sort of her husband's friends. Tom Mocket came occasionally
on business with Rand, and once he brought Vinie with him.
Jacqueline liked the sandy-haired and freckled scamp, and
made friends with Vinie. In the first July days Adam Gaudylock
often sat upon her porch, but now for weeks he had
been wandering in the West. Once or twice Mr. Pincornet,
straying that way, had delicately looked his pity for a lovely
woman in a desert waste. Cousin Jane Selden remained her
good neighbour and kind friend, and once Mr. Ned Hunter
brought a message from Unity. Her old minister came to see
her, and Dr. Gilmer, when illness called him in that direction,
always drew rein at her gate. Ludwell Cary was out of the
county, and Fairfax Cary never rode that way. Unity came
whenever it was possible, and thrice, between July and October,
Deb and Miranda and a horsehair trunk arrived for a
blissful week. To Deb they were unshadowed days. The
log house, the pine wood and singing stream, an owl that
hooted each night, a row of tiger lilies and a thicket of
blackberries, Jacqueline to tell her stories, Mammy Chloe and
Hannah, the new brother who came home every evening riding
a great bay horse and kissing Jacqueline beneath the
mimosa tree, the brother who showed her twenty unguessed
treasures and gave her the Arabian Nights,&mdash;Deb thought
the week on the Three-Notched Road a piece out of the book,
and wept when she must go back to Fontenoy.</p>

<p>But Colonel Churchill and Major Edward never came,
never wrote, never sent messages to Jacqueline, never, she
forced Unity to tell her, mentioned her name or would hear it
mentioned at Fontenoy. Only Aunt Nancy, lying always in
the chamber, her key-basket beside her on the white counterpane,
talked of her when she chose. &quot;But she talks as though
you were dead,&quot; acknowledged Unity; then, &quot;Oh, Jacqueline,
it must all come right some day! And as for him, he's
talked of more and more,&mdash;everywhere one goes, one hears
his name! He's head and front of his party here. Oh, what
a party! Mrs. Adams writes that at Washington they eat
soup with their fingers and still think <i>&Ccedil;a Ira</i> the latest
song! Cannot you convert him? They say the Mammoth's
jealous, and that your husband and Colonel Burr correspond
in cipher. Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;I shall not try to convert
him. I would have a man loyal to his beliefs&mdash;so would
you, Unity! Suppose yourself of another party&mdash;would you
change Fairfax Cary? You would wish him to stay always
the Federalist that he is! So with me. I love my great Republican.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you,&quot; said Unity. &quot;Kiss me. Now, when do you
go to Richmond?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Next month. Oh, Unity, if Uncle Dick and Uncle
Edward would but make friends before we go!&quot;</p>

<p>Unity, stopping for an hour at Cousin Jane Selden's, remarked
to that lady, &quot;Ah, she is happy! She does not know
and she does not care what is said of Lewis Rand. They say
dreadful things. The last Gazette&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She doesn't hear a Federalist upon the subject,&quot; replied
Cousin Jane. &quot;The last Gazette! Pooh! who believes what
a Federalist paper says of a Republican, or a Republican
paper says of a Federalist? Most men and all newspapers
are liars.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It says that he is a Buonaparte ready to break the
shell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buonaparte's a great man, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that the Mammoth's alarmed&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like the hen that hatched the eaglet&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that Lewis Rand's no more Republican at heart
than he is Federalist. He's just for Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm-m-m!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that his name's known as far west as the Mississippi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no law against a man's name spreading. It's
what every man strives for. One succeeds, and the birds that
carried the news are indignant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that he's an Atheist.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis Rand's no saint, child, but he's no fool either.
You'll be telling me next that he mistreats his wife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, he does not do that!&quot; exclaimed Unity. &quot;She's deep
in love. He can't be so very bad, can he, Cousin Jane?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's not a monster, child: he's just a man.&mdash;And now,
Unity, I am making damson preserves to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Unity, rising. &quot;But they believe these
things at Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do they believe them at Greenwood?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. Ludwell Cary is still away&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When are you going to marry his brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I don't know that I am going to marry his brother
at all,&quot; answered Unity, her foot upon the coach step. &quot;Good-bye,
Cousin Jane. I wish I could make pot-pourri like
yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must know what spices to use, and when to gather
the roses,&quot; said Cousin Jane. &quot;Good-bye, child! You read
too many romances, but you're a loyal soul and one of
your gowns is prettier than another. Don't you believe all
the world says of Lewis Rand. It's mighty prone to make
mistakes. The man's just a sinner like the rest of us.&quot;</p>

<p>At Fontenoy, that September afternoon, Fairfax Cary,
riding over from Greenwood, found Miss Dandridge seated
upon the steps which ran down to the garden from the glass
doors of the library. Her chin was in her hands, and her
black eyes were suspiciously bright. &quot;You were crying,&quot;
exclaimed the younger Cary. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been reading about the Capulets and the Montagues.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not one to cry for the dead,&quot; said the young
man. &quot;Tell me truly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I'm crying for the living. I've been talking to the
Capulets. I've been giving Uncle Edward a piece of my
mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which he would not take?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just so. Oh, it was a battle royal! But I lost&mdash;I always
lose. He is sitting there in triumphant misery, reading Swift.
I brought my defeat out here. Now and then I am glad I
am a woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad all the time,&quot; said Fairfax Cary. &quot;Don't dwell
on lost battles. Unity, when are you going to let me fight
all your battles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; answered Miss Dandridge promptly.
&quot;I don't even know that I would like to have all my battles
fought for me. I'm not lazy, and I believe my ancestors
fought their own. Besides&mdash;would you fight this one?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause; then, &quot;Do you love your cousin so?&quot;
asked the young man.</p>

<p>&quot;Love Jacqueline? Jacqueline is like my sister. If she
is not happy, then neither am I!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she is happy. She loved Lewis Rand, and she married
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes. But a woman may marry her lover and yet
be unhappy. If he takes her to a strange country, she may
perish of homesickness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has he taken her to a strange country?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; cried Unity, with fire. &quot;How can it but be a strange
country?&quot; Her eyes filled with tears. &quot;Why, why did she
not love your brother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; said the younger Cary grimly, &quot;is what I do not
profess to understand. And I would fight for your cousin,
but I will not fight for Lewis Rand. My brother's enemies
are mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You see. You wouldn't fight this battle, after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would Miss Dandridge wish me to?&quot;</p>

<p>Unity regarded the sunset beyond the snowball bushes.
&quot;No,&quot; she said at last, with a sigh and a shake of her head,
&quot;no, I wouldn't. I had rather a man behaved like a man
than like an angel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are the angel. At least your cousin will not live
much longer in that log house, with the pines and the tobacco
and the ghost of old Gideon. Lewis Rand has bought Roselands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Roselands!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You knew it was for sale. Well, he's bought it. I had the
news from the agent. It's to be put in order this winter, and
in the spring Rand will come back from Richmond and take
possession. It is strange to think of a Rand owning Roselands!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Churchill will own it, too! It will have been bought
with Churchill money. I am so glad! It can be made a lovely
place. Jacqueline will have the garden and the old, long drawing-room!
Deb and I can go there easily. It is all more fitting&mdash;I
am glad!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is too near Greenwood,&quot; said the other gloomily. &quot;I
think that Ludwell will stay in Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; said Unity softly and brightly. &quot;I wish, I
wish&mdash;but what's the use in wishing? There! the sun has
gone, and it is growing cold. I have sat here until I'm no
longer angry with Uncle Edward. Poor man! to be reading
Swift all this time!&mdash;I'll walk with you to the front
porch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought,&quot; ventured the young man, &quot;I thought that
perhaps you might ask me to stay to supper. It's so lonely
at Greenwood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You stayed to supper last night,&quot; said Miss Dandridge
pensively, &quot;and you were here to dinner the day before,
and you rode over the preceding afternoon, and the morning
before that you read me Vathek.&mdash;Oh, stay to supper by
all means!&quot;</p>

<p>Cary picked up her scarf and handed her down the steps to
the path that was beginning to be strewn with autumn leaves.
&quot;Miss Dandridge&mdash;Unity&mdash;it has been fourteen mortal
days since I last asked you to marry me! You said I might
ask you once a month&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't,&quot; said Unity serenely. &quot;I said once a month was
too often.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you ever going to love me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, some day, yes!&quot; replied Miss Dandridge. &quot;When
you've swum the Hellespont like Leander, or picked a glove
out of the lion's den like the French knight, or battered down
a haunted castle like Rinaldo, or taken the ring from a murderer's
hand like Onofrio, or set free the Magician's daughter
like Julio&mdash;perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I must cast about to win my spurs!&quot; said the younger
Cary. &quot;In the mean time I'll ask you again, come fourteen
days.&quot;</p>

<p>Late September passed into October. The nuts ripened,
the forests grew yellow and red, and the corn was stacked in
the long, sere fields, above which, each morning, lay a white
mist. Goldenrod and farewell-summer faded, but sumach
and alder-berry still held the fence corners. The air was
fragrant with wood smoke; all sound was softened, thin, and
far away. A frost fell and the persimmons grew red gold. The
song birds had gone south, but there were creatures enough
left in the trees. Sometimes, through the thin forest, in the
blue distance, deer were seen; bears began to approach the
corn-cribs, and in the unbroken wilderness wolves were heard
at night. Early and late the air struck cold, but each midday
was a halcyon time. In the last of October, on a still and
coloured morning, Rand and Jacqueline, having shaken hands
with the overseer and the slaves they were leaving, caressed
the dogs, and said good-bye to the cat, quitted the house on
the Three-Notched Road. At the gate they turned, and, standing
beneath the mimosa, looked back across the yard where
the flowers had been touched by the frost, to the house and
the sombre pines. They stood in silence. Jacqueline thought
of the first evening beneath the mimosa, of the July dusk, and
the cry of the whip-poor-will. Rand thought, suddenly and
inconsequently, of his father and mother, standing here at the
gate as he had often seen them stand. There was no mimosa
then.&mdash;Jacqueline turned, caught his hand, and pressed it to
her lips. He strained her in his arms and kissed her, and they
entered the chaise which was to carry them to Richmond.
Before them lay a hundred miles of sunny road, three days'
companionship in the blue, autumnal weather. A few moments,
and the house, the pines, and the hurrying stream
were lost to view. &quot;A long good-bye!&quot; said Rand. &quot;In the
spring we'll enter Roselands!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You value it more than I,&quot; answered Jacqueline. &quot;I
loved the house behind us. Loved! I am speaking as though
it were a thing of the long past. Farewells are always sad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I value it for you,&quot; said Rand. &quot;Have I not chafed, ever
since July, to see you in so poor a place? Roselands is not
ideal, but it is a fairer nest for my bird than that we've
left!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed. &quot;'Roselands is not ideal!' I think
Roselands quite grand enough! Oh, Lewis, Lewis, how high
you build! Take care of the upper winds!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll build firmly,&quot; he answered. &quot;The winds may do
their worst. Here is the old road to Greenwood. Now that
the trees are bare, you can see the house.&quot;</p>

<p>They drove all day by field and woodland. At noon they
paused for luncheon beside a bubbling spring in a dell strewn
with red leaves, then drove on through the haze of afternoon.
There were few leaves left upon the boughs. In the fields that
they passed the stacked corn had the seeming of silent encampments,
deserted tents of a vanished army, russet and
empty wigwams drawn against a deep blue sky. Now and
then, in the darker woods, there was a scurry of partridges,
the red gleam of a fox, or a vision of antlers, and once a wild
turkey, bronze and stately, crossed the road before the
chaise. When they passed a smithy or a mill, the clink of iron,
the rush of water, came to them faintly in the smoky air.
That night they slept at the house of a wealthy planter and
good Republican, where, after supper, all sat around a great
fire, the children on footstools between the elders, and stories
were told of hunting, of Indian warfare, and of Tarleton's
raid. At ten they made a hall and danced for an hour to a
negro's fiddling, then a bowl of punch was brought and the
bedroom candles lighted.</p>

<p>In the morning Rand and Jacqueline went on towards
Richmond, and at sunset they found themselves before a
country tavern, not over clean or comfortable, but famous for
good company. The centre of a large neighbourhood, it had
been that day the scene of some Republican anniversary, and
a number of gentlemen, sober and otherwise, had remained
for supper and a ride home through the frosty moonlight.
Among them were several lawyers of note, and a writer and
thinker whose opinion Rand valued. Besides all these there
were at the inn a group of small farmers, a party of boatmen
from the James, the local schoolmaster and the parson, a
Scotch merchant or two, and the usual idle that a tavern
draws. All were Republicans, and all knew their party's men.
Rand descended from the chaise amidst a buzz of recognition,
and after supper came a demand that he should speak from
the tavern porch to an increasing crowd. He did not refuse.
To his iron frame the fatigue of the day was as naught,
and there were men in the throng whom he was willing
to move. It came to him suddenly, also, that Jacqueline
had never heard him speak. Well, he would speak to her
to-night.</p>

<p>His was an universal mind. On occasion he could stoop
to praise one party and vituperate another, but that was his
tongue serving his worldly interest. The man himself dealt
with humanity, wherever found and in whatever time, however
differentiated, however allied, with its ancestry of the
brute and its destiny of the spirit; with the root of the tree
and the far-off flower and every intermediate development
of stem and leaf; with the soil that sustained the marvellous
growth, and with the unknown Gardener who for an unfathomable
purpose had set the inexplicable seed in an unthinkable
universe. From the ephemera to the star he accepted
and conjectured, and while he often thought ill of the living,
he had never yet thought ill of life. He had long been allied
with a thinker who, with a low estimate of at least so much
of human nature as ran counter to his purposes, yet believed
with devoutness in the perfectibility of his species,
and had of the future a large, calm, and noble vision. If
Lewis Rand had not Jefferson's equanimity, his sane and
wise belief in the satisfying power of common daylight, common
pleasures, all the common relations of daily life; if some
strangeness in his nature thrilled to the meteor's flight, craved
the exotic, responded to clashing and barbaric music, yet the
two preached the same doctrine. He believed in the doctrine,
though he also believed that great men are not mastered
by doctrine. They made doctrine their servant, their
useful slave of the lamp. He knew&mdash;none better&mdash;that the
genie might turn and rend; that there was always one last,
one fatal thing that must not be asked. But his mind was
supple, and he thought that he could fence with the genie.
Usually, when he spoke, he believed all that he said, believed
it with all the strength of his reason, and yet&mdash;he
saw the kingdoms of the world. To-night, in the autumn
air, pure and cold beneath the autumn stars, with the feeling
and the fragrance of the forest day about him, in sympathy
with his audience, and conscious in every fibre of the
presence of the woman whom he loved, he saw no other
kingdom than that of high and tranquil thought.</p>

<p>Jacqueline, seated at her open window, listened for the
first time to any public utterance of her husband's. He was
not a man who often spoke of the processes of his thought.
Sometimes, in the house on the Three-Notched Road, he told
her, briefly, his conclusions on such and such a matter, but
he rarely described the road by which he travelled. She knew
the conservative, the British, the Federal side of most questions.
That was the cleared country, familiar, safe, and smiling;
her husband's side was the strange forest which she had
entered and must travel through. She was yet afraid of the
forest, of its lights and its shadows, the rough places and the
smooth, the stir of its air and the possibility of wild beasts.
To her it was night-time there, and where the ground seemed
fair and the light to play, she thought of the marsh and
the will-o'-the-wisp. She could not but be loyal to the old,
trodden ways. She had married Lewis Rand, not his party or
its principles. But to-night, as she listened, the light seemed
to grow until it was dawn in the forest, and the air to blow so
cold, strong, and pure that she thought of mountain peaks and
of the ocean which she had never seen. She was no longer
afraid of the country in which she found herself.</p>

<p>Rand, standing in the red torchlight above the attentive
crowd, preached a high doctrine, preached it austerely,
boldly, and well. He did not speak to-night of the hundred
party words, the flaunting banners, systems, expedients, and
policies fit for this turn of the spiral, born to be disavowed,
discarded, and thrown down by a higher, freer whorl; but he
gave his voice for the larger Republicanism, for the undying
battle-cry, and the ever-streaming battle-flag. He had no less
a text than the Liberty and Happiness of the human race, and
he made no straying from the subject.</p>

<p>Freedom! Happiness! What is freedom? What is happiness?
Freedom is the maximum of self-government finally
becoming automatic, and the minimum of government from
without finally reduced to the vanishing-point. Happiness
is the ultimate bourne, the Olympian goal, the intense and
burning star towards which we travel. Does not its light even
now fall upon us? even now we are palely happy. And how
shall we know the road? and what if, in the night-time, we
turn irremediably aside? How are they to be attained, true
Liberty and true Happiness? Learn! Light the lamp, and
the shadows will flee.&mdash;Self-government. Teach thyself
temperance, foresight, and wise memory of the past. Thou
thyself, in thine own body, art a community. See, then, that
thy communal life is clean, that thy will is in right operation,
and thy minds divide thee not to disaster. Thy very ego, is
it not but thy president, the voice of all thy members, representative
of all that thy race has made thee to be, effect of
ten million causes, and cause of effects thou canst not see?
Let thy ego strengthen itself, deal justly, rule wisely, that thy
state fall not behind in this world-progress and be lost out
of time and out of mind, in a night without a dawn. There
have been such things: over against immortal gain there
lies immortal loss. Work, then, while it is day, for if thou
work not, the night will make no tarrying. Know thyself, and,
knowing, rule that strange world of thine. Were it not a
doom, were it not a frightful doom, that it should come to
rule thee? ... Government from without! Government of
to-day, Government abroad as we see it in every journal,
in every letter that we open&mdash;how heavy, how heavy is the
ball and chain the nations wear! If we alone in this land go
free, if for four golden years we have moved with lightness,
look to it lest a gaoler come! Government! What is the ideal
government? It is a man of business, worthy and esteemed,
administering his client's affairs with thoroughness, economy,
and honour. It is a wise judge, holding the balances with a
steadfast hand, sitting there clothed reverently, to judge
uprightly and to do no more. It is a skilled council, a
picked band, an honourable Legion, chosen of the multitude,
to determine the line of march for an advancing civilization;
to make such laws as are according to reason and necessity
and to make none that are not, and to provide for the keeping
of the law that is made. The careful man of affairs, the
upright judge, the honest maker of honest laws must needs
present an account for maintenance and for that expenditure
which shall give offence neither to generosity nor to justice;
and the account must be paid, yea, and ungrudgingly! Let
us pay, then, each man according to his ability, the tax that
is right and fitting; and let us, moreover, give due honour
to the vanguard of the people. It is there that the great
flag waves with all the blazonry of the race. But we want
no substituted banner, no private ensign, no conqueror's
flapping eagles! Government! Honour the instrument by
which we rule ourselves; but worship not a mechanical
device, and call not a means an end! Admirable means,
but oh, the sorry end! Therefore we'll have no usurping
Pr&aelig;torian, no juggling sophist, no bailiff extravagant and
unjust, no spendthrift squandering on idleness that which
would pay just debts! A ruler! There's no halo about a
ruler's head. The people&mdash;the people are the sacred thing,
for they are the seed whence the future is to spring. He who
betrays his trust, which is to guard the seed,&mdash;what is that
man&mdash;Emperor or President, Louis or George, Pharaoh or
C&aelig;sar&mdash;but a traitor and a breaker of the Law? He may
die by the axe, or he may die in a purple robe of a surfeit, but
he dies! The people live on, and his memory pays. He has
been a tyrant and a pygmy, and the ages hold him in contempt....
War! There are righteous wars, and righteous
men die in them, but the righteous man does not love war.
Conquest! Conquest of ignorance, superstition, and indolence,
conquest of the waste and void, of the forces of earth, air, and
water, and of the dying beast within us, but no other conquest!
We attained Louisiana by fair trade, for the benefit of
unborn generations. Standing armies! We want them not.
Navies! The sea is the mother of life; why call her that of
death? Her highways are for merchant ships, for argosies
carrying corn and oil, bearing travellers and the written
thought of man; for voyages of discovery and happy intercourse,
and all rich exchange from strand to strand. Why
stain the ocean red? Is it not fairer when 'tis blue? Guard
coast-line and commerce, but we need no Armada for
that. Make no quarrels and enter none; so we shall be the
exemplar of the nations.... Free Trade. We are citizens
and merchants of the world. No man or woman but lives by
trade and barter. Long ago there was a marriage between the
house of Give and the house of Take, and their child is Civilization.
Sultan or Czar may say, &quot;Buy here, sell there, and at
this price. You are my slave. Obey!&quot; But who, in this century
and this land, shall say that to me&mdash;or to you? Are we
free men? Then let us walk as such through the marts of the
earth. &quot;Trade where you will,&quot; saith Nature. &quot;It was so I
brought the tree to the barren isle, and scattered the life of
the seas.&quot; Authority of law! Respect the law, and to that
end let us have laws that are respectable. Laws are made
to be kept, else we live in a house of chicane. But there is
a danger that decrees may thicken until they form a dungeon
grate for Freedom, until, like Gulliver, she is held down to
earth by every several hair. Few laws and just, and those not
lightly broken. The Contract between the States&mdash;let it be
kept. It was pledged in good faith&mdash;the cup went around
among equals. There is no more solemn covenant; we shall
prosper but as we maintain it. Is it not for the welfare and
the grandeur of the whole that each part should have its
healthful life? The whole exists but by the glow within its
parts. Shall we become dead members of a sickly soul? God
forbid! but sister planets revolving in their orbits about one
central Idea, which is Freedom by Co&ouml;peration. To each her
own life, varied, rich, complete, and her communal life, large
with service rendered and received! Each bound to other
and to that central Thought by primal law, but each a sovereign
orb, grave mistress of her own affairs! Slavery! Ay, I
will give you that though you want it not! Slavery is abominable.
There is a tree that grows in the tropics which they
call the upas tree. All who lie in the shadow of its branches
fall asleep, and die sleeping. To-day we lie under the upas
tree&mdash;would that we were awake! I have heard that&mdash;in
the tropics&mdash;the sons sometimes hew down that which the
fathers have planted. I would that it were so in Virginia!
Freedom of thought, of speech, and of pen. I will away with
this cope of lead, this Ancient Authority, which is too often
an Ancient Iniquity. Did it not have once a minority? was
it not once a New Thought? Is not a man's thought to-day
as potent, holy, and near the right as was his great-grandfather's
thought which was born in a like manner, of the brain
of a man, in a modern time? I will think freely and according
to reason. When it seems wise to tell my mind I will
speak; and with judgment I will write down my thought;
and fear no man's censure. Knowledge! I was a poor boy,
and I strove for learning, strove hard, and found it worth the
striving. I know the hunger, and I know the rage when one
asks for knowledge and asks in vain. Is it not a shameful
thing that happy men, lodged warm and clear in the Interpreter's
house, should hear the groping in the dark without,
know that their fellows are searching, in pain and with
shortness of breath, for the key which let the fortunate in,
and make no stir to aid those luckless ones? Give of your
abundance, or your abundance will decay in your hands and
turn to that which shall cause you shuddering!</p>

<p>His words went on, magnetic as the man. He spoke for an
hour, coming at the last to a consideration of those particular
questions which hung in Virginian air. He dealt with these
ably, and he subtly conciliated those of his audience who
might differ with him. None could have called him flatterer,
but when he ceased to speak his hearers, feeling for themselves
a higher esteem, had for him a reflex glow. It was what
he could always count upon, and it furthered his fortunes.
Now they crowded about him, and it was late before, pleading
the fatigue of his journey, he could escape from their friendly
importunity. At last, it being towards midnight and the
moon riding high, the neighbouring planters and their guests
got to saddle and, after many and pressing offers of hospitality
to Rand and his wife, galloped off to home and bed. The
commonalty and the hangers-on faded too into the darkness,
and the folk who were sleeping at the inn took their candles
and said good-night. All was suddenly quiet,&mdash;a moonlit
crossroads in Virginia, tranquil as the shaven fields and the
endless columns of the pine.</p>

<p>Upstairs, in the low &quot;best room,&quot; Rand found his wife still
seated by the open window, her folded arms upon the sill, her
eyes raised to the stars that shone despite the moon. He
crossed to her and closed the window. &quot;The night is cold.
Dearest, have you been sitting here all this time?&quot;</p>

<p>She rose, turning upon him a radiant face. &quot;All this time.
I was not cold. I was warm. I am so happy that I'm frightened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you like it?&quot; he asked. &quot;I hoped that you would.
I thought of you&mdash;my star, my happiness!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I used to wonder,&quot; she said; &quot;when they would come home
to Fontenoy and say, 'Lewis Rand spoke to-day,' I used to
wonder if I should ever hear you speak! And when they
blamed you I said to my aching heart, 'They need not tell
me! He's not ambitious, self-seeking, a leveller, a demagogue
and Jacobin!-he is the man I met beneath the apple tree!'
And I was right&mdash;I was right!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I that man?&quot; he asked. &quot;I will try to be, Jacqueline.
Leveller, demagogue, and Jacobin I am not; but for the
rest, who knows&mdash;who knows? Men are cloudy worlds&mdash;and
I dream sometimes of a Pursuer.&quot;</p>

<p>The next morning the skies had changed, and Rand and
Jacqueline fared forward through a sodden, grey, and windy
day. The rain had ceased to fall when at twilight they came
into Richmond by the Broad Street Road. Lights gleamed
from the wet houses; high overhead grey clouds were parting,
and in the west was a line of red. The wind was high, and
the sycamores with which the town abounded rocked their
speckled arms. The river was swollen and rolled hoarsely
over the rocks beneath the red west. Rand had taken a house
on Shockoe Hill, not far from the Chief Justice's, and to this
he and Jacqueline came through the wet and windy freshness
of the night. Smiling in the doorway were the servants&mdash;Joab
and Mammy Chloe and Hannah&mdash;who had set out
from Albemarle the day before their master and mistress.
Rand and Jacqueline, leaving the mud-splashed chaise, were
welcomed with loquacity and ushered into a cheerful room
where there was a crackling fire and a loaded table.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Leigh's compliments, Miss Jacqueline, an' she done
sont de rolls. Mrs. Fisher's best wishes, an' she moughty glad
to hab a neighbour, an' she done sont de broiled chicken.
An' Mr. Hay, he done sont de oysters wid he compliments&mdash;an'

lef' de birds, an' he gwine come roun' fust thing in de
mawnin'&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We shall have friends,&quot; said Rand. &quot;I am glad for you,
sweetheart. But I wish that one Federalist had had the grace
to remember that Jacqueline Churchill came to town to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, once I would have cared,&quot; answered Jacqueline. &quot;It
does not matter now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a tear on your hand&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed. &quot;At least, it doesn't matter much.&mdash;Is
that all, Joab?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' Marse Ludwell Cary, he ride erroun in de rain an'
leave he compliments for Marse Lewis, an' he say will Miss
Jacqueline 'cept dese yer flowers&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One remembered,&quot; said Rand, and watched his wife put
the flowers in water.</p>

<h3>THE LAW OFFICE</h3>


<p>&quot;If you were not so damned particular&mdash;&quot; said the weasel
disconsolately.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not damned particular,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;I've
wanted wealth and I've wanted power ever since I went barefoot
and suckered tobacco&mdash;as you know who know me
better than almost any one else! But this&quot;&mdash;he tapped the
papers on the table before him&mdash;&quot;this is cheating.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you!&quot; complained the scamp. &quot;You are of the elect.
What you want you'll take by main force. You are a strong
man! You've taken a deal since that day we went into the
bookshop by the bridge. But I'm no Samson or David&mdash;I'm
just Tom Mocket&mdash;and still, why shouldn't I have my
pennyworth?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand paused in his walking up and down the office in
Main Street. It was the late winter, a year and more from
that evening when he and Jacqueline had first come to the
house on Shockoe Hill. Standing by the rough deal table,
he laid an authoritative hand upon the documents with which
it was strewn. &quot;You'll never get your pennyworth here. The
scheme these gentry have afoot is just a Yazoo business. If
these lands exist, they're only a hunting-ground of swamp,
Indians, and buffalo. The survey is paper, the cleared fields
a fable, the town Manoa, the scheme a bubble, the purchasers
fools, and the sellers knaves,&mdash;and there's your legal opinion
in a nutshell!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't ask for a legal opinion,&quot; said Mocket. &quot;I'm a
lawyer myself. There's land there, you'll not deny, and a
river, and plenty of game If a Yankee doesn't find it Paradise,
he had no chance anyhow, and a Kentuck can care for
himself! There's no sense in calling it a bubble, or being so
damned scrupulous!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand made a gesture of contempt. &quot;You let Yazoo companies
and the Promised Land alone! People are ceasing to
be fools. To-day they demand a hair of the mammoth or a
sample of the salt mountain.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket ceased rustling the papers on the table, and turned
to regard his chief more closely. &quot;Lewis, I've heard you
say things like that more than once lately. A year ago you
were mighty respectful to Mr. Jefferson's salt mountain and
strange bones and great elk and silk grass and all the rest of
it. That was a curious letter of yours in the Examiner. If't
was meant to defend his neutrality doings, 'twas a damned
lukewarm defence! If I hadn't known 'twas yours, sink me
if I wouldn't have thought it a damned piece of Federal
sarcasm!&mdash;Did you send that paper to the President?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I did not send it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis,&quot; said the scamp slowly, &quot;are you breaking with
Mr. Jefferson?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand walked to the window and stood looking out upon
the winter afternoon. It was snowing hard, and through the
drifting veil the trees across the way could hardly be discerned.
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said deliberately. &quot;Yes,&mdash;if you call it
breaking with a man to have grown away from him. If he
served me once&mdash;yes, and greatly!&mdash;have I not worked for
him since, hand and foot? We are quits, I think. I shall
not cease to esteem him.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket breathed hard with excitement. &quot;You haven't
been natural for a long time&mdash;but I didn't know 't was
this&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am being natural now,&quot; said Rand somewhat sternly.
&quot;I've told you, Tom, and now let it alone. Least said is
soonest mended.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;but&mdash;&quot; stammered the scamp, &quot;are you going
over to the other camp?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand did not at once answer. From a plate on the windowsill
he took a crust of bread, and, raising the sash, crumbled it
upon the snow without. The sparrows came at once, alighting
near his hand with a tameness that spoke of pleasing association
with the providence above them. &quot;No,&quot; said Rand at
last, &quot;I am not going over to the other camp&mdash;if by that you
mean the Federalist camp. Must one forever sign under a
captain? It is not my instinct to serve.&mdash;Now let it alone.&quot;</p>

<p>He closed the window and, turning again to the table, bent
over an unrolled map which covered half its surface. The
chart was a large one, showing the vast territory drained by
the Ohio, the Missouri, and the Mississippi, and the imagination
of the cartographer had made good his lack of information.
Rivers and mountains appeared where nature had made
no such provision, while the names, quaint and uncouth, with
which Jefferson proposed to burden states yet in embryo
sprawled in large letters across the yellow plain.
&quot;Assenispia&mdash;Polypotamia&mdash;Chersonesus&mdash;Michigania,&quot; read Rand.
&quot;Barbarous! I could name them better out of Ossian!&quot;
He traced with his finger the lower Ohio. &quot;This is where
Blennerhasset's island should be.&quot; The finger went on down
the Mississippi. &quot;What a river! When it is in flood, it is a
sea. And the rich black fields on either side! Cotton! Our
Fortunatus purse shall be spun of that. They call the creeks
bayous. All these little towns&mdash;French and Spanish. To
speak to them of Washington is to speak of the moon&mdash;so
distant and so cold. Here are Indians. Here are settlers
from the East, and the burden of their song is, 'We are so far
from the Old Thirteen that we care not if we are farther yet!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; exclaimed Mocket. &quot;That's treason!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here Adam Gaudylock met Wilkinson. The river narrows
here, and runs deep and strong.&quot; Rand's hand rested
on the coast-line. &quot;New Orleans,&quot; he said, &quot;but capable of
becoming a new Rome. Here to the westward is the Perdido
that they call the boundary,&mdash;then Mexico and the City of
Mexico. If not New Orleans, then Mexico!&quot; He straightened
himself with a laugh. &quot;I am dreaming, Tom&mdash;just as I used
to dream in the fields! Ugh! I feel the hot sun, and the thick
leaves draw through my hands! Let's get back to every
day. To-morrow in the House I am going to carry the Albemarle
Resolutions. The last debate is on. Wirt speaks first,
and then I speak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwell Cary is fighting you,&quot; said Mocket. &quot;Fighting
hard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'll be there to hear you speak. Lord! if I could
speak like you, Lewis, and plan like you, and if whiskey
would let me alone, and if I wasn't afraid of the dark, I'd
make a stir in the country&mdash;I'd go higher than a Franklin
kite!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might manage the rest,&quot; said Rand, with good-natured
scorn; &quot;but it doesn't do to be afraid of the dark.&quot;</p>

<p>From the pegs behind the door he took his greatcoat and
beaver. &quot;I am going home now,&quot; he said. &quot;I have company
to supper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who, then?&quot; asked Mocket. &quot;Adam Gaudylock? He's
in town.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand laughed. &quot;Who, then?' Tom, Tom, you've the
manners of the West Indian skippers you consort with! No,
it's not Adam Gaudylock. It is&mdash;&quot; He hesitated, then took
up a pen and wrote two words. &quot;That's his name&mdash;but you
are to keep it dark.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket's tilted chair came noisily to the floor. &quot;What!
In Richmond!&mdash;he in Richmond! When did he come?
Where's he staying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He came last night, and he's staying quietly at Bowler's
Tavern. It isn't known that he's here, and he is not anxious
that it should be known. He's here on business, and he goes
to-morrow. That is all&mdash;and you're to say no word of what
I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; quoth Tom. &quot;I won't blab. But I'd mightily
like to see the man who shot Alexander Hamilton.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've told you he's not anxious for company.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know!&quot; said Tom, not without humility. &quot;I'm
small fry. Well, there are curious things said about him, and
you and he are strange bedfellows! How did it happen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tom, Tom,&quot; answered Rand, &quot;you ask too many questions!
It was an accident, or it was predestined and foreordained
when I was dust blown about by the wind. You
may take your choice according to your theology! I'm going
now. Be at the House early to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to take that Mathews case? Young
Mathews was here yesterday, swearing that if he couldn't
get you, he would hang himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've said that I would take it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwell Cary's for the other side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know. I'll win.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you're fairly pitted. Half the town backs one and
half the other. That letter signed 'Aurelius' in the Gazette&mdash;did
you know 'twas his?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand dropped his hand from the latch. The colour rushed
to his face, then ebbed as quickly. &quot;No, I did not know,&quot; he
said, in a voice that was not quite steady. &quot;I thought of quite
another man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is Ludwell Cary's, and every Black Cockade in Richmond,
and not a few Republicans, are quoting it. My certie!
it was a commentary in caustic&mdash;and so damned courteous
all the time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care for such courtesy,&quot; answered Rand &quot;Ludwell
Cary had best look where he treads.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I thought I'd tell you,&quot; said his colleague &quot;I
don't like the Carys, either!&mdash;And so I'm not to go into
that land scheme?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. It's a small thing, and not honest. Some day, Tom,
I'll help you to a larger thing than that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And honest?&quot; said Mocket shrewdly.</p>

<p>The other turned upon him with anger, black as it was
sudden. &quot;Honest! Yes, honest as this storm, honest as any
struggle for any piece of earth wider than a coffin space!
Who are you to question me? I give you warning&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gently, gently!&quot; exclaimed the scamp, and started back.
&quot;Lord, how Gideon peeps out of you now and then!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You need not say that, either,&quot; retorted Rand grimly. He
stood for a moment, a cloudy presence in the darkening
room, then with a short laugh recovered himself. &quot;I thought
the black dog was dead,&quot; he said. &quot;It's this gloomy day&mdash;and
I did not sleep last night. Honest! We're all indifferent
honest!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; answered the pacific Tom, &quot;I'll sink or swim
with you. I've followed where you have led this many a day.&quot;</p>

<p>Outside the red brick office the snow lay deep. It was still
falling steadily, in large flakes, grey in the upper air, feathery
white and pure against the opposite houses and the boles of
leafless trees. The day was closing in. Up and down the
street merchants were putting up their shutters; customers
had been few on such a snowy day. Here and there appeared
a figure, booted and greatcoated, emerging from a tavern or
from a law office such as Rand's. A sledge passed, laden with
pine and hickory, drawn by mules with jangling bells; and
a handful of boys loosed from school threw down their bags
of books and fell to snowballing. A negro shuffled by with
a spade on his shoulder, singing as he went,&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;Didn't my Lawd deliber Daniel,<br />
Didn't my Lawd deliber Daniel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">An' why not ebery man?</span><br />
He delibered Daniel from de lions' den,<br />
An' de Hebrew Chillern from de furnace,<br />
He delibered David from de han' of Saul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">An' why not ebery man?&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Rand turned into Governor Street, climbed its white
ascent, and struck across the Capitol Square. Above him
every bough had its weight of snow, and seen through the drifting
veil the pillared Capitol looked remote as that building
of which it was a copy. He walked quickly, with a light and
determined step, a handsome figure in a many-caped coat of
bottle green, striding through the snow toward the cheer of
home. In his outer man, at least, the eighteen months since
his marriage had wrought a change. What was striking then
was more striking now,&mdash;his ease and might of frame, the
admirable poise of his head, and the force expressed in every
feature, the air of power that was about him like an emanation.
The difference was that what had been rude strength
was now strength polished and restrained. The deeps might
hide abrupt and violent things, but the surface had assumed
a fine amenity. Where he wished to learn he was the aptest
pupil, and from the days of the tobacco-field he had longed
for this smooth lustre. Not Gideon, but the mother, spoke in
the appreciation and the facility. Manner counted for much
in Lewis Rand's day; the critical point was not what you did,
but the way you did it. Rand set himself to learn from his
wife all the passwords of the region native to her, but into
which he had broken. She taught him that code with a
courtesy and simplicity exquisitely high-minded and sweet,
and he learned with quickness, gratitude, and lack of any
false shame. What else he might have learned of her he
dimly felt, but he had not covenanted with existence for
qualities that would war with a hundred purposes of his
brain and will. He and Jacqueline were lovers yet. At the
sight of each other the delicate fire ran through their veins;
in absence the mind felt along the wall and dreamed of the
gardens within. If the woman who had given all was the
more constant lover; if the man, while his passion sweetened
all his life, yet bowed before his great idol and fought and
slaved for Power, it was according to the nature of the two,
and there was perhaps no help.</p>

<p>He left the Capitol Square and went on toward the house
he had retaken for the second winter in Richmond. Few were
afoot, though now and then a sleigh went by. Rand's mind
as he walked was busy, not with the debate of to-morrow or
the visitor of to-night, the Mathews trial or Tom Mocket's
puerile schemes, but with the letter in the Gazette signed
&quot;Aurelius.&quot; It had been an attack, able beyond the common,
certainly not upon Lewis Rand, but upon the party which, in
the eyes of the generality, he yet most markedly represented.
In the inflamed condition of public sentiment such attacks
were of weekly occurrence; the wise man was he who put
them by unmoved. For the most part Rand was wise. Federal
diatribes upon the Tripoli war, the Florida purchase, the
quarrel with Spain, Santo Domingo, Neutral Trade, and
Jefferson's leanings toward France left him cold. This letter
in the Gazette had not done so. It had gone to the sources
of things, analyzing with a coolness and naming with a propriety
the more remarkable that it acknowledged, on certain
sides, a community of thought with the party attacked.
The result was that, as in civil war, the quarrel, through
understanding, was the more determined. The man who
signed &quot;Aurelius&quot; had not spared to point out, with a certain
melancholy sternness, the plague spots, the defenceless
places. Moreover, throughout his exposition there ran a
harsh and sombre thread, now felt in denunciation and now in
ironic praise. There was more than unveiling of the weakness
of any human policy or party; the letter was in part a commination
of individual conduct. No name was used, no direct
reference given or example quoted; but one with acumen
might guess there was a man in mind when the writer sat in
judgment. The writer himself was perhaps not aware of the
fulness of this betrayal, but Lewis Rand was aware. The
paper had angered him, and he had not lacked intention of
discovering at whose door it was to be laid. He had enemies
enough&mdash;but this one was a close observer. The subtlety of
the rebuke shook him. How had the writer who signed &quot;Aurelius&quot;
known or divined? He thought of Major Edward
Churchill, but certain reasons made him sure the letter was
not his. And now it seemed that it was Ludwell Cary's.</p>

<p>Rand's lips set closely. Ludwell Cary might not know
where all his shafts were striking, but Rand felt the sting.
Fair fight in the courtroom,&mdash;that was one thing,&mdash;but this
paper was wrought of sterner stuff. There was in it even a
solemnity of warning. Rand's soul, that was in the grasp of
Giant Two-Ways, writhed for a moment, then lay still again.
With his characteristic short laugh, he shook off the feeling
that he mistook for weakness, dismissed the momentary
abashment, and pursued his way through the snowy streets.
The question now in his mind was whether or no he should
make his resentment plain to Ludwell Cary. At long intervals,
three or four times in the winter, perhaps, it was the latter's
custom to lift the knocker of Rand's door, and to sit for an
hour in Jacqueline's drawing-room. Sometimes Rand was
there, sometimes not; Cary's coming had grown to be a habit
of the house, quiet, ordered, and urbane as all its habits were.
Its master now determined, after a moment's sharp debate,
to say nothing that he might not have said before he knew the
identity of that writer to the Gazette. He was conscious of
no desire for immediate retaliation; these things settled themselves
in the long run. He did not intend speaking of the
matter to Jacqueline. Pride forbade his giving Cary reason
to surmise that he had hit the truth. Rand was willing to
believe that many of the shafts were chance-sent. The reflection
hardly lessened his anger, but it enabled him to thrust
the matter behind him to the limbo of old scores.</p>

<p>He was crossing Broad Street when the door of a house
before him opened, and a young man, with a gay word of farewell
to some one in the doorway, ran down the steps and into
the snowy street. It was Fairfax Cary. Rand and he, passing,
lifted their hats, but they did not speak. Had it been the elder
Cary, there would have been a moment's tarrying, an exchange
of courteous speech. But Fairfax Cary made no secret
of his enmity. If he did not offensively publish it, if he was,
indeed, for so young a man, somewhat grimly silent upon
those frequent occasions when Rand was talked of, the hostility
was defined, and at times frank. He went on now
with his handsome head held high. Rand looked after him
with a curious, even a wistful smile upon his lips. He was
himself a man young in years and strength of passion, but
older far in experience and in thought. He did not dislike
Fairfax Cary; he thought indeed that the young man's spirit,
bearing, and partisanship were admirable. His smile was for
the thought that had lightened through his mind: &quot;If in after
years I could have a son like that!&quot; He wanted children; he
wanted a son. Rand sighed. The day had been vexatious,
and there were heavy questions yet to settle before the evening
closed. After all, what was the use, since Jacqueline cared
nothing for baubles, and there was no child! Better live out
his days at Roselands, a farmer and a country lawyer! He
shook off the weight, summoned all his household troop of
thoughts, and went on homewards through the falling snow.</p>

<h3>COMPANY TO SUPPER</h3>


<p>Jacqueline arranged the flowers, cut from her window
stand, in the porcelain vase, and set the vase with
care in the centre of the polished table. All was in
order, from the heavy damask napkins and the Chelsea plates
to the silver candlesticks and the old cut-glass. She turned
her graceful head, and called to her husband, whose step she
heard in the adjoining room. He came, and, standing beside
her, surveyed the mahogany field. &quot;Is there anything lacking?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p>He turned and kissed her. &quot;Only that you should be
happy!&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;If I am not,&quot; she answered, &quot;he will never find it out!
But when I see him, I shall hear that fatal shot!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will make you quite forget it. All women like him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I shall be the exception. General Hamilton was
Uncle Edward's friend. At Fontenoy they'll call it insult
that I have talked with this man!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They will not know,&quot; Rand replied. &quot;It was an honest
duel fought nigh two years ago. Forget&mdash;forget! There's
so much one must forget. Besides, others are forgiving. There
is not now the old enmity between him and the Federalists.&quot;
&quot;No?&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot tell you, but old differences are being smoothed
over. It is rather the Republicans who are out with him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that he is no friend to Mr. Jefferson.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, he is no friend to Mr. Jefferson. The room looks
well, sweetheart. But some day you shall have a much
grander one, all light and splendour, and larger flowers than
these&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>His wife rested her head against his shoulder. &quot;I don't
want it, Lewis. It is only you who care for magnificence.
Sometimes I wonder that you should so care.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is my mother in me,&quot; he answered. &quot;She cared&mdash;poor
soul. But I don't want magnificence for myself. I want
it for you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must not want it for me,&quot; cried Jacqueline, with
wistful passion. &quot;I am happy here, and I am happy at Roselands&mdash;but
I was happiest of all in the house on the Three-Notched
Road!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then Rand spoke slowly.
&quot;I was not born for content. I am urged on&mdash;and on&mdash;and
I cannot always tell right from wrong. There is a darkness
within me&mdash;I wish it were light instead!&quot; He laughed.
&quot;But if wishes were horses, beggars might ride!&mdash;And
you've cut all your pretty bright flowers! After supper, before
we begin our talk, you must sing to him. They say his
daughter is an accomplished and beautiful woman. But you&mdash;you
are Beauty, Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>The knocker sounded. &quot;That is he,&quot; exclaimed Rand, and
went into the hail to welcome his guest. Jacqueline returned
to the drawing-room, and waited there before the fire. She
was dressed in white, with bare neck and arms and her
mother's amethysts around her throat. In a moment the two
men entered. &quot;This is my wife, Colonel Burr,&quot; said Rand.</p>

<p>Jacqueline curtsied. A small, slight, black-eyed, and smiling
gentleman bowed low, and with much grace of manner
took and kissed her hand. &quot;Mr. Rand, now I understand
the pride in your voice! Madam, I wish my daughter Theodosia
were with me. She is my pride, and when I say that
you two would be friends, I pay you both a compliment!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard much of her,&quot; answered Jacqueline, &quot;and
nothing but good. My husband tells me that you have been
in the South&mdash;and in Virginia we are welcoming you with
a snowstorm!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The cold is all outside,&quot; said Colonel Burr. &quot;Permit
me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He handed his hostess to the green-striped sofa, and seated
himself beside her with a sigh of appreciation for the warmth
and soft light of the pleasant room, and the presence of
woman. &quot;Your harp!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I should have
brought a sheaf of Spanish songs such as the ladies sing to
the guitar in New Orleans!&mdash;My dear sir, your fair wife and
my Theodosia must one day sing together, walk hand in
hand together, in that richer, sweeter land! They shall use
the mantilla and wield the fan. Crowns are too heavy&mdash;they
shall wear black lace!&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke with not unpleasant brusqueness, a military
manner tempered with gallantry, and he looked at Rand with
quick black eyes. &quot;Yes, they must meet,&quot; said Rand simply.
He spoke composedly, but he had nevertheless a moment's
vision of Jacqueline, away from the snow and the storm,
walking in beauty through the gardens of a far country. He
saw her with a circlet of gold upon her head, a circlet of
Mexican gold. Crowns were heavy, but men&mdash;ay, and
women, too!&mdash;fought for them. Hers should be light and
fanciful upon her head. She should wear black lace if she
chose,&mdash;though always he liked her best in white, in her
kingdom, in the kingdom he was going to help Aaron Burr
establish.&mdash;No! in the kingdom Aaron Burr should help
Lewis Rand establish! His dream broke. He was not sure
that he meant to come to an understanding with Burr. It
depended&mdash;it depended. But still he saw Jacqueline in trailing
robes, with the gold circlet on her head.</p>

<p>Joab at the door announced supper, and the three went
into the dining-room, where the red geraniums glowed between
the candles. Jacqueline took her place behind the
coffee-urn, and Joab waited.</p>

<p>The meal went pleasantly on. Colonel Burr was accomplished
in conversation, now supple and insinuating as a
courtier, now direct, forceful, even plain, as became an old
soldier of the Revolution, always agreeable, and always with
a fine air of sincerity. The daughter of Henry Churchill did
not lack wit, charm, and proper fire, and the Virginia hostess
never showed her private feelings to a guest. She watched
over the stranger's comfort with soft care, and met his talk
with graceful readiness. He spoke to her of her family: of
her grandfather, whose name had been widely known, of her
father, whose praises he had heard sung, of Major Churchill,
whom he had met in Philadelphia in General Washington's
time. He spoke of her kinsmen with an admiration which
went far toward including their opinions. Jacqueline marvelled.
Surely this gentleman was a Democrat-Republican,
lately the Vice-President of that party's electing. It was not
two years since he had slain General Hamilton; and now,
in a quiet, refined voice, he was talking of Federalists and
Federal ways with all the familiarity, sympathy, and ease of
one born in the fold and contented with his lot. She wondered
if he had quarrelled with his party, and while he was
talking she was proudly thinking, &quot;The Federalists will not
have him&mdash;no, not if he went on his knees to them!&quot; And
then she thought, &quot;He is a man without a country.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand sat somewhat silent and distrait, his mind occupied
in building, building, now laying the timbers this way and
now that; but presently, upon his guest's referring to him
some point for elucidation, he entered the conversation, and
thenceforth, though he spoke not a great deal, his personality
dominated it. The acute intelligence opposite him took faint
alarm. &quot;I am bargaining for a supporter,&quot; Burr told himself,
&quot;not for a rival,&quot; and became if possible more deferentially
courteous than before. The talk went smoothly on,
from Virginia politics to the triumphal march of Napoleon
through Europe; from England and the death of Pitt to the
Spanish intrigues, and so back to questions of the West;
and to references, which Jacqueline did not understand, to
the Spanish Minister, Casa Yrujo, to the English Mr. Merry,
and to Messieurs Sauv&eacute;, Derbigny, and Jean No&euml;l Destr&eacute;han
of New Orleans.</p>

<p>Joab took away the Chelsea plates and dishes, brushed the
mahogany, and placed before his master squat decanters of
sherry and Madeira. The flowing talk took a warmer tone,
and began to sing with the music of the South and the golden
West; to be charged with Spanish, French, and Indian names,
with the odour of strange flowers, the roll of the Mississippi,
and the flashing of coloured wings. It was the two men now
who spoke. Jacqueline, leaning back in her chair, half listened
to the talk of the Territory of Orleans, the Perdido, and the
road to Mexico, half dreamed of what they might be doing at
Fontenoy this snowy night. The knocker sounded. &quot;That
is Adam Gaudylock,&quot; exclaimed Rand. &quot;Joab, show Mr.
Gaudylock in.&quot;</p>
<div><a name="page198" id="page198" /></div>
<p>Jacqueline rose, and Colonel Burr sprang to open the door
for her. &quot;We may sit late, Jacqueline,&quot; said Rand, and
their guest, &quot;Madam, I will make court to you in a court
some day!&quot;</p>

<p>Gaudylock's voice floated in from the hall: &quot;Is a little
man with him?&mdash;a black-eyed man?&quot; She passed into the
drawing-room, and, pressing her brow against the window-pane,
looked out into the night. The snow had ceased to fall,
and the moon was struggling with the breaking clouds. The
door opened to admit her husband, who came for a moment
to her side. &quot;It is not snowing now,&quot; he said. &quot;A visitor will
hardly knock on such a night. If by chance one should come,
say that I am engaged with a client, make my excuses, and as
soon as possible get rid of him. On no account&mdash;on no account,
Jacqueline, would I have it known that Aaron Burr is
here to-night. This is important. I will keep the doors shut,
and we will not speak loudly.&quot; He turned to go, then hesitated.
&quot;On second thoughts, I will tell Joab to excuse us both
at the door. For you&mdash;do not sit up, dear heart! It will be
late before our business is done.&quot;</p>

<p>He was gone. Jacqueline went back to the fire and, sitting
down beneath the high mantel, opened the fifth volume of
Clarissa Harlowe. She read for a while, then closed the
book, and with her chin in her hand fell to studying the
ruddy hollows and the dropping coals. Perhaps half an hour
passed. The door opened, and she looked up from her picture
in the deep hollows to see Ludwell Cary smiling down
upon her and holding out his hand. &quot;Perhaps I should have
drifted past with the snow,&quot; he said, &quot;but the light in the
window drew me, and I heard to-day from Fontenoy. Mr.
Rand, I know, is at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Jacqueline, rising, &quot;but he is much
engaged to-night with&mdash;with a friend. Did Joab not tell
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mammy Chloe let me in. I did not see Joab. I am
sorry&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He hesitated. There came a blast of wind that rattled the
boughs of the maple outside the window. The fire leaped and
the shadows danced in the corners of the room. Jacqueline
knew that it was cold outside&mdash;her visitor's coat was wet
with snow. Sitting there before the fire she had been lonely,
and her heart was hungry for news from home.</p>

<p>&quot;May I stay a few minutes?&quot; asked Cary. &quot;I will read
you what Major Edward says of Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>She was far from dreaming how little Rand would wish
this visitor to know of his affairs that night. Her knowledge
extended no further than the fact that for some reason Colonel
Burr did not wish it known that he was in Richmond.
She listened, but the walls were thick, and she heard no sound
from the distant dining-room. Cary would know only what
she told him, and in a few minutes he would be gone. &quot;I
should like to hear the letter,&quot; she said, and motioned to the
armchair beside the hearth. He took it, and she seated herself
opposite him, upon an old, embroidered tabouret. Between
them the fire of hickory logs burned softly; without the
curtained windows the maple branches, moved by the wind,
struck at intervals against the eaves. Jacqueline faced the
door. It was her intention, should she hear steps, to rise and
speak to Lewis in the hail without.</p>

<p>The letter which Cary drew from his breast pocket was
from Major Churchill. That he did not read it all was due to
his correspondent's choice of subjects and great plainness of
speech; but he read what the Major had to say of Fontenoy,
of the winter weather and the ailing slaves, of Mustapha, of
county deaths and marriages, of the books he had been reading,
and the men to whom he wrote. Major Edward's strain
was ironic, fine, and very humanly lonely. Jacqueline's eyes
filled with tears, and all the flames of the fire ran together like
shaken jewels.</p>

<p>&quot;Almost all the rest,&quot; said Cary, &quot;has to do with politics.
I will not read you what he has to say of us slight, younger
men and the puny times in which we live. But this will interest
you&mdash;this is of general import.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned the page and read: &quot;I have to-day a letter from
G. Morris with the latest mischief from the North. Aaron
Burr is going West, but with, I warrant you, no thought of
the setting sun. The Ancient Iniquity in Washington smiles
with thin lips and pronounces that all men and Aaron Burr
are unambitious, unselfish, and peace-loving&mdash;but none the
less, he looks askance at the serpent's windings. The friends
of Burr are not the friends of Jefferson. There are Federalists&mdash;'tis
said they increase in numbers&mdash;who do not wish
the former ill; myself I am not of them. Colonel Burr <i>desired</i>
that duel; he lay in wait for the affront which should be his
opportunity; he murdered Hamilton. He risked his own life&mdash;very
true, the majority of murderers do the same. The
one who does not is a dastard in addition&mdash;<i>voila tout!</i></p>

<p>&quot;Burr quits the East, and all men know that the West,
like Israel of old, is weary of an Idea and would like to have
a King. If the world revolves this way much longer, the Man
of the People will not be asked to write the next Declaration
of Independence, and the country west of the Ohio will be
celebrating not the Fourth of July but an eighteenth Prairial.
Aaron Burr and his confederates intend an Empire. 'Tis
said there are five hundred men in his confidence here in the
East, and that the chief of these wait but for a signal from
him or from Wilkinson&mdash;whereupon they'll follow him and
he'll make them dukes and princes.</p>

<p>&quot;Like Macbeth, he has done his murder and is on his
way to be crowned at Scone. He has not a wife, but he has
a daughter ambitious as himself. She has a son. He sees his
line secured. He has suborned other murderers and made
traitors of honest men&mdash;and our Laputa philosopher at
Washington smiles and says there is nothing amiss!</p>

<p>&quot;May I be gathered soon out of this cap-and-bells democracy
to some Walhalla where I may find Hamilton and
General Washington and be at peace! This world is growing
wearisome to me.</p>

<p>&quot;G. Morris speaks of the bulk of his news as report
merely, but I'll stake my head the report is true.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary ceased to read. Jacqueline sat motionless, and in the
silence of the room they heard the wind outside and the tapping
of the maple branches.</p>

<p>&quot;If I were Mr. Jefferson,&quot; said Cary presently, &quot;I would
arrest Colonel Burr this side of the Ohio. He has been West
too often; he is in the East now, and I would see to it that he
remained here. But Mr. Jefferson will temporize, and Burr
will make his dash for a throne. Well! he is neither C&aelig;sar
nor Buonaparte; he is only Aaron Burr. He is the adventurer,
not the Emperor. The danger is that in all the motley
he is enlisting there may be a Buonaparte. Then farewell to
this poor schemer and any delusions he may yet nourish as
to a peaceful, federated West! War and brazen clamour and
the yelling eagles of a conqueror!&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke with conviction, but now, as though to lighten his
own mood, he laughed. &quot;All this may not be so,&quot; he said.
&quot;It may be but a dream of our over-peaceful night.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline rose, motioned him with a smile to keep his seat,
and, moving to an escritoire standing near the door, wrote a
line upon a sheet of paper, then rang the bell and when Joab
appeared, put the paper into his hand. &quot;Give this to your master,&quot;
she said, and came back to Cary beside the fire. She
smiled, but he saw with concern that she was very pale, and
that the amethysts were trembling at her throat. &quot;I should
not have read you this letter,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It is over-caustic,
over-bitter. Do not let it trouble you. You have grown pale!&quot;</p>

<p>She bent over the fire as if she were cold. &quot;It is nothing.
Yes, I was troubled&mdash;I am always troubled when I think
of Fontenoy. But it is over now&mdash;and indeed I wanted
to hear Uncle Edward's letter.&quot; She straightened herself
and turned to him a smiling face. &quot;And now tell me of
yourself! You are looking worn. Men work too hard in
Richmond. Oh, for the Albemarle air! The snow will be
white to-morrow on my fir tree, and Deb will have to throw
crumbs for the birds. I have learned a new song. When next
you come, I will sing it to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you not,&quot; asked Cary,&mdash;&quot;will you not sing it to
me now?&quot;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &quot;Not now. How the branches strike
against the roof to-night!&quot;</p>

<p>As she spoke she moved restlessly, and Cary saw the amethysts
stir again. A thought flashed through his mind. It
had to do with Lewis Rand, of whom he often thought, sometimes
with melancholy envy, sometimes with strong dislike,
sometimes with unwilling admiration, and always with painful
curiosity. Now, the substance of Major Churchill's letter
strongly in mind, with senses rendered more acute and emotions
heightened as they always were in the presence of the
woman he had not ceased to love, troubled, too, by something
in her demeanor, intangibly different from her usual frank
welcome, he suddenly and vividly recalled a much-applauded
speech that Rand had made three days before in a public
gathering. It had included a noteworthy display of minute
information of western conditions, extending to the physical
features of the country and to every degree of its complex
population. One sentence among many had caught Cary's attention,
had perplexed him, and had remained in his memory
to be considered afterwards, closely and thoughtfully. There
was one possible meaning&mdash;</p>

<p>Cary crumpled the letter in his hand. Rand's speech perplexed
him no longer. That was it&mdash;that was it! His breath
came quickly. He had builded better&mdash;he had builded better
than he knew, when he wrote that paper signed &quot;Aurelius&quot;!</p>

<p>With fingers that were not quite steady he smoothed and
refolded Major Churchill's letter He was saying to himself,
&quot;What does she know She grew pale Thou suspicious fool!
That was for thought of home He will have told her nothing&mdash;nothing!
Her soul is clear.&quot;</p>

<p>He pocketed his letter and, rising, spoke to her with a
chivalrous gentleness &quot;I will go now Do not let the thought
of Fontenoy distress you Do you remember the snow man
we made there once, wreathing his head with holly? But I'll
tell you a strange thing,&mdash;even on such a night as this, I
always see Fontenoy bathed in summer weather!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; she answered &quot;I, too. Oh, home!&quot;</p>

<p>He held out his hand &quot;You'll give my compliments to
Mr. Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;He is busy to-night with a client from
the country. He works too hard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take him soon to Roselands and tie him there. Sing him
To Althea and make him forget.&quot; He bent and kissed her
hand. &quot;Good-night&mdash;good-night!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; she answered, and moved with him to the
door. Standing there, she watched him through the hail and
out of the house, then turned and, going to the window, pressed
her brow against the pane and watched him down the street.
The night had cleared; there was a high wind and many
stars.</p>

<p>In Rand's dining-room the three men sat late over the wine
and the questions that had brought them together, but at last
the conference was somewhat stormily over. Burr and Adam
Gaudylock left the house together, the hunter volunteering
to guide the stranger to his inn. It was midnight, and Colonel
Burr did not see his hostess. He sent her courtly messages,
and he pressed Rand's hand somewhat too closely, then with
his most admirable military air and frankest smile, thrust his
arm through Gaudylock's and marched away. Rand closed
the door, put down the candle that he held, and turned into
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Before the dying fire he found Jacqueline in her white
gown, the amethysts about her throat, and her scarf of silver
gauze fallen from her hand upon the floor. In her young face
and form there should have been no hint, no fleeting breath
of tragedy, but to-night there was that hint and that breath.
The fire over which she bent and brooded seemed to leave her
cold. The room was no longer brightly lighted, and she appeared
mournfully a part of the hovering shadows. Her spirit
had power to step forth and clothe the flesh. Almost always
she looked the thing she felt. Now, in the half light, bent
above the fading coals, she looked old. Her husband, with his
hand upon the mantel-shelf, gazed down upon her. &quot;It was
wise of you to send me that note. Burr and I might have
walked in here, or we might have spoken loudly. I heard
Cary when he went out. How did you manage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He asked for you. I told him that you were engaged with
a client from the country. Oh, Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand stooped and kissed her. &quot;It was the best thing you
could say. I would not have had him guess our visitor to-night.
You are trembling like a leaf!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The best that I could say!&mdash;I don't know that. I feel
like a leaf in the wind! I did not understand&mdash;but I was
afraid for you. It is done, but I prefer to tell the truth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I prefer it for you,&quot; said Rand. &quot;To-night was mere
unluckiness. And he suspected nothing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He went without knowing who was in the dining-room.
Lewis, what is there to suspect?&quot;</p>

<p>He stood looking down upon her with a glow in his dark
eyes and an unwonted red in his cheek. &quot;Suspect? There is
nothing to suspect. But to expect&mdash;there might be expectations,
my Queen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As long as you live you are my King&quot; she said. &quot;To-night
I am afraid for my King. I do not like Colonel Burr!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry for that. He is said to be a favourite with
women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis!&quot; she cried, &quot;what does he want with you? Tell
me!&quot;</p>

<p>So appealing was her voice, so urgent the touch of her
hand, that with a start Rand awoke from his visions to the
fact of her emotion. His eye was hawklike, and his intuition
unfailing. &quot;What did Ludwell Cary say to you?&quot; he
demanded.</p>

<p>She took her scarf from the floor, wound her hands in it,
and clasped them tightly before her. &quot;When I told him,&mdash;Mammy
Chloe let him in,&mdash;when I told him that you were
busy with your client, he thought no more of it. And then
we talked of Fontenoy, and he read me a letter from Uncle
Edward. Much of the letter was about Colonel Burr, and&mdash;and
suspicions that were aroused. Uncle Edward called
him a traitor and a maker of traitors. That is an ugly name,
is it not? Ludwell Cary did not think the rumour false.
He said that if he were Mr. Jefferson, he would arrest Colonel
Burr. He, also, called him traitor. I can tell you what
he said. He said, 'But Mr. Jefferson will temporize, and
Burr will make his dash for a throne. Well! he is neither
C&aelig;sar nor Buonaparte; he is only Aaron Burr. The danger
is that in all the motley he is enlisting there may be a Buonaparte.
Then farewell to this poor schemer and any delusions
he may yet nourish as to a peaceful, federated West!
War and brazen clamour and the yelling eagles of a conqueror!'
That is what he said.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Rand spoke in a curious voice,
&quot;Saul among the prophets! In the future, let us have less of
Ludwell Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis, why did Colonel Burr come here to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand turned from the fire and began to pace the room,
head bent and hand at mouth, thinking rapidly. His wife
raised her hands, still wrapped in the silver scarf, to her heart,
and waited. As he passed for the third time the tall harp, he
drew his hand heavily across the strings. The room vibrated
to the sound. Rand came back to the hearth, took the armchair
in which Cary had sat, and drew it closer to the glowing
embers. &quot;Come,&quot; he said. &quot;Come, Jacqueline, let us look
at the pictures in the fire.&quot;</p>

<p>She knelt beside him on the braided rug. &quot;Show me true
pictures! Home in Virginia, and honourable life, and noble
service, and my King a King indeed, and this Colonel Burr
gone like a shadow and an ugly dream!&mdash;that is the picture
I want to see.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence before the white ash and
the dying heart of the wood, then Rand with the tongs squared
a flaky bed and drew from top to bottom a jagged line.
&quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;is the great artery; this is the Mississippi
River.&quot; He drew another line. &quot;Here to the southwest is
Mexico, and that is a country for great dreams. There the
plantain and the orange grow and there are silver and gold&mdash;and
the warm gulf is on this side, and the South Sea far, far
away, and down here is South America. The Aztecs lived in
Mexico, and Cortez conquered them. He burned his ships
so that he and his Spaniards might not retreat. Here is
the land west of the Mississippi, unknown and far away.
There are grassy plains that seem to roll into the sun, and
there are great herds of game, and warlike Indians, and
beyond the range of any vision there are vast mountains
white with snow. Gold, too, may be there. It is a country
enormous, grandiose, rich, and silent,&mdash;a desert waiting
dumbly for the strong man's tread.&quot; He turned a little and
drew another line. &quot;To this side, away, away to the east,
here where you and I are sitting, watching, watching, here are
the Old Thirteen,&mdash;the Thirteen that the English took from
the Indians, that the children of the English took from England.
It is the law of us all, Jacqueline, the law of the Three
Kingdoms: the battle is to the strong and the race to the
swift. The Old Thirteen are stable; let them rest! Together
they make a great country, and they will be greater yet
But here is the Ohio&mdash;la belle Rivi&egrave;re, the Frenchmen call it.
And beyond and below the Ohio, through all the gigantic
valley of a river so great that it seems a fable, south to New
Orleans, and westward to the undiscovered lies the country
that is to be! And Napoleon, in order that he may brandish
over England one thunderbolt the more, sells it for a song!&mdash;and
we buy it for a song&mdash;and not one man in fifty guesses
that we have bought the song of the future! The man who
bought it knows its value&mdash;but Mr. Jefferson cares only
for Done lays. He'll not have the Phrygian. He dreams of
cotton and olives, of flocks and herds, rock salt and peaceful
mines, and the manors of the Golden Age,&mdash;all gathered,
tended, worked, administered by farmers, school-teachers,
and philosophers! The ploughshare (improved) and the
pruning-hook, a pulpit for Dr. Priestley, and a statue of Tom
Paine, a glass house where the study of the mastodon may
lead to a knowledge of man, slavery abolished, and war abhorred,
the lion and the lamb to lie down together and
Rousseau to come true&mdash;all the old mirage&mdash;perfectibility
in plain sight! That is his dream, and it is a noble one. There
is no room in it for the wicked man. In the mean time he
proposes to govern this land of milk and honey, this bought-and-paid-for
Paradise, very much as an eastern Despot might
govern a conquered province. The inconsistencies of man
must disconcert even the Thinker up in the skies. Well&mdash;it
happens that the West and this great new city of ours, there
at the mouth of the river, with her levees and her ships, her
merchants, priests, and lawyers, do not want government by
a satrap. They want an Imperial City and a C&aelig;sar of their
own. Throughout the length and breadth of this vast territory
there is deep dissatisfaction&mdash;within and without, for
Spain is yet arrogant upon its borders. The Floridas&mdash;Mexico&mdash;fret
and fever everywhere! It is so before all
changes, Jacqueline. The very wind sighs uneasily. Then
one comes, bolder than the rest, sees and takes his advantage.
So empires and great names are made.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So good names are lost!&quot; she cried. &quot;It is not thus that
you spoke one October evening on our way from Albemarle!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand dropped the iron from his hand. &quot;That was a year
and a half ago, and all things move with rapidity. A man's
mind changes. That evening!&mdash;I was in Utopia. And yet,
if we reigned,&mdash;if we two reigned, Jacqueline,&mdash;we might
reign like that. We might make a kingdom wise and great.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Mr. Jefferson, and all that you owe to him? And
your letter to him every month with all the public news?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was before this winter,&quot; he answered. &quot;We have almost
ceased to write. I am not like James Madison or James
Monroe. I cannot follow always. Mr. Jefferson is a great
man&mdash;but it is hungry dwelling in the shadow of another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better dwell in the shadow forever,&quot; cried Jacqueline,
with passion, &quot;than to reign with faithlessness in the sun!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not faithless&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So Benedict Arnold thought! Oh, Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak,&quot; said Rand slowly, &quot;too much like the
Churchills and the Carys.&quot;</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, Jacqueline rose and stood over
against him, the scarf trailing from her hand and the amethysts
rising and falling with her laboured breathing. He
glanced at her and then went on: &quot;Burr leaves Richmond
to-morrow. He does not go West till summer, and all his
schemes may come to naught. What he does or does not do
will depend on many things, chiefly on whether or not we go
to war with Spain. I am not going West with him&mdash;not yet.
I have let him talk. I have brought him and Adam Gaudylock
together; I have put a little money in this land purchase
of his upon the Washita, and I have given him some advice.
That is all there is of rebellion, treason, and sedition,&mdash;all the
cock-a-hoop story! Ludwell Cary may keep his own breath
to cool his own porridge. And you, Jacqueline, you who
married me, you have not a soul to be frighted with big
words! You and I shall walk side by side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we?&quot; she said. &quot;That will depend. I'll not walk
with you over the dead&mdash;dead faith, dead hope, dead
honour!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not ask you to,&quot; he answered. &quot;You are not yourself.
You are using words without thought. It is the cold, the
lateness, and this dying fire&mdash;Ludwell Cary's arrogance as
well. Dead faith, hope, honour!&mdash;is this your trust, your
faith?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis, Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>He rose, crossed the shadowy space between them, and took
her hands. &quot;Don't fear&mdash;don't fear! We two will always
love. Jacqueline, there is that within me that will not rest,
that cries for power, and that overrides obstacles! See what I
have overridden since the days beneath the apple tree! I am
not idly dreaming. Conditions such as exist to-day will not
arise again. Upon this continent it is the time of times for the
bold&mdash;the wisely bold. This that beckons is no mirage in
the West; it is palpable fact. Say that I follow Burr&mdash;follow!
overtake and pass him! He has a tarnished name and
fifty years,&mdash;a supple rapier but a shrunken arm. He's
daring; but I can be that and more. He plans; I can achieve.
I am no dreamer and no braggart when I say that in the
West I can play the Corsican. What can I do here? Become,
perhaps, Governor of Virginia; wait until Mr. Jefferson is
dead, and Mr. Madison is dead, and Mr. Monroe is dead, and
then, if the world is yet Republican, become President? The
governorship I do not want; the presidency is but a chance,
and half a lifetime off! But this&mdash;this, Jacqueline, is real
and at hand. Say that I go, say that I gain a throne where
you and I may sit and rule, wise and great and sovereign,
holding kingdoms for our children&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Jacqueline.</p>

<p>Rand drew her to him. &quot;Don't fear&mdash;don't fear! The
child will come&mdash;we want him so!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Promise me,&quot; she cried,&mdash;&quot;promise me that you will see
Colonel Burr no more, write to him no more! Promise me
that you will put all this away, forever, forever! Oh, Lewis,
give me your word!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will do nothing rash,&quot; he said. &quot;We will go back to
Roselands,&mdash;we will watch and wait awhile. Burr himself
does not go West until the summer. Ere then I will persuade
you. That first July evening, under the mimosa at the gate,
even then this thing was vaguely, vaguely in my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was it?&quot; she cried. &quot;Oh me, oh me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are wearied,&quot; he said, &quot;chilled and trembling. I
wish that Ludwell Cary had aired his views elsewhere to-night!
Put it all from your mind and come to rest&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis, if ever you loved me&mdash;if ever you said that you
would give me proof&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know that I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, as I gave up friends and home for you, give up this
thing for me! No, no, I'll not cease to beg&quot;&mdash;She slipped
from his arm to her knees. &quot;Lewis, Lewis, this is not the
road&mdash;this is not the way to freedom, goodness, happiness
Promise me! Oh, Lewis, if ever you loved me, promise me!&quot;</p>

<p>From Rand's house on Shockoe Hill Ludwell Cary walked
quickly homeward to the Eagle, where he and his brother
lodged. As he walked he thought at first, hotly and bitterly
enough, of Lewis Rand and painfully of himself, but at
length the solemnity of the white night and the high glitter of
the stars made him impatient of his own mood. He looked
at the stars, and at the ivory and black of the tall trees, and
his mind calmed itself and turned to think of Jacqueline.</p>

<p>In the Eagle's best bedroom, before a blazing fire and a
bottle of port, he found Fairfax Cary deep in a winged chair
and a volume of Fielding. &quot;Well, Fair?&quot; he said, with his arm
upon the mantel-shelf and his booted foot upon the fender.</p>

<p>The younger Cary closed his book and hospitably poured
wine for his brother. &quot;Were you at the Amblers'?&quot; he asked.
&quot;It's a night for one's own fireside. I went to the Mayos', but
the fair Maria is out of town. On the way I stopped at
Bowler's Tavern to see his man about that filly we were talking of,
and I had a glass with old Bowler himself. He let
out a piece of news. Who d'ye think is in town and under
Bowler's roof?&mdash;Aaron Burr!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Cary said quietly, &quot;Aren't you
mistaken, Fair?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the least,&quot; answered the other. &quot;He came in a
sloop from Baltimore yesterday. It is not known that he's in
town; he does not want it known. He's keeping quiet,&mdash;perhaps
he has another duel on his conscience. I don't believe
old Bowler knew he had let the cat out. Burr leaves to-morrow.
He was out visiting to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Cary demanded, with sudden
sharpness.</p>

<p>&quot;Bowler's best bedroom in darkness&mdash;no special preparations
for supper&mdash;Burr's man idling in the kitchen&mdash;mine
host taking no cake to speak low,&mdash;in short, the wedding
guest was roaming. I wonder where he was!&quot;</p>

<p>The elder Cary raised and drained the glass of wine. He
knew where Aaron Burr had supped and passed the evening,
and a coldness that was not of the night crept upon him. As
for Lewis Rand, he cared not what he did nor why he did it,
but for Jacqueline Churchill. This had been the client
from the country! All the time she was keeping it secret that
Burr was there. She had turned pale. No wonder!&mdash;the
faithful wife!</p>

<p>&quot;Take care, that glass is thin&mdash;you'll break it!&quot; warned
the younger Cary, but the glass had snapped in the elder's
fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;Pshaw!&quot; said Cary; &quot;too frail for use! I'm off to bed,
Fair. That bill comes up to-morrow, and it means a bitter
fight. Good-night,&mdash;and I say, Fair, hold your tongue
about Aaron Burr. Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p>In his room he put out the candle, parted the window curtains,
and looked upon Orion, icily splendid in the midnight
sky. &quot;What is there that is steadfast?&quot; he thought. &quot;Does
she love him so?&quot; He stood for a long time looking out into
the night. He thought of that evening at Fontenoy when he
had come in from the sultry and thunderous air and had
found Rand seated in the drawing-room and Jacqueline at her
harp, singing To Althea,&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;Minds innocent and quiet take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That for a hermitage.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>The words and the vision of Fontenoy that night were
yet with him when at last he turned from the window and
threw himself upon the bed, where he finally fell asleep with
his arm flung up and across his eyes.</p>

<h3>AT LYNCH'S</h3>


<p>Rand, walking hastily through the hail of the Capitol,
came out into the portico. Before him, between the
great pillars, the landscape showed in glittering silver,
in the brown of leafless trees and the hard green of pine and
fir. The hill fell steep and white to the houses at its base and
to the trampled street. In the still and crystal air the river
made itself plainly heard. Across, on the Chesterfield side,
the woods formed a long smudge of umber against the blue
of the afternoon sky.</p>

<p>There were people here in the open air as there had been
in the corridor, a number of men talking loudly, or excitedly
whispering, or in silence rolling triumph beneath the tongue,
or digesting defeat. Rand's progress, here as there, brought
a change. The loud talking fell, the whisperers turned, the
silent found their voices, and there arose a humming note
of recognition and tribute. Rand had carried the Albemarle
Resolutions, and that with a high hand. He moved through
the crowd, acknowledging with a bend of his head this or
that man's salute, frankly smiling upon good friends, and
finely unconscious of all enemies, until at the head of the
broad steps he came upon Adam Gaudylock seated with
his gun beside him, smoking reflectively in the face of the
Albemarle Resolutions and the general excitement. At Rand's
glance he rose, took up the gun, and slid the pipe into his
beaded pouch. The two descended the steps together.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going to Lynch's,&quot; said Rand. &quot;The stage will
soon be in and I want the news. Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's off,&quot; answered Gaudylock. &quot;Chaise to Fredericksburg
at six this morning. Pitch dark and no one stirring, and
he as chipper, fresh, and pleased as a squirrel with a nut!
Pshaw! a Creek pappoose could read his trail! He's from
New England anyway. I want a Virginian out there!&quot;</p>

<p>They walked on down the white hillside. The hunter,
tawny and light of tread, scarce older to the eye, for all his
wanderings, than the man beside him, glanced aslant with
his sea-blue eyes. &quot;When are you coming, Lewis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never, I think,&quot; said Rand abruptly; then after a moment's
silent walking, &quot;They should better clean these paths
of snow. Mocket says a brig came in yesterday from the
Indies;&mdash;attacks on Neutral Trade and great storms at sea.
I've a pipe of Madeira on the ocean that I hope will not
go astray. I wish that some time you would send me by a
wagon coming east antlers of elk for the hall at Roselands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, certainly!&quot; quoth Gaudylock. &quot;And so you are
going to settle down like every other country gentleman,&mdash;safe
and snug, winter and summer, fenced in by tobacco and
looking after negroes? I'll send you the skin of a grizzly,
too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied Rand; then presently, &quot;I dreamed
last night&mdash;when at last I got to sleep&mdash;of my father. Do
you remember how he used to stride along with his black
hair and his open shirt and his big stick in his hand? I
used to think that stick a part of him&mdash;just his arm made
long and heavy. I tried once to burn it when he was asleep.
Ugh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dreamed,&quot; said Gaudylock imperturbably, &quot;of a
Shawnee girl who once wanted me to stay in her father's
lodge. 'It is winter in the forest,' quoth she, 'and the wolves
begin to howl. All your talk of places where the river runs
through flowers and the pale faces build great villages is the
talk of singing birds! Stay by the fire, Golden-tongue!' and I
stayed&mdash;in the dream.</p>

<p>
&quot;When you see a partridge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scurrying through the grass,</span><br />
Fit an arrow to the bow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a man will pass!</span><br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Heigho!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am already,&quot; retorted Rand, &quot;at the place where the
river runs through flowers and the pale faces have built villages.
Who will say that I did not cross the forest?&mdash;I was
years in crossing it! Here is Lynch's.&quot;</p>

<p>The coffee house on Main Street was the resort of lawyers,
politicians, and strangers in town, and towards dusk, when the
stage and post-rider were in, a crowded and noisy place. It
was yet early when Rand and Gaudylock entered, and neither
the mail-bag, nor many habitu&eacute;s of the place had arrived.
The room was quiet and not over brightly lit by the declining
sun and the flare of a great, crackling fire. There were a number
of tables and a few shadowy figures sipping chocolate,
wine, or punch. Rand led the way to a corner table, and,
sitting down with his back to the room, beckoned a negro
and ordered wine. &quot;I am tired, voice and mind,&quot; he said
to Gaudylock, &quot;and I know you well enough to neglect you.
Let us sit still till the papers come.&quot;</p>

<p>He drank his wine and, with his elbow on the table, rested
his forehead upon his hand and closed his eyes. Adam
emptied his glass, then, leaning back in his corner, surveyed
the room. Two men came and seated themselves at a neighbouring
table. They were talking in lowered voices, but
Gaudylock's ears were exceedingly keen. &quot;A great speech!&quot;
said one. &quot;As great as Mr. Henry ever made. Do you remember
old Gideon Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>The other shrugged. &quot;Yes; and I remember old Stephen
Rand, Gideon's father&mdash;a pirate of a man, sullen, cruel, and
revengeful! A black stock!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Waynes were not angels either&mdash;save by comparison,&quot;
quoth the first. &quot;All the same it was a great speech.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I grant you that,&quot; said the other. &quot;Black stock or not,
we'll see him Governor of Virginia. Curious, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>They became aware of their neighbours, glanced uneasily
at each other, raised their eyebrows, and changed to a distant
table. Rand made no sign of having heard. He put out his
hand to the Burgundy, filled his glass, and drank it slowly,
then closed his eyes again. A figure, half buried in the settle
by the fire, folded a month-old journal and, rising, displayed
in the light from the hickory logs the faded silk stockings,
the velvet short-clothes, brocaded coat, and curled wig of
M. Achille Pincornet, who taught dancing each winter in
Richmond, as in summer he taught it in Albemarle. Mr.
Pincornet, snuff-box and handkerchief in hand, looked around
him, saw the two at the corner table, and crossed to them.
&quot;Mr. Rand, I make you my compliments. I was in the gallery.
Ah, eloquence, eloquence!&mdash;substance persuasively
put! Minerva with the air of Venus! I, too, was eloquent in
my day! Pray honour me!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand touched the extended snuff-box with his fingers, muttered
an absent word or two, and again sank into revery. Mr.
Pincornet, with an affable, &quot;Ah, hunter!&quot; to Gaudylock,
passed on to greet an entering compatriot, the good Abb&eacute;
Dubois.</p>

<p>Rand sat still, his head propped upon one hand, the fingers
of the other moving upon the board before him, half aimlessly,
half deliberately, as though he wrote in a dream. Opposite
him rested Adam, placid as an eastern god. The room
began to fill and the murmur of voices to deepen. &quot;The Red
Deer is late,&quot; affirmed some one. &quot;Damned heavy roads!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then they've sent on a rider!&quot; cried another. &quot;Here's
Lynch's man with the bag!&quot;</p>

<p>It being the custom to address letters, papers, and pamphlets
to gentlemen at &quot;Lynch's Coffee House,&quot; there was
now a general movement of interest and expectation. A negro
carrying a pair of saddle-bags advanced, obsequious and smiling,
to a high desk at one side of the room and placed thereon
the news from the outer world The genial Mr Lynch, proprietor
of the establishment, took his place behind the desk
with due solemnity, and a score of lawyers, merchants, and
planters left tobacco, wine, julep, and toddy to press around
his temporary throne. Every day at this hour Lynch mounted
this height, and he dearly loved the transient importance. Now
he solemnly unfastened the bags, drew out a great handful
of matter, looked it over, amid laughing clamour, with pursed
lips and one raised, deprecating hand, then in a cheerful,
wheezing voice began to call out names,&mdash;&quot;Major Du Val&mdash;Major
Baker&mdash;Mr. Allan&mdash;Mr. Munford&mdash;Mr.
Chavallie&mdash;Colonel Harvie&mdash;Major Gibbon&mdash;Dr.
Foushee&mdash;Mr. Warrington&mdash;Major Willis&mdash;Mr. Wickham&mdash;Mr.
Rand&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>There was a moment's check while Lynch craned his neck.
&quot;Mr. Rand's not here, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis Rand,&mdash;no!&quot; quoth Mr. Wickham. &quot;What
should he do in a mere coffee house with mere earthly newspapers?
He's walking somewhere in a laurel garden in the
cool of the evening.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand's voice came out of the depths of the room that was
now just light enough to see the written word. &quot;I am here,
Mr. Lynch.&quot; He rose and came forward. &quot;Good-afternoon,
gentlemen&mdash;good-afternoon, Mr. Wickham!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you hear?&quot; asked Wickham coolly. &quot;Well, it is a
laurel garden, you know! Mr. Lynch, let's have candles&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Mr. Lynch. &quot;Colonel Ambler&mdash;Mr. Carrington&mdash;Mr.
Rutherfoord&mdash;Mr. Page&mdash;Mr. Cary&mdash;Mr.
Fairfax Cary&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are coming later,&quot; said a voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Mason&mdash;Mr. Carter&mdash;Mr. Call&mdash;Mr.
Cabell&mdash;the Abb&eacute; Dubois-&quot;</p>

<p>The list went on. Candles were lighted on every table and
on the mantel-shelf, though outside the windows the west was
yet red. Two negroes brought and tossed into the cavernous
fireplace a mighty backlog of hickory. The sound of the fire
mingled with the rustle of large thin sheets of paper, the crisp
turning of Auroras, National Intelligencers, Alexandria Expositors,
Gazettes of the United States, excited journals of an
excited time, with softly uttered interjections and running
comment, and with now and then a high, clear statement of
fact or rumour. At home, the hour's burning question was
that of English and Spanish depredation at sea, attack upon
neutral ships, confiscation and impressment of American sailors.
In Washington, the resolutions of Gregg and Nicholson
were under consideration, and all things looked toward the
Embargo of a year later. Abroad, the sign in the skies was
still Napoleon&mdash;Napoleon&mdash;Napoleon! Now, at Lynch's, as
the crowd increased and the first absorbed perusal of script
and print gave way to exchange of news and heated discussion,
the room began to ring with voices. Broken sentences,
words, and talismanic phrases danced as thick as motes in
a sunbeam. &quot;Non-Importation.... Gregg.... Too wholesale....
Nicholson.... Silk, window-glass.... Napoleon....
Brass, playing-cards, books, prints, beer, and ale....
Napoleon.... The Essex of Salem, the Enoch and
Rowena.... Texas&mdash;the seizure of Texas. Two millions
for the Floridas.... The Death of Pitt.... Napoleon&mdash;Austerlitz....
'Decius' in the Enquirer&mdash;that's John
Randolph of Roanoke.... 'Aurelius'&mdash;that letter of
'Aurelius'&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Rand, at the corner table, had moved his chair so as to
face the room. Letters and papers were spread before him; he
had broken the seal of a thin blue sheet and drawn a candle
close to the fine, neat, and pointed writing. The letter interested
him, and he apparently took no heed of the rapid
disjointed speech around him. But the word &quot;Aurelius&quot;
brought a sudden, darting glance, a movement of the lower
lip, and a stiffening of the shoulders. Gaudylock, who sat and
smoked, supremely indifferent to the display of newspapers,
marked the flicker of emotion. &quot;He sees a snake in the
grass,&quot; he thought lazily &quot;Who's 'Aurelius'?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand turned the thin blue page, snuffed the candle, and
fell again to his reading. Right and left the talk continued.
&quot;Glass, tin.... The Albemarle Resolutions. Great speech.
He's over there.... All this talk about Aaron Burr....
Austerlitz&mdash;twenty thousand Russians.... Westwood the
coiner got clean away on a brig for Martinique. One villain
the less here, one the more in Martinique. Martinique!
that's where the Empress Josephine comes from&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My faith!&quot; said Adam. &quot;It's worse than the mockingbirds
in June!&quot;</p>

<p>The doors opened and the two Carys entered the coffee
room. Rand lifted his eyes for a moment, then let them fall
to the third sheet of his letter. Mr. Lynch bustled forward.
&quot;Ha, Mr. Cary, your letters are waiting! Mr. Fairfax Cary,&mdash;your
servant, sir!&mdash;Eli, wine for Mr. Cary&mdash;<i>the</i> Madeira.
Christopher, more wood to the fire! The night is
falling cold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very cold, Mr. Lynch,&quot; said Ludwell Cary. &quot;Colonel
Ambler&mdash;Mr. Wickham, we meet again!&quot;&mdash;and his brother,
&quot;We never have such cold in Albemarle, Mr. Lynch!
Ha, your fire is good, and your wine's good, and your company's
good. There's a table by the fire, Ludwell.&quot;</p>

<p>They moved to it, exchanging greetings, as they went, with
half the room, sat down, drank each a glass of wine, and fell
to their letters, careless of the surrounding war of words. The
elder's mail was heavy,&mdash;letters from London, from New
York, from Philadelphia, one from his overseer at Greenwood,
others from clients, colleagues, and strangers,&mdash;all the
varied correspondence of the lawyer, the planter, and the
man of the world. Fairfax Cary's letters were fewer in number,
but one was gilt-edged, curiously folded, and superscribed
in a strong and delicate hand. &quot;Miss Dandridge
seals with a dove and an olive branch?&quot; murmured the elder
brother. &quot;Lucky Fair! What's the frown for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Olive branch?&quot; quoth the other. &quot;She should seal with
a nettle! Listen to this: 'Mr. Hunter has been some time with
us at Fontenoy. Mr. Carter spent his Christmas here&mdash;he
dances extremely well. Mr. Page gives us now and then
the pleasure of his company. He turns the leaves of my music
for me. Mr. Lee and I are reading Sir Charles Grandison
together. I see Mr. Nelson at Saint Anne's.' Saint Anne!
Saint Griselda! Her letters are enough to make a man
renounce the world, the flesh, and the devil, and turn Trappist&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish the room would turn Trappist,&quot; said the other.
&quot;I am tired of talk. I would like to be somewhere in the
woods to-night&mdash;quiet. We won't stay long here. There
has been contention enough to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>The younger leaned forward. &quot;Lewis Rand is over there&mdash;three
tables back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. I saw him when we came in. Read your letters
and we will be gone.&quot;</p>

<p>The minutes passed. Outside Lynch's the western red
faded, and the still, winter night came quickly on. Within,
fire and candles burned bright, but to not a few of Mr.
Lynch's patrons the flames danced unsteadily. It was an
age of hard drinking; the day had been an exciting one, and
Lynch's wine or punch or apple toddy but the last of many
potations. The assemblage was assuredly not drunken, but
neither was it, at this hour and after the emotional wear and
tear of the past hours, quite sane or less than hectic. Its mood
was edged. Now, in the quarter of an hour before the general
start for home and supper, foreign and federal affairs gave
way to first-hand matters and a review of the day that was
closing. It had been a field day. The city of Richmond was
strongly Federal, the General Assembly mainly Republican.
At Lynch's this evening were members, Federalist and Republican,
of the two Houses, with citizens, planters, visitors
enough of either principle. When the general talk turned
upon the Albemarle Resolutions and the morning's proceedings
in the House of Delegates, it was as though an invisible
grindstone had put upon the moment a finer edge.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand, sweeping his letters and papers together, had
nodded to Adam and moved from his table to that of a pillar
of the Republican party, with whom he was now in attentive
discourse. Apparently he gave no heed to the voices around
him, though he might have heard his own name, seeing that
wherever the talk now turned it came at last upon his speech
of that morning. Presently, &quot;Mr. Rand!&quot; called some one
from across the room.</p>

<p>Rand turned. &quot;Mr. Harrison?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Rand, there's a dispute here. Just what did you
mean by&mdash;&quot; and there followed a quotation from the morning's
speech.</p>

<p>Rand moistened his lips with wine, turned more fully in his
chair, and answered in a sentence of such pith as to bring
applause from those of his party who heard. In a moment
there was another query, then a third; he was presently committed
to a short and vigorous exposition and defence of the
point in question. The entire room became attentive. Then,
as he paused, the strident voice of a noted and irascible man
proclaimed, &quot;That's not democracy and not Jefferson&mdash;that
doctrine, Mr. Rand. Veil her as you please in gauze and
tinsel, you've got conquest by the hand. You may not think
it, but you're preaching&mdash;what's the word that 'Aurelius'
used?&mdash;'Buonapartism.'&quot;</p>

<p>A Federalist of light weight who had arrived at quarrelsomeness
and an empty bottle put in a sudden oar. &quot;'Buonapartism'
equals Ambition, and both begin with an R.&quot; He
looked pointedly at Rand.</p>

<p>&quot;My name begins with an R, sir,&quot; said Rand.</p>

<p>&quot;Pshaw! so does mine!&quot; exclaimed the man at the table
with him. &quot;Let him alone, Rand. He doesn't know what he
is saying.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand turned to the first speaker. &quot;'Buonapartism,'&mdash;that's
a word that's as ample as Charity, but I hardly think,
sir, that it covers this case. It's a very vague word. But
writers to the Gazette are apt to be more fluent than accurate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shouldn't call it vague,&quot; cried his opponent. &quot;It's a
damned good word, and so I'd tell 'Aurelius,' if I knew who
he was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn't random firing in that letter,&quot; said a voice from
another quarter of the room. &quot;I don't much care to know the
gunner, but I'd mightily like to know who was aimed at. It
was a damned definite thing, that letter. 'Buonapartism&mdash;the
will to mount&mdash;sacrifice of obligations&mdash;Genius prostituted
to Ambition&mdash;sin against light&mdash;a man's betrayal of
his highest self and his own belief&mdash;the mind's incurable
blindness&mdash;I, I am above all law&mdash;to take rich gifts and
hold the gods in contempt&mdash;D&aelig;dalus wings'&quot;&mdash;The
speaker paused to fill his glass. &quot;Yes, I should powerfully
like to know at whom 'Aurelius' was aiming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At no one, I think,&quot; said Rand coolly. &quot;He made a
scarecrow of his own, and then was frightened by it. His
chain-shot raked a man of straw,&mdash;and so would I tell
'Aurelius,' if I knew who he was.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he moved to face the fire. He had not raised
his voice, but he had given it carrying quality. Cary raised
his eyes, and laid down the paper he had in his hand. A
genial, down-river planter and magistrate entered the conversation.
&quot;Well, I for one don't hold with all this latter-day
hiding behind names out of Roman history! Brutus and Cato
and Helvidius, Decius and Aurelius, and all the rest of them!
Is a man ashamed of his English name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or afraid?&quot; said Rand, then bit his lip. He had not
meant to carry things so far, but the pent-up anger had its
way at last. His mind was weary and tense, irritable from two
sleepless nights and from futile decisions, and he inherited
a tendency to black and sudden rage. It was true he had
walked through life with a black dog at his heels. Sometimes
he turned, closed with, throttled, and flung off his pursuer;
sometimes he left him far behind; more than once he had
seen him mastered and done with, dead by the wayside, had
drawn free breath, and had gone on with a victor's brow.
Then, when all the fields were smiling, came at a bound the
dark shape, leaped at the throat, and hung there. It was so
this evening at Lynch's. He strove with his passion, but he
was aware of a wish to strive no longer, to let the black dog
have his way.</p>

<p>There was a laugh for the speaker before him. &quot;You see,
sir,&quot; cried a noted lawyer, &quot;Brutus and Cato, Helvidius,
Decius, and Aurelius, and all the noble Romans died before
duelling came in! 'Sir, the editor of the&mdash;ahem!&mdash;newspaper,
I take exception to this statement in your pages.'
'Sir, I refer you to Junius Brutus. Answer, Roman!' Never a
sound from Limbo!&mdash;'Sir, Decius has grossly misrepresented.
Where shall I send my challenge?' 'To Hades, no less!
Not the least use in knocking up John Randolph of Roanoke.'&mdash;'Sir,
I am at odds with Aurelius. Pray favour me with the
gentleman's address.' 'Sir, he left no name. You see, he
lived so long ago!'&quot;</p>

<p>Amid the laugh that followed, Cary turned a smiling face
upon the speaker. &quot;<i>I</i> will answer, Mr. Wickham, for Aurelius.
Do you really want to challenge me?&quot; He slightly
changed his position so as to confront Rand's table. &quot;In this
instance, Mr. Rand, I am certain there was no fear.&quot;</p>

<p>His speech, heard of all, wrought in various ways.
Mocket the day before had not exaggerated the general interest
in the letter signed &quot;Aurelius.&quot; Now at Lynch's there
arose a small tumult of surprise, acclaim, enthusiasm, and
dissent. His friends broke into triumph, his political enemies&mdash;he
had few others&mdash;strove for a deeper frown and a
growling note. The only indifferent in Lynch's was Adam
Gaudylock, who smoked tranquilly on, not having read the
letter in question nor being concerned with Roman history.
Lewis Rand sat in silence with compressed lips, bodily there
in the lit coffee room, but the inner man far away on the
mind's dark plains, struggling with the fiend that dogged him.
Fairfax Cary's cheek glowed and his eyes shone. He looked
at his brother, then poured a glass of wine and raised it to
his lips. &quot;Wait, Fairfax! We'll all drink with you!&quot; cried
a neighbour. &quot;Gentlemen and Federalists, glasses!&mdash;Ludwell
Cary, and may he live to hear his children's children
read 'Aurelius'!&quot;</p>

<p>The Federalists drank the toast with acclaim, while the
Republicans with equal ostentation did no such thing. Mr.
Pincornet in his corner, hearing the words &quot;Gentlemen&quot; and
&quot;Cary,&quot; drank with gusto his very thin wine, and Adam
drank because he had always liked the Carys and certainly
had no grudge against &quot;Aurelius,&quot; whoever he might be.</p>

<p>In the first lull of sound the man at the table with Lewis
Rand spoke in a loud, harsh, but agreeable voice. &quot;Well,
Mr. Cary, the staunchest of Republicans, though he can't
drink that toast, need not deny praise to a masterpiece of
words. Words, sir, not facts. What I want to know is at
whom&mdash;not at what, at <i>whom</i>&mdash;you were firing? I thought
once that Aaron Burr was your mark. But he's too light
metal&mdash;a mere buccaneer! That broadside of yours would
predicate a general foe&mdash;and I'm damned if I wouldn't
like to know his name!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We would all like to know his name,&quot; said Rand. &quot;And
when we know it, I for one would like to hear Mr. Cary's
proofs of faithlessness to obligations.&quot;</p>

<p>In the hush of expectation which fell upon the room the
eyes of the two men met. In Rand's there was something cold
and gleaming, something that was not his father's nor his
grandfather's, but his own, deadly but markedly courageous.
Cary's look was more masked, grave, and collected, with the
merest quiver of the upper lip. In the mind of each the curtain
strangely lifted, not upon Richmond or Fontenoy or the
Court House at Charlottesville, but upon a long past day and
the Albemarle woods and two boys gathering nuts together.
This lasted but an instant, then Cary spoke. &quot;In that letter,
Judge Roane, 'Aurelius' had no thought of Aaron Burr. I
doubt if in writing he meant to give to any image recognizable
face and form. I think that, very largely, he believed
himself but personifying the powers of evil and the tendencies
thereto inherent in the Democrat-Republican as in all human
doctrine. If he builded better than he knew, if he held the
mirror up, if, in short, there's any whom the cap fits&quot;&mdash;He
paused a moment, then said sternly, &quot;Let the wearer, whoever
he may be, look to his steps!&quot; and turned to face Rand.
&quot;Seeing there is no name to divulge, there are of course no
proofs of faithlessness.&quot; He rose. &quot;It is growing late, gentlemen,
and I, for one, am committed to Mrs. Ambler's party.
Who goes towards the Eagle?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a movement throughout the coffee room. It was
full dark, home beckoned, and a number besides Cary were
pledged to the evening's entertainment. From every table
men were rising, gathering up their papers, when Rand's
voice, harsh, raised, and thick with passion, jarred the room.
&quot;I hold, Mr. Cary, that not even to please his fine imagination
is a gentleman justified in publicly weaving caps of so
particular a description!&quot;</p>

<p>Cary turned sharply. &quot;Not even when he weaves it for a
man of straw?&mdash;your own expression, Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even men of straw,&quot; answered the other thickly, &quot;find
sometimes a defender. By God, I'll not endure it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All this,&quot; said Cary scornfully,&mdash;&quot;all this for the usual,
the familiar, the expected Federalist criticism of Republican
precept and practice! What, specifically, is it, Mr. Rand,
that you'll not endure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll endure,&quot; replied Rand, in a strained, monotonous,
and menacing voice, &quot;no taunt from you.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he threw himself forward. &quot;Have a care, sir!&quot;
cried Cary, and flung out his arm. He had seen, and the men
around had seen, the intention of the blow. It was not struck.
Amid the commotion that arose, Rand suddenly, and with an
effort so violent and so directed that it had scarcely been in the
scope of any other there, checked himself upon the precipice's
verge, stood rigid, and strove with white lips for self-command.
His inmost, his highest man had no desire to feel or
to exhibit ungoverned rage, but there was a legion against
him&mdash;and the black and furious dog. The coffee house
was in a ferment. &quot;Gentlemen&mdash;gentlemen!&mdash;What's the
quarrel, Rand?&mdash;Ludwell Cary, I'm at your service!&mdash;Bills
and bows! bills and bows!&mdash;or is it coffee and pistols?&quot;
Fairfax Cary had sprung to his brother's side. Adam Gaudylock,
annihilating in some mysterious fashion the distance
between the corner table and the group in the light of the fire,
was visible over Rand's shoulder. Mr. Pincornet, chin in air
and with his hand where once a sword had been, tiptoed upon
the fringe of the crowd. The clamour went on. &quot;Is it a
challenge?&mdash;was
a blow struck?&mdash;Mr. Cary, command me&mdash;Mr. Rand&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Cary and Rand, standing opposed, three feet of bare floor
between them, looked fixedly at each other. Both were pale,
both breathing heavily, but for both the unthinking moment
had passed. Reflection had come and was standing there
between them. To Rand it wore more faces than one, but to
Cary it was steadily a form in white with amethysts about the
neck. There had been&mdash;it was well, it was best&mdash;no blow
struck, no lie given. Cary drew a long breath, shook himself
slightly like a swimmer who has breasted a formidable wave,
and broke into a laugh. &quot;No affront and no challenge, gentlemen!
That is so, is it not, Mr. Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>If there was an instant's sombre hesitation, it was no more.
&quot;Yes, that is so,&quot; said Rand. &quot;After all, men should be more
stable. There is no quarrel, gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p>He bowed ceremoniously to Cary, who returned the salute.
Each moved from where he had stood, and the tide at
Lynch's came between them. There was some questioning,
some excited speech, some natural disappointment at matters
going no further. It was not clearly understood what offence
had been given or what taken, but many felt aggrieved by the
check on the threshold of a likely affair. However, it was,
they could concede, the business of the two principals, each
of whom could afford to ignore any seeming reflection upon
his unreadiness to pick up the glove&mdash;if a glove had been
thrown. As the assemblage broke up and flowed homeward,
the most pertinent comment, perhaps, was that of the down-river
planter: &quot;If 'twas just a breeze, and all over, why
didn't they shake hands? Gad! when I was young and we
fell out and made up over the wine, we went roaring home
arm over shoulder! Your manners are too cold. A bow is
nothing&mdash;one can bow to a villain! Men of honour, when
the quarrel's over, should shake hands!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Precisely,&quot; said his companion, who chanced to be Mr.
Wickham. &quot;They are men of honour; they didn't shake
hands. <i>Ergo</i> the quarrel's not over!&mdash;Here we are at the
Eagle.&quot;</p>

<h3>FAIRFAX AND UNITY</h3>


<p>&quot;Bah!&quot; exclaimed Major Churchill. &quot;Long ago Hamilton
said the last word on the subject. Aaron Burr's
sole political principle is to <i>mount</i>. The Gazette says
he has started West&mdash;gone, I'll swear, to light the fuse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I hope the mine will blow up under him,&quot; said
Fairfax Cary. &quot;Can you tell me, sir, if Miss Dandridge is at
home?&quot;</p>

<p>The Major looked over the top of his Gazette. &quot;Miss
Dandridge is sitting beneath the catalpa tree.&quot; The other
made a movement towards the door. &quot;Mr. Page is with her.
He is reading aloud&mdash;Elo&iuml;sa to Abelard, or some such impassioned
stuff. Don't apologize! I have no objection to
expletives.&quot;</p>

<p>The younger Cary laid down his hat, took a chair with
great deliberation, and flecked his boot with his riding-whip.
&quot;The catalpa shall be sacred for me. Elo&iuml;sa to Abelard! Is
it a long poem, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is longer than its author was. Sentimental rubbish!&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward folded the Gazette with his one hand,
laid it on the library table, and leaned back in his leather
chair. &quot;It is not my opinion that Unity cares for Mr. Page.
She cares for what many men and an occasional woman
have cared for&mdash;liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would give her liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She may possibly prefer it,&quot; said the Major dryly, &quot;first
hand.&quot;</p>

<p>The young man laughed ruefully. &quot;So little liberty as she
has left me! I am bound hand and foot to her chariot wheels.
There's nothing I wouldn't do for her, short of hearing
Page read aloud.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll win in the end, I think. And I hope you may.
Unity Dandridge is wilful, but she is a fine woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The finest in the world&mdash;the most beautiful&mdash;the most
sparkling&mdash;the most loyal&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll not find her lacking in spirit. She will speak her
mind, will Miss Dandridge! The Carys, fortunately, have a
certain fine obstinacy of their own. It is a saving grace.&quot;</p>

<p>The other laughed. &quot;I never heard that the Churchills
lacked it, sir. Anyhow, I mean to marry Miss Dandridge.
I've told her and the world my intention, and they may count
upon my carrying it out. If she only knew how lonely it is
at Greenwood! Breakfast, dinner, and supper&mdash;Ludwell
at the head of the table and I at the foot, and a company of
ghosts in between&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwell may yet marry.&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary shook his head. &quot;No. He'll never marry.
If the Carys are obstinate, sir, they are also constant.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Churchill rose, turned to the bookshelves, and drew
forth a volume. &quot;Is he not over that?&quot; he asked harshly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, he is not. He'll never be over it. And they say
matches are made in heaven!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bah! They are made on earth, and cracked hearts can be
mended like any other cracked ware. 'A little crudded milk,
fantastical puff-paste,' with a woman's name&mdash;and it has
power to turn the sunshine black! Let him play the man and
put her out of mind!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He does play the man,&quot; answered the other, with spirit.
&quot;He neither sulks nor shirks. It remains that there was but
one woman in the world for him, and that she is at Roselands
with Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major's book fell with a crash to the floor. He stooped
quickly and recovered it before the younger man could give
him service. &quot;I shall run Mustapha on the sixteenth at
Staunton against Carter's York,&quot; he said, in a shaking voice.
&quot;Have you seen that Barbary mare Dick has gotten over from
England?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; answered the young man. &quot;I'll take a look at the
stables before I go. What is your book, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is&quot;&mdash;said the Major. &quot;I'm damned if I know what
it is!&quot; and he looked at the volume in his hand. &quot;Paul and
Virginia&mdash;faugh!&quot; He threw the book down and stalked
to the window. Fairfax Cary sat in silence, one booted knee
over the other, an arm upon the back of his chair, and the
riding-whip depending from his hand. The Major turned.
&quot;They have laid down Pope, and Mr. Page is making his
adieux! Humph! I can remember a day when the poem was
considered vastly moving. I would advise you to strike while
the iron is hot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes I think it will take an earthquake to move her
toward me,&quot; said the other. &quot;I'll give Page three minutes
in which to clear out, and then I'll try again. It would amuse
you, sir, to know how many times I have tried. If to have an
object in life is praiseworthy, I am much to be lauded!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have always evinced a fine determination,&quot; admitted
the Major. &quot;Well, life must have an object, fair or foul.
With it, cark and care; without it, ditchwater! This way disappointment;
that, fungi on a log. Vanity in either direction,
but a man of honour must prefer the rack to the stocks.&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary looked at his watch. &quot;Page's time is up.
I'll go pursue my object, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The pursuit took him over the greensward to the bench
built around the great catalpa. The heat of the day was
broken and the evening shadows lay upon the grass. Mr.
Page was gone. Unity sat beneath the catalpa, elbow on knee
and chin in hand, studying a dandelion at her feet. The
poetical works of Mr. Alexander Pope lay at a distance, face
down. The sky between the broad catalpa leaves was very
blue, and a long ray of sunshine sifted through to gild the
tendrils of Miss Dandridge's hair and to slide in brightness
down her flowery gown. She glanced at the young man
striding towards her from the house, then again admired the
dandelion.</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary stooped, picked up Pope, and regarded the
open pages with disfavour. &quot;And at home he probably reads
only The Complete Farrier&mdash;on Sundays maybe the Gentleman's
Magazine or The Book of Dreams!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot; asked Unity.</p>

<p>&quot;My rival. If he read Greek, he would yet be my rival and
an ignorant fellow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He does read Greek,&quot; said Miss Dandridge severely,
&quot;and 'ignorant fellow' is the last thing that could be applied
to him. Did you ride over from Greenwood to be scornful?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I rode over to be as meek as Moses and as patient as
Job&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They were never my favourites in Scripture.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor mine.&quot; He closed the book, swung his arm, and
Pope crashed into a lilac bush. &quot;There,&quot; he said, &quot;goes
meekness, patience, and the eighteenth century. This is the
nineteenth. Time is no endless draught, no bottomless cup.
Waste of life is the cankered rose. You know that you treat
me badly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do I?&mdash;I did not mean to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do. Now you've got to say to me, 'I love you and
I'll marry you,' or 'I love you not and I'm going to marry
some one else.' If it's the first, I'll be the happiest man on
earth; if the second, I'll go far away and try to forget.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you sit down?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have kept me standing in spirit these three years.
Standing!&mdash;kneeling! Now, will you or won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not care in the least for Mr. Page. He is merely an
agreeable acquaintance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Mr. Dabney?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The same. He entertains me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Lee&mdash;Mr. Minor&mdash;Ned Hunter&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What applies to one applies to all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad to hear it. All merely agreeable acquaintances.
And Mr. Fairfax Cary? He is, perhaps, in the same category?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps. Oh, what a beautiful butterfly!&mdash;there, on that
trumpet flower! I think it is a Tawny Emperor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; said the young man. &quot;Excuse me a moment while
I frighten him away.&quot; He gravely shook the trumpet vine, and
the light splendour spread its wings and sailed to a securer
realm. &quot;Now that the Emperor is gone perhaps you will pay
attention. Am <i>I</i> merely an agreeable acquaintance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh&mdash;agreeable!&quot; murmured Miss Dandridge.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not trying to be agreeable. I am looking for the
truth. Am I, then, merely an acquaintance?&quot;</p>

<p>Unity sighed. &quot;Why not say 'friend'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Friend' is good as far as it goes. It does not go far
enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it does,&quot; said Miss Dandridge. &quot;It goes further than
all your less sober travellers.</p>

<p>
&quot;Love me little, love me long.<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;You want such violent things!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you. Is it, then, only a poor, pale friendship?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why call it poor and pale? Friendship can be rosy-cheeked
as well as&mdash;as other things. Look how the grass is
burned&mdash;and all the locusts are singing of the heat!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is beneath you to trifle so. If this is all, it is poor and
pale, and the sooner it dies, the better! Unity, I'm waiting
for your <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm tired,&quot; said Unity. &quot;You hurt me, and I'm tired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never heard you say that before. Look at me! the tears
are in your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everybody cries over Elo&iuml;sa to Abelard.</p>

<p>
&quot;O death all-eloquent! you only prove<br />
What dust we dote on, when't is man we love!<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Home first, then&mdash;I don't know where. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid the book in the lilac bush is spoiled. If you'll
allow me, I'll send you another copy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please don't go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The tears are on your cheeks. It is a moving poem.</p>

<p>
&quot;Oh, may we never love as those have loved!<br />
</p>

<p>&quot;This is the third and last good-bye. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>The younger Cary turned and resolutely walked away.
Miss Dandridge rose and followed him. He did not turn his
head, and the thick turf could not echo her light footfall. He
walked firmly, with the port of a man who hears a distant
drum beat to action. Miss Dandridge admired the attitude
through her tears. He walked rapidly and the sweep of greensward
between them widened. It was no great distance to the
driveway and the white pillars of the house. Uncle Dick and
Uncle Edward, Deb, the servants, any one, might be looking
out of the windows. For one moment Unity stopped short as
Atalanta when she saw the golden apple, then she began to
run. She touched her goal within ten feet of the house,
and he stood still and looked at the hand upon his arm.
&quot;Oh!&quot; she panted. &quot;Don't go! I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you. Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>If any window saw, it was discreet and never told, remembering
perhaps a youth of its own. The embrace was
not prolonged beyond a minute. Unity, red and beautiful,
released herself, looked about her like a startled dryad, and
made again for the catalpa. Fairfax Cary followed, and they
took that portion of the circular bench which had between it
and the house the giant bole of the tree. Before them dipped
the shady hollow, filled with the rustling of leaves, cool and
retired as its parent forest.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, yes; it's true, gospel true!&quot; cried Unity. &quot;But
I'll not be married for a long, long year!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A year! You're going to be cruel again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, I'm not cruel! I never was. 'Twas all your
imagination. When I marry, I'll be married hard and fast,
hand and foot, wind and rain, sleet and snow, June and
December, forever and a day, world without end, amen!
holidays and all! I may live forever, and I'll be married all
that time. I want just one little year to say good-bye to Unity
Dandridge in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll take her to Greenwood with us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no. We'll bury her in the flower garden the day
before. Just one year&mdash;please!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Unity, when you say 'please'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is August. I'll marry you twelve little months from
now&mdash;please!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A thousand things may happen&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They won't&mdash;they won't. Don't you love Unity Dandridge?
Then let her live a little longer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kiss me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Unity did as she was bid. The sunlight left the hollow, but
stayed bright upon the hills beyond. It was August, but in
a treetop somewhere a solitary bird was singing. Nearer the
earth the crickets and cicadas began their evening concert, a
shrill drumming in the warm, still air. There was a scent of
dry grass, a feeling of summer at its full. Dewy freshness, tender
green, mist of bloom, and a thousand songs were far away,
and yet upon the bench beneath the catalpa there was spring.</p>

<p>&quot;The sun is setting,&quot; said Unity at last. &quot;Let us go speak
to Uncle Dick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He'll be glad, I think. May I stay to supper? I want
to hear Unity Dandridge sing afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Uncle Dick will be glad&mdash;he and Uncle Edward
will be very glad. I don't believe that Unity Dandridge will
want to sing to-night. She'll be thinking of that grave in the
flower garden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! She shall think of the sunrise at Greenwood&mdash;sunrise
and splendid roses and the million harps of heaven
playing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Unity, &quot;the sunrise at Greenwood should
have been for your brother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, for him and your cousin. Blind fate! He is worth
a thousand of me, and he sits lonely there in his house&mdash;and
I am here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no pure joy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I tell him to-night, he will feel but pure joy for me&mdash;not
one thought of self, of the sunrise he might have
watched at Greenwood! Oh, Justice and her balances!
There goes the last rim of the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll sing to you what you will&mdash;and you may stay as
long as you like&mdash;and I'll love you all my life. Oh! Now
let's go find Uncle Dick.&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Dick was easily found, being in fact upon the porch
in his especial chair, with the dogs around him, and in his
hand a silver goblet of mint and apple brandy. &quot;Hey!
What, what!&quot; he cried, &quot;has the jade said Yes at last?
Where's Edward? Edward, Edward! Kiss me, you minx!
Fair, I wish that my dear friend, your father, were alive.
Well, well, patience does it, and the Lord knows, Unity, he's
been patient! Oh, you black-eyed piece, you need a bit and
bridle! Here's Edward! Edward, the shrew's tamed at
last! Such a wedding as Fontenoy will have!&quot;</p>

<p>Four hours later, when supper was over, and Aunt Nancy
in the &quot;chamber&quot; had been visited by the affianced pair, and
all matters had been discussed, and Unity at the harpsichord
had sung without protest a number of very sentimental songs,
and Deb had gone unwillingly to bed, and first one uncle and
then the other had thoughtfully faded from the drawing-room,
and good-night, when it came to be said in the moonlit
porch, took ten minutes to say, and the boy who brought
around the visitor's horse had caught with a grin and a
&quot;Thank'e, sah!&quot; the whirling silver dollar, and Major
Edward's voice had sounded from the hail door behind Unity,
&quot;Good-night, Fair; bring Ludwell with you to-morrow night,&quot;
and Unity had echoed softly, &quot;Yes, bring Ludwell,&quot; and the
last wave of the hand had been given, Fairfax Cary cantered
down the driveway and through the lower gates. Out upon
the red highway he put his horse to the gallop, and rode
with his bared head high to the wind and the stars of night.</p>

<p>At Greenwood there was but one light burning. He saw
it half a mile from the house, lost it, then caught it again,
crowning like a star the low hilltop. Bending from the saddle,
he opened the gate, passed through, and rode on beneath the
oaks to the house door. The light shone from the library.
When a negro had taken his horse, the younger Cary entered
to find his brother sitting before a mass of books and papers,
wine on the table, and a favourite dog asleep upon the hearth.
&quot;You are late,&quot; said the elder, looking up with a smile.
&quot;Fontenoy, of course?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fontenoy, of course. Ludwell, I've won!&quot;</p>

<p>The elder brother pushed back his chair, rose, and, going
to the younger, put both hands upon his shoulders. &quot;Fair.
I'm glad! I told you that you would. She's the loveliest
black-eyed lady&mdash;and as for you, you deserve your fortune!
<i>Monsieur mon fr&egrave;re</i>, I make you my congratulations!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a blaze of light you've got in here! All the way home
my horse's hoofs were saying, <i>Unity Cary&mdash;Unity Cary</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Ludwell laughed. &quot;You're drunk with joy. The room is
not brightly lit. Sit down and tell me all about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Twas underneath the catalpa tree. We quarrelled&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As usual.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Page had been there, reading aloud,&mdash;reading Elo&iuml;sa to
Abelard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We quarrelled. I said good-bye forever, and walked
away. She came after me over the grass. Ludwell, to hold the
woman that you love in your arms, close, close&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can guess 'twas bliss. And then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heaven still&mdash;only quieter. We went back to the bench
under the catalpa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Happy tree! And I never thought it a poetic growth&mdash;the
flowers are so sticky! Now Unity shall plant one at Greenwood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Unity'! Isn't it sweet to say just 'Unity'?&quot;</p>

<p>The other laughed again. &quot;I think you are a very satisfactory
lover! And when's the marriage, Fair?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not for a whole year&mdash;she won't marry me for a whole
year to come!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, that's too long,&quot; said the elder kindly. &quot;What
reason?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Time to say farewell. Once she's married, she will never
see Unity Dandridge again!&quot;</p>

<p>Both laughed, but there was much tenderness in their
laughter. &quot;Oh, she's individual!&quot; said Ludwell. &quot;Even
when you add the Cary, she'll be Unity Dandridge still. A
year! Perhaps she may relent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've given my word not to ask her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&mdash;well, a year's not so long, Fair. She's a lovely
witch&mdash;she'll charm the hours away. This time next year
how gay we'll make the old house!&quot;</p>

<p>The younger paced the room. &quot;I can't go to bed.
Michaelmas&mdash;Christmas&mdash;St. Valentine's&mdash;Easter&mdash;the
Fourth&mdash;then August again. Twelve months!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll ride to Fontenoy in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true&mdash;and you'll ride with me. The last thing
that she said was that I was to bring you. Ludwell, I want
to say that not even Unity, though I love her so much, could
ever make me love you an iota the less. You know that, don't
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know, Fair,&quot; said the other from the great chair.
&quot;We are friends as well as brothers. I'm as glad for your
happiness as if it were my own, and I'll ride with you to
Fontenoy to kiss my new sister. You've both chosen wisely,
and it's a great day for Greenwood! Stop that striding here
and there like an ecstatic lion! Sit down and tell me all about
it again. The wine's good, and I'll light more candles.
There!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're the best fellow in the world, Ludwell,&quot; said the
younger gratefully. &quot;She had on a gown with little flowers
all over a yellowy ground, and there was a curl that came
down on her white neck&mdash;and when I had gone away forever
and then felt her hand upon my arm, it was like a sword-stroke
opening Paradise. It isn't really late, is it? I could
talk till dawn!&quot;</p>

<h3>THE GREEN DOOR</h3>


<p>The coach of Mrs. Jane Selden entered Charlottesville
at nine in the morning, and did not turn homeward
again until the afternoon stood at four. The
intermediate hours were diligently used by the small and
withered lady in plum-coloured silk and straw bonnet, scarf
of striped, apple-green gauze, and turkey-feather fan. She
came to town but once in three months, and made of each
visit a field day. Every store was called at, for buying must
be done for herself and her plantation to last until Christmas-tide.
Lutestring, calico, chintz and prunella, linsey and
osnaburg; gilt-edged paper, sticks of wax, and fine black
ink; drugs of sorts, bohea, spice, and china were bought and
bestowed in brown paper parcels in corners of a vehicle
ample as Cinderella's pumpkin coach, while Jamaica sugar
and Java coffee, old rum, molasses, salt and vinegar, hardware,
kitchen things, needs of the quarter, and all heavy
matters were left to be called for by her wagon next day.
Shopping over, she took dinner with an ancient friend, and
afterwards called upon the doctor and the minister. The
post-office came next in order, and then the blacksmith, for
one of her four sleepy coach horses had cast a shoe. The
fault remedied, she looked at her watch. &quot;Half-past three.
Stop at the green door, Gabriel.&quot;</p>

<p>Coach and four made a wide turn, swung drowsily down
the main street, and drew up before a one-story brick building
with a green door and a black lettered sign above, &quot;Lewis
Rand, Attorney-at-Law.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden, putting her head out of the window, directed
a small negro, lounging near, to raise the knocker below the
sign; but before she could be obeyed, the door opened and
Rand himself came quickly down the steps. &quot;Come, come!&quot;
he said; &quot;I knew it was your day in town, and I was wondering
if you were going by without a word.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't I always stop? A habit is a habit. We are all
miserable sinners, and the world can't get on without lawyers.
I want to ask you how I'm to keep old Tom Carfax off my
land. There is no one with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one. Mocket has ridden over to North Garden, and
I've just dismissed a deputation from Milton.&quot; As he spoke,
he opened the coach door and assisted his old friend to alight.</p>

<p>Together they went into the office, which was a cool little
place, with a climbing rose at the windows, a bare floor, and
a dim fragrance of law-books. The shade was grateful after
the August heat and glare. Mrs. Selden, seated in a capacious
wooden chair, wielded her turkey fan and looked about
her at the crowded book-shelves, the mass of papers held
down on desk and deal table by pieces of iron ore, the land
maps on the wall, the corner ledger and high stool, the cupboard
whose opened door disclosed bottles and glasses, and
the blush roses just without the two small windows. &quot;I like
the law,&quot; she remarked. &quot;There's a deal of villainy in it, no
doubt, but that's a complaint to which all ways of making a
living are liable. Even a shoemaker may be a villain. How
does it feel to be a great lawyer, Lewis?&quot;</p>

<p>He smiled. &quot;Am I a great one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should know best, but it's what men call you.
What was your deputation from Milton? About the governorship?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thanked them for the honour they did me, and told them
that I had declined the nomination.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have declined it! Why?&quot;</p>

<p>He smiled again. &quot;You used to preach contentment
when I was a boy and you heard me rage out against my
father. Well&mdash;shall I not rest content with being a great
lawyer?&quot;</p>

<p>His old neighbour regarded him keenly above her turkey-feather
fan. &quot;Lewis Rand, Lewis Rand,&quot; she said at last,
&quot;I wish I knew your end.&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed. &quot;Do you mean my aim in life, or my last
hour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The one,&quot; said his visitor sharply, &quot;will be according to
the other. We all wander through a wood into some curious
place at last. You're the kind of person one thinks of
as coming into a stranger place than common. Have you
heard the news about Unity Dandridge and Fairfax Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. She was at Roselands yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's good news. Unity Dandridge needs a master, and
there's been no woman at Greenwood this weary while.
Ludwell Cary will never marry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see nothing to prevent his marrying.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden suspended the waving of her fan. &quot;He won't.
Don't dislike him so, Lewis. It shows in your forehead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it so plain as that?&quot; asked Rand. &quot;Well, I do dislike
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enmities are born with us, I suppose,&quot; said his visitor
thoughtfully. &quot;I remember a man whom, without reason,
I hated. Had I been a man, I would have made it my study
to quarrel with him&mdash;to force him into a duel&mdash;to make
way with him secretly if need be! I wouldn't have stopped
at murder. And it was all a mistake, as I found when he was
dead and I didn't have to walk the same earth with him any
more. It's a curious world, is the heart of man. And so
you won't be Governor of Virginia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not now&mdash;some later day, perhaps. You see it takes
all my time to be a great lawyer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't deceive me,&quot; said Mrs. Selden, with great
dryness. &quot;But good or bad, your reason's your own, and
I'll not ask you to satisfy an old woman's curiosity. In my
day it was something to be Governor of Virginia.&quot;
She waved her fan more vigorously than before, and the
wind from it blew a paper from the table beside her. She
was birdlike in her movements, and before Rand could stoop,
she had caught the sheet. &quot;Rows and rows of figures!&quot; she
exclaimed. &quot;Is it a sum you're doing?&quot;</p>

<p>He nodded, taking it from her. &quot;Yes; a giant of a sum,&quot;
he answered easily, and put the paper in his pocket. &quot;Now
what is old Carfax doing on your land?&quot;</p>

<p>The consultation over, Mrs. Selden left the office and was
handed by Rand into the pumpkin coach. When he had
closed the door, he yet stood beside the lowered glass, his
arm, sleeved in fine green cloth, laid along its rim, his strong
face, clear cut and dark, smiling in upon his old friend. In
his mind was the long and dreary stretch of his boyhood
when she and Adam Gaudylock were the only beings towards
whom he had a friendly thought. He was one of those men
whose minds still hold communion with all the selves that
they have left behind. Each in its day had been a throbbing,
vital thing, and though at times he found the past obtrusive
and wished to throw it off, he could never utterly do
so. There was for him no Lethe. But if he tasted the disadvantages
of so compound a self, to others the array enriched
the man, making him vibrant of all that had been as well
as all that was. It put them, too, to speculation as to how
great an army he would gather ere the end, and as to the nature
of the last recruit. The visitor from the Three-Notched
Road looked at him now with her keen old eyes and laid her
mittened hand upon his arm. &quot;Be a good man, Lewis Rand!
Be a great one if you will, but be good. That comes first.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand touched her withered hand with his lips. &quot;It is
women who are good. And you'll not come to town again
until nearly Christmas! I'll ride over before then, and I'll
settle Carfax for you. You are going home now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Vinie Mocket is cutting watermelon rind for me. I'll
stop there first and then I'll go home! Give my love to
Jacqueline. I heard at the Swan that Mr. Jefferson is at
Monticello. Is that true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Humph!&quot; said Mrs. Selden. &quot;Then you'll be at Monticello
all hours. I wish you'd ask him for a seedling of that
new peach tree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not be there all hours,&quot; said Rand, &quot;but I'll
manage to get the seedling for you. Good-bye, good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>The coach and four lumbered on down the dusty Main
Street. Mrs. Selden, sitting opposite her brown paper bundles,
waved her fan and looked out on the parching trees and the
straggling, vine-embowered houses. For half an hour there
had been a thought at the back of her head, and now it
suddenly opened wings. Those strangely arranged lines of
figures on that paper which had fluttered to the floor, they
formed no sum that Lewis Rand was working! The paper
that they covered was not a stray leaf; it had been folded like
a letter. There was, she remembered, a piece of wax upon
it. It was a day when men of mark often wrote to each
other in cipher&mdash;there was nothing strange in Lewis Rand
so corresponding with whom he chose. Most probably it
was a letter from the President&mdash;though that could hardly
be, seeing that the President was at Monticello! Mrs. Selden
looked out of the window towards that low, green mountain
which was now rising before her, and frowningly tried to
remember some gossamer of speech which had been blown
to her upon the Three-Notched Road. A quarrel between
Rand and the President?&mdash;pshaw! it could hardly have
been that! She had a sudden memory of Rand's face ere he
grew to manhood, of the ardent eyes and the involuntary
gesture of reverence which he used when he spoke of Mr.
Jefferson. He could not even speak of him without a certain
trembling of the voice. Any one could see the change in
him since then, but it was hardly to be believed that the old
feeling did not abide at the bottom of the well! Mrs. Selden
was annoyed. The letter might have been from Mr. Madison,
or Mr. Monroe, or Albert Gallatin, or John Randolph,&mdash;though
John Randolph, too, had quarrelled with the President,&mdash;or
Spencer Roane, or almost any great Democrat-Republican.
It was no business of hers whom it was from.
A colour crept into her withered cheek, and she tapped her
black silk shoe upon the floor of the coach. &quot;Yes; a giant
of a sum,&quot; Lewis had said with great easiness, and then had
put the paper out of sight. Why had he not been frank?
He might have said to an old friend, &quot;That's a cipher,&mdash;you
see men will be riddlers still!&quot; and then have laid away
the letter as securely as he pleased! Mrs. Selden hated deceit
in anything, great or small, and hated to find flaws in
folk of whom she was fond. It was a trifle truly, but Lewis
Rand had meant to give her a false impression, and that
when he knew as well as she how she detested falsity! As
for his reasons for concealment,&mdash;let him keep his reasons!
She angrily told herself that Jane Selden had no desire to
pry into a politician's secrets. But he should have said that the
letter was a letter! With which conclusion, the coach having
drawn up before Vinie Mocket's door, Mrs. Selden dismissed
the matter from her mind, and, descending, was met by
Vinie herself at the gate.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got the sweetmeats all cut, Mrs. Selden! Grapes and
baskets, and hearts with arrows through them, and vases
of roses. I never did any prettier. Won't you come in,
ma'am? There's water just drawn from the well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'll have a glass, and I'll just look at the sweetmeats.
It is late and I must be going home. Vinie, why
don't you have your gate mended?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It always was broken,&quot; said Vinie. &quot;I'm always meaning
to have it mended. Will you sit on the porch, ma'am? It's
cooler than inside.&quot;</p>

<p>The short path was lined with zinnias and with prince's
feather and the porch covered with a shady grapevine.
Vinie brought a pitcher beaded with cool well water, and
then a salver spread with fanciful shapes cut from the
delicate green rind of melon and ready for preserving. Mrs.
Selden drank the well water and approved Vinie's skill;
then, &quot;Your brother's gone to North Garden,&quot; she said
abruptly. &quot;Mr. Rand's affairs must keep him busy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, ma'am. Tom comes and goes,&quot; said Vinie wistfully.
&quot;I wish he'd be Governor of Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who? Tom?&quot;</p>

<p>The girl laughed. &quot;La, no, ma'am! Mr. Rand.&quot; The
tone conveyed, pleasantly enough, both the grotesque impossibility
of Mr. Tom Mocket aspiring to such a post, and
the eminent suitability of its lying in the fortunes of Lewis
Rand. Vinie, shy and pink and faintly pretty in her shell
calico, leaned against the wooden railing beneath the grapevine,
and appealed to her visitor: &quot;I'm always after Tom
to make him say he'll run. Tom can do a great deal with
him&mdash;he always could. I reckon all his friends want him to
take the nomination. But Tom says he has a bigger thing
in mind&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who? Tom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, ma'am. Mr. Rand. I forgot! Tom said I wasn't
to tell that to any one.&quot; Vinie looked distressed. &quot;Won't
you have another glass of water, ma'am? The drouth this
year is something awful&mdash;all the corn burned up and the
tobacco failing. Tom will be back soon from North Garden.
Yeth, ma'am, he works right hard for Mr. Rand. The last
time he was here he said that whether he ended in a palace
or a dungeon, he'd remember Tom somewhere towards
the last. Yeth, ma'am, it was a funny thing to say, but he
was always mighty fond of Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does he come here often?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right often,&mdash;when there's work to be done at night,
or when he wants to meet some one at a quieter place than
the office. He's always known he could use this house as he
pleased,&quot; Vinie ended simply. &quot;Tom and I would go barefoot
over fire for Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, my dear, I hope he won't ask you to,&quot; said her
visitor, with dryness. She rose. &quot;I've a long drive before
me, so I'll not sit longer. Who's that&mdash;I left my glasses
in the coach&mdash;who's that speaking to Gabriel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Mr. Gaudylock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gaudylock! He's not been in Albemarle for a year!
When did he come back?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just the other day, ma'am.&quot; A smile crept over Vinie's
face. &quot;He brought me a comb like the Spanish women wear.
He's a mighty kind man&mdash;Mr. Gaudylock.&quot;</p>

<p>The hunter and Mrs. Selden met at the broken gate. &quot;I
am glad to see you back, Adam,&quot; she said. &quot;You're a rolling
stone, but all the same we're fond of you in Albemarle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm surely fond of Albemarle, ma'am,&quot; answered Adam.</p>

<p>&quot;When I've rolled long and far enough and the moss is
ready to gather on me, I reckon I'll roll back to a hillside
in the old county. I'm sorry to see the drouth so bad.
We've had a power of rain over the mountains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not long since, I had a letter from a kinsman of mine in
Louisiana, and he spoke of you. He said that up and down
the rivers you were known, that the villages made it a holiday
when you came to one, and that in the forest your name
was like Robin Hood's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Robin Hood? Who's he?&quot; demanded Adam; then, &quot;Oh,
you mean the man in the poetry book. I reckon he never
saw the Mississippi in flood, and his forest would have laid
on the palm of your hand. Yes, I'm known out there.&quot;
He gave his mellow laugh. &quot;A letter of introduction from
Adam Gaudylock is a pretty good letter, whether it's to
the captain of an ark, or a Creek sachem, or a Natchitoches
settler, or a soldier at Fort Stoddert. Let me help you in,
ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p>He handed her to her seat with the sure lightness and the
woodsman's grace which was part of his charm, then gave
her order to Gabriel. The coach turned and went back
through the Main Street, and so on, in the yellow afternoon,
to the Three-Notched Road. As she passed again the green
door, Mrs. Selden looked out, but the door was fast and
the shutters closed behind the blush roses. &quot;He must have
gone home early,&quot; she said to herself, and all the way along
the Three-Notched Road she thought of Lewis Rand and
his career.</p>

<p>Rand had not gone home, but was walking down the
street towards the Eagle and the post-office. Presently the
stage would be in, and he carried a letter the posting of
which he did not care to entrust to another. He walked
lightly and firmly, in the glow before sunset, and as he approached
the post-office steps he met, full face, coming from
the other end of the town, Colonel Richard and Major Edward
Churchill and Fairfax Cary. They were afoot, having
left their horses at the Swan while they waited for the incoming
stage. The post-office had a high white porch, and
on this were gathered a number of planters and townsfolk,
while others lounged below on the trodden grass beneath
three warped mulberries. All these, suspending conversation,
watched the encounter.</p>

<p>Rand lifted his hat, and Fairfax Cary answered the
salute with cold punctilio, but the two Churchills, the one
with a red, the other with a stony countenance, ignored their
nephew-in-law. The four reached together the post-office
steps, a somewhat long and wide flight, but not broad enough
to accommodate a blood feud. Rand made no attempt at
speech, conciliatory or otherwise, but with a slight gesture
of courtesy stood aside for the two elder men to pass and
precede him. The smile upon his lip was half bitter, half
philosophic, and as they passed, he regarded them aslant
but freely. The burly, heated figure of the Colonel was
trembling with anger, while Major Edward, striving for indifference,
achieved only a wonderful, grey hauteur. They
had been talking of the drouth, and they talked on while they
went by Rand, but their voices sounded hollow like drums
in a desert. They took as little outward notice of the living
man whose fate entwined with theirs as if he had been a
bleached bone upon the desert sands. They went on and,
upon the porch above, mingled with a group of friends and
neighbours.</p>

<p>Rand put himself in motion, and he and Fairfax Cary
mounted step for step. The elder man looked aside at his
companion of the moment, slender and vigorous, boyishly
handsome in his dark riding-dress. He harboured no enmity
towards the younger Cary, and for Unity he had only
admiration and affection. His mind was full of recesses, and
in one of them there hovered on bright wings a desire for the
esteem of these two. In his day-dreams he steadily conferred
upon them benefits, and in day-dreams he saw their feeling
for him turn from prejudice to respect and fondness. Now,
after a moment's hesitation, he spoke. &quot;<i>I</i> have no quarrel,
Mr. Cary, with a happiness that all the county is glad of.
Miss Dandridge and my wife are the fondest friends. May
I offer you my congratulations?&quot;</p>

<p>He had ceased to move forward, and the other paused
with him. The younger Cary was thinking, &quot;Now if I were
Ludwell, I'd accept this with simplicity, since, damn him,
in this the man's sincere.&quot; He looked at the toe of his
boot, swallowed hard, and then faced Rand with a sudden,
transfiguring brightness of mien. &quot;I thank you, Mr. Rand.
Miss Dandridge is an angel, and I'm the happiest of men.
Will you tell Mrs. Rand so, with my best regards?&quot; He hesitated
a moment, then went on: &quot;No sign of rain! This weather
is calamitous! I hope that Roselands has not suffered as
Greenwood has done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it has,&quot; said Rand, with a smile. &quot;The corn is all
burned, and the entire state will make but little tobacco
this year. Miss Dandridge is better than an angel; she's
a very noble woman&mdash;I wish you both long life and happiness!&quot;</p>

<p>They said no more, but mounted the remaining steps to
the level above. Fairfax Cary joined the two Churchills
and their friends, while Rand, after a just perceptible hesitation,
entered the small room where the postmaster was filling,
with great leisureliness, the leather mail-bag. Besides himself
there was no other there; even the window gave not upon
the porch, but on a quiet, tangled garden. He took the letter
from his breast pocket and stood looking at it. The postmaster,
after the first word of greeting, went on with his work,
whistling softly as he handled the stiffly folded, wax-splashed
missives of the time. The wind was in the west, and the fitful
air came in from the withered garden and breathed upon
Rand's forehead. He stood for perhaps five minutes looking
at the letter, then with a curious and characteristic gesture
of decision he walked to the high counter and with his own
hand dropped it into the mail-bag, then waited to see it covered
by the drift from the postmaster's fingers. &quot;Don't the
world move, sir?&quot; said the latter worthy. &quot;It hasn't been so
long since there wasn't any mail for the West anyhow, and
now look at this bag! Kentucky, and this new Tennessee,
and Mississippi, and Louisiana, and the Lord knows what
besides! Letters coming thick and fast to Mr. Jefferson, and
letters going out from every one who has a dollar or an acre
or a son or brother in those God-forsaken parts where Adam
Gaudylock says they don't speak English and you walk
uphill to the river! I like things snug, Mr. Rand, and this
country's too big and this mail's too heavy. You have
correspondents out there yourself, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Rand, with indifference. &quot;As you say,
Mr. Smock, all the world writes letters nowadays. Certainly
it is natural that from all over the West men should write to
Mr. Jefferson.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Natural or not, they do it,&quot; quoth Mr. Smock doggedly.
&quot;I thought I heard the stage horn?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand looked at his watch. &quot;Not yet. It lacks some minutes
of its time,&quot; he said, and, leaning on the counter, waited
until he saw the mail-bag filled and securely fastened.
Lounging there, he took occasion to ask after the health of
Mr. Smock's wife, and to commiserate the burnt garden
without the window. If the expression of interest was calculated,
the interest itself was genuine enough. A shrewd
observer might have said that in dealing with the voters of
his county Rand exhibited a fine fusion of the subtle politician
with the well-wishing neighbour. The facts that he
was quite simply and sincerely sorry for the postmaster's
ailing wife, and that he had the yeoman's love for fresh and
springing green instead of withered leaf and stalk, in no wise
militated against that other fact that it was his cue to conciliate,
as far as might be, the minds of men. He almost never
neglected his cue; when he did so, it was because uncontrollable
passion had intervened. Now the postmaster, too, shook
his head over the ruined garden, entered with particularity
into the doctor's last report, and by the time that Rand,
with a nod of farewell, left the room, had voted him into the
Governor's chair, or any other seat of honour to which he
might aspire. &quot;Brains, brains!&quot; thought Mr. Smock. &quot;And
a plain man despite his fine marriage! If there were more
like him, the country would be safer than it is to-day.
There is the horn!&quot;</p>

<p>The stage with its four horses and flapping leather hanging,
its heated, red-coated driver and guard, and its dusty passengers
swung into town with great cracking of a whip and
blowing of a horn, drew up at the post-office just long enough
to deliver a plethoric mail-bag, and then rolled on in a pillar
of dust to the Eagle. The crowd about the post-office increased,
men gathering on the steps as well as upon the porch
above and on the parched turf beneath the mulberries.
There was a principle of division. The Federalists, who
were in the minority, held one end of the porch; the more
prominent Republicans the other, while the steps were free to
both, and the space below was given over to a rabble almost
entirely Republican. Rand, with several associates, lawyers
or planters, stood near the head of the steps;&mdash;all waited for
the sorting and distribution of the mail. The sun was low
over the Ragged Mountains, and after the breathless heat
of the day, a wind had arisen that refreshed like wine.</p>

<p>Rand, his back to the light, and paying grave attention
to a colleague's low-voiced exposition of a point in law, did
not at first observe a movement of the throng, coupled with
the utterance of a well-known name, but presently, as though
an unseen hand had tapped him on the shoulder, he turned
abruptly, and looked with all the rest. Mr. Jefferson was
coming up the street, riding slowly on a big, black horse
and followed by a negro groom. The tall, spare form sat
very upright, the reins loosely held in the sinewy hand.
Above the lawn neckcloth the face, sanguine in complexion
and with deep-set eyes, looking smilingly from side to side
of the village street. He came on to the post-office amid a buzz
of voices, and the more prominent men of his party started
down the steps to greet him. The few Federalists stiffly held
their places, but they, too, as he rode up, lifted their hats to
their ancient neighbour and the country's Chief Magistrate.
A dozen hands were ready to help him dismount, but he
shook his head with a smile. &quot;Thank you, gentlemen, but
I will keep my seat. I have but ridden down to get my mail.&mdash;Mr.
Coles, if you will be so good!&mdash;It is a pity, is it not,
to see this drouth? There has been nothing like it these fifty
years.&mdash;Mr. Holliday, I have news of Meriwether Lewis.
He has seen the Pacific.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Tiphysque novos</span><br />
Detegat orbes; nec sit terris<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ultima Thule.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Massie, I want some apples from Spring Valley for
my guest, the Abb&eacute; Correa.&mdash;Mr. Cocke, my Merinos are
prospering despite the burned pastures.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Coles came down the steps with a great handful of
letters and newspapers. The President took them from him,
and, without running them over, deposited all together in a
small cotton bag which hung from his saddle-bow. This
done, he raised his head and let his glance travel from one
end to the other of the porch above him. Of the men standing
there many were his bitter political enemies, but also they
were his old neighbours, lovers, like himself, of Albemarle
and Virginia, and once, in the old days when all were English,
as in the later time when all were patriots, his friends
and comrades. He bowed to them, and they returned his
salute, not genially, but with the respect due to his fame and
office. His eye travelled on. &quot;Mr. Rand, may I have a word
with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand left the pillar against which he had leaned and came
down the steps to the waiting horseman. He moved neither
fast nor slow, but yet with proper alacrity, and his dark face
was imperturbable. The fact of some disagreement, some
misunderstanding between Mr. Jefferson and the man who
had entered the public arena as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, had been for
some time in the air of Albemarle. What it was, and whether
great or small, Albemarle was not prepared to say. There
was a chill in the air, it thought, but the cloud might well
prove the merest passing mist, if, indeed, Rumour was not
entirely mistaken, and the coolness a misapprehension. The
President's voice had been quiet and friendly, and Rand
himself moved with a most care-free aspect. He was of those
who draw observation, and all eyes followed him down the
steps. He crossed the yard or two of turf to the black horse,
and stood beside the rider. &quot;You wished me, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to know if you will be so good as to come to Monticello
to-night? After nine the house will be quiet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly I will come, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will look for you then.&quot; He bowed slightly and gathered
up his reins. Rand stood back, and with a &quot;Good-afternoon
to you all, gentlemen,&quot; the President wheeled his horse and
rode down the street towards his mountain home. The
crowd about the post-office received its mail and melted away
to town house and country house, to supper at both, and to
a review, cheerful or acrimonious, of the events of the day,
including the fact that, as far as appearances went, Lewis
Rand was yet the President's staff and confidant. The
Churchills and Fairfax Cary rode away together. In passing,
the latter just bent his head to Rand, but Colonel Dick and
Major Edward sat like adamant. Rand took the letters doled
out to him by Mr. Smock, glanced at the superscriptions, and
put them in his pocket, then walked to the Eagle and spoke
to the hostler there, and finally, as the big red ball of the
sun dipped behind the mountains, betook himself to Tom
Mocket's small house on the edge of town.</p>

<p>He found Vinie on the porch. &quot;Is Adam here?&quot; he asked.
She nodded. &quot;That's well,&quot; he said. &quot;I want a talk with
him&mdash;a long talk. And, Vinie, can you give me a bit of
supper? I won't go home until late to-night;&mdash;I have sent
my wife word. Tell Adam, will you? that I am here, and
let us have the porch to ourselves.&quot;</p>

<h3>MONTICELLO AGAIN</h3>


<p>The night was hot and dark when Rand, riding Selim,
left the town and took the Monticello road. He
forded the creek, and the horse, scrambling up the
farther side, struck fire from the loose stones. Farther on,
the way grew steep, and the heavy shadow of the overhanging
trees made yet more oppressive the breathless night. The
stars could hardly be seen between the branches, but from
the ground to the leafy roof the fireflies sparkled restlessly.
Rand thought, as he rode, of the future and the present, but
not of the past. It was so old and familiar, this road, that he
might well feel the eyes of the past fixed upon him from every
bush and tree; but if he felt the gaze, he set his will and would
not return it. For some time he climbed through the thick
darkness, shot with those small and wandering fires, but at
last he came upon the higher levels and saw below him the
wide and dark plain. In the east there was heat lightning.
Here on the mountain-top the air blew, and a man was free
from the dust of the valley. He drew a long breath, checked
Selim for a moment, and, sitting there, looked out over the
vast expanse; but the eyes of the past grew troublesome, and
he hurried on. It was striking nine when a negro opened
the house gate for him and, following him to the portico,
took the horse from which he dismounted. Light streamed
from the open door, and from the library windows. Except
for a glimmer in the Abb&eacute; Correa's room, the rest of the
house was in darkness. If Mrs. Randolph and her daughters
were there, they had retired. He heard no voices. In
the hot and sulphurous night the pillared, silent house with
its open portal provoked a sensation of strangeness. Rand
crossed the portico and paused at the door. Time had been
when he would have made no pause, but, familiar to the house
and assured of his welcome, would have passed through the
wide hall to the library and his waiting friend and mentor.
Now he laid his hand upon the knocker, but before it could
sound, a door halfway down the hall opened, and there
appeared the tall figure of the President. He stood for a
moment, framed in the doorway, gazing at his visitor, and
there was in his regard a curious thoughtfulness, an old
regret, and&mdash;or so Rand thought&mdash;a faint hostility. The
look lasted but a moment; he raised his hand, and, with a
movement that was both a gesture of welcome and an invitation
to follow him, turned and entered the passage which
led to the library. Rand moved in silence through the hall,
where Indian curiosities, horns of elk, and prehistoric relics
were arranged above the marble heads of Buonaparte and
Alexander the First, Franklin and Voltaire, and down the
narrow passage to the room that had been almost chief of
all his sacred places. It was now somewhat dimly lit, with
every window wide to the night. Jefferson, sitting beside the
table in his particular great chair, motioned the younger man
to a seat across from him, evidently placed in anticipation
of his coming. Rand took the chair, but as he did so, he
slightly moved the candles upon the table so that they did
not illumine, as they had been placed to illumine, his face
and figure. It was he who began the conversation, and he
wasted no time upon preliminaries. The night was in his
blood, and he was weary of half measures. This storm had
long been brewing: let it break and be over with; better the
open lightning than the sullen storing up of unpaid scores,
unemptied vials of wrath! There were matters of quarrel:
well, let the quarrel come! The supreme matter, unknown
and undreamed of by the philosopher opposite him, would
sleep secure beneath the uproar over little things. He craved
the open quarrel. It would be easier after the storm. The
air would be cleared, though by forces that were dire, and he
could go more easily through the forest when he had laid
the trees low. It was better to hurry over the bared plain
towards the shining goal than to stumble and be deterred
amid these snares of old memories, habits, affections, and
gratitudes. The past&mdash;the past was man's enemy. He was
committed to the future, and in order to serve that strong
master there was work&mdash;disagreeable work&mdash;to be done
in the present. Ingratitude!&mdash;that, too, was but a word,
though a long one. He was willing to deceive himself, and so
ideas and images came at his bidding, but they hung his
path with false lights, and they served, not him, but his
inward foe.</p>

<p>He spoke abruptly. &quot;That Militia Bill,&mdash;the matter did
not approve itself to my reason, and so I could not push
it through. I understood, of course, at the time that you were
vexed&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should not say that 'vexed' was the word. I was surprised.
You will do me the justice to acknowledge that I
cheerfully accepted the explanation which you gave me.
You are fully aware that I, of all men, would be the last to
deny your right&mdash;any man's right&mdash;of private judgment.
All this was last winter, and might have been buried out
of sight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard that a letter of mine in the Enquirer gave
you umbrage. It was my opinion that the country's honour
demanded less milk and water, less supineness in our dealings
with England, and I expressed my opinion&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The country's honour! That expression of your opinion
placed you among the critics of the administration, and
that at an hour when every friend was needed. It came
without warning, and if it was meant to wound me, it succeeded.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand moved restlessly. &quot;It was not,&quot; he said sombrely;
&quot;it was not meant to wound you, sir. Let me, once for all,
sitting in this room amid the shades of so many past kindnesses,
utterly disavow any personal feeling toward you other
than respect and gratitude. It was apparent to me that the
letter must be written, but I take God to witness that I
regretted the necessity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The regret,&quot; answered the other, &quot;will doubtless, in the
sight of the Power you invoke, justify the performance. Well,
the nine days' wonder of the letter is long over! A man
in public life cannot live sixty years without suffering and
forgiving many a similar stab. The letter was in February.
Afterwards&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ceased to write to you. Through all the years in which
I had written, we had been in perfect accord. Now I saw the
rift between us, and that it would widen, and I threw no
futile bridges.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are frank. I have indeed letters from you, written
in this room&quot;&mdash;There was upon the table an orderly litter
of books and papers. From a packet of the latter Jefferson
drew a letter, unfolded it, and, stretching out his long arm,
laid it on the table before his visitor. &quot;There is one,&quot; he said,
&quot;written not three years ago, on the evening of the day when
you were elected to the General Assembly. I shall ask you
to do me the favour to read it through.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand took the letter and ran his dark eye down the sheets.
As he read, the blood stained his cheek, brow, and throat, and
presently, with a violent movement, he rose and, crossing the
room to a window, stood there with his face to the night.
The clock had ticked three minutes before he turned and,
coming back to the table, dropped the letter upon its polished
surface. &quot;You have your revenge,&quot; he said. &quot;Yes, I
was like that&mdash;and less than three years ago. I remember
that night very well, and had a spirit whispered to me then
that this night would come, I would have told the spirit that
he lied! And it has come. Let us pass to the next count
in the indictment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Albemarle Resolutions&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I carried them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wished them carried, but I should rather have seen
them lost than that in your speech&mdash;a speech that resounded
far and wide&mdash;you should have put the face you did upon
matters! You knew my sentiments and convictions; until
I read that speech, I thought they were your own. The
Albemarle Resolutions! I have heard it said that your zeal
for the Albemarle Resolutions was largely fanned by the
fact that your personal enemy was chief among your opponents!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask who said that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may ask, but I shall not answer. We are now at
late February.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Assembly adjourned. I returned to Albemarle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You took first a journey to Philadelphia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Is there treason in that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; said Jefferson, with calmness, &quot;is a word not yet
of my using.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand leaned forward. &quot;Yet?&quot; he repeated, with emphasis.</p>

<p>There fell a silence in the room. After a moment of sitting
quietly, his hands held lightly on the arm of his chair, Mr.
Jefferson rose and began to pace the floor. The action was
unusual; in all personal intercourse his command of himself
was remarkable. An inveterate cheerful composure, a still
sunniness, a readiness to settle all jars of the universe in
an extremely short time and without stirring from his chair,
were characteristics with which Rand was too familiar not
to feel a frowning wonder at the pacing figure and the troubled
footfall. He was a man bold to hardihood, and well
assured of a covered trail, so assured that his brain rejected
with vehemence the thought that darted through it. To Mr.
Jefferson the word that he had audaciously used could have
no significance. Treason! Traitor! Aaron Burr and his Jack-o'-Lantern
ambitions, indeed, had long been looked upon
with suspicion, vague and ill-directed, now slumbering and
now idly alert. In this very room&mdash;in this very room the
man had been talked of, discussed, analysed, and puffed away
by the two who now held it with their estranged and troubled
souls. Burr was gone; this August night he was floating
down the Ohio toward New Orleans and the promised blow.
Had some fool or knave or sickly conscience among the motley
that was conspiring with him turned coward or been bought?
It was possible. Burr might be betrayed, but hardly Lewis
Rand. That was a guarded maze to which Mr. Jefferson
could have no clue.</p>

<p>Jefferson came back to the table and the great chair.
&quot;You were, of course, as free as any man to travel to Philadelphia
or where you would. I heard that you were upon
such a journey, and I felt a certitude that you would also
visit Washington. Had you done this, I should have received
you with the old confidence and affection. I should have
listened to the explanation I felt assured you would wish to
make. At that time it was my belief that there needed but
one long conversation between us to remove misapprehension,
to convince you of your error, and to recall you to your
allegiance. Do not mistake me. I craved no more than
was human, no more than was justified by our relations in
the past&mdash;your allegiance to me. But I wished to see you
devoutly true to the principles you professed, to the Republican
Idea, and to all that you, no less than I, had once
included in that term. I looked for you in Washington,
and I looked in vain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You make it hard for me,&quot; said Rand, with lowered eyes.
&quot;I had no explanation to give.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you neither came nor wrote, I assumed as much.
It was in April that you returned to Albemarle. Since then
I have myself been twice in the county.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have met&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But never alone. Had you forgotten the Monticello road?
After the Three-Notched Road, I should have thought it best
known to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have not forgotten it, sir. But I might doubt my welcome
here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might well doubt it,&quot; answered the other sternly.
&quot;But had there been humility in your heart&mdash;ay, or
common remembrance!&mdash;that doubt would not have
kept you back. When I saw at last that you would not
come, I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He paused, took from the table a book and turned its
leaves, then closed and laid it down again. &quot;I whistled you
down the wind,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>There was a silence, then, far away in the hot night, a
dog howled. The hall clock struck the hour. Rand drew his
breath sharply and turned in his chair. &quot;And you brought
me here to-night to tell me so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will answer that presently. In these three years you
have made yourself a great name in Virginia; and now your
party&mdash;It is still your party?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is still my party.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your party wishes to make you Governor. You have
travelled fast and far since the days when you walked with
your father! Yesterday I was astounded to hear that you
had refused the nomination.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should you be 'astounded'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I hold you for a most ambitious man, and this
is the plain, the apparent step in your fortunes. At what
goal are you aiming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not want the governorship, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you want a greater thing. What it is&mdash;what it
is&quot;&mdash;With a sudden movement he rested his elbow on
the table and regarded Rand from under the shelter of his
hand. &quot;And so,&quot; he said at last, in an altered voice,&mdash;&quot;and
so you will not be Governor. Well, it is an honourable post.
This is late August, and in November you return to Richmond&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I go first across the mountains to examine a tract of land
I have bought.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed? When do you go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have not altogether decided.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you take Mrs. Rand with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so. Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is,&quot; said Mr. Jefferson, &quot;a rough journey and a wild
country for a lady.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke he rose, and, going to a small table, poured
for himself a little wine in a glass and drank it slowly, then,
putting the glass gently down, passed to a long window and
stood, as Rand had stood before him, looking out into the
night. When he turned, the expression of his face had again
changed. &quot;It is growing late,&quot; he said. &quot;In two days I return
to Washington. The world will have grown older ere
we meet again. Who knows? We may never meet again.
This night we may be parting forever. You ask me if I
brought you here to tell you that I acquiesced in this quarrel
of your making, shook you from my thoughts, and bade you
an eternal farewell. That is as may be. Even now&mdash;even
now the nature of our parting is in your hands!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand also had risen. &quot;In this room, what can I say? Your
kindness to me has been very great. My God, sir, I should
be stock or stone not to feel abashed! And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;Will
you have it at last? You ask discipleship&mdash;you must
have about you tame and obedient spirits&mdash;a Saint James
the Greater and a Saint James the Less to hearken to your
words and spread them far and wide, and all the attentive
band to wait upon your wisdom! Free! We are tremendously
free, but you must still be Lord and Master! Well,
say that I rebel&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see that you have done so,&quot; said Jefferson, with
irony. &quot;<i>I</i> am not your Lord and Master.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would not, if I could, have shunned this interview to-night.
For long we have felt this strain, and now the sharp
break is over. I shall sleep the better for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad, sir, that you view it so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For years I have worn your livery and trudged your road,&mdash;that
fair, wide country road with bleating sheep and farmer
folk, all going to markets dull as death! I've swincked and
sweated for you on that road. Now I'll tread my own, though
I come at last to the gates of Tartarus! My service is done,
sir; I'm out of livery.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your road!&quot; exclaimed the other. &quot;Where does it lie, and
who are your fellow travellers? John Randolph of Roanoke
and the new Republicans? or monarchism and the Federalists?
Or have I the honour, to-night, to entertain a Virginian
C&aelig;sar?&mdash;perhaps even a Buonaparte?&quot; His voice
changed. &quot;Have you reflected, sir, that there is some danger
in so free an expression of your mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have reflected,&quot; answered Rand, &quot;that there is no danger
so intolerable as the chafing of a half-acknowledged bond.
The clock is striking again. I owe you much, sir. I thank
you for it. While I served you, I served faithfully. It is
over now. I look you in the face and tell you this, and so I
give you warning that I am free. Henceforth I act as my
free will directs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Act, then!&quot; said the other. &quot;Act, and find a weight upon
your genius heavier than all behests of duty, friendship, faith,
and loyalty rolled in one! Single out from all humanity one
man alone, and that yourself, surround him with a monstrous
observance, sacrifice before him every living thing that shall
cross his path, crown him with gold, and banish from his court
every idea that will not play the sycophant! Seat him, a
chained king, high in some red star!&mdash;and still, like a wandering
wind, large and candid thought, straying some day
past your gloomy windows, shall look within and say, 'See
this slave to himself chained upon his burning throne!'
When at last you hear the voice, try to break away.&quot;</p>

<p>He left the window and, crossing to the mantel, pulled the
bell-rope. Old Burwell appeared at the door. &quot;Mr. Rand's
horse, Burwell,&quot; directed the master, in a cheerful voice, then,
when the negro was gone, spoke on without change of tone.
&quot;The night has altered while we talked. There is a great
bank of cloud in the west, and I think the drouth is broken.
You will reach Roselands, however, before the rain comes
down. Pray present my respectful salutations to Mrs. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are very good,&quot; said Rand. &quot;My wife&quot;&mdash;He
hesitated, then, &quot;I would have you aware that my wife's
hand would keep me in that same country road I spoke of,
among those same green fields and peaceful, blameless folk!
Her star is not like mine&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I esteem her the more highly for it,&quot; answered the other.
&quot;I hear your horse upon the gravel&mdash;Selim, still, is it not?
A pleasant ride to you home through this fresher air! Good-night&mdash;and
good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not the monster I appear to you,&quot; said Rand. &quot;A
man may go through life and never encounter the irresistible
current. When he does&mdash;I am as little superstitious as
you, but I tell you I am borne on! All the men and women
whose blood is in my veins hurry me on, and there is behind
me a tide of circumstance. For all past kindnesses I thank
you, sir. I admire you much, reverence you no little, and
bid you a long farewell.&quot;</p>

<p>He walked to the door, then, turning, swept the room with
one slow look. &quot;I was fifteen,&quot; he said, &quot;the day I first came
here. There was a glass of lilies on the table. Good-night,
sir,&mdash;and good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>Without, the night was indeed cooler, with a sighing wind,
and in the west a thickening wrack of clouds. It was very
dark. The restless and multitudinous flicker of the fireflies
but emphasized the shadow, and the stars seemed few and
dim. It was near midnight, and the wide landscape below
the mountain lay in darkness, save for one distant knoll
where lights were burning. That was Fontenoy, and Rand,
looking toward it with knitted brows, wondered why the house
was so brightly lighted at such an hour. In another moment
the road descended, the heavy trees shut out the view of the
valley, and with very much indeed upon his mind, he thought
no more of Fontenoy. It was utterly necessary to him to find
a remedy for the sting, keen and intolerable, which he bore
with him from Monticello. He felt the poison as he rode,
and his mind searched, in passion and in haste, for the
sovereign antidote. He found it and applied it, and the
rankling pain grew less. Now more than ever was it necessary
to go on. Now more than ever he must commit himself
without reserve to the strong current. When it had borne
him to a fair and far country, to kingship, sway, empire, and
vast renown, then would this night be justified!</p>

<p>He left the mountain, and, riding rapidly, soon found himself
upon the road to Roselands. It was also the Greenwood
road. Between the two plantations lay a deep wood, and as
he emerged from this, he saw before him in the dim starlight
a horseman, coming towards him from Roselands. &quot;Is that
you, Mocket?&quot; he called.</p>

<p>The other drew rein. &quot;It is Ludwell Cary. Good-evening,
Mr. Rand. I have just left Roselands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot; exclaimed Rand. &quot;May I ask&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came from Fontenoy at the request of Colonel Churchill.
Mrs. Churchill fell suddenly very ill to-night. They think
she will not last many hours, and she asks continually for
her niece. Colonel Churchill sent me to beg Mrs. Rand to
come without delay to Fontenoy. I have delivered my message,
and she but waits your return to Roselands&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will hurry on,&quot; said Rand. &quot;Be so good as to tell
Colonel Churchill that Joab will bring her in the chaise&mdash;Mammy
Chloe with her. I am sorry for your news. Accept,
too, our thanks for the trouble to which you have put yourself&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is nothing,&quot; answered Cary. &quot;My brother and I
chanced to be at Fontenoy. Mrs. Rand is much distressed,
and I'll detain you no longer&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He bowed, touched his horse, and rode into the wood.
Rand turned in his saddle and looked after him for a long
moment, then shook his reins, broke into a gallop, and passed
presently through the Roselands gates and up the dark drive
to the stone steps and open door. Jacqueline met him on the
threshold. She was trembling, but not weeping; there was
even a wistful fire and passion in her dark eyes and a rose-leaf
colour in her cheeks. &quot;Did you meet him?&quot; she said.
&quot;Did he tell you? I am all ready. He says that Aunt
Nancy thinks that it is years ago, and that I'm Jacqueline
Churchill still. I thought you would never, never come&quot;&mdash;She
turned and threw herself into his arms. &quot;Oh, Lewis, we
are going to Fontenoy!&quot;</p>

<h3>THE NINETEENTH OF FEBRUARY</h3>


<p>&quot;That's true,&quot; quoth Gaudylock. &quot;It's the cracked
I pitcher that goes oftenest to the well, and a delicate
lady that's lain a-dying on her bed this twenty year
may live to see you and me and the blacksmith buried! There
never was a Churchill that I didn't like, and I'm certainly
glad she's better this morning. If you're going to Greenwood,
I'll bear you company for a bit. I'm bound for Roselands
myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Ludwell Cary dismounted and, with his bridle across his
arm, walked beside the hunter. &quot;Albemarle has not seen you
for a long while,&quot; he said pleasantly. &quot;The county is fond
of you, and glad to have you home again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So a lady told me the other day!&quot; answered Adam. &quot;It
has been a year since I was in Albemarle,&mdash;but I saw you,
sir, last winter in Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Last winter? I don't recall&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At Lynch's Coffee House. The twentieth of February.
The day the Albemarle Resolutions were passed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; breathed Cary. The two walked on, now in sun,
now in shade, upon the quiet road. The drouth was broken.
There had been a torrential rain, then two days of sunshine.
A cool wind now stirred the treetops; the mountains drew
closer in the crystal air, and the washed fields renewed their
green. So bright and sunny was the morning that the late
summer wore the air of spring. Cary stood still beside a log,
huge and mossy, that lay beside the road. &quot;Let us rest here
a moment,&quot; he said, and, taking his seat, began to draw in
the dust before him with the butt of his whip. &quot;I do not remember
seeing you that day. I did not know that you were
in Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was there,&quot; answered Adam cheerfully, &quot;on business.&quot;
He took an acorn from the ground and balanced it upon
a brown forefinger. &quot;It's a handsome place&mdash;Lynch's&mdash;and,
my faith, one sees the best of company! I was there
with Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>The sound was sharp, and long like an indrawn breath.
Adam, who could read the tones of a man's voice, glanced
aside and remembered the quarrel. &quot;Thin ice there, and
crackling twigs!&quot; he thought. &quot;Look where you set your
moccasin, Golden-Tongue!&quot; Aloud he said, &quot;You and your
brother came in out of the snow, and read your letters by
the fire. It had fallen thick the day before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I remember. A heavy fall all day, but at night it
cleared.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; went on the other blithely. &quot;I was at Lewis
Rand's on Shockoe Hill, and when I walked home, the stars
were shining. What's the matter, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought,&quot; quoth Adam, &quot;that some varmint had stung
you.&quot; He looked thoughtfully at the acorn. &quot;You are a
schollard, Mr. Cary. Is the whole oak, root, branch, and
seed, in the acorn&mdash;bound to come out just that way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So they say,&quot; answered Cary. &quot;And in the invisible acorn
of that oak a second tree, and that second holds a third,
and the third a fourth, and so on through the magic forest.
Consequences to the thousandth generation. You were
saying that you were at Mr. Rand's the night of the nineteenth
of February.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was I?&quot; asked Adam, with coolness. &quot;Oh, yes! I went
over to talk with him about a buffalo skin and some antlers
of elk that he wanted for Roselands&mdash;and the stars were
shining when I came away.&quot; To himself he said, &quot;Now why
did he start like that a moment back? It wasn't because
the snow had stopped and the stars were shining. Where
was <i>he</i> that night?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary drew a circle in the dust with the handle of his whip.
&quot;You were at Lynch's with Mr. Rand the next afternoon.
And immediately after that you returned to the West?&quot;</p>

<p>Adam nodded. The acorn was yet poised upon his finger,
but his keen blue eyes were for the other's face and form,
bent over the drawing in the dusty road. &quot;Ay, West I went,&quot;
he said cheerfully. &quot;I'm just a born wanderer! I can't any
more stay in one town than a bird can stay on one bush.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A born wanderer,&quot; said Cary pleasantly, &quot;is almost
always a born good fellow. How long this time will be your
stay in Albemarle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, that's as may be,&quot; answered Adam, with vagueness.
&quot;I'm mighty fond of this country in the fall of the year,
and I've a hankering for an old-time Christmas at home&mdash;But,
my faith; wanderers never know when the fit will take
them! It may be to-morrow, and it may be next year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You and Mr. Rand are old friends?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may say that,&quot; exclaimed the hunter. &quot;There's a
connection somewhere between the Gaudylocks and the
Rands, and I knew Gideon better than most men. As for
Lewis, I reckon there was a time when I was almost his only
friend. I've stood between him and many a beating, and
'twas I that taught him to shoot. A fine place he's making
out of Roselands!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Cary, with a quick sigh; &quot;a beautiful
place. The West is in a ferment just now, is it not? One
hears much talk of dissatisfaction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, all that sort of thing is told me when I come home,&quot;
said Adam. &quot;The Indians call such idle speech talk of singing
birds. My faith, I think all the singing birds in the Mississippi
Territory have flown East! In the West we don't
listen to them. That's a fine mare you're riding, sir! You
should see the wild horses start up from the prairie grass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would be worth seeing. Have you ever, in your
wanderings, come across Aaron Burr?&quot;</p>

<p>Adam regarded the other side of the acorn. &quot;Aaron Burr!
Why, I wouldn't say that I mayn't have seen him somewhere.
A man who traps and trades, and hunts and fishes,
up and down a thousand miles of the Mississippi River is
bound to come across a mort of men. But 'twould be by
accident. He's a gentleman and a talker, and he was the
Vice-President. I reckon he runs with the Governor and the
General and the gentleman-planter and the New Orleans ladies.&quot;
Adam laughed genially. &quot;I know a red lip or two in New
Orleans myself, but they're not ladies! and I drink with the
soldiers, but not with the General. What's your interest,
sir, in Aaron Burr?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The common interest,&quot; said Cary, rising. &quot;When you
quit Albemarle this time, you quit it alone?&quot;</p>

<p>Gaudylock tossed aside the acorn. &quot;That is my fortune,&quot;
he answered coolly.</p>

<p>Cary swung himself into his saddle. &quot;The woods, I see,
teach but half the Spartan learning. We'll part here, I
think, unless you'll come by Greenwood?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you kindly, sir, but I've a bit of a woodsman's
job to look after at Roselands. What was the Spartan
learning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are going,&quot; replied the other, &quot;to the house of a
gentleman who knows the classics. Ask him. Good-day!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-day,&quot; said Adam somewhat abruptly, and with
a thoughtful face watched the other ride away. &quot;He has
been listening,&quot; thought the hunter, &quot;to singing birds. Now
when, and where, and to how loud a singing? The nineteenth
of February&mdash;and the snowstorm&mdash;and the stars
shining as I walked home from Shockoe Hill. He didn't know
that I was in Richmond! Then, was he on Burr's trail?
Humph! Where <i>was</i> Mr. Ludwell Cary the night of the
nineteenth of February?&quot; Adam took up his gun and coonskin
cap. &quot;I'll see if Lewis can make that light,&quot; he said,
and turned his face to Roselands.</p>

<p>Ludwell Cary rode to Greenwood, dismounted, and, going
into the library, took from the drawer of his desk a letter,
opened it, and ran it over. &quot;As to your enquiries,&quot; said the
letter, &quot;Swartwout and Bollman are believed to be in New
Orleans, Ogden in Kentucky, and Aaron Burr himself at a
Mr. Harman Blennerhassett's on the Ohio. Rumour has it
that Burr's daughter and her son are travelling to meet him.
It says, moreover, that a number of gentlemen in the East
are winding up their affairs preparatory to leaving for the
West. One and all look more innocent than lambs, but they
dream at night of s&eacute;noritas, besieged cities, and the mines
of Montezuma! There's a report to-day that Burr is levying
troops. That's war. If these men go, they'll not return.&quot;
Cary laid down the letter. &quot;If these men go, they'll not
return. Is Lewis Rand so fixed in Albemarle?&quot;</p>

<p>He moved from the desk to an old chess table and, sitting
down, began to move the pieces this way and that. &quot;The nineteenth
of February&mdash;the nineteenth of February.&quot; He saw
again a firelit room, and heard the tapping of maple boughs
against a window. There she sat in her dress of festive white,
listening to a denunciation of Aaron Burr and those concerned
with him&mdash;and all the time the man beneath her roof!
Cary sighed impatiently and moved another piece. Adam
Gaudylock, who had let slip that he had been there as well&mdash;and
then had been careful to let slip no other fact of value,
except, indeed, the fact that he was thus careful! Cary covered
his lips with his hand and sat staring at the board. The
problem, then, was to construct from the hunter's character
the hunter's part. A keen trader, scout, and enthusiast of the
West, known to and knowing the men of those parts, and
able to bend the undercurrents&mdash;a delighter in danger, with
a boy's zest for intrigue, risk, and daring&mdash;an uncomplex
mind, little troubled by theories of political obligation,
political faith and unfaith, loyalty to government or its reverse&mdash;a
being born to adventure, but to adventure under
guidance, skilled and gay subaltern to some graver, abler
leader&mdash;that, he thought, would be Adam Gaudylock. An
old, old friend of Lewis Rand's&mdash;&quot;There's a connection
somewhere between the Gaudylocks and the Rands.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary put out his hand and moved a piece with suddenness.
&quot;Granted the connection,&quot; he said aloud. His eye gleamed.
&quot;That night Rand agreed with Burr. Gaudylock would have
been there to give information; probably, seeing that he went
West immediately afterwards, to receive instructions. But
he is an asset of Lewis Rand's, not of Burr's.&quot;</p>

<p>His hand touched the piece again. &quot;An asset of Lewis
Rand's&mdash;Rand and Burr&mdash;Rand and Burr. What was
it that they plotted that night while she talked to me of the
new song she had learned? An expedition against Mexico,
an attack upon the dominions of the King of Spain with
whom we are at peace? Or a revolution in the country west
of the Ohio? The one's a misdemeanour; the other's treason.&quot;
He moved a rook. &quot;Most like 'twas both&mdash;the first
to mask the second. The boldest, simplest, most comprehensive
stroke; there, there would show the mind of Lewis
Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>He rose and paced the long, cool room, then came back
to the chess table. &quot;They parted. Burr to the North, as I
found the next morning; this trader, as he says, back to the
West; Lewis Rand quiet in Richmond, quiet here in Albemarle.
Quiet! That speech of his&mdash;those letters in the
Enquirer. How long has he been breaking with Mr.
Jefferson? That journey, too, to Philadelphia&mdash;whom did
he see there? Swartwout, Bollman, perhaps Burr himself?
Home he comes to Albemarle and begins improving Roselands.
Cases too, in court, and a queue of waiting clients,
and Richmond to return to in November. Granted there's
a strange emigration West; but Lewis Rand&mdash;Lewis Rand's
as fixed in Virginia as are the Churchills and the Carys!&quot;</p>

<p>He slowly lifted and as slowly moved a queen. &quot;And what
other course, from time out of mind, does the disloyal pursue?
A mask&mdash;all a mask. He, too, is for the West. He goes to
join Burr; goes, if his fate stands true, to supplant Burr.
Matters draw to a point, and he has little time to spare!
Say that he goes&quot;&mdash;A movement of his arm, involuntary
and sharp, jarred the table and disarranged the board. &quot;Will
he go alone?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary rose and walked the floor. &quot;I must know&mdash;I must
know.&quot; He paused at a western window, and with unseeing
eyes gazed into the blue distance. &quot;Were he Ludwell Cary,
would he fare forth on his adventure alone? Perhaps. Being
Lewis Rand, will he go without her, leave her behind?
A thousand times, no! Even now this daughter of Burr's
is hurrying by day and by night over rough and over smooth,
to join her father; how much more, then, shall lover go
with lover, the faithful wife with the all-conquering husband!
She shall be there to buckle on our armour, to heal
us with her kiss when the long day's work is over!&quot; He bent
his brow upon his arm. &quot;O God, O God!&quot;</p>

<p>From the hall without there sounded a clear whistle, and
Fairfax Cary appeared in the library door. &quot;Are you there,
Ludwell? It's all dark in here after the sun outside. I am
going to town.&quot;</p>

<p>The elder brother left the window. &quot;Wait a little, Fair.
I want to talk to you. Do you remember the night of the
nineteenth of February?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the other. &quot;It had been snowing, and then
it cleared brilliantly. I went to the Mayos, and I stopped by
Bowler's Tavern. It was the night that Aaron Burr slept in
Richmond. I told you, you know, that he was supping out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. With Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence, then, &quot;So!&quot; exclaimed Fairfax Cary,
with a long whistle.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not surprised?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. It explains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; assented the other sombrely, &quot;it explains. Fair,
I want to find out when Adam Gaudylock goes West.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gaudylock!&quot; cried the other; then after a moment,
&quot;Well, I'm not surprised at that, either. I can tell you now
when he's going. In two weeks' time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unity sent a message about some work or other to Tom
Mocket's sister Vinie. I gave the message, and the girl fell
to talking about Adam. She was wearing a Spanish comb
which he had brought her. I told her 't was pretty, and she
said 'Yes: 'twas from New Orleans, and if Miss Unity would
like one, Mr. Adam was going there again in two weeks.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two weeks!&quot; brooded the other. &quot;Fair, would you not
say from every appearance that Lewis Rand is as fixed in
Albemarle and in Virginia as you or I or any honest man?
He improves Roselands; he has an important case coming
on; it is supposed that in November he will return to Richmond.
I happen to know that he has retaken the house on
Shockoe Hill.&quot; He moved restlessly. &quot;Why should I dream
that he is preparing a moonlight flitting? dream that I see
him in the gold southwest, treading his appointed road, triumphant
there as here? A moonlight flitting! When he
goes, he'll go by day&mdash;walk forth in bronze and purple,
unconcerned and confident, high and bold as any C&aelig;sar!
From what egg did he spring that he can play the traitor
and the parricide&mdash;and yet, and yet the rose bend to his
hand? Does it look, Fair, as though he were in marching
order?&quot;</p>

<p>The other considered. &quot;Do you believe that he is going
West to join Burr?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do. And yet this week he is defending a case in court,
and there are others coming on. He is busy, too, at Roselands,
and he has taken the Richmond house. I am, perhaps,
a suspicious, envious, and vindictive fool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Roselands and the Richmond house might be a mask,
He refused the nomination for Governor.&quot;</p>

<p>Ludwell Cary started violently. &quot;I had forgotten that!
You have it, Fair. He would do that&mdash;he would refuse
the nomination. Lewis Rand, Lewis Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any proof that he is conspiring with Burr?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None that I could advance&mdash;none. I have an inward
certainty, that is all. Nor can I&mdash;nor can I, Fair, even
speak of such a suspicion. You see that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I see that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I repented last winter of having written that letter signed
'Aurelius.' I <i>knew</i> nothing, and it seemed beneath me to have
made that guesswork public. That he was my enemy should
have made me careful, but I was under strong feeling, and
I wrote. He has neither forgotten nor forgiven. Denounce
him now as a conspirator against his party and his country?
That is impossible. Impossible from lack of proof, and
impossible to me were proofs as thick as blackberries! But
if I can help it, he shall not leave Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it your opinion that he would take her with him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would she go?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary rose, moved to the window, and stood there a moment
in silence. When, presently, he came back to the table, his
face was pale, but lifted, controlled, and quiet. There was
a saying in the county,&mdash;&quot;The high look of the Carys.&quot;
He wore it now, the high look of the Carys. &quot;Yes, Fair,
she would go with him.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence, then the younger spoke. &quot;She is at
Fontenoy. Mrs. Churchill may linger long, and her niece
is always with her. Rand could not take his wife away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a check to his plans, no doubt,&quot; said the other wearily.</p>

<p>&quot;He's frowning over it now. He'll wait as long as may be.
He would sin, but he would not sin meanly. In his conception
of himself a greatness, even in transgression, must clothe
all that he does. He'll wait, gravely and decently, even
though to wait is his heavy risk.&quot; He made a gesture with
his hand. &quot;Do I not know him, know him well? Sometimes
I think that for three years I've had no other study!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should have let me challenge him that first election
day,&quot; said Fairfax Cary gloomily. &quot;If we had met and I had
put a bullet through him, then all this coil would have been
spared. What do you propose to do now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the moment I am going to Fontenoy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would speak, I think, to Major Edward.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes: that was in my mind. If there is any right, it lies
with the men of her family. Fair, on the nineteenth of February
I was at Lewis Rand's!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed his brother.</p>

<p>&quot;I was admitted, as I have since come to see, by mistake,
and against orders. I found her alone in her drawing-room,
and we sat by the dying fire and we talked of this very thing,
this very plot, this very Aaron Burr&mdash;yes, and of the part
a stronger than Burr might play in the West and in Mexico!
She told me that her husband was busy that night&mdash;excused
him because he was engaged with a client from the
country. A client from the country! and I, who would have
taken her word against an angel's, I sat there and wondered
why she was distrait and pale! She was pale because there
was danger, she was absent because she was contriving how
she might soonest rid the house of one who was not wanted
there that night! She was dressed in gauze and gems; she
had supped with Aaron Burr&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see&mdash;I see!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When at last I perceived, though I could not guess the
reason, that she wished to be alone, I bade her good-night,
and she watched me&mdash;oh, carefully!&mdash;through the hall and
past the other doors and out of the house. I came home
through the starlight and over the snow to the Eagle. I found
you there by the fire, and you told me that Aaron Burr was
in Richmond. Then, then, Fair, I <i>knew</i>. I knew with whom
Lewis Rand was engaged, I knew who was the client from
the country! The next morning I made my inquiries. Burr
had gone at dawn, muffled and secret and swift&mdash;one man
to see him off. That man, I learned to-day, was Adam
Gaudylock. He, too, was at Rand's the night before. A
triumvirate, was it not? Well, she knew, she knew&mdash;and
women, too, have dreamed of crowns!&quot;</p>

<p>He rose. &quot;I'm going to ride to Fontenoy. You can bear
me witness that I've kept away since her return. Now I
shall keep away no longer. I will speak to Major Edward.
Her family may draw a circle out of which she may not step.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's been,&quot; said the other, &quot;no true reconciliation.
She's only at Fontenoy because the Churchills could not
refuse a dying woman. They speak to her as to a stranger
to whom, as gentlemen, they must needs be courteous. And
she's proud, too. Unity says they are far apart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. But though the Churchill men are stubborn,
they are Virginians and they are patriots. This touches their
honour and the honour of their house. If Rand plots at all,
he's plotting treason. How much does she know, how little
does she not know? God knows, not I! But they may make
a circle she cannot overstep&mdash;no, not for all the magician's
piping!&quot; He rested his forehead upon his clasped hands.
&quot;Fair, Fair, she was my Destiny! Why did he come like a
shape of night, with the power of night? And now he draws
her, too, into the shadow. He's treading a road beset&mdash;and
they are one flesh; she travels with him. Oh, despair!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have out a warrant against him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What proofs? and what disgrace if proved! No, Fair,
no.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let me challenge him.&quot;</p>

<p>The other smiled. &quot;Should it come to that, I will be the
challenger! I am your senior there. Don't forget it, Fair.&quot;
He rose from the table. &quot;Do you remember that first day
we rode to Fontenoy when I came home from England?
The place was all in sunshine, all fine gold. She was standing
on the porch beside Major Edward; she lifted her hand
and shaded her eyes with a fan&mdash;there was a flower in her
hair. Three years! I am worn with those three years.&quot;
For a moment he rested his hand on the other's shoulder.
&quot;Fair, Fair, you know happy love&mdash;may you never know
unhappy love! I am going now to Fontenoy. Is there a message
for Unity?&quot;</p>

<h3>THE CEDAR WOOD</h3>


<p>Jacqueline closed the door of her aunt's chamber
softly behind her, passed through the Fontenoy hall, and
came out upon the wide porch. There, in the peace
of the September afternoon, she found Unity alone with the
Lay of the Last Minstrel. &quot;Aunt Nancy is asleep,&quot; she said.
&quot;I left Mammy Chloe beside her. Unity, I think she's better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So the doctor said this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think she's beginning to remember. She looks strangely
at me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If she does remember, she'll want you still!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline shook her head. &quot;I think not. How lovely
it is, this afternoon! The asters are all in bloom in the garden,
and the gum tree is turning red.&quot; She threw a gauze
scarf over her head. &quot;I am going down to the old gate by
the narrow road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish,&quot; said Unity, &quot;that I had the ordering of the universe
for just one hour! Then Christians would become
Christian, and you wouldn't have to meet your husband
outside the gates of home.&quot;</p>

<p>The other laughed a little. &quot;Oh, Unity, Christians won't
be Christian, and even as it is, 'tis sweet to be at home!
Until you go away to Greenwood, you'll not know how dear
was Fontenoy! To hear the poplars rustling and to smell the
box again&mdash;Is it not strange that I should have a light
heart when they look so cold upon me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have hopes of Uncle Dick, but Uncle Edward&quot;&mdash;Unity
shook her head. &quot;I don't understand Uncle Edward.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; answered Jacqueline, &quot;and I love him most.
I'll go now and leave you to the Last Minstrel. Does
Fairfax Cary come to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He may&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed. &quot;'He may.' Yes, indeed, I think he
may! Oh, Unity, smell the roses, and look at the light upon
the mountains! Good-bye! I'm for Lewis now.&quot;</p>

<p>She passed down the steps and through the garden toward
the cedar wood which led to the old gate on the narrow
road. Unity heard her singing as she went. The voice died
in the distance. A door opened, Uncle Edward's step was
heard in the hall, and his voice, harsh and strange, came out
to his niece upon the porch: &quot;Unity, I want you in the library
a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline kept her tryst with Rand under the great oak
that stood without the old gate, on land that was not the
Churchills'. It was their custom to walk a little way into the
wood that lay hard by, but this afternoon the narrow road,
grass-grown and seldom used, was all their own. They sat
upon the wayside, beneath the tree, and Selim grazed beside
them. There was her full report of all that concerned them
both, and there was what he chose to tell her. They talked
of Fontenoy, and then of Roselands&mdash;talked freely and with
clasped hands. Her head rested on his shoulder; they sat in
deep accord, bathed by the golden light of the afternoon; sometimes
they were silent for minutes at a time, while the light
grew fairer on the hills. When an hour had passed they rose
and kissed, and he watched her across the road and through
the gate into the circle of Fontenoy. She turned, and waited
to see him mount Selim and ride away. He spoke from the
saddle, &quot;At the same hour to-morrow,&quot; and she answered,
&quot;The same hour.&quot; Her hands were clasped upon the top-most
bar of the gate. He wheeled Selim, crossed the road,
half swung himself from the saddle, and pressed his lips
upon them. &quot;Come home soon!&quot; he said, and she answered,
&quot;Soon.&quot;</p>

<p>When the bend of the road had hidden horse and rider,
she left the gate and began her return to the house. Her path
lay through a field, through the cedar wood, and through the
flower garden. In the field beside a runlet grew masses of
purple ironweed. She broke a stately piece, half as tall as
herself, and with it in her hand left the autumn-coloured
field and entered the little wood where the cedars grew dark
and close, with the bare, red earth beneath. At the end of
the aisle of trees could be seen the bright-hued garden and
a fraction of blue heaven. Holding the branch of ironweed
before her, Jacqueline passed through the wood toward the
light of sky and flowers, and came at the edge of the open
space upon a large old tree, twisted like one of those which
Dante saw. As she stepped beneath the dark and spreading
boughs a man, leaving the sunlit flower garden for the shadow
of the cedars, met her face to face. &quot;You!&quot; he cried, and
stopped short.</p>

<p>The branch of ironweed dropped from her hand. &quot;I did
not know that you were at Fontenoy. I have not seen
you this long while&mdash;except for that moment the other
night. Is it not&mdash;is it not the loveliest day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came from the library into the flower garden and on to
this wood because I wished to think, to be alone, to gain
composure before I returned to the house&mdash;and you front
me like a spectre in the dimness! Once before, I entered
this wood from the flower garden&mdash;and it was dark, dark
as it is to-day, though the weather was June. Nor do I,
either, count the other night when I came to Roselands as
Colonel Churchill's messenger. It has been long, indeed,
since we truly met.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not well, Mr. Cary!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am&mdash;I am,&quot; said Cary. &quot;Give me a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>He rested his arm against the red trunk of the cedar and
covered his eyes with his hand. Jacqueline stood, looking
not at him but at the coloured round of garden. Her heart
was fluttering, she knew not why. The moment that he asked
went by and, dropping his arm, he turned upon her a face
that he had not yet schooled to calmness.</p>

<p>&quot;The evening of the nineteenth of February,&quot; he said.
&quot;That was the last time we really met. Do you remember?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I remember. It was the day of the deep snow.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary regarded her mutely; then, &quot;Yes, that was the important
thing. We all remember it because of the snow. You
were learning a new song that you promised to sing to me
when I came again. But I never heard it&mdash;I never came
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. Why was that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you ask?&quot; he cried, and there was pain and anger
in his voice. &quot;I thought it not of you.&quot;</p>

<p>The crimson surged over Jacqueline's face and throat.
She bent toward him impetuously, with a quick motion of
her hands. &quot;Ah, forgive me!&quot; she cried. &quot;I know&mdash;I
know. I was told of the quarrel next day in the coffee house.
I&mdash;I was more sorry than I can say. I understood. You
could not, after that, come again to the house. Oh, more than
almost anything, I wish that you and Lewis were friends!
It is wrong to try to make you think that that evening does
not live in my memory. It does&mdash;it does!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am willing to believe as much,&quot; he returned, with a
strange dryness. &quot;I know that you remember that evening,
but I hardly think it altogether on my account&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The colour faded from her cheek. &quot;On whose, then?
My husband's?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And your guest's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were my guest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; cried Cary, &quot;I'll not have it! You shall not so perjure
yourself! He has taken much from me; if your truth is
his as well, then indeed he has taken all! I know, I know
who was the guest that night, the man with whom you supped,
the 'client from the country.'&quot;</p>

<p>She gazed at him with large eyes, her hand upon her heart,
then, with an inarticulate word or two, she moved to the
gnarled and protruding roots of the cedar and took her seat
there facing his troubled figure and indignant eyes. &quot;Who
was the guest,&mdash;the client from the country?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aaron Burr.&quot;</p>

<p>She drew a difficult breath. &quot;How long have you known?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since that night. No&mdash;do not be distressed! I learned
it not from you,&mdash;you kept faithful guard. But when I
left you, within the hour I knew it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And&mdash;and if he were there, what harm?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary regarded her in silence; then, &quot;The letter that I read
you that night from your uncle, from one of the heads of your
house, from a patriot and a man of stainless honour, that
letter was, I think, sufficiently explicit! There was the harm.
But Major Churchill's opinion, too, is perhaps forgot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; cried Jacqueline, &quot;no; you do not understand!
Listen to me!&quot; She rose, drawing herself to her full height,
the red again in her cheek, her eyes dark and bright. &quot;I am
going to tell you the truth of this matter. Are you not my
friend, whose opinion I value for me and mine? You are
a true and honourable gentleman&mdash;I speak with no fear
that what I say will ever pass beyond this wood! Uncle
Edward's letter! You think that what was said in Uncle
Edward's letter&mdash;ay, and what you, too, said in comment&mdash;was
already known to me that night! Well, it was not.
Oh, it is true that Colonel Burr had supped with us, and it
is also true that I was most heartily sorry for it! At table,
while he talked, I saw only that green field so far away, and
General Hamilton bleeding to his death,&mdash;yes, and I thought,
'Oh me, what would they say to me at Fontenoy?' But I
knew no worse of Colonel Burr than that one deed, and I
bore myself toward him as any woman must toward her husband's
guest! I am telling you all. He was Lewis's guest,
Lewis's correspondent, and this was an arranged meeting.
I knew that and I knew no more. After supper they talked
together, and I sat alone by the fire in the empty drawing-room.
I was bidden&mdash;yes, I will tell you this!&mdash;I was bidden
to keep all visitors out, since it must not be known that
Colonel Burr was then in Richmond! You came, and by mistake
you were admitted. I was lonely at heart and hungry
for news from home, I let you stay, and you read to me
what my uncle had to say of the man who was at that instant
beneath my roof, engaged in talk with my husband! You
read, and then you, too, took up the tale! 'Traitor&mdash;treason....
A man whom, had you the power, you would arrest at
once.... False to his honour, false to his country.... Traitor
and maker of traitors.... And where is your husband
to-night?' Well, I did not choose to tell you where was my
husband that night&mdash;and, since I was frightened, and cold
at heart, and knew not what to say, and&mdash;and was frightened,
I <i>lied</i> to you! But as for that which I now see that
you have thought of me&mdash;you are much mistaken there!
Until you read me Uncle Edward's letter, I did not know
what men said of Aaron Burr!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wronged you,&quot; said Cary, with emotion. &quot;I doubted
you, and I have been most wretched in the doubting. Forgive
me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You wronged me, yes!&quot; she cried. &quot;But am I the only
one you've wronged? Oh, I see, I see what since that night
you have thought of Lewis! It was the next day that you
quarrelled in the coffee house! Oh, all these months, have
you been mistrusting Lewis Rand, believing him concerned
with that man, suspecting him of&mdash;of&mdash;of <i>treason</i>? There,
too, you are mistaken. Listen!&quot;</p>

<p>She came closer to him, all colour, light, and fire against
the dark cedars. &quot;I am going to tell you. You are generous,
open-minded, candid, fair&mdash;you will understand, and you
will know him better, and you and he may yet be friends! I
have that at heart&mdash;you would hardly believe how much
I have that at heart. Have you been dreaming of Lewis Rand
as the aider and abetter of Colonel Burr's designs, whatever
they may be! as a conspirator with him against the peace of
the country, against Virginia, against the Republic? You
have, you have,&mdash;I read it in your face! Well, you are wrong.
Oh, I will tell you the clean truth! He was tempted&mdash;he saw
below him the kingdoms of the earth&mdash;and oh, remember
that around him are not the friendly arms, the old things,
the counsel of the past, the watchword in the blood, the voice
that cries to you or to my uncles and so surely points to you
the road! I will tell the whole truth. I will not say that his
mind sees always by the light by which we rest. He has
come another way and through another world. How should
he think our thoughts, see just with our eyes? He has come
through night and hurrying clouds; his way has been steep,
and there are stains upon his nature. I that love him will not
deny them! He was tempted as Ludwell Cary would not have
been. Oh, perhaps if I had not been there, he would have
made his compact. But I was there! and I besought him&mdash;and
that night he swore to me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Cary threw out his arm with a cry. &quot;Stop, stop! I take
God to witness that I never thought of this!&quot;</p>

<p>She went on, unheeding. &quot;He swore to me that whatever
in that world of his he had thought of Aaron Burr and of
his projects, however keenly he had seen the dazzling fortune
that lay in that western country, yet, as I had left my world
for his, so would he leave that night, in this, his world for
mine! And he did so&mdash;he did so that night before the
dawn!&quot;</p>

<p>She raised her hand to her eyes and dashed away the bright
drops. &quot;You have done an injustice. All this time you
have thought him what that night you called Aaron Burr. I
know not where Colonel Burr is now, but since the night of
the nineteenth of February, he and my husband have had
no dealings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My God!&quot; said Cary, in a low voice; then, &quot;This is all
your assurance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All?&quot; she echoed proudly. &quot;It is enough.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned away and, walking to the edge of the wood,
stood there, striving for some measure of self-command. His
hands opened and shut. Lewis Rand was a perjured traitor,
and it only remained to tell Jacqueline as much.</p>

<p>The garden swam before his eyes, then the mist passed and
he saw with distinctness. There was a path before him that
led away between walls of box to the green and flowery heart
of the place, and at the heart was a summer-house. He saw it
all again. There was the morning in June, there was the blowing
rose, there was the sudden vision&mdash;Rand and Jacqueline,
hand in hand, with mingled breath! It was into this
path that he had turned&mdash;it was to this wood that he had
stumbled, leaving them there. He felt again the icy shock,
the death and wormwood in his soul. They had had the
gold, they had loved and embraced while, with his face to
the earth, he had lain there beneath that tree where now she
stood. Well, Time's globe was turning&mdash;there were shadows
now for the lovers' country! Their land, too, would have its
night; perhaps an endless night. He entertained the fierce,
triumphant thought, but not for long. He had loved Jacqueline
Churchill truly, and her happiness was more to him
than his own. When, presently, he reached the consideration
of her in that darkened country, moving forever over ash
and cinder beneath an empty, leaden heaven, he found the
contemplation intolerable. A tenderness crept into his heart,
divine enough as things go in the heart of man. The summer-house
mocked him still, and the image of Rand walked with
armed foot through every chamber of his brain, but he wished
no worse for Jacqueline than unending light and love. After
the first red moment, it was not possible to him to put out
one lamp, to break one flower, in her paradise. It hung like
a garden in Babylon over the dust and sorrow of the common
way, over the gulf of broken gods and rent illusions. To jar
that rainbow tenure by the raising of his voice, to bring that
phantom bliss whirling down to the trodden street, lay not
within the quality of the man. He closed his eyes and fought
with the memory of that June morning when he and Colonel
Churchill had come upon the summer-house; fought with
that and with a hundred memories besides, then looked again,
and quietly, at the autumn place, bright with late flowers and
breathed over by the haunting fragrance of the box. Another
moment and he turned back to the wood and the great tree.</p>

<p>Jacqueline sat beneath the cedar, the branch of ironweed
again within her hand. She had found it natural that Ludwell
Cary should turn away. It was not easy to struggle
against a misconception, to re-marshal facts and revise
judgments&mdash;often it was hard. She waited quietly, fingering
the tufts of purple bloom, her eyes upon the clear sky
between the cedar boughs. When at last she heard his step
and looked up, it was with an exquisite kindness in her large,
dark eyes. &quot;It was a natural mistake,&quot; she said. &quot;Do not
think that I blame you. It is hard to believe in good when
we think we see evil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am thankful,&quot; he answered, &quot;that you are back in your
shrine. Forgive me my error.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him fixedly. &quot;But concerning Lewis&mdash;there,
too, was error. Why should you continue enemies?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Cary spoke, sadly and bitterly.
&quot;You must leave me that. There are men who are born to
be antagonists. When that is so, they find each other out
over half the world, and circumstance may be trusted to
square for them a battle-ground. Mr. Rand and I, I fear,
will still be enemies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what I have told you makes no difference&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are mistaken there. What you have told me shall
have its weight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, then,&quot; cried Jacqueline, &quot;you cannot judge him as
you have been judging throughout a spring and summer!
You are just and generous&mdash;will you not try to be friends?
Ere this men have left off being foes, and many and many
a battlefield is now thick with wild flowers. I should be
happy if you and Lewis would clasp hands.&quot;</p>

<p>Her voice was persuasion's own, and there was a tremulous
smile upon her red lips, and a soft light in her dark eyes.
&quot;There is a thing that I have long divined,&quot; she said, &quot;and
that is the strange regard for what you think and what you
are that exists deep, deep down in his mind. It lies so deep
that he is mainly ignorant that it is there. He thinks that you
and he are all inimical. But it is there like an ancient treasure
far down in the ocean depths, far below the surface storm.
There is in him a preoccupation with you. Often and often,
when questions of right and wrong arise, I know that his
thought descends to that secret place where he keeps an
image of you! I know that he interrogates that image, 'Is
it thus or so that you would do?' And if, at times, scornfully
or sullenly or with indifference, he does the opposite to
what the image says, yet none the less at the next decision
will his thought fly to that same judgment bar! It is an
attraction that he fights against, a habit of the mind that
he would break if he could&mdash;but it is there&mdash;indeed, indeed
it is there! It is despotic&mdash;I do not think that he can
escape. Ah, if you and he were friends, you would be friends
indeed!&quot; She looked at him pleadingly, with her hand outstretched.</p>

<p>Cary shook his head. &quot;You are mistaken,&quot; he said harshly.
&quot;I am conscious of no place where my spirit and that of
Mr. Rand may touch. I cannot explain; we are enemies:
you must let us fight it out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does it so much matter that you are Federalist and he
Republican?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It matters very little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or that you are a Cary, with all that that means, while
he is Lewis Rand from the Three-Notched Road?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That matters not at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or that you are rival lawyers? Or that in politics he
has defeated you? Or&mdash;Oh, my friend, now I am dealing
unjustly! Forgive me&mdash;forgive me and make friends!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would he,&quot; asked Cary sombrely&mdash;&quot;would he agree?
I think not. I am sure not. I think rather that he cherishes
this enmity, feeds it, and fans it. Our lines in life have crossed,
and now there is no force can lay them parallel. The sun is
sinking, and I must see Major Edward again.&quot;</p>

<p>She rose from her seat beneath the cedar. &quot;I'll hope on,&quot;
she said. &quot;Some day, if we live long enough, all clouds will
break. Time withstands even the stony heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think,&quot; he demanded, &quot;that mine is a stony
heart? Well, be it so, since this is a game of misunderstanding!
I will say this. If I could come, the next nineteenth of
February, to your house on Shockoe Hill, and find him
there, and find you happy with him there, then, then I
think I would clasp hands&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; she cried, &quot;do not wait until February! We shall
be there on Shockoe Hill in November.&quot;</p>

<p>He stooped and lifted her branch of ironweed. &quot;You are
sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;The house has been retaken.
We go to Richmond as soon as Lewis comes back
from over the mountains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has bought land in the western part of the state. He
is going on a journey soon to examine it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Toward the Ohio?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; toward the Ohio. How did you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you&mdash;you will not go with him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has talked of my going. But I cannot now that my
aunt is ill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he will wait?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; he says that he will. How pale you are! I am sure
you are not well?&quot;</p>

<p>They had stepped from out the wood into the light of
the garden. She looked at him with concern, but be dismissed
her question with a gesture of his hand and a laugh that
sounded strangely in her ears. &quot;It is,&quot; he said, &quot;the fading
light. Are you going in now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet. Daphne is ill at the quarter, and I'll walk
down to her cabin first. Do you stay to supper?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not to-night. But I wish to see Major Edward again.
If you'll allow me, I will go on to the library.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; answered Jacqueline, and, when he had kissed
her hand and said good-bye, watched him across the flower
garden and up the steps that led to the glass doors. He passed
into the room, out of her sight, but she still stood there among
the asters and the box. His look was strange, she thought,
and her hand had been crushed, rather than held, to his lips.
She drew her scarf about her; the September evening was
falling chill. The sunset light struck full upon the glass doors.
She wondered why, for the second time in an afternoon,
Ludwell Cary wished to see Uncle Edward, there in the
library. Only once or twice, in the fortnight that she had
been at Fontenoy, had she entered the library, and it was
the room of all others that she loved. She thought now of
the old green chair and of her father's portrait, and of every
loved and dreamed-of detail, and she felt shut out in the dusk
and chill. A sensation of strangeness crept over her. She
thought, &quot;If I were dead and trying to make the living hear,
I should feel this way. And they would not even try to hear;
they would shut the door and keep me out, all alone in the
dark.&quot;</p>

<p>She stood for a full minute staring at the panes and the
red reflected glare of the sun, then drew the scarf closer over
her head, and took the path that led to the quarter.</p>

<h3>MAJOR EDWARD</h3>


<p>Rand rose from the supper-table and led the way
into the dim, high-ceilinged room that served him
as study and library. &quot;Bring the candles,&quot; he said
over his shoulder, and Tom Mocket obediently took up the
heavy candelabra. With the clustered lights illuminating
freckled face and sandy hair, he followed his chief. &quot;Don't
you want me to start the fire?&quot; he asked. &quot;These October
nights are mortal cold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;Put a light to it and make the
room bright. Fire is like a woman's presence.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he walked to the windows and drew the curtains,
then took from his desk a number of papers and began
to lay them in an orderly row upon the table in the middle of
the room. &quot;Mrs. Churchill is quite out of danger. My wife
returns to Roselands to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's fortunate,&quot; quoth Mocket, on his knees before
the great fireplace. &quot;You always did cut things mighty close,
Lewis, and I must say you are cutting this one close! Adam,
he goes along from day to day laughing and singing, with a
face as smooth as an egg, but I'll warrant he's watching the
sun, the clock, and the hourglass!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know&mdash;I know,&quot; said Rand. &quot;The sun is travelling,
and the clock is striking, and the sands are running. This
was a cursed check, this illness at Fontenoy. But for it I
should be now upon the Ohio.&quot; He left the table and began
to pace the room, his hands clasped behind him. &quot;Two
weeks from here to this island&mdash;then eight weeks for that
twelve hundred miles of river, and to gather men from New
Madrid and Baton Rouge and Bayou Pierre. October,
November, December. Say New Orleans by the New Year.
There will be some seizing there,&mdash;the banks, the shipping.
If the army joins us, all will be well. But there, Tom, there!
there is the 'if' in this project!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you are sure of General Wilkinson!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand paused to take a letter from his pocket. &quot;Burr is. I
have this to-day from him in cipher. Listen!&quot; He unfolded
the paper, brought it into the firelight, and began to read in
a clear, low voice. &quot;Burr has written to Wilkinson in substance
as follows: Funds are obtained and operations commenced.
The eastern detachment will rendezvous on the
Ohio the first of November. Everything internal and external
favours our views. The naval protection of England is secured.
Final orders are given to my friends and followers.
It will be a host of choice spirits. Burr proceeds westward
never to return. With him go his daughter and grandson.
Our project, my dear friend, is brought to a point so long
desired. Burr guarantees the result with his life and honour,
with the lives and honour and fortune of hundreds, the best
blood of our country. Burr's plan of operation is to move
down rapidly from the falls on the fifteenth of November,
with the first five hundred or one thousand men, in light boats,
now constructing for that purpose, to be at Natchez between
the fifth and fifteenth of December, there to meet Wilkinson,
there to determine whether it will be expedient in the first instance
to seize on, or pass by, Baton Rouge. The people of the
country to which we are going are prepared to receive us;
their agents, now with Burr, say that if we will protect their
religion, and will not subject them to a foreign power, then in
three weeks all will be settled. The gods invite us to glory and
fortune; it remains to be seen whether we deserve the boon.'&quot;</p>

<p>Rand ceased to read and refolded the paper. &quot;So Colonel
Burr, with more to the same effect. If he writes thus to General
Wilkinson, he is undoubtedly very sure of that gentleman
and of the army which he commands. I am not of as confident
a temper, and I am sure of no one save Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>The other blew the flames beneath the pine knots.
&quot;There's Gaudylock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I except Gaudylock.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom rose from the brick hearth and dusted his knees.
&quot;And there's me.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand smiled down upon his old lieutenant. &quot;Ah, yes,
there's you, Tom,&mdash;you and Vinie! Well, if we are fortunate,
you shall come to me in the spring. By then we'll know
if we are conquerors and founders of empire, or if we're simply
to be hanged as traitors. If the fairer lot is ours, you
shall have your island, my good old Panza!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if it's the other?&quot; demanded Tom, with a wry
face.</p>

<p>Rand gave his characteristic short laugh. &quot;It shall not
be the other. The hemp is not planted that shall trouble us.
There are no more astrologers now that we are grown wise,&mdash;and
still a man trusts in his star! I trust in mine. Well, next
week you'll open the office as usual, and to all that come
you'll state that I've gone, between courts, to look at a purchase
of land in Wood County. I'll bring that forgery case
to an end day after to-morrow, and by Monday Adam and
I will be out of Albemarle.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket drew a long breath. &quot;Monday! That's soon, but
the sooner, I reckon, the better. Sometimes just any delay is
fatal. For all his singing, I know that Adam is anxious&mdash;and
he's weatherwise, is Adam! There's something in the
air. The papers have begun to talk, and everywhere you turn
there's the same damned curiosity about Aaron Burr and
New Orleans and Mexico and the Washita lands! Moreover,
when a man's as quiet as Mr. Jefferson is just now, I suspect
that man. Best to get quite out of reach of a countermine.
You've gone too far not to go a deal farther.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just so,&quot; agreed the other. &quot;Many and many a league
farther. Now, this paper of directions. I'll go over it carefully
with you, and then I'll burn it. First, as to Roselands,
the stock, and the servants. Joab and Isham go with us,
starting on horseback an hour behind the chaise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You take no maid for Mrs. Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It cannot be managed. When we reach this island, I can
doubtless purchase a woman from Mr. Blennerhassett.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Rand does not know yet, does she, Lewis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She does not know. She will not know until we are over
the mountains and return is impossible.&quot; He turned from the
fire, walked the room again, and spoke on as to himself.
&quot;When I tell her, there will be my first battle, and the one
battle that I dread! But I'll win it,&mdash;I'll win because I
<i>must</i> win. She will suffer at first, but I will make her forget,&mdash;I
will love her so that I will make her forget. If all goes
well and greatness is in our horoscope, she shall yet be friends
with the crown upon her brow! Yes, and gracious friends
with all that she has left behind, and with her Virginian kindred!
When all's won, and all's at peace, and the clash and
marvel an old tale, then shall her sister and her cousin visit
her.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused at the fireplace and stirred the logs with his foot.
&quot;But that's a vision of the morrow. Between now and then,
and here and there, it never fails that there's an ambushed
road.&quot; He stood a moment, staring at the leaping flames,
then returned to the table. &quot;Back to business, Tom! When
Roselands is sold&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know,&quot; suggested Tom, &quot;I've been thinking
that, now he is going to be married, a purchaser might be
found in Fairfax Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fairfax Cary!&quot; exclaimed the other, and drummed upon
the table. &quot;No; they will not want it, those two. Poor old
Tom! your intuitions are not very fine, are they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I just thought he might,&quot; said the underling. &quot;But
he may live on at Greenwood with Ludwell Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand struck his foot against the floor. &quot;Don't let us speak
that name to-night! I am weary of it. It haunts me like a
bell&mdash;<i>Ludwell Cary! Ludwell Cary!</i> And why it should
haunt me, and why the thought of him always, for one moment,
palsies my will and my arm, I know no more than you!
When I shake the dust of this county from my feet, it shall go
hard but I will shake this obsession from my soul! Somewhere,
when this world was but a fiery cloud, all the particles
of our being were whirled into collision. Well, enough of
that! Whoever purchases Roselands, it will not be a Cary.
What's the matter now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a horse coming up the drive.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand dropped the paper in his hand and sat listening.
&quot;Unlucky! I wanted no visitor to-night. It may be but a
messenger. Ring the bell, will you, for Joab.&quot;</p>

<p>The horse came on and stopped before the great doorstone.
There was the sound of some one dismounting, Joab
speaking, and then the voice of the horseman. Rand started
violently. &quot;Are we awake?&quot; he said, rising. &quot;That is Major
Churchill's voice.&quot;</p>

<p>Joab appeared at the door. &quot;Marse Lewis, Marse Edward
Churchill say kin he trouble you fer a few minutes' conversation?
He say he lak ter see you alone&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One moment, Joab,&quot; said the master, gathering the
papers from the table as he spoke. &quot;Tom, you'll go back to
the dining-room and wait for me there. No; not by that door&mdash;there's
no use in his meeting you. What imaginable thing
has brought him here?&quot; He replaced the papers in a drawer,
closed and locked it, looked up to see that Mocket was gone,
and spoke to the negro. &quot;Show Major Churchill in here.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major entered, dry, withered, his empty sleeve pinned
to the front of his riding-coat. &quot;Mr. Rand, good-evening.
Ha, a cheerful fire against a frosty night! I come in out of the
cold to a blaze like that, sir, and straightway, by a trick of the
mind that never fails, I am back at Valley Forge!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand looked at him keenly. &quot;Permit me to hope, sir, that
there is nothing wrong at Fontenoy? My wife is well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fontenoy is much as usual, sir,&quot; answered his visitor,
&quot;and my niece is very well. It is natural that my appearance
here should cause surprise.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand pushed forward a great chair. &quot;Yes, I am surprised,&quot;
he said, with a smile. &quot;Very much surprised. But since you
bring no bad news, I am also glad. Won't you sit, sir? You
are welcome to Roselands.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward took the edge of the chair, and held out his
long, thin fingers to the blaze. &quot;Yes; Valley Forge,&quot; he
repeated, with his dry deliberation. &quot;Valley Forge&mdash;and
starving soldiers moaning through the icy night! Washington
rarely slept; he sat there in his tent, planning, planning,
in the cold, by the dim light. There was a war&mdash;and
there were brave men&mdash;and there was a patriot soul!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I learn from Jacqueline that Colonel Churchill and you
too, sir, have shown her for some days past much kindness,
tenderness, and consideration. She has been made happy
thereby.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My niece has never been other than dear to me, sir,&quot; said
the Major, and still warmed his hand. &quot;I believe, Mr. Rand,
that your father fought bravely in the war?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He did his part, sir. He was a scout with General
Campbell and, I have heard, fought like a berserker at
King's Mountain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he did his part,&quot; the Major replied, &quot;he did well, and
is to be reckoned among the <i>patres patri&aelig;</i>. It is a good
inheritance to derive from a patriot father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I have read, sir,&quot; said Rand dryly.</p>

<p>There was a silence while the flames leaped and roared.
The Major broke it. &quot;You would take me, would you not,
Mr. Rand, to be a man of my word?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It has been my reputation. The last time that I spoke
to you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Rand smiled gravely. &quot;That was two years and a half ago,
and your speech was to the effect that never should you speak
to me again. Well! opinion and will have their mutations.
Men of their word, Major Churchill, know better than most
how little worth are the words of men. However you come
here to-night, pray believe that you are welcome, and that I
would gladly be friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward drew a long breath, pushed back his chair
somewhat from the warmth of the fire, and from under shaggy
brows regarded his nephew-in-law with the eyes of an old
eagle, sombre and fierce. &quot;Be so good, then, as to conceive
that I come with an olive branch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is difficult,&quot; said Rand, after a pause and with a smile,
&quot;to conceive that, but if it be true, sir, then hail to the olive!
This feud was not of my seeking.&quot; He leaned forward from
his chair and held out his hand. &quot;Ever since the days of the
blue room and that deep draught of Fontenoy kindness, a
light has dwelt for me over the place. Will you not shake
hands, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>The other made an irresolute movement, then drew back.
&quot;Let us wait a little,&quot; he exclaimed harshly. &quot;Perhaps I will,
sir, in the end, perhaps I will! It is in the hope that eventually
we will strike hands that I sit here. But such signs of amity
come with better grace at the battle's end&mdash;&quot; He paused
and glared at the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;There is, then, to be a battle?&quot;</p>

<p>The Major swung around from the red light of the logs.
&quot;Mr. Rand, we&mdash;my brother Dick and I&mdash;propose a lasting
peace between the two houses, between Fontenoy and
Roselands. My brother Henry, sir, the father of&mdash;of your
wife, sir, was as near to us in love as in blood, and the honour,
safety, and peace of mind of his daughter are very much our
concern! You will say that by perseverance in this long
estrangement we have ignored the last of these. Perhaps, sir,
perhaps! Old men are obstinate, and their wounds do not
heal like those of youth. Enough of that! We&mdash;my brother
Dick and I&mdash;are prepared to let bygones be bygones. We
have cudgelled our brains&mdash;I mean, we have talked matters
over. We are prepared, Mr. Rand, to meet you halfway&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Rand. &quot;On what specific proposition?&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward rose, took a short turn in the room, and
came back to his chair. &quot;Mr. Rand, in the matter of the
nomination for Governor, is it too late to recall your refusal?
I think not, sir. Your party has named no other candidate.
As a Federalist, I know, sir, but little of that party's inner
working, but I am told that you would sweep the state. Far
be it from me to say that I wish to see a Democrat-Republican
Governor of Virginia! I do not. But since the gentleman
for whom I myself, sir, shall vote, is undoubtedly destined to
defeat, we&mdash;my brother Dick and I&mdash;consider that that
post may as well be filled by you, sir, as by any other of your
Jacobinical party. No one doubts your ability&mdash;you are
diabolically able! But, sir, I would bury this arm where a
damned cutthroat barber surgeon buried the other before I
would cry on to such a post any man who did not enter the
race with heart and hands washed clean of all but honour,
plain intents, and loyalty! In the past he may have been
tempted&mdash;he may have listened to the charmer, charming
never so wisely&mdash;there is in man an iron capacity for going
wrong. He may have done this, planned that&mdash;I know not;
we all err. It is not too late; he may yet put behind him all
this&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not think that I understand,&quot; said Rand. &quot;All what,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p>The Major faced around from the fire with a jerk. &quot;All
this. I am explicit, sir. All this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; answered Rand. &quot;I am dull, I suppose. All this.
Well, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should,&quot; continued the Major, with emphasis, &quot;regard
the acceptance of the nomination as proof positive of the laying
aside of all conflicting ideas, uneasy dreams, and fallacious
reasoning, of all intents and purposes that might war
with a sober and honourable discharge of exalted public
duties. They are exalted, sir, and they may be so highly
discharged, so ably and so loftily, as to infinitely dignify the
office that has already great traditions. A Governor of Virginia
may be the theme, sir, of many a far distant panegyric&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Again he rose and stalked across the room, then, returning
to the hearth, stood before Rand, his high, thin features somewhat
flushed and his deep old eyes alight. &quot;Mr. Rand, it
would be idle to deny to you that I have had for you both dislike
and mistrust. You may, if you choose, even strengthen
these terms and say that I have regarded you with hatred and
contempt. I am a man of strong feelings, sir, and you outraged
them&mdash;you outraged them! Well, I am prepared
to bury all that. Become a great Governor of Virginia, serve
your land truly, according to the lights vouchsafed to a Republican,
and, though we may not vote for you, sir, yet we&mdash;my
brother Dick and I&mdash;we will watch your career with interest&mdash;yes,
damn me, sir! with interest, pride, and affection!&quot; He
broke off to stare moodily into the fire and, with his foot, to
thrust farther in a burning log.</p>

<p>&quot;An olive branch!&quot; exclaimed Rand, smiling. &quot;This is a
whole grove of olives! I am sorry about the governorship&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have made enquiries,&quot; interrupted the other harshly.
&quot;You have but to signify your change of mind to your committee,
and your name is up. The governorship&mdash;the governorship
is not all! It is but a step from Richmond to Washington.
There's field enough for even a towering ambition.&quot;
He looked around him. &quot;And Roselands. This place has
always had a charm. In the old days it was famed for
hospitality&mdash;for hospitality and for the beauty of its women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In neither respect, sir, has it lost its reputation.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward made a gesture of acquiescence. &quot;I dare
say not, sir, I dare say not. I am told that Republicans flock
here. And Jacqueline is a beautiful woman. Well, sir, why
should not pilgrimages be made to Roselands as to Monticello?
You have begun to improve it. Continue, and make
the place a Garden of Eden, a Farm of Cincinnatus, a&mdash;a&mdash;what
you will! Dick thinks that you may not be in funds to
plant and build as you desire. If that is so, sir, either he or I
might with ease accommodate you&mdash;&quot; He paused.</p>

<p>&quot;I take your offer as it is meant,&quot; said Rand, &quot;and thank
you both. But my affairs are in order, and I am not straitened
for money.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major made a courteous gesture. &quot;It was but a supposition.
Well, Mr. Rand, why not? Why not make the
picture real that we are painting? Eminent in public
affairs&mdash;eminent in the law&mdash;ay, there, sir, I will praise you
unreservedly. You are a great lawyer&mdash;worshipped by your
party and in the line of succession to its highest gift, fixed
in your state and county and happy in your home, rounding
out your life with all that makes life worthy to be lived,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Honour, love, obedience, troops of friends.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Is not the picture fair enough, sir? There is in it no mirage, no
Fata Morgana, no marsh fire. You are a man of great abilities,
with ample power to direct those inner forces to outward
ends that shall truly gild your name. Truly, sir, not falsely.
Gold, not pinchbeck. Clear glory of duty highly done, not a
cloudy fame whose wings are drenched with blood and tears.
Come, sir, come&mdash;make an old man happy!&quot; He dragged
his chair nearer to Rand and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot accept the nomination for Governor, sir,&quot; said
Rand. &quot;There are various considerations which put it out of
the question. I cannot go into these with you. You must
take it from me that it is impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>The Major drew back. &quot;That is final, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is final.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence. Rand sat, chin in hand, thoughtfully
regarding his visitor. Major Churchill, erect, rigid, grey, and
arid, stared before him as though indeed he saw only snowy
plains, fallen men, and a forlorn hope. At last he spoke in a
dry and difficult voice. &quot;You persevere in your intention of
returning to Richmond and to your house on Shockoe Hill
in November?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is my plan, sir, to go to Richmond in November.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Immediately upon your return from over the mountains?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand shot a glance at his interlocutor. &quot;Immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These lands that you are going to see, sir&mdash;they are not
as far as the Washita?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; they are not as far as the Washita.&quot; Rand sat
upright and let his hand fall heavily upon the arm of his
chair. &quot;That is a curious question, Major Churchill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you find it so?&quot; asked the Major grimly. &quot;<i>I</i> should,
were it asked of me&mdash;so damned strange a question that it
would not pass without challenge! But then, I am not declining
governorships nor travelling West.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand rose from his chair. &quot;Major Churchill&quot;&mdash;He
stopped short, bit his lip, and walked away to the window.
There he drew the curtain slightly aside and stood with brow
pressed against a pane, gazing out into the frosty darkness. A
half moon just lifted the wide landscape out of shadow, and
from the interlacing boughs of trees the coloured leaves were
falling. Rand looked at the distant mountains, but the eye of
his mind travelled farther yet and saw all the country beyond,
all the land of the To Be, all the giant valley of the Mississippi,
all the rolling, endless plains, all Mexico with snowy peaks
and mines of gold. The apparition did not come dazzlingly.
He was no visionary. He weighed and measured and reckoned
carefully with his host. But there, beyond the mountains,
lay no small part of the habitable world,&mdash;and the
race of conquerors had not died with Alexander or C&aelig;sar,
Cortez or Pizarro! Witness Marengo and Austerlitz and that
throne at Fontainebleau! He dropped the curtain from his
hand and turned to the firelit room and to the tense grey figure
on the hearth. &quot;Major Churchill, if, softened by Jacqueline's
presence there at Fontenoy, you came to-night to Roselands
with the simple purpose of making friends with the man she
loves, then, sir, that man would be a heartless churl indeed if
he were not touched and gratified, and did not accept with
eagerness such an overture. But, sir, but! There is more, I
think, in your visit to-night than meets the eye. You demand
that I shall become my party's candidate for the governorship.
I answer it is not now possible. You insist that I shall
busy myself with improvements here at Roselands, and to
that end you offer to reinforce my purse. I answer that Roselands
does very well, and that I am not in need of money.
You preach to me patriotism and refer to General Washington;
you speak poetically of gold <i>versus</i> pinchbeck, and true
glory <i>versus</i> fame with drenched wings; you ask me certain
questions in a voice that has hardly the ring of friendship&mdash;and
last but not least you wish to know if a parcel of land that
I have bought over the mountains is situate upon the Washita!
The Washita, Major Churchill, is on the far side of the
Mississippi, in Spanish Territory. May I ask, sir, before I
withdraw my welcome to Roselands, by what right you are
entitled to put such a question to me, and what is, indeed,
the purport of your visit here to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward Churchill rose, stark and grey, with narrowed
eyes and deliberating, pointing hand. &quot;You are a villain,
sir; yes, sir, a damned, skilled, heart-breaking villain!
Bold! yes, you are bold&mdash;bold as others of your tribe of whom
the mythologies tell! Arrogant as Lucifer, you are more
wretched than the slave in your fields! You might have been
upon the side of light; you have chosen darkness. It will
swallow you up, and I, for one, shall say, 'The night hath its
own.' You have chosen wrongly where you might have chosen
rightly, and you have not done so in blind passion but in cold
blood, fully and freely, under whatever monstrous light it is
by which you think you walk! I have warned you of the gulf,
and I have warned in vain. So be it! But do not think, sir,
do not think that you will be allowed to drag with you, down
into the darkness, the woman whom you have married! I
wish that my niece had died before she saw your face! Do
you know what she thinks you, sir? She thinks you a lover
so devoted that at her pleading you put forever from you a
gilded lure; a gentleman so absolutely of your word that for
her to doubt it would be the blackest treason; a statesman and
a patriot who will yet nobly serve Virginia and the country!
God knows what she doesn't think you&mdash;the misguided
child! She's happy to-night, at Fontenoy, because she's
coming home to you to-morrow. That I should have lived
to say such a thing of Henry Churchill's daughter! When I
rode away to-night, she was singing.&quot; He burst into spasmodic
and grating laughter. &quot;It was that song of Lovelace's!
By God, sir, she must have had you in mind.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;I could not love thee, dear, so much,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Loved I not honour more.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, by God, she was thinking of you! Ha ha, ha ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are an old man,&quot; said Rand. &quot;It is well for you that
you are. I wish to know who is responsible for these conjectures,
suspicions, charges&mdash;whatever term you choose, sir,
for all are alike indifferent to me&mdash;which brought you here
to-night? Who, sir, is the principal in this affair? You are
an old man, and you are my wife's kinsman; doubly are you
behind cover; but who, who, Major Churchill, set you on to
speak of towering ambition and blood-drenched wings and
broken vows and deceived innocence, and all the rest of this
night's farrago? Who, I say&mdash;who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask on, sir,&quot; answered the Major grimly. &quot;There is no
law against asking, as there is none to compel an answer.
Sir, I am about to remove myself from a house that I shall not
trouble again, and I have but three words to say before I bid
you good-night. I warn you not to proceed with your Luciferian
schemes, whatever they may be, sir, whatever they
may be! I warn you that it is ill travelling over the mountains
at this season of the year, and I solemnly protest to you
that my niece shall not travel with you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who,&quot; asked Rand calmly,&mdash;&quot;and who will prevent
that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; answered the other, &quot;a grain of sand or a blade of
grass, if rightly placed.&quot; He shook his long forefinger at the
younger man. &quot;You have been fortunate for a long turn in
the game, Lewis Rand, and you have grown to think the revolving
earth but a pin-wheel for your turning. You will
awake some day, and since there is that in you which charity
might call perverted greatness, I think that you will suffer
when you awake. In which hope, sir, I take my leave. Mr.
Rand, I have the honour to bid you a very good-night.&quot;</p>

<p>The master of Roselands rang the bell. &quot;Good-night,
Major Churchill. I am sorry that we part no better friends,
and I regret that you will not tell me what gatherer up of
rumour and discoverer of mares' nests was at the pains to
procure me the honour of this visit. I might hazard a guess&mdash;but
no matter. Joab, Major Churchill's horse. Good-night,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p>He bowed formally. Major Churchill stood for a moment
looking straight before him with a somewhat glassy stare,
then, &quot;Good-night, Mr. Rand,&quot; he said, in a voice like a wind
through November reeds, made a bow as low and as studied
as that with which he had once honoured Rand in the Fontenoy
drawing-room, turned with martial precision, and stalked
from the room.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand stood long upon the hearth, staring down into
the fire. He heard Major Edward's horse go down the drive
and out upon the highroad with a swiftness that spoke of a
rider in a passion. The sound of hoofs died away, and he still
stood looking into the red hollows, but at last with a short and
angry laugh he turned away and opened the door which led
to the dining-room. &quot;Are you still there, Tom? Come in,
man! The accusing angel has gone.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom appeared, and the two went back to the great table in
the centre of the room. Rand unlocked the drawer and took
out the papers in the perusal of which they had been interrupted.
Mocket snuffed the candles and tossed another log
of hickory upon the fire. &quot;It falls in with what Gaudylock
suspected,&quot; said Rand's measured voice behind him, &quot;and it
all dates back to the nineteenth of February. When he left
the house that night, he must have known&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of whom are you talking?&quot; asked Tom at the fire.
&quot;Major Edward?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not Major Edward. And now he is using his knowledge.
She told me to-day that he was often at Fontenoy.
Too often, too often, Ludwell Cary!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, after stopping my mouth, you have spoken his name
yourself!&quot; remarked Tom. &quot;You and he are over against
each other in that case to-morrow, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In every case we are over against each other,&quot; said the
other abruptly. &quot;And we shall be so until Judgment Day.
Come, man, come! we have all these to go through with
before cockcrow.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII" />CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>A CHALLENGE</h3>


<p>The Charlottesville Robbery Case was one of no great
importance save to those directly concerned. It had
to do with a forged note, a robbery by night, and an
absconding trusted clerk of a company of British Merchants.
When the case came up for trial on this October day, the
Court House was well filled indeed, but rather on account of
the lawyers engaged than because of the matter's intrinsic
interest. The British Merchants had retained Mr. Ludwell
Cary. The side of the prisoner, mentioning that fact in a
pitiful scrawl addressed to the law office of Messrs. Rand and
Mocket, found to its somewhat pathetic surprise that Mr.
Rand himself would take the case and oppose Mr. Cary.</p>

<p>The two had fought it with a determination apparent to
every bystander, and now, on the last day of the trial, the
counsel for the prosecution rose to sum up his case. He was
listened to with attention, and his speech was effective. The
theme was the individual who, after forgery and embezzlement,
had taken French leave, quitting a post of trust and
credit for regions where he hoped to enjoy his ill-gotten gains
in peace and quietness. The regions had proved inhospitable,
and a sheriff had escorted the unlucky adventurer with that
which was not his own back to the spot whence he had started.
His transgression was now to be traced from the moment&mdash;day
or night, or sunrise or sunset; what mattered the moment?&mdash;when
the thought passed through his brain, &quot;Why
should I plod on like other men?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Passed through,' did I say?&mdash;nay, it tarried; at first
like a visitor who will one day take his leave, then a cherished
inmate, and at last lord and master of every crevice of that
petty mansion! It <i>dwelled</i> there, and day by day it fed itself
with remembered examples. 'There was Tom, over on the
Eastern Shore, grew tired, too, of working for his employers,&mdash;and
he robbed the till one night, and got off on a sloop to
the Havana, and now they say he has a pirate ship of his
very own! And Dick. Dick got tired, too, in a tan-yard in
Alexandria, and when his master sent him on a mission to
Washington, he took his foot in his hand and went farther.
He had his expenses in his pocket, so why not? He's
prospering now in a bigger and gayer town than Alexandria!
And Harry. Harry was more trusted than them all, but he,
too, got tired&mdash;in a warehouse at Rocket's&mdash;of plod, plod,
plod! serve, serve, serve! So he forged a name, and took the
gold that lay beneath his hand, tore up his indentures, and
fled in the night-time&mdash;over the hills and far away! He's a
rich man now, somewhere near the sunset, rich and great,
with clerks of his own. He had the advantage of education,
had Harry! Examples! Examples thick as hops! What's
Buonaparte himself but a poor Corsican lieutenant that stole
an empire? I'll be bold, too. I'll steal, and then I'll steal
away!'</p>

<p>&quot;So scullion soul to pliant body. His thought is father to
his deed, and there is the usual resemblance between son
and parent. What matters it that he has lived in his
employer's house, and has found him no Egyptian taskmaster, but a
benefactor, lavish of favours? What matters it that he has
in charge things of trust and moment which, by miscarrying,
will work distress to many? What matters it that others are
about him, engaged in this same drudgery of doing one's
duty, to whom, should he succeed in villainy as he trusts to
do, his example will remain, a wrecker's light to entice the
storm-tossed upon a rocky shore? What matters it,&mdash;I am
told, gentlemen, that the prisoner has a good and industrious
sister,&mdash;what matters it that rarely, rarely, is there ill-doing
without, somewhere in the shadowed background, some
bruised and broken heart? What does it matter that he
betrays his trust, breaks his oath, blackens his name, slurs his
friends, and recruits the army, wan and sinister, of all the
fallen since time began? To him, apparently, it matters less
than a drifting leaf in the wind of this October day. He
remembers all that he should forget, and forgets all that
should be remembered. There pass by him in long parade
Tom and Dick and Harry and others of their ilk. He sees
them, and he sees little else. It is a host of choice spirits, and
they have banners flying. His courage mounts. Brave
emulation! noble rivalry! He, too, will be bold; he, too, will join
their regiment! For him, too, the spoils of opportunity and
a daughter of the game! He feels the summer in the air,
and all Brummagem rises upon his horizon. Farewell to
patient drudgery and the slow playing over of the tune of
life! He's for a brisker air, he's for 'Over the hills and far
away.'</p>

<p>&quot;His little plans are laid. I say 'little,' gentlemen, advisedly,
for in all this there is no greatness. We speak of a self-seeker
here, and all the ends of such an one are small, and he himself
has not attained the full stature of a man. The ambitious
soul before us! By stealth he practises until he can sign his
employer's name, more lifelike almost than life! By stealth
he gains impressions of the keys. By stealth he eyes the only
wealth that his mole mind can value! By stealth he makes
his preparations, and by stealth he cons the miles and the
post-houses between him and the country to which he means
to carry himself and his stolen goods! He is assiduous at his
desk; his employers nod approval, praise him for a lad of
parts, and hold him up for emulation. In his brain one air
continues,&mdash;'Over the hills and far away.'</p>

<p>&quot;The day approaches. The forgery is done, the accustomed
hand slips easily in and out of the golden drawer, and
all the roads are got by heart. We have the loan of a horse&mdash;before
another dawn we will be gone. O Fortune of great
thieves, stand pat! and kindly tune run on! 'Over the hills
and far away.'</p>

<p>&quot;We have been told by the worthy gentlemen, his employers,
that so trustworthy did they consider the prisoner at the
bar, so able in their affairs and assiduous in their service, that
this very day it was in their minds to increase his pay and to
raise him quite above his fellow clerks to an honourable post
indeed. He did not give them time, gentlemen, he did not
give them time! The hour is here, the notes are sewn within
the lining of our well-brushed riding-coat, the master key is
in our itching palm! We'll lurk until midnight, then in the
dark room we will unlock the drawer. If we are heard, softly
as we step in the silence of the night&mdash;if a watchman come&mdash;the
worse for the watchman! We carry pistols, and the butt
of one against his forehead will do the work. For we are bold,
gentlemen, we are as bold as C&aelig;sar or Buonaparte! We
won't be stopped&mdash;we won't! We're for 'Over the hills and
far away.'&quot;</p>

<p>The counsel for the prisoner addressed the Judge. &quot;Your
Honour, no watchman, dead or alive, being among the witnesses,
and there being no capable proof of what were or were
not my client's thoughts upon the night in question, I indignantly
protest&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The objection was sustained. The interruption over, the
attorney for the British Merchants went evenly on. &quot;We
have Mr. Rand's word for it that the prisoner had no thought
of the watchman, and no intention of using, even in case of
need, the weapons with which it has been proved he was provided.
Mr. Rand must know. As a rule, gentlemen bearing
arms about their persons may be considered the potential
users of said arms, whether the antiquated rapier or the modern
pistol&mdash;but then, I bethink me, we are not speaking
of men of honour. We are speaking of a small criminal in
a small way, and Mr. Rand assures us that his thoughts
matched his estate&mdash;they were humble, they were creeping.
Headstrong, proud, and bold are words too swelling for this
low and narrow case. To wear a weapon with intent to use
is one thing, to buckle it on as a mere trivial, harmless, modish
ornament and gewgaw is quite another! We have Mr.
Rand's word for it that it was so worn. Gentlemen, the prisoner,
armed, indeed, as has been proved, was absolutely innocent
of even the remotest intent to use under any provocation
beneath high heaven the pistols&mdash;oiled, primed, and
duelling type&mdash;with which, by chance or for the merest
whim of ornament, he had decked his person upon this eventful
night. Mr. Rand tells us so, and doubtless he knows
whereof he speaks.</p>

<p>&quot;So armed and so harmless, gentlemen, the prisoner, having
committed forgery, does now his second crime&mdash;the
pitiful robbery. The key that he has forged with care is true
to him, the gold lies at his mercy, underneath his hand; he
lifts it up, the shining thing; he bears it away. The hour
has struck, the deed is done; irrevocable, it takes its place
upon the inexpugnable record. He has stolen, and there is no
power in heaven or earth to change that little fact. We are
grown squeamish in these modern days, and no longer brand
a thief with heated iron. No letter will appear, seared on his
shoulder or his hand, but is he less the thief for that? He
himself has done the branding, and Eternity cannot wear out
the mark. He goes. With his stolen gold he steals away. It is
night. There are only the stars to watch his flight, and he
cares not for the stars&mdash;they never tell. Have they not, time
out of mind, stood the friend of all gentlemen of the road?
He quits the house that has seen his crime; he leaves dull and
honest men asleep; he bestows no parting glance upon the
dim, familiar ways. His native land is naught&mdash;he's for
green fields and pastures new&mdash;he's for Tom and Dick and
Harry, and all their goodly company&mdash;he's for 'Over the
hills and far away.'&quot;</p>

<p>The counsel for the prosecution finished his speech. The
judge summed up the case, the jury retired, and very shortly
returned with the expected verdict of Guilty. The chalk-white
and shaking prisoner stood up, was sentenced and removed,
and, the business of the day being over, the court
adjourned.</p>

<p>Good-naturedly, laughing and talking after the morning's
restraint, the crowd, gentle and simple, from the lower part
of the room, was in the course of jostling toward the door,
when there came a sudden check coupled with exclamations
from those nearest the bar, and with a general turning of
heads and bodies in that direction.</p>

<p>The lawyer for the prosecution and the lawyer for the defence
stood opposed, a yard of court-room floor between them,
and around them a ring of excited friends and acquaintances.
There had been high voices, but now a silence fell, and the
throng held its breath in cheerful expectation of the bursting
of a long predicted storm.</p>

<p>&quot;This,&quot; said Cary's clear and even voice, not raised, but
smoothly distinct,&mdash;&quot;this is a challenge, sir. I take it rightly,
Mr. Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You take it rightly, Mr. Cary. I shall presently send a
friend to wait upon you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will find me, sir, at the Swan. As the challenged party,
it is my prerogative to name hour and place. You shall
shortly be advised of both.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am going to my office, sir, where I will await your messenger.
You cannot name an hour too soon, a place too near
for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of that I am aware, Mr. Rand. I will make no delay
that I conceive to be unnecessary. I am, sir, your very
humble servant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am yours, Mr. Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>The two bowed profoundly and parted company, making
their several ways through the throng to the Swan and to the
office with the green door. With them went their immediate
friends and backers. The crowd of spectators, talking loud
or talking low, conjecturing, explaining, and laying down the
law, jesting, disputing, hotly partisan, and on the whole very
agreeably excited, finally got itself out of the Court House
and the Court-House yard, and the autumn stillness settled
down upon the place.</p>

<p>At Roselands, in the late afternoon, Jacqueline came out
upon the doorstone and sat there, listening for Selim's hoofs
upon the road. The weather was Indian summer, balmy,
mild, and blue with haze. On the great ring of grass before the
stone yellow beech leaves were lying thick, and the grey
limbs of the gigantic, solitary tree rose bare against the blue.
Jacqueline sat with her chin in her hand, watching the mountains,
more visible now that the leaves were gone. She saw
the cleft through which ran the western road, and she thought
with pleasure of the days before her. She loved the journeys
to Richmond, and this one would be more beautiful, and new.
They would be gone ten days, perhaps,&mdash;ten days of slow,
bright travel through sumptuous woods, of talk close and dear.
She was exquisitely happy as she sat there with her eyes upon
the Blue Ridge. The last fortnight of her stay at Fontenoy
had been almost a blissful time. Her uncles changed, and no
longer passed her with averted eyes, or, when they spoke, used
so cold a ceremony as to chill her heart. They grew almost
natural, they seemed even tender of her. Uncle Dick had
once again called her &quot;My little Jack,&quot; though he groaned
immediately afterwards and, getting up, looked out of the
window, and Uncle Edward left the library door ajar.
Jacqueline laid her head upon her arm and laughed. It was
coming right&mdash;it was coming right!&mdash;and next year they
would all dance at Fontenoy with light hearts, at Unity's
wedding. It had begun to come right the evening of the day
that she had met Ludwell Cary in the cedar wood. She wondered,
slightly, at that coincidence, and then she fell again to
dreaming.</p>

<p>Lewis was coming; he had passed through the gate&mdash;and
she started up. He rode on to the back of the house, left his
horse there, and, striding through the hall and down the three
stone steps, joined her where she stood upon the greensward,
among the fallen leaves. &quot;Good-evening to you!&quot; she said,
touched his shoulder with her hand, and raised her face to
his. He drew her to him, kissed her with fierce passion, and
let her go, then walked to the beech tree and stood with his
back to the house, staring at the long wall of the mountains,
dark now against a pale gold sky. She followed him. &quot;Lewis!
what is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>He answered without turning, &quot;We are not going, quite
yet awhile, over the mountains. Man proposes, and Ludwell
Cary disposes. Well! we will stay merrily at home. But he
shall pay the score!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two weeks! What may not happen over there in two
weeks? And I bound here, hard and fast, hand and foot! By
what?&mdash;by the plaything code of a plaything honour! Now,
if he were any other man under the canopy, I would not
stay! The question is, is it imaginable that all this was of
set purpose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis, what is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand turned. &quot;The matter, child? The matter is that
you may unpack, and that we will give a dinner party! We
do not travel to-morrow; no, nor the next day, nor the next!
I have to await a gentleman's leisure.&quot;</p>

<p>She hung upon his arm. &quot;Lewis, Lewis, what is it? You
are trembling&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed. &quot;Do you think it is with fear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't, don't!&quot; she cried. &quot;Don't be so angry&mdash;don't
look so black! I am afraid of you. What is it, dearest, dearest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; he said harshly. &quot;Wait, Jacqueline, a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>He put her abruptly from him, walked to the doorstone,
and, sitting down, bowed his face upon his hands. For some
moments he remained thus, while she stood under the beech
tree, her hand upon her heart, watching him. At last he
lifted his head, rose, and came back to her. &quot;To-day, in the
court room, I challenged Ludwell Cary. He has named, as
is his right, time and place of our meeting. The time, something
more than two weeks from to-day; the place, five miles
from Richmond. I confess that I was taken by surprise.
I had expected to-morrow morning and the wood beyond
the race-course. If I thought&mdash;what, by all the gods, I do
think!&mdash;that he had dared&mdash;that he had done this deliberately,
with intent to keep me here, I&mdash;Jacqueline! why,
Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm&mdash;I'm not going to swoon,&quot; said Jacqueline, with
difficulty. &quot;Air, that is all&mdash;let me sit down a moment on
the grass. A duel&mdash;you and Ludwell Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I and Ludwell Cary.&quot; Rand uttered his short laugh.
&quot;How steadily have we been coming just to this! I think
I knew it long ago. I have in me so much of the ancient
Roman that I prize him, now that we are at grips, and think
him a fair enemy. If I did not hate him, I would love him.
But it is the first, and I'll not forgive this pretty trap he's
laid! What does he think will come after these two weeks
he has me shackled? Does he think that he can always keep
me here?&mdash;or only until&mdash;until it is too late to go?&quot; He
struck his hand against the beech tree. &quot;Well, well, mine
enemy, we will try conclusions.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline rose from the grass, came to him, and laid her
head upon his breast. &quot;Lewis, is there no way out with honour?
Must it be? He is my friend and you my husband
whom I love. Will you face each other there like&mdash;like
General Hamilton and Aaron Burr? Oh, break, my heart!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand kissed her. &quot;There is no way out. He means me to
stay, and I will do it&mdash;for this while, Cary, for this while!
Look, Jacqueline; the sun is setting over the road we should
have gone! I have been a fool. Six weeks ago should have
seen us far, far upon that shining track! Now the world is
spinning from me, the glory rolling under, and I feel the dark.
Adam is right; once started on this trail, I should have gone
like the strong arrow's flight. I knew the warriors were behind
me, and yet I idled,&mdash;waited first to break with my old
chief,&mdash;as if my going would not have done that work, as
short, as clean!&mdash;and waited last because of a sick woman's
whim! If I had not let you go to Fontenoy, we might to-day
have heard the rushing of a mightier river than the Rivanna
yonder! Delay, delay, where haste itself should have felt the
spur!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I had not gone to Fontenoy,&quot; cried Jacqueline, &quot;my
aunt might have died with her last wish ungratified! If I had
not gone, oh, what would they not have thought of me, most
rightly, most justly! Now we are almost friends again,&mdash;the
thing I've prayed for, longed for, wept for, since that June!
Was this not worth the waiting? There is something here
that I do not understand. Why should you so greatly care
to see these lands? Say that there is some money lost and
some vexation&mdash;what does that count against this nearing
home&mdash;this making friends?&quot; She struck her hands together.
&quot;And yet&mdash;and yet if we had gone, there would
not have been this day, this quarrel, and this challenge!
There would not be this day to come, when I shall hear
what, from now till then I'll dream I hear! O Christ, I
heard them then, the pistol shots! Why did we not go,
Lewis, days ago?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now you are weeping,&quot; said Rand, &quot;and that will ease
your heart. Could I have helped it, I would not have told you
of this quarrel. You could not, however, have failed to hear;
it was a public thing, and the town is buzzing with it. See,
Jacqueline, I am no longer passionate. The dog is down.
The mistake, if mistake it was, is made; we are not over the
mountains; we are here in Albemarle, at Roselands, underneath
the beech tree. I was never one to weep for spilt milk.
This way is stopped, and this moment foreclosed. Well, there
are other moments and other ways! The sun is down and the
night falls dark and cold. Come, dry your eyes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is soon done. The thorn is in my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will draw it out,&quot; he answered. &quot;I'll draw it out with
love. Don't think that Ludwell Cary can hurt me; it's not
within his kingdom. Do not grieve that men are enemies;
smile and say, 'It will be so a few years longer!' I am glad
with all my heart that you are friends again with all at Fontenoy.
As for this journey, I stayed for you, Jacqueline. It
was needful for me to go, but I stayed that you might part
friends with your kindred. Remember it one day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; she cried,&mdash;&quot;why did you not go without me?
You would not have been long gone, and I should have
waited your return there at Fontenoy! Then this day and this
quarrel would not have come! Ludwell Cary and you to
meet&mdash;O God!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not wish to go without you. You do not understand&mdash;but
trust me, Jacqueline; trust me, trust me!&quot; He took
her in his arms. &quot;Come, now! It is twilight, and there's a
dreariness in these fallen leaves. Come indoors to the fire and
the light, and the books and the harp. Deb arrived to-day,
did she not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; she is somewhere with Miranda. They have been
playing dolls with the last flowers.&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped a moment as they were moving over the grassy
ring. &quot;Flower dolls! They were playing flower dolls that
morning in June when I came down from the blue room and
out into the garden. There they sat, on the red earth in the
little cedar wood, with their bright ladies. Deb told me all
their names. She told me more than that&mdash;she told me you
were reading in the arbour. Jacqueline, are you sorry that
I found you there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I am not sorry; I am glad. You could make me
wretched, but you could not make me repentant. Oh,
Lewis! I shall hear those shots to-night&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you will not&mdash;I shall read you to sleep. Why, if
you were a soldier's wife, would you hear all the bullets flying?
There, the last red has faded, and I hear the children's
voices! Come in; come in out of the dark.&quot;</p>

<h3>THE DUEL</h3>


<p>It was nine o'clock of a November morning when a coach,
driven out from Richmond, passed a country tavern and
a blacksmith's shop, and, turning from the main road,
went jolting through a stubble-field down to the steep and
grassy bank of the James. It was a morning fine and clear,
with the hoar frost yet upon the ground. The trees, of which
there were many, were bare, saving the oaks, which yet held
a rusty crimson. In the fields the crows were cawing, and
beyond the network of branch and bough the river flashed
and murmured among its multitude of islets. The place
was solitary, screened from the highroad by a rise of land,
and fitted for a lovers' meeting or for other concerns of
secrecy.</p>

<p>The coach drew up beneath a spreading oak with the mistletoe
clustering in the dull red upper branches. Three men
stepped out,&mdash;Lewis Rand, the gentleman acting as his
second, and a good physician. &quot;We are first on the field,&quot;
said Rand, looking at his watch. &quot;It is early yet. Pompey,
drive a hundred yards down the bank&mdash;as far as those
bushes yonder&mdash;and wait until you are called. Ha! there
could be no better spot, Mr. Jones!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've seen no better in my experience, sir,&quot; answered
Skelton Jones. &quot;When I was last out, we had the worst of
fare!&mdash;starveling locust wood&mdash;damned poor makeshift at
gentlemanly privacy&mdash;stuck between a schoolhouse and a
church! But this is good; this is nonpareil! Fine, brisk,
frosty weather, too! I hate to fight on a muggy, leaden, dispirited
day, weeping like a widow! It's as crisp as mint, this
morning&mdash;hey, Doctor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I find,&quot; said the doctor, in a preoccupied tone, &quot;that I've
left my best probe at home. However, no matter&mdash;I've one
I can use.</p>

<p>&quot;I hear wheels,&quot; remarked Rand. &quot;He is on the hour.&quot;</p>

<p>A chaise mounted the knoll of furrowed land and came
down to the grassy level and the waiting figures. It stopped,
and Ludwell Cary and his brother got out. &quot;Drive over there
where the coach is standing,&quot; directed the latter, and chaise
and negro driver rolled away. The elder Cary walked forward,
paused within a few feet of his antagonist, and the two
bowed ceremoniously.</p>

<p>&quot;I trust that I have not kept you waiting, Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the least, Mr. Cary. The hour has but struck.&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary strode up, and the salutations became general.
Skelton Jones looked briskly at his watch. &quot;With your leave,
gentlemen, we'll to formalities. The Washington stage has
just gone by, and we will all wish to get back for the mail.
Mr. Fairfax Cary, shall we walk a little to one side? You
have, I see, the case of pistols. Dr. McClurg, if you will
kindly station yourself beneath yonder oak&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The seconds stepped aside for their conference, and the
doctor retreated to the indicated oak. Lewis Rand and Ludwell
Cary exchanged a comment or two upon the weather,
then fell silent. The one presently sat down upon the root of
a tree, and, drawing out a pocket-book, began to look over
certain memoranda; the other walked near the river and stood
gazing across its falls and eddies and innumerable fairy
islands to the misty blue of the farther woods. The seconds
returned and proceeded to measure the distance&mdash;ten paces,
after which they loaded the pistols. Skelton Jones advanced,
the ends of two strips of paper showing from his closed hand.
&quot;Gentlemen, you will draw for choice of position. The longest
strip carries the advantage. Thank you. Mr. Cary,
Fortune favours you! We are ready now, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>The two laid aside their riding-coats. Cary walked across
the leaf-strewn lists and, turning, stood with his back to the
sun. Rand took the opposite place. The seconds presented
the loaded pistols. As Cary took his from his brother, their
hands touched&mdash;that of the younger was marble cold. Skelton
Jones crossed to his principal's right, and Fairfax Cary
moved also to his proper place. There was a minute's pause
while the sun shone and the leaves drifted down, then, &quot;Are
you ready, gentlemen?&quot; cried Rand's second.</p>

<p>The principals answered in the affirmative. Fairfax Cary
gave the word, &quot;<i>Present!</i>&quot; The two raised their weapons,
and Skelton Jones began to count &quot;One&mdash;two&mdash;three!
Fire!&quot; Rand fired. Cary swayed slightly, recovered himself,
and stood firm. Fairfax Cary took the count. &quot;One&mdash;two&mdash;three!
Fire!&quot; The elder Cary slowly turned the muzzle
of his pistol from his waiting antagonist, and fired into the air.</p>

<p>The report echoed from the winding river-banks. For an
appreciable moment, until it died away, the participants in
the meeting stood motionless, then the seconds bestirred
themselves and ran forward.</p>

<p>&quot;But a single shot, each, gentlemen&mdash;that was agreed
upon!&quot; cried the one, and the other, &quot;Ludwell, you are
wounded! Where is it? Dr. McClurg! Dr. McClurg!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is nothing, Fair,&mdash;through the shoulder.&quot; Cary
waved him aside and turned a face, pale but composed, upon
Lewis Rand, who now stood before him. Rand's hue was dark
red, his features working. &quot;Why,&quot; he demanded hoarsely,&mdash;&quot;why
did you not fire upon me?&quot; The agitation, marked
as it was, ceased or was controlled even as he spoke. The
colour faded, the brow lost its corrugations, and the voice its
thickness. Before his antagonist could reply, he spoke again.
&quot;It was yours, of course, to do what you pleased with. I
sincerely trust that your wound is not deep. I have regretted
the necessity&mdash;I profess myself entirely satisfied.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is well,&quot; answered Cary, &quot;and I thank you, Mr.
Rand. The wound is utterly of no consequence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here is Dr. McClurg,&quot; said Rand. &quot;I will wait yonder
to hear that confirmed.&quot;</p>

<p>He walked to the river-bank and stood, as Cary had stood a
little earlier, gazing over the falls and eddies and fairy islands
to the blue woods on the farther shore. Under the oak which
he had left, the doctor looked and handled, with a pursed lip,
a keen eye, and a final &quot;Humph!&quot; of relief. &quot;High and clean
through and just a little splintered. You'll wear your arm
in a sling for a while, Mr. Cary! Mr. Fairfax Cary, you're
too white by half! There's a brandy flask in yonder case.
Mr. Jones, the wound is slight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, that's good hearing!&quot; cried Skelton Jones. &quot;Mr.
Cary must return to town in the coach, with Mr. Fairfax Cary
and with you, Doctor. Mr. Rand and I will take the chaise.
My profound regard, and my compliments, Mr. Cary! Mr.
Fairfax Cary, may I have the pleasure of acting with you
again! Doctor, good-morning. Now, Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand turned from his contemplation of the river, advanced
toward the group beneath the oak, and bowed with formality
to Cary, who, arresting the doctor's ministrations, returned
the salute in kind. The chaise, beckoned to by Mr. Jones,
came up; there was a slight and final exchange of courtesies,
and the two Republicans entered the vehicle and were driven
away.</p>

<p>&quot;Give them five minutes' start, Fair,&quot; ordered Cary.
&quot;Then call the coach; I want to get back to town for the
Washington mail.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll get back to town and get to bed!&quot; stormed the
other. &quot;'Fire in the air,' quotha! <i>I</i> could have brought down
a kite from the blue! You might, at least, have broken a
wing for him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I might, I might,&quot; said the other wearily. &quot;But I
didn't. I never liked this work of breaking wings. Now,
Doctor, that is a bandage fit for a king! Call the coach, Fair.
This much of the business is over.&quot;</p>

<p>The chaise carrying Lewis Rand and his companion traversed
with rapidity the miles to Richmond. The road was
fair, and the day bright and cool. The meeting by the river
had occupied hardly an hour; the world of the country was
yet at its morning stirring, and filled with cheerful sound.
Above the fields the sky showed steel blue; the creepers upon
the rail-fencing still displayed, here and there, five crimson
fingers, and wayside cedars patched with shadow the pale
ribbon of the road. Rand kept silence, and his late second,
at first inclined to talkativeness, soon fell under the infection
and stared blankly at the fence corners. A notorious duellist,
he may have been busy with dramas of the past. Rand's
thought was for the future.</p>

<p>They came into Main Street and drove to Rand's office.
&quot;We'll dismiss the chaise here,&quot; said the latter. &quot;I have a
few directions to give, and then I'm for the post-office and
the Eagle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will precede you there,&quot; answered the other. &quot;Allow
me, sir, before we part, to express the gratification I have
felt in serving, to the best of my poor abilities, a gentleman
of whom the party expects so much&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather allow me, sir, to express my gratitude&mdash;&quot; and so
on through the stilted compliment of the day. Assurances
from both sides over at last, and the chaise discharged, the
one walked briskly down the unpaved street toward the Eagle,
and the other entered quietly the bare and business-like room
from whose window, last February, he had fed the snowbirds.
The room was not vacant. Before the table, with his
arms upon it, and his head upon his arms, sat Mocket. At
the sound of the closing door he started up, stared at Rand,
then fell back with a gasp of relief, and the water in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis? Thank the Lord!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Lewis,&quot; said the other. &quot;My good old fellow, did
you think only to see my ghost? Well, the comedy is over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lord! it's been a long hour!&quot; breathed his associate.
&quot;What did you do to him, Lewis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has a ball through his shoulder. It is not serious.
I don't want to talk about it, Tom.&quot; Rand spoke abruptly,
and, walking to his desk, sat down, drew a piece of
paper toward him, and dipped a quill into the ink-well. &quot;Is
Young Isham there? He is to take this note to the house,
to Mrs. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket went to find Young Isham. Rand, alone in the
room, wrote in his strong, plain hand:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>JACQUELINE:&mdash;We met an hour ago. He is slightly
wounded&mdash;through the shoulder. I tell you truth, it is in
no wise dangerous. I am unhurt.</p></div>

<p>The hand travelling across the sheet of paper paused, and
Rand sat for a moment motionless, looking straight before
him; then, with an indrawn breath, he dipped the quill again
into the ink and wrote on,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He fired into the air.<br />
<br />
Thine, Lewis.</p></div>

<p>He sanded the paper, folded and sealed it, sat for a moment
longer, leaning back in his heavy chair, then rose and himself
gave the missive to Young Isham, with orders to make no
tarrying between the office and the house on Shockoe Hill.
Rand's slaves had for him a dog-like affection combined with
a dog-like fear of his eye in anger. The boy went at once, and
the master returned to the waiting Tom. &quot;The Washington
stage is in,&quot; he said. &quot;I am going now to the Eagle, and
you had best come with me. Then back here, and to work!
Where is that man from the Bienville at Norfolk?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's waiting at the Indian Queen. I can get him here
in ten minutes. This morning's Argus says that the Bienville
of New Orleans sails on Saturday&mdash;valuable cargo and
no passengers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Rand; &quot;the Argus's eyes are heavy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A half-breed hunter was here this morning. He says that,
ten days ago, crossing the Endless Mountains with his face
to the east, he met the great hunter they call Golden-Tongue
walking very fast, with his face to the west. Learning that
he was on his way to Richmond, Golden-Tongue gave him
this to be delivered in silence to you.&quot; Mocket took from the
table a feather and held it out to the other.</p>

<p>&quot;A blackbird feather,&quot; exclaimed Rand, turning it over in
his hand. &quot;That would mean&mdash;that would mean&mdash;'It is
the fall of the leaf. The bird has flown south. Follow all
the migratory tribe! follow while the air is yet open to you, or
stay behind with the sick and the old and the faint of heart
and the fighters against instinct! Winter comes. It is time
to make haste.'&quot; He laid the feather down with a smile.
&quot;That's Adam. Well, Adam, we will see how swift the
Bienville can fly! I may yet be first at New Orleans.
Wilkinson and I to welcome Burr and all the motley in his
river-boats with a salvo from the city already ours. Ha!
that's a silvery dream, Tom, and an eagle's pinion for Adam's
blackbird quill!&quot; He laughed and took up his hat. &quot;Let's
down the street first, and then you may find the man from
the Bienville. There's a long day's work before us, and to-night&quot;&mdash;He
drew a quick breath. &quot;To-night I have a task
that is not slight. Come away! It's striking twelve.&quot;</p>

<p>The two closed the office and went out into the sunny
street. &quot;Where are all the people?&quot; exclaimed Mocket.
&quot;It's as still as Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p>A boy at a shop door, hearing the remark, raised a piping
voice. &quot;Everybody's down at the Eagle and the post-office,
sir. I heard them say there's big news. Maybe the President's
dead!&quot;</p>

<p>The distance to the Eagle was but short. Rand walked so
rapidly that his companion had difficulty to keep beside him,
and walked in silence, cutting short every attempt of Tom's
to speak. They came within sight of the tavern. The long
lower porch seemed crowded, the street in front filled with
people. There were horsemen, a coach and a chaise or two,
a rapid shifting of brown, green, blue, and plum-coloured
coats, a gleam here and there of a woman's dress. A bugle
sounded, and there issued from Governor Street first a roll
of drums and a shouted order, and then a company in blue
and white with tall, nodding plumes.</p>

<p>&quot;There are the Blues!&quot; cried Tom. &quot;My land! What is
the fuss about?&quot;</p>

<p>They were now upon the edge of the throng, which suddenly
fell from excited talking to a breathless attention. A
tall man of commanding presence and ringing voice had
mounted a chair, set at the top of the steps to the Eagle
porch, and unfolded a paper. Rand touched upon the
shoulder the man before him. &quot;Mr. Ritchie, I have just
come in from the country, and have heard nothing. What,
sir, is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Treason, sir!&quot; answered the editor of the Enquirer.
&quot;Treason. An attempt to disrupt the Republic! A blow in
the face of Washington and Henry and Franklin, of the sacred
dead and the patriot living! The lie direct to the Constitution!
Apollyon stretching himself, sir; but, by gad! Apollyon
foiled! Listen, and you will hear. Foushee's reading the
Proclamation for the second time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Rand, in a curious voice. &quot;A Proclamation.
From&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From the President. Evil hasn't prospered, and though
we can't hang Apollyon, we can hang Aaron Burr. Listen
now.&quot;</p>

<p>The reader's voice was sonorous, and his text came fully
to all the crowd in the Richmond street.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>&quot;Whereas information has been received that sundry persons,
citizens of the United States or resident within the same, are
conspiring and confederating together to begin and set on foot,
provide and prepare, the means of a military expedition or
enterprise against the Dominions of Spain, against which
nation war has not been declared by the constitutional authorities
of the United States; that for this purpose they are fitting
out and arming vessels in the western waters of the United
States, collecting provisions, arms, military stores, and other
means; are deceiving and seducing honest men and well-meaning
citizens under various pretences to engage in their criminal
enterprises; are organising, officering, and arming themselves
for the same, contrary to the laws in such cases made and provided,&mdash;I
have therefore thought it fit to issue this my proclamation,
warning and enjoining all faithful citizens who
have been led to participate in the said unlawful enterprise
without due knowledge or consideration to withdraw from the
same without delay, and commanding all persons whatsoever
engaged or concerned in the same to cease all farther proceedings
therein as they will answer the contrary at their peril, and will
incur prosecution with all the rigours of the law. And I hereby
enjoin and require all officers, civil or military, of the United
States, or of any of the States or Territories, and especially all
Governors, and other executive authorities, all judges, justices,
and other officers of the peace, all military officers of the militia,
to be vigilant, each within his respective department and
according to his functions, in searching out and bringing to
condign punishment all persons engaged or concerned in such
enterprise, and in seizing and detaining, subject to the disposition
of the law, all vessels, arms, military stores, or other means
provided or providing for the same, and in general preventing
the carrying on such expedition or enterprise by all the lawful
means within their power. And I require all good and faithful
citizens and others within the United States to be aiding and
assisting herein, and especially in the discovery, apprehension,
and bringing to justice of all such offenders, and the giving
information against them to the proper authorities.</i></p>

<p><i>&quot;In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United
States to be affixed to these presents, and have signed the same
with my hand. Given at the City of Washington on the twenty-seventh
day of November, 1806, and of the sovereignty and
Independence of the United States the thirty-first.</i></p>

<p>&quot;<i>THOMAS JEFFERSON.&quot;</i></p></div>

<p>&quot;That isn't all,&quot; said Mr. Ritchie in Rand's ear. &quot;The
plot was not only against Spain&mdash;it looked to the separation
of the West from the East, with the Alleghanies for the wall
between. General Wilkinson is the hero. It seems that Burr
thought to implicate him and secure the army. Wilkinson sent
Burr's letters in cipher to the President. The Government
has had knowledge from various sources, and while he was
thought to be dozing last summer, Mr. Jefferson was as wide
awake as you or I. The militia are out in Wood County, and
Burr will be taken somewhere upon the Ohio. Wilkinson has
put New Orleans under martial law. Informer or no, he's
now more loyal than loyalty itself. The Bienville is to be
searched at Norfolk for a consignment of arms. They say
Eaton's implicated, and Alston, Bollman, Swartwout, and
this man Blennerhassett. Truxtun's name is mentioned, and
it's said that Decatur was applied to. Andrew Jackson, too,
has been friendly with Burr. Well, we'll see what we will see!
Treason and traitor are ugly words, Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are so considered, Mr. Ritchie,&quot; said Rand, with
calmness. &quot;Thanks for your courtesy, and good-morning!&quot;</p>

<p>He bowed and made his way, not unaccosted, through the
crowd to the Eagle porch. There was much excitement. The
Governor was speaking from the head of the steps. Below
him planters, merchants, lawyers, and politicians were now
listening eagerly, now commenting sotto voce, while beyond
them the nondescript population swayed and exclaimed. To
one side were massed the tall plumes of the Blues. Rand saw,
near these, Fairfax Cary's handsome face, not pale as it had
been between nine and ten o'clock, but alert, flushed, and&mdash;or
so Rand interpreted its light and energy&mdash;triumphant.
He went on into the house, ordered and drank a small quantity
of brandy, and when he came back upon the porch was
met by those near him with a cry of &quot;Speech! Speech!&quot;
The Governor's periods were at an end, and John Randolph
of Roanoke held the impromptu tribune. Rand's eloquence,
if not as impassioned and mordant, was as overwhelming,
and his reasoning of a closer texture. Those around him
loudly claimed him for the next to address the crowd, which
now numbered a great part of the free men of Richmond.
He shook off the detaining hands and, with a gesture of refusal
to one and all, made his escape by a side step into the
miscellany of the street, and finally out of the throng, and,
by a d&eacute;tour, back to the deserted square where stood his
office. He had lost sight of Mocket, but as he put his key into
the door, the other came panting up, and the two entered
the bare, sunshine-flooded room together. Rand locked the
door and, without a look at his trembling subaltern, proceeded
to take from his desk paper after paper, some in
neatly tied packets, some in single sheets, until a crisp white
heap lay on the wood beneath his hand. &quot;Light a fire,&quot; he
said over his shoulder. &quot;There's absolutely nothing, is there,
in that desk of yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. For the Lord's sake, Lewis, is this the end of
everything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everything is a large word. It is the end of this.&quot; He
pushed a table closer to the fireplace and transferred to it
his armful of papers. &quot;Strike a light, will you? Here goes
every line that can incriminate. If Burr did as he was told,
and burned two letters of mine, there'll not be a word when
I finish here.&quot; He tore a paper across and tossed it into the
flame. &quot;Tom, Tom, don't look so woe-begone! Life is long,
and now and then a battle will be lost. A battle&mdash;a campaign,
a war! But given the fighter, all wars will not be lost.
Somewhere, there awaits Victory, hard-won, but laurel-crowned!&quot;
He tore and burned another paper. &quot;This fat's
in the fire, this chance has gone by, this road's barricaded,
and we must across country to another! Well, I shall make
it serve, the smooth, green, country road that jog-trots to
market! What is man but a Mercenary, a Swiss, to die before
whatever door will give him moderate pay? I would have had
a kingdom an I could. I would have ruled, ay, by God, and
ruled well! The great wheel will not have it so. Down, then,
that action! and up this. The King is dead: long live the
King!&mdash;alias the Law, Respectability, Virginia, and the
Union!&quot; He tossed in a double handful.</p>

<p>&quot;All those!&quot; said Tom dully. &quot;I hate to see them burn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They might have burned this morning,&quot; answered the
other. &quot;I gave you orders to burn them if I fell, the moment
you heard it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you did not fall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. He fired into the air.&quot; Rand tore the paper in his
hand across and across. &quot;He had me in his trap. That was
why&mdash;that was why he spared to fire! Oh, I could take this
check from the hand of Fortune, or the hand of Malice, or
the hand of Treachery, or the hand of Policy, but, but&quot;&mdash;he
crushed the torn paper in his hands, then flung it from him
with a violent and sinister gesture&mdash;&quot;to take it from the
hand of Ludwell Cary&mdash;that requires more than my philosophy
is prepared to give! Let him look to himself!&quot; He
thrust in another bundle, and held down with an ashen stick
the mass of curling leaves.</p>

<h3>OLD SAINT JOHN'S</h3>


<p>The distance was so great from the more populous
part of the town to Saint John's on Church Hill,
and the road thereto so steep, in hot weather
dusty, in wet deep in mud, that it had become the Richmond
custom to worship within the Capitol, in the Hall of
the House of Delegates. But during this August of the year
1807 the habit was foregone. It was the month in which
Aaron Burr, arrested in Alabama in January, brought to
Richmond in the early spring, and, since the finding of a
true bill, confined in the penitentiary without the town, was
to be tried for his life on the charge of high treason. Early
and late, during the week, every apartment of the Capitol
was in requisition, and though the building itself was closed
on Sunday, the Capitol Square remained, a place of rendezvous,
noise, heat, confusion, and dispute. There was in
the town a multitude of strangers, with a range from legal,
political, military, and naval heights, through a rolling
country of frontiersmen, to a level of Ohio boatmen, servants,
and nondescript. Many were witnesses subpoenaed
by the Government, others had been called by Burr, and
yet others brought upon the scene by varied interests, or
by the sheer, compelling curiosity which the trial evoked.
One and all were loudly and fiercely partisan. The lesser
sort and ruder fry congregated in numbers beneath the
trees about the Capitol, and it was thought with propriety
that during this month church-going ladies would prefer to
attend Saint John's. Here, therefore, on a Sunday in mid-August,
the Reverend John Buchanan preached to a large
and noteworthy assemblage.</p>

<p>The day was hot, but the chestnut trees and sycamores
gave a grateful shade, and large white clouds in a brilliant
blue threw now and then a transient screen between sun and
earth. The broad and murmuring river and the far stretch
of woodland upon the Chesterfield side gave, too, a sensation
of space and coolness. Faint airs carried the smell of midsummer
flowers, and bees droned around the flat tombstones
sunk in honeysuckle. The congregation gathered slowly, the
masculine portion of it lingering, as was the custom, in the
wide old churchyard until the second tinkling of the bell
should call them indoors. They had thus the double advantage
of talk and observation of the Progress of Women. These
traversed the path to the church door like a drift of blossoms
in the summer air, saluted on either hand by the lowest of
bows, the most gallant lifting of bell-shaped hats. Whatever
might be said of the men's dress, from the fair top-boot to the
yards of lawn that swathed the throat, that of the weaker sex,
in the days of the Empire, was admirably fitted for August
weather. Above pale, thin stuffs, girdled beneath the breast
and falling straight and narrow to the instep, rose bare white
neck and arms, while each charming face looked forth from
an umbrageous bonnet of fine straw. Bonnet and large fan
appeared the only ample articles of attire; even the gloves
were but mitts. By ones and twos, or in larger knots, the wearers
of this slender finery entered Saint John's with sedateness,
took their seats in the dim old pews, and waited in the
warm, fragrant, whisper-filled air for the ringing of the second
bell and the entrance of the men. After church, custom
would still reign, and all alike would linger, laugh, and talk
beneath the trees, while the coaches drew up slowly and
the grooms brought the saddle-horses from the rack, and
those who meant to walk gathered courage for the dusty
venture.</p>

<p>Jacqueline Rand and Unity Dandridge, the one in her
customary white, the other in a blue that marvellously set
off dark hair, dark eyes, and brilliant bloom, entered Saint
John's together and passed up the aisle to a seat halfway
between door and pulpit. By some miscalculation of Unity's
they were very early, a fact which presently brought a whispered
ejaculation of annoyance from Miss Dandridge. &quot;I
love a flutter when I come in and the knowledge that I've
turned every head&mdash;and here we've entered an empty
church! Heigho! Nothing to do for half an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Read your prayer book,&quot; suggested Jacqueline. &quot;Oh!
does it open just there as easily as all that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It always did open just there,&quot; answered Miss Dandridge.
&quot;It's something in the binding. Heigho! 'Love, honour, and
obey.' Obey!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your entrance,&quot; said her cousin, &quot;was not entirely unseen,
and here comes one whose head is certainly turned.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; asked Unity, and hastily closed the prayer
book as Fairfax Cary entered the pew behind them.</p>

<p>Jacqueline turned and greeted the young man with a
smile. There was now between Greenwood and Roselands,
between the house on Shockoe Hill and the quarters of the
Carys at the Swan, a profound breach, an almost utter division.
Lewis Rand and Ludwell Cary were private as well
as political enemies, and all men knew as much. There had
been no attempt on the part of either to conceal the fact of
the duel in November. Their world of town and country
surmised and conjectured, volubly or silently, according to
company, drew its conclusions, and chose its colours. The
conclusions were largely false, for it occurred to no one&mdash;at
least outside of Fontenoy&mdash;to connect the quarrel and the
duel with the President's proclamation and the Burr conspiracy.
During the past winter Cary had been much in
Albemarle, little in Richmond, and the encounters of the two
had not been frequent. In the spring, however, matters
had brought him to the city, and in the fever and excitement
of the ensuing summer he and Rand were often thrown into
company. When this was the case, they spoke with a bare
and cold civility, and left each other's neighbourhood as
soon as circumstances permitted. Cary came, of course, no
more to the house on Shockoe Hill. Jacqueline, remaining
in town through the summer because her husband remained,
saw him now and again in some public place or gathering.
He bowed low and she inclined her head, but they did not
speak. Her heart was hot and pained. She had pleaded that
afternoon in the cedar wood for his better understanding of
Lewis, and to what purpose?&mdash;an open quarrel and a duel!
She did not want to speak; she wanted to forget him.</p>

<p>But for Fairfax Cary, friend and shadow though he was of
the elder brother, her feeling was different. He was a man to
be liked for himself, and he loved and was to marry Unity.
He adopted his brother's quarrel: he and Lewis barely spoke,
and that despite the fact that Lewis had for him a strange
half-grim, half-vexed admiration; he came no more than the
elder Cary to the house on Shockoe; but when they met
abroad, Jacqueline was sure of some greeting, half gay, half
stiff, some talk of Fontenoy, some exchange of sentiment
upon one topic dear to each, some chivalrous compliment to
herself. He made a gallant and devoted lover, and Jacqueline
could not but applaud Unity's choice and feel for him an
almost unmixed kindness.</p>

<p>Because of the trial, which drew friends, kindred, and acquaintances
to Richmond, the marriage, which was to have
been celebrated in August, had been postponed to September.
Unity came to town for a month and stayed with her cousin.
Her lover would not enter Lewis Rand's house, nor did she
ask him to do so. Her kindred in Richmond were numerous,
and they might and did meet in a score of Federalist mansions,
at various places of entertainment, and, as now, at
church.</p>

<p>He answered Jacqueline's welcome and Miss Dandridge's
bright blush and brief &quot;How d'ye do?&quot; with the not-too-profound
bow, the subdued and deprecatory smile, and the
comparative absence of compliment that church demanded,
then, seating himself, leaned forward with his arm upon
the back of their pew and entered into low-toned conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;They were early.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Yes: too early!&quot;&mdash;&quot;So much
the better, for now they could see all the famous folk enter.
Army, Navy, Law, and Letters are all coming to church.
To-morrow is the indictment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; murmured Jacqueline; and Unity, &quot;They say he
held a levee at the Penitentiary yesterday. Personally, I prefer
a surly traitor to one who is so affable, smiling, and witty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also,&quot; agreed her lover. &quot;But Colonel Burr is no Grand
Seigneur of a traitor out of the dismal romances that you
read! He meant no harm&mdash;not he! His ideas of <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i> may be vague, but when all's said, he's the most courteous
gentleman and a boon companion! I think that we are
well-nigh the only Federalists in town who have not forgotten
that this man slew Hamilton, and who keep the fact in mind
that, defend him as they please, his counsel cannot say, He
loved his country and wished no other empire!' After the
indictment to-morrow, Hay will speak and the Government
begin to call its witnesses. Who is this coming in&mdash;the lady
with Mrs. Carrington? Look! It's Burr's daughter&mdash;it's
Mrs. Alston!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's a brave woman,&quot; said Unity. &quot;One can't but honour
such spirit, courage, and loyalty. She's dressed as if it
were a gala day!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you'll let me pass,&quot; whispered Jacqueline, &quot;I will
speak to her. We met at the Amblers' the other night.
There's an anxious heart behind that fine fire!&quot;</p>

<p>She rose and, slipping past Unity, moved up the aisle to
the Carrington pew. The two left behind looked after the
gliding white figure in silence. Unity sighed. &quot;To me Lewis
Rand's like a giant, and she's like his captive. And yet&mdash;and
yet there's much that's likeable in the giant, and I can
perfectly well see how the captive might adore him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't,&quot; retorted the other. &quot;I'll grant his ability, but
there's a little worm at the heart! Even his genius will one
day turn against him; it is the tree too tall that falls the
soonest. He's not coming here to-day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. He's out of town. All the Republican papers are
wondering why the President did not include him among the
counsel for the Government.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dare say,&quot; said the younger Cary grimly. &quot;Well, that
would have been an entertainment worth hearing, that
speech for the prosecution!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't let's talk of him any more. I feel a traitor to
Jacqueline when I do. How slow the people are in coming!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They may stay away as long as they please,&quot; murmured
her lover. &quot;I like a quiet time for worship before all the fuss
and flutter. You should always wear blue, Unity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You told me yesterday that I should always wear pink.
At last, here enters a man!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is Winfield Scott, just up from Williamsburgh. He
doesn't like the law and will go into the army. Here are all
the Randolphs and the beautiful Mrs. Peyton!&quot;</p>

<p>Unity moved to let Jacqueline re&euml;nter the pew. The
church was beginning to fill, and the whispering and noise
of fluttering fans increased. All the windows were open to
the breeze, and the soft scents and sounds and colours, the
dimness within the church, and the August skies and waving
trees without, combined to give a drowsy, mellow, and
enchanted air to old Saint John's and to the gathering
people.</p>

<p>&quot;The choir have come into the gallery,&quot; said Fairfax
Cary. &quot;I hear the scrape of Fitzwhyllson's viol.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The quiet is over and here comes the world,&quot; answered
Jacqueline. &quot;Who is that with Mr. Wickham&mdash;the tall,
lean man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is the Governor of Tennessee and a fire-eater for
Burr&mdash;Andrew Jackson by name. The third man is Luther
Martin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He may be learned in the law,&quot; murmured Unity, &quot;but
I would like to know the University that taught him dress.
See, Jacqueline, Charlotte Foushee has the newest bonnet
yet!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is Commodore Truxtun coming in with Edmund
Randolph. He looks a seaman, every inch of him! Who is
the young gentleman in blue?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that,&quot; replied Unity, &quot;is Mr. Washington Irving of
New York. He has just returned from the Grand Tour, and
he writes most beautifully. He has sent me an acrostic for
my keepsake that&mdash;that&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That I could not have written had I tried till doomsday,&quot;
finished Fairfax Cary. &quot;Do you like acrostics, Mrs.
Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline smiled. &quot;No, nor keepsakes either. Unity and
I both like strong prose and books with meanings. Her
<i>fa&ccedil;ons de parler</i> are many.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, anyhow,&quot; said Miss Dandridge, &quot;I like Mr. Washington
Irving. He doesn't only write acrostics; he writes
prose as well. Here is the Chief Justice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The second bell is ringing. We'll have all the churchyard
now. Here comes the Tenth Legion&mdash;Hay, Wirt, and
McRae! Mark Wirt bow to Martin!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will General Wilkinson be here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speak of&mdash;one that's often named in church&mdash;and see
the waving of his red cockfeather! This is the General now.
Ahem! he looks what he is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the other with the sash?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eaton. They are both tarred with the same brush!
Here, coming toward us, is one of very different make! You
met him yesterday, did you not? Ha! Captain Decatur,
allow me to give you anchorage!&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he held open the pew door. Captain Stephen
Decatur smiled, bowed, and entered, and was presently
greeting with a manly, frank, and engaging manner the
beautiful Mrs. Rand and the equally lovely Miss Dandridge,
to both of whom he had been presented at an evening entertainment.
The church was now filled and the bell ceased
ringing. From the gallery came the deeper growl of the bass
viol and the preliminary breath of a flute. A moment more
and the minister walked up the aisle and, mounting the tall
old pulpit, invoked a blessing, then gave out in a fine mellow
voice with a strong Scotch accent:&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;The spacious firmament on high,<br />
With all the blue, ethereal sky<br />
And spangled heavens, a shining frame,<br />
Their great Original proclaim.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>The choir in the gallery, viol, flute, and voices, took up the
strain, and the congregation beneath following in their turn,
there arose and floated through the windows a veritable
p&aelig;an, so sweet and loud that the boatmen on the river heard.</p>

<p>On went the service until the sermon was reached, and on
went the sermon from &quot;firstly&quot; to &quot;eighteenthly and last,
my brethren.&quot; The sermon was upon Charity, and included
no allusion to the topic of the day uppermost in men's minds,
for this minister never evinced any party spirit, and thought
politics not his province. The discourse ended, the plate was
carried and the benediction given, whereupon, after a decorous
pause, the congregation streamed forth to the green and
warm churchyard.</p>

<p>Here it broke into groups, flowery bright on the part of the
women, gallant and gay enough on the side of the attending
gentlemen. The broad path was like the unfolding of a
figured ribbon, and the sward on either hand like sprinkled
taffeta. The sky between the large white clouds showed
bluer than blue, and the leaves of the sycamores trembled
in a small, refreshing breeze. The birds were silent, but the
insect world filled with its light voice the space between all
other sounds. Outside the gate coaches and horses waited.
There was no hurry; the ribbon unrolled but slowly, and the
blossomy knots upon the taffeta as leisurely shifted position.</p>

<p>Theodosia Alston and Jacqueline came out of church
together, in a cluster of Carringtons and Amblers. Besides
her affianced, Unity had for company Captain Decatur, Mr.
Irving, and Mr. Scott. The throng, pressing between, separated
the cousins. Aaron Burr's daughter, though she talked
and laughed with spirit and vivacity, was so evidently anxious
to be away that the friend with whom she had come made
haste down the path to their waiting coach. Jacqueline,
meaning to tarry but a moment beside the woman for whom
all, of whatever party, had only admiration and sympathy,
found herself drawn along the path to the gate. The Carrington
coach rolled away, and she was left almost alone in
the sunny lower end of the churchyard.</p>

<p>The ribbon was unrolling toward her, and she waited, glad
of the moment's quiet. She saw Unity's forget-me-not blue,
and Charlotte Foushee's bonnet, piquant and immense, and
Mrs. Randolph's lilac lutestring, and all the blue and green
and wine-coloured coats of the men moving toward her as in
a summer dream, gay midges in a giant shaft of sunlight.
A great bee droned past her to the honeysuckle upon the
wall against which she leaned. She watched the furred creature,
barred and golden, and thought suddenly of the bees
about the mimosa on the Three-Notched Road.</p>

<p>A middle-aged gentleman, of a responsible and benevolent
cast of countenance, came up to her. &quot;A very good day to
you, my dear Mrs. Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to you, Colonel Nicholas.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are of my mind. You do not care to dilly-dally after
church. 'Tis as bad as a London rout, where you move an
inch an hour. Well, there are men here to-day who have
made some stir in the world! Do you go to-morrow to the
Capitol?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. My cousin and I have seats with Mrs. Wickham.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will not be such a trial as was Warren Hastings's.
Yet it will have its value both to the eye and the ear. If it
were possible, I would have there every young boy in town.
Is Mr. Rand at home?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. He is in Williamsburgh for several days.&quot;</p>

<p>The gentleman hesitated. &quot;Vexatious! I have something
for his own hand, and I myself go out of town after to-morrow.
It may be important&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cannot I give it to him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a small packet, or letter, from the President. He
sent it to me by a private messenger, with a note asking me to
do him the friendly service to place it directly in Mr. Rand's
hand. I have it with me, as I thought I might meet Mr.
Rand here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will hardly return before Wednesday. When he comes,
I will give him the letter with pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>The other took from his pocket a thick letter, strongly
sealed, and addressed in Jefferson's fine, precise hand. &quot;I
must be away from Richmond for a week or more, and the
matter may be important. I can conceive no reason why, so
that it be put directly into Mr. Rand's hand, one agent should
be better than another. I'll confide it to you, Mrs. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will do as the President directs, Colonel Nicholas, and
will give it to my husband the moment he returns.&quot;</p>

<p>She put out her hand, and he laid the packet in it. Hanging
from her arm by a rose-coloured ribbon was a small bag of old
brocade. This she opened, and slipped into the silken depths
the President's somewhat heavy missive. &quot;He shall have it
on Wednesday,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The dispersing congregation touched and claimed them.
Mr. Wirt and Commodore Truxtun bore off her companion,
and she herself, after a moment of gay talk with all the Randolphs,
rejoined Unity and her court. Fairfax Cary called
their coach, and Captain Decatur and Mr. Irving and Mr.
Scott saw them in, and still talked at the lowered windows
until Big Isham on the box, with a loud crack of his whip,
put the greys in motion.</p>

<p>The coach went slowly down the hill. Unity yawned and
waved her fan. &quot;I like Captain Decatur. Think of sailing
into a tropic harbour and destroying the Philadelphia on
a day like this! Lend me your fan; it is larger than mine.
What have you in your bag?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My prayer book, and something that Colonel Nicholas
gave me for Lewis. I could think only of Theodosia Alston,
and of how long to-night will be to her!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She believes that he will be acquitted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She does not know, and pictures of what we fear are
dreadful! Knowledge is like death sometimes, but not to
know is like frightened dying! Oh, warm, warm! I shall be
glad when it is all over and we leave Richmond for the
mountains and the streams again, and for your wedding,
dearest heart!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my wedding!&quot; said Unity. &quot;My wedding's like a
dream. I don't believe I'm going to have any wedding!&quot;</p>

<h3>THE TRIAL OF AARON BURR</h3>


<p>At an early hour the crowd in the Hall of the House
of Delegates was very great, and as it drew toward
the time when the principals in the drama would appear,
the press of the people and the heat of the August day
grew well-nigh intolerable. In the gallery were many women,
and their diaphanous gowns and the incessant flutter of their
fans imparted to this portion of the Hall a pale illusion of
comfort. In the hall below, men stood upon the window-sills,
choked the entrances, crowded the corridors without. Not
only was there a throng where something might be heard
and seen, but the portico of the Capitol had its numbers,
and the green surrounding slopes a concourse avid of what
news the birds might bring. Within and without, the heat
was extreme, even for August in Tidewater Virginia; an atmosphere
sultry and boding, tense with the feeling of an
approaching storm.</p>

<p>In the gallery, beside Unity and Mrs. Wickham, around
her women of Federalist families who were loath to believe
any one guilty who was prosecuted, or persecuted, by the
present Government, and women of Republican houses who
asserted, while they waved their fans, that, being guilty,
Aaron Burr must be, should be, would be hanged! sat
Jacqueline Rand, and wondered somewhat at her weakness
in coming there that day. It had been, perhaps, in the last
analysis, a painful curiosity, a vague desire to see the place,
the men, all the circumstance and environment, with which
her husband&mdash;she thanked God with every breath&mdash;had
no connection! He might have had here his part, she knew
tremulously; it might have been his role to stand here beside
Aaron Burr, and, with a passionately humble and grateful
heart, she nursed the memory of that winter night when he
had sworn to her that from that hour he and this enterprise
should be strangers.</p>

<p>There had been days and weeks of preliminaries to the
actual trial for high treason, but she had not before been in
this hall. All her delicacy shrank from the thought of sitting
here beside her husband, conscious of his consciousness that
she knew all that might have been, and saw in fancy more
prisoners at the bar than one. No man would like that. He
had come often to the Capitol during the days of skirmishing
prior to the general engagement; had he not done so, it
would have been at once remarked. She expressed no desire
to accompany him, nor did he ever ask her to do so. She was
aware of the general surprise that he had no place among
the Government counsel. Whether or not such place had
been offered to him, pressed upon him, she did not know, but
she thought it possible that this was the case. If so, he had
refused as was right. Acceptance, she knew, would have
been impossible.</p>

<p>All through these months there had been between them a
silent pact, a covenant to avoid all superfluous mention of the
topic which met them on every hand, from every mouth, in
every letter or printed sheet. Rand was much occupied with
important cases, much in demand in various portions of the
state, much away from home. She was not a woman to
demand as her right entrance into every chamber of another's
soul. Her own had its hushed rooms, its reticences, its altars
built to solitude; she was aware that beyond, below, above
the fair chamber where he entertained her were other spaces
in her husband's nature. Into some she looked as through
open door and clear windows, but others were closed to her,
and she was both too proud and too pure of thought to
search for keys that had not been offered her.</p>

<p>She knew that her husband had not meant to be absent
from Richmond that day. An unexpected turn in the case he
was conducting had compelled his presence in Williamsburgh,
and on the other hand, in Richmond, the labour of finding
an impartial jury had been brought to a sudden end by
Burr's <i>coup de main</i> in refusing to challenge and calmly
accepting as prejudiced a twelve as perhaps, in the United
States of America, ever decided whether a man should live
or die. The move had hastened the day when the Government
was to begin its cannonade.</p>

<p>Lewis was yet in Williamsburgh. Had he been present in
this hail, watching events with his fellow lawyers, fellow
politicians, fellow countrymen, who knew nothing of one
snowy night a year ago last February, his wife, for both their
sakes, would have remained away. As it was, she had been
persuaded. Unity would not for much have missed the spectacle,
friends had been pressing, and at last her own painful
interest prevailed. She was here now, and she sat as in
a waking dream, her hands idle, her eyes, wide and dark,
steadily fixed upon the scene below. She saw, leaning against
a window, Ludwell Cary, and, the centre of a cluster of men
in hunting-shirts, Adam Gaudylock.</p>

<p>The Capitol clock struck twelve. As the last stroke died
upon the feverish air, the Chief Justice entered the Hall and
took the Speaker's chair. Beside him was Cyrus Griffin, the
District Judge. Hay, the District Attorney, with his associates
William Wirt and Alexander McRae, now appeared,
and immediately afterward the imposing array of the prisoner's
counsel, a phalanx which included no less than four
sometime Attorneys-General and two subalterns of note.
These took the seats reserved for them; the marshal and his
deputies pressed the people back, and the jury entered and
filled the jury box. Below and near them sat a medley of
witnesses&mdash;important folk, and folk whom only this trial
made important.</p>

<p>A loud murmur was now heard from without; the marshal's
men, red and perspiring, cleared a thread-like path, and the
prisoner, accompanied by his son-in-law, entered the Hall.
He was dressed in black, with carefully powdered hair.
Quiet, cool, smiling, and collected, he was brought to the bar,
when, having taken his place, bowed to the judges, and
greeted his counsel, he turned slightly and surveyed with his
composed face and his extremely keen black eyes the throng
that with intentness looked on him in turn. It was by no
means their first encounter of eyes. The preliminaries of that
famous trial had been many and prolonged. From the prisoner's
arrival in April under military escort to the present
moment, through the first arraignment at that bar, the
assembling of the Grand Jury, the tedious waiting for Wilkinson's
long-deferred arrival from New Orleans, the matter
of the subpoena to the President with which the country rang,
the adjournment from June to August, the victory gained by
the defence in the exclusion of Wilkinson's evidence, and the
clamour of the two camps into which the city was divided,&mdash;through
all this had been manifest the prisoner's deliberate
purpose and attempt to make every fibre of a personality
ingratiating beyond that of most, tell in its own behalf. He
had able advocates, but none more able than Aaron Burr.
His day and time was, on the whole, a time astonishingly
fluid and na&iuml;ve, and he impressed it.</p>

<p>There was in this moment, therefore, no novelty of encounter
between him and the stare of the opposing throng.
He was not seeing them, nor they him, for the first time. Yet
the situation had its high intensity. This day was the beginning
of the actual trial, and only the day which brought
the verdict could outweigh it in importance. This was the
lighting of the lamp that was to search out mysteries; this was
the bending of the bow; this was the first rung of the ladder
which might lead&mdash;where? As John Marshall's voice was
heard from the bench and the prisoner turned from his
steadfast contemplation of the throng, a psychic wave overflowed
and lifted all the great assembly. This was spectacle,
this was drama! The oldest of all the first principles stirred
under the stimulus, and with savage naturalness sucked in
the sense of pageant.</p>

<p>The court was opened. Counsel on both sides brought
forward and disposed of a minor point or two, then, amid a
silence so great that the twittering of the martins outside the
windows seemed importunate and shrill, proclamation was
made, the prisoner stood up, and the indictment was read.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>The grand inquest of the United States of America for the
Virginia District upon their oath do present that Aaron Burr,
late of the city of New York, and State of New York, attorney-at-law,
being an inhabitant of and residing within the United
States, and under the protection of the laws of the United States,
and owing allegiance and fidelity to the same United States, not
having the fear of God before his eyes, nor weighing the duty
of his said allegiance, but being moved and seduced by the
instigation of the Devil, wickedly devising and intending the
peace and tranquillity of the said United States to disturb, and
to stir, move, and excite insurrection, rebellion, and war against
the said United States, on the tenth day of December, in the
year of Christ one thousand, eight hundred and six, at a certain
place called and known by the name of Blennerhassett's Island,
in the county of Wood and District of Virginia aforesaid, and
within the jurisdiction of this court, with force and arms,
unlawfully, falsely, maliciously, and traitorously did compass,
imagine, and intend to raise and levy war, insurrection, and
rebellion against the said United States</i>&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>And so on through much thunderous repetition to the
final,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>And the said Aaron Burr with the said persons as aforesaid
traitorously assembled and armed and arranged in manner
aforesaid, most wickedly, maliciously, and traitorously did
ordain, prepare, and levy war against the said United States,
and further to fulfil and carry into effect the said traitorous
compassings, imaginings, and intentions of him the said
Aaron Burr, and to carry on the war thus levied as aforesaid
against the United States, the said Aaron Burr with the multitude
last mentioned, at the island aforesaid, in the said county
of Wood within the Virginia District aforesaid, and within the
jurisdiction of this court, did array themselves in a warlike
manner, with guns and other weapons, offensive and defensive,
and did proceed from the said island down the river Ohio in the
county aforesaid, within the Virginia District, and within the
jurisdiction of this court, on the said eleventh day of December,
in the year one thousand, eight hundred and six aforesaid, with
the wicked and traitorous intention to descend the said river
and the river Mississippi, and by force and arms traitorously
to take possession of the city commonly called New Orleans, in
the territory of Orleans, belonging to the United States, contrary
to the duty of their said allegiance and fidelity, against
the Constitution, peace, and dignity of the United States and
against the form of the Act of Congress of the United States in
such case made and provided</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>The clerk ceased to read. When the last sonorous word
had died upon the air, the audience yet sat or stood in silence,
bent a little forward, in the attitude of listeners. This lasted
an appreciable moment, then the tension snapped. Marshall
moved slightly in his great chair, Judge Griffin coughed, a
rustling sound and a deep breath ran through the Hall. The
prisoner, who had faced with the most perfect composure the
indictment's long thunder, now slightly inclined his head to
the Judges and took his seat. His counsel, ostentatiously
easy and smiling, gathered about him, and the District
Attorney rose to open for the Government in a lengthy and
able speech.</p>

<p>In the gallery, among the fluttering fans, Jacqueline asked
herself if her rising and quitting the place would disturb
those about her. She was in the very front, beside the gallery
rail, there was a great crowd behind, she must stay it out.
She bit her lip, forced back emotion, strove with resolution
to conquer the too visionary aspect of all things before her.
It had been foolish, she knew now, to come. She had not
dreamed with what strong and feverish grasp such a scene
could take prisoner the imagination. She saw too plainly
much that was not there; she brought other figures into the
Hall; abstractions and realities, they thronged the place. The
place itself widened until to her inner sense it was as wide as
her world and her life. Fontenoy was there and the house on
the Three-Notched Road; Roselands, and much besides. For
all the heat, and the fluttering of the fans, and the roll of
declamation from the District Attorney, who was now upon
the definition of treason, one night in February was there as
well, the night that had seen so much imperilled, the night
that had seen, thank God! the cloud go by. Of all the images
that thronged upon her, creating a strange tumult of the soul,
darkening her eyes and driving the faint colour from her
cheek, the image of that evening was the most insistent. It
was, perhaps, aided by her fancy that in that cool survey of
the Hall in which the prisoner indulged himself, his eyes,
keen and darting as a snake's, had rested for a moment upon
her face. She could have said that there was in them a curious
light of recognition, even a cool amusement, a sarcasm,&mdash;the
very memory of the look made for her a trouble vague,
but deep! Had he, too, given a thought to that evening, to
the man whom he did not secure, and to the woman with
whom he had talked of black lace and Spanish songs? She
wondered. But why should Colonel Burr be amused, and why
sarcastic? She abandoned the enquiry and listened to the
heavy lumbering up of Government cannon. &quot;Courts of
Great Britain&mdash;Foster's Crown Laws&mdash;Demaree and
Purchase&mdash;Vaughan&mdash;Lord George Gordon&mdash;Throgmorton&mdash;United
States <i>vs.</i> Fries&mdash;Opinion of Judge Chase&mdash;Of
Judge Iredell&mdash;Overt Act&mdash;Overt Act proven&mdash;Arms,
array and treasonable purpose; here is bellum levatum if
not bellum percussum-Treason and traitors, not potential
but actual&mdash;their discovery and their punishment&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>On boomed the guns of the prosecution. Jacqueline listened,
fascinated for a time, but the words at last grew to
hurt her so that, could she have done so unobserved, she
would have stopped her ears with her hands. The feverish
interest of the scene still held her in its grasp, but the words
were cruel and struck upon her heart. She could not free
herself from the brooding thought of how poignant, how
burning, how deadly poisonous they had been to her, had
all things been different and she forced to sit in this place
hearing them launched against another than Aaron Burr,
there, there at that bar! She unlocked her hands, drew a long
and tremulous breath, and, leaning a little forward, tried not
to listen, and to lose herself in watching the throng below.
Her eyes fell, at once, upon Ludwell Cary.</p>

<p>He was standing where she had before marked him, beside
a window almost opposite, his arm upon the sill, his attention
closely given to the District Attorney, who was now eulogising
that great patriot, General James Wilkinson. Now, while
Jacqueline looked, he turned his head. It was as though
she had called and he had been ready with his answer.</p>

<p>Painfully raised in feeling and driven out of habitual citadels,
tense and fevered, subtly touched by the storm in the
air, she found in the moment no sense of self-consciousness,
no question and no movement of aversion. She and Cary
looked at each other long and fully, and with something of an
old understanding; on her part a softening of pardon for the
quarrel and the duel, on his a light and compassion that she
could not clearly understand. She knew that he read her
thoughts, but if he, too, was remembering that evening long
ago in February, he must also remember that Lewis Rand
gave up, that snowy night, definitely and forever, the fevered
ambitions, the too-high imaginings, the conqueror's thirst
for power; gave them up, and turned from the charmer into
the path of right! There came into her heart a longing that
Ludwell Cary should see the matter truly. He should have
done so that afternoon in the cedar wood; where was the
black mote that kept the vision out? She was suddenly
aware&mdash;and it came to her with a dizzying strangeness&mdash;that
there was in her own soul that reference of matters to
the bar of Cary's idea, thought, and judgment which, that
day in the cedar wood, she had told him existed in that of her
husband. Were she and Lewis grown so much alike? or
had her own soul always recognised, deferred to, rested upon,
something in the inmost nature of the man into whose eyes
she looked across this thronged and fevered space&mdash;something
of rare equanimity, dispassionate yet tender, calm,
high, impartial, and ideal? She did not know; she had not
thought of it before. Her eyes dilated. Suddenly she saw the
drawing-room at Fontenoy, green and gold and cool, with
the portraits on the wall,&mdash;Edmund Churchill, who fought
with King Charles; Henry his son, who fled to Virginia and
founded the family there; a second Edmund, aide-de-camp
to Marlborough; two Governors of Virginia and a President
of the Council; the Lely and the Kneller&mdash;both Churchill
women; and the fair face and form of Grandaunt Jacqueline
for whom she was named. She smelled the roses in the bowls,
and she saw herself singing at her harp. It was a night in
June, the night of the great thunderstorm. Lewis Rand had
come down from the blue room, and Ludwell Cary entered
from the darkness of the storm.</p>

<p>
&quot;Stone walls do not a prison make,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor iron bars a cage</span><br />
Minds innocent and quiet take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That for a hermitage.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Unity's hand touched her. &quot;Jacqueline, are you tired?
Would you like to go away?&quot;</p>

<p>The spell broke. Jacqueline was most tired, and she
would very much have liked to go away, but a glance at her
cousin and at the lady with whom they had come determined
the question. That to both it was as good as a play, colour
and animation proclaimed, and Jacqueline had not the heart
to ring the curtain down. She shook her head and smiled.
&quot;We'll stay it out.&quot;</p>

<p>Her companion leaned back, relieved, and she was left to
herself again. She knew that Cary's eyes were still upon her,
but she would not turn her own that way. She made herself
look at the judges upon the bench, the District Attorney, the
opposing lawyers, even the prisoner. It was the heat and the
thunder in the air that made her so tense and yet so tremulous.
Every nerve to-day was like a harpstring tightly drawn
where every wandering air must touch it. All this would
soon be over&mdash;then home and quiet! The day was growing
old; even now Mr. Hay was addressing the jury with an impressiveness
that announced the closing periods of a speech.
When he was done, would not the court adjourn until to-morrow?
It was said the trial might last two weeks. Mr.
Hay sat down, but alas! before the applause and stir had
ceased, Mr. Wickham was upon his feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Wirt followed Mr. Wickham, and was followed in
turn by Luther Martin. The firing was heavy. Boom, boom!
went the guns of the Government, quick and withering came
the fire from the defence. If advantage of position was with
the first, the last showed the higher generalship. The duel
was sharp, and it was followed by the spectators with strained
interest. The Chief Justice on the bench and the prisoner
at the bar, attentive though they both were, alone of almost
all concerned seemed to watch the struggle calmly. It drew
toward late afternoon. Luther Martin, still upon the Overt
Act, after an ironic compliment or two to the Government
counsel, and a statement that George Washington, the great
and the good, might with a like innocency of intents have
found himself in a like position with Colonel Burr, withdrew
his guns for the night. The prosecution, after a glare
of indignation, announced that on the morrow it would
begin examination of witnesses; the Chief Justice said a
few weighty words, and the court was adjourned.</p>

<p>Out to the air, the grass and the trees, the gleam of the distant
James, and a tremendous and fantastic show of clouds,
piled along the horizon and flushed by the declining sun,
streamed the crowd. Excited and voluble, lavish of opinions
that had been pent up for hours, and drinking in greedily the
fresher air, it made no haste to quit the Capitol portico or
the Capitol Square. There were friends and acquaintances
to greet, noted people to speak to, or to hear and see others
speak to, the lawyers to congratulate and the judges to bow
to&mdash;and last but not least, there was the prisoner to mark
enter, with the marshal, a plain coach and drive away to the
house opposite the Swan, to which he had been removed from
his rooms in the Penitentiary.</p>

<p>The women who had observed the first day of the great
trial from the gallery made, of course, no such tarrying. They
left the building and the square at once, and the men of
their families present saw them into their carriages, or, if the
distance home was not great, watched them walk away in
little groups with a servant or two behind them.</p>

<p>At the head of the Capitol steps Jacqueline and Unity
found Fairfax Cary awaiting them, and upon the grass below
they were joined by Mr. Washington Irving. Mrs. Wickham
was with them, Mrs. Carrington, Mrs. Ambler, and Miss
Mayo. All the women lived within a short distance of one
another, and all, escorted by the two gentlemen, would walk
the little way across Capitol and Broad to Marshall Street.
Unity was to take supper with Mrs. Carrington and to spend
the night with Mrs. Ambler, and she would not go home first,
unless&mdash;She looked at Jacqueline. &quot;Did the fireworks
frighten you, honey? Would you rather that I stayed with
you?&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed. &quot;The fireworks were alarming,
weren't they, Mrs. Wickham? No, no; go with Mrs. Carrington,
Unity. To-night I'm going to write to Deb and read
a novel.&quot; They were now opposite the Chief Justice's house,
and as she spoke, she paused and made a slight curtsy to the
elder ladies. &quot;Our ways part here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will walk with you to your door,&quot; said Fairfax Cary.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &quot;No, do not. I am almost there.&quot;
Then, as his intention still held, she continued in a lower
voice, &quot;I had rather be alone. Obey me, please.&quot;</p>

<p>The small discussion ended in the group of ladies and their
two escorts giving Jacqueline Rand her way, and with laughing
good-byes keeping to their course down the street that was
now bathed in the glow of sunset. She watched them for a
moment, then turned her face toward her own house. The
distance was short, and she traversed it lightly and rapidly,
glad to be alone, glad to feel upon her brow the sunset wind,
and glad at the prospect of her solitary evening. She was
conscious of a strong revulsion of feeling. The sights and the
sounds of the past hours were still in mind, but all the air had
changed, and was no longer fevered and boding. She had
thought too much and made too much, she told herself, of
that vague and dark &quot;It might have been.&quot; It was not;
thank God, it was not! And Lewis, there in Williamsburgh,
walking now, perhaps, down Duke of Gloucester Street, or
sitting in the Apollo room at the Raleigh,&mdash;would she have
had Lewis read her mind that day? Generous! had she been
generous&mdash;or just? The colour flowed over her face and
throat. &quot;Neither just nor generous!&quot; she cried to herself,
in a passion of relief. &quot;I'll go no more to that place!&quot;</p>

<p>She reached her own gate, entered between the two box
bushes, and mounted the steps to the honeysuckle-covered
porch. The door before her was open, and the hall, wide and
cool, with the tall clock and the long sofa, the portraits on the
wall and a great bowl of stock and gillyflower, brought to her
senses a blissful feeling of home, of fixedness and peace.</p>

<p>Mammy Chloe came from the back of the house, and in her
mistress's chamber took from her her straw bonnet, gauze
scarf, and filmy gloves, then brought her slippers of morocco
and a thin, flowered house-dress, narrow and fine as an
infant's robe.</p>

<p>&quot;Has Joab gone to the post-office?&quot; asked Jacqueline.</p>

<p>&quot;Yaas'm. De Williamsbu'gh stage done come, fer I heah
de horn more'n an hour ago. Dar Joab now!&quot;</p>

<p>Mammy Chloe put down the blue china ewer, left the room,
and returned with a letter in her hand. &quot;Dar, now! Marse
Lewis ain' neber gwine fergit you! Ef de sun shine, or ef hit
don' shine, heah come de letter jes' de same!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline took the letter from her. &quot;Yes, Mammy, yes,&quot;
she said, with a sweet and tremulous laugh. &quot;He's a good
master, isn't he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lawd knows I ain' neber had a better,&quot; assented Mammy
Chloe. &quot;He powerful stric' to mek you min', is Marse Lewis,
but he am' de kin' what licks he lips ober de fac' dat you is
a-mindin'! I ain' gwine say, honey, an' I neber is gwine say,
dat he's wuth what de Churchills is wuth, but I's ready to
survigerate dat he's got he own wuth. An' ef hit's enough
fer you, chile, hit's enough fer yo' ole mammy. Read yo'
letter while I puts on yo' slippers.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline broke the seal and read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>JACQUELINE:&mdash;I am kept here for an uncertain time&mdash;worse
luck, dear heart! Do not send what letters may have
come for me, as I may leave sooner than I think for, and so
would pass them on the road. Open any from the court in
Winchester, where I have a case pending&mdash;if the matter
seems pressing, take a copy, and send copy or original to me
by to-morrow's stage. I am expecting a letter from Washington&mdash;an
important one, outlining the Embargo measures.
I looked for it before I left Richmond. If it has arrived, open
it, dear heart, and glance through it to see if there be any
message or enquiry which I should have at once. It is very
hot, very dusty, very tiresome in the court room. I will leave
Tom Mocket here to wind things up, and will get home as
soon as I can. Then, as soon as the hurly-burly's over, we'll
go to Roselands for a little while&mdash;to the calm, the peace,
bright days and white nights! While I write here in the
Apollo, you are at church in Saint John's. Shall I say, &quot;Pray
for me, sweet saint?&quot; You'll do that without my asking.
So I'll say instead, &quot;Think of me, dear wife, and love me
still.&quot;</p>

<p>Thine, LEWIS.</p></div>

<p>Jacqueline stood up in her faintly coloured gown, all rich
light and rose bloom. From her dressing-table she took her
keys, and, opening her mother's desk of rosewood and
mother-of-pearl, lifted from it several letters and the packet
which Colonel Nicholas had given her the day before. With
these in her hands she left her chamber and went into the
drawing-room. &quot;Bring the candles,&quot; she said over her
shoulder to Mammy Chloe. &quot;It is growing too dark to see
to read.&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII" />CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE LETTER</h3>


<p>The windows were open to the dusky rose of the west,
and their long curtains stirred in the hot and fitful
breeze. Jacqueline, waiting for the lights, pushed the
heavy hair from her forehead and panted a little with the
oppression of the night. Young Isham entered with the candles,
and Mammy Chloe brought her upon a salver a cup of coffee
and a roll. She ate and drank, then sent her old nurse away.
The candles, under their tall glass shades, were upon the
centre table, and beside them lay the letters she was to read.
Her husband's own letter was slipped beneath the ribbon that
confined her dress, and lay against her heart.</p>

<p>It was so hot and dull a night that she stood for a while
at a window, leaning a little out, trying to fancy that there
was rain in the fantastic mass of clouds that rose on either
side of the evening star. The smell of the box at the gate was
strong. She thought of Fontenoy, of Major Edward, and of
Deb. A grey moth touched her; she looked once again at the
bright star between the clouds, then, turning back into the
room, drew a chair to the table and, sitting down, took into
her lap the papers that lay beside the candles.</p>

<p>There had come a letter in the stage from Winchester.
She opened it. &quot;Could Mr. Rand arrive by such a day? The
case was important&mdash;the interests large&mdash;the fee large, too.
Could he come just as soon as the jury, the press, and Mr.
Jefferson hanged Aaron Burr? An early reply&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline rose, brought writing-materials from the escritoire
to the table, and copied rapidly, in her clear, Italian
hand, the Winchester letter, then laid it to one side to be folded
with her own to Lewis for to-morrow's stage to Williamsburgh.
The next letter was, she knew, from Albemarle, and
not important. She laid it aside. The third she opened; it
was from a gentleman in Westmoreland who wished in a
certain litigation &quot;the services, sir, of the foremost lawyer
in the state.&quot; Jacqueline smiled and laid it with the Albemarle
letter. The matter might wait until the foremost lawyer's
return. There were now two letters, and neither was
from Washington. One was indeed about matters political,
a tirade from a party leader on Rand's folly in declining, last
year, the nomination for Governor, but it contained nothing
to demand his instant attention. The other, which had come
by boat from Norfolk, seemed of no consequence.</p>

<p>Jacqueline put both aside, and took into her hand the
packet given her by Colonel Nicholas. She sat for a moment,
looking at the superscription. &quot;A letter from Washington,&quot;
Lewis said, &quot;outlining the Embargo measures. Open and
glance through it to see if there be any message I should
have at once.&quot; She thought no otherwise than that this was
the letter in question. Mr. Jefferson was, she knew, upon
the defensive in regard to these measures, and she was glad
to believe that he had fallen into an ancient habit and was
willing, as of old, to expatiate upon his policy to Lewis Rand.</p>

<p>She broke the red seals and unfolded the paper. It proved
to be a letter covering a letter. She let fall the folded, inner
missive, drew a candle nearer, and read in Jefferson's small,
formal, and very clear hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have the honour to restore to you the letter which you
will find enclosed. If you ask how it came into my hands, I
have but to say that, in times of crisis and peril, rules of conduct,
on the part of a government as of an individual, have
somewhat to bow to necessity. Enough that it did come into
my hands&mdash;last autumn. Judge if I have used it against
you! It is now returned to you because I no longer conceive
it necessary to hold it. I might have burned it; I prefer that
you shall do so.</p>

<p>I have but a word to add to our conversation of last August
at Monticello. I am a man of strong affections. Your youth
and all the eager service you did me in those years, and the
great hopes I had for you, endeared you to me. These things
are present in my mind. Were they not so, you would have
heard from me in other wise! Were they not so, that which
I now enclose should not travel back to the writer's hand;
it should remain, distinct and black, upon your Country's
records, for your children's children to read with burning
cheeks! I spare you, but you are of course aware that the
affection of which I spoke is dead, dead as the trust with
which I regarded you, or as the pride with which I dwelt
upon your future! Reread and destroy that which I place in
your hand.</p>

<p>THOMAS JEFFERSON.</p></div>

<p>Jacqueline laid down the large, blue, crackling sheet, and
took from the floor beside her, where it had fallen, the
President's enclosure. Hand and eye moved mechanically; she
neither thought nor feared. Her judgment was in suspension,
and she was unconscious of herself or of her act. The
seals upon this second letter were broken. She unfolded it.
On the outside it was addressed in a hand that, had she
thought, she would have recognised for Tom Mocket's, to an
undistinguished person at Marietta upon the Ohio; within,
the writing was her husband's and the address was to Aaron
Burr. The date was last August, the subject-matter the disruption
of the Republic and the conquest of Mexico, and the
detail of plans included the arrangement by which Rand was
to leave Albemarle, ostensibly to examine a purchase of land
beyond the mountains He would leave, however, not to
return. Once out of the country, he with his wife would press
on rapidly to the Ohio, to Blennerhassett's island.</p>

<p>The summer night deepened, hot and languorous, with a
sweep of moths to the candle flames, with vagrant odours of
flowering vines and vagrant sounds of distant laughter, voices,
footsteps down the long street. Jacqueline sat very still,
the letter in her lap. The curtains at the window moved in
the fitful air. Through the open doors from the kitchen in the
yard behind the house came the strumming of a banjo, then
Joab's deep bass:&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;Go down, go down, Moses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell Pharaoh let us go!</span><br />
Go down, go down, Moses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">King Pharaoh, let us go!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>There was a wave of honeysuckle, too faint and deadly sweet.
A party of men, boatmen or waggoners, went by, and as they
passed, broke into rough laughter.</p>

<p>Jacqueline rose, letting fall the letter. With her hand to
her forehead she stood for a minute, then moved haltingly to
the window. Her eyes were blank; she wanted air, she knew,
and for the moment she knew little else. She was whelmed
in deep waters, and all horizons were one. When she reached
the casement, she could only cling to the sill, raise her eyes
to the stars, and find nothing there to help her understand.
There was in them neither calm nor sublimity; they swung
and danced like insensate fireflies. The honeysuckle was too
strong&mdash;and she must tell Joab she did not wish to hear his
banjo to-night. The men who had passed were still laughing.</p>

<p>She put her hand again to her forehead, then presently
withdrew it and looked over her shoulder at the paper lying
upon the floor beside the table. By degrees the vagueness
and the absence of sensation vanished. She had had her
moments of merciful deadening, of indifference to pain; they
were past, and torment now began.</p>

<p>Perhaps half an hour went by. She rose from the sofa upon
which she had thrown herself, face down, pressed her hands
to her temples, then, moving to the table, wrote there a word
or two, folded and addressed the paper, and rang the bell.
Young Isham appeared and she gave him the note, bidding
him, in a voice that by an effort she made natural, to hasten
upon his errand. When he was gone, she stooped and gathered
from the floor the fallen letters&mdash;the President's and
Lewis Rand's&mdash;and laid them in a drawer. The touch
seemed to burn her, for she moaned a little. She wandered
for a moment uncertainly, here and there in the room, then,
returning to the sofa, fell upon her knees beside it, stretched
out her arms along the silk, and laid her head upon them.
&quot;O God! O God!&quot; she said, but made no other prayer.</p>

<p>The minutes passed. There was a step, the sound of the
gate-latch, and a hand upon the knocker. She rose from her
knees, and was standing by the table when, in another moment,
the drawing-room door opened to admit Ludwell Cary.
He came forward.</p>

<p>&quot;You sent for me&quot;&mdash;He paused, stepped back, and
looked at her fully and gravely. &quot;Something has happened.
Tell me what it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know. You have known all the time. You knew
last summer in the cedar wood!&quot; Her voice broke; she
raised her arms above her head, then let them fall with a cry.
&quot;You knew&mdash;you knew!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How have you come to know? No, don't tell me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am mad, I think. A letter came that told me. I see now
how the world must look to madmen. It is a curious place
where we are all strangers&mdash;and yet we think it is our safe
home.&quot;</p>

<p>As she turned from him, she reeled. There was a great chair
near, beside the window. Cary caught her by both hands,
forced her to sit down, and drew the curtains apart so that the
air of night came fully in. The quiet street was now deserted;
the maple boughs, too, screened the place. &quot;Look!&quot; he said.
&quot;Look how brightly Venus shines! All the immense rack of
clouds that we had at sunset has vanished. The box smells
like the garden at Fontenoy, where, I make no doubt, Deb
and Major Edward are walking up and down, counting the
stars. Yes, I knew, that afternoon in the cedar wood&mdash;but
not for happiness itself would I have robbed you of that
faith, that confidence&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She leaned forward in the great chair, her hands clasped
upon its arms, her dark eyes wide upon the night without
the window. &quot;I sent for you because I wished you to tell
me all. I wanted truth as I wanted air! I want it now.
That day we met in the cedar wood&mdash;you and Uncle Edward
talked together.&quot; She drew a difficult breath. &quot;It
was then that they&mdash;Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward&mdash;began
to treat me as though&mdash;as though I had never left
home! It was then&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They feared,&quot; said Cary gently, &quot;for your happiness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I returned to Roselands, and in three days we were to
travel across the mountains. Then at sunset, underneath the
beech tree&quot;&mdash;She sat for a moment perfectly still, then
turned in her chair and spoke in a clear voice. &quot;That was
why you forced him to challenge you, and that was why you
named a distant time and place? The truth, please.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was why.&quot;</p>

<p>She rose from the chair and leaned, panting, against the
window-frame. &quot;Was there no other way&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seemed the simplest way,&quot; he answered quietly.
&quot;There was no harm done, and it answered my purpose.&quot;
He paused, then went on. &quot;My purpose was to detain Mr.
Rand from so rash and so fatal a step until it was too late for
him to take it.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned from the window. &quot;You are generous,&quot; she said,
in a stifled voice. &quot;I ask your pardon for my hard thoughts
of you. Oh, for a storm and a wind to blow! It is too hot,
too heavy a night. I never wish to smell the honeysuckle
again.&quot;</p>

<p>He followed her back to the light of the candles. &quot;Listen
to me for a moment. I do not think that you know&mdash;I am not
sure that I know&mdash;the iron strength of the laws that rule an
ambitious nature. Ambition becomes an atmosphere; the
man whose temperament and self-training enure him to it
breathes it at last as though it were his native air. It becomes
that&mdash;an inner and personal clime, the source and spring
of countless actions, great and small. The light, too, is refracted,
and the great background of life is not seen quite
truly. It is, I think, an enchanted air, into which a man drifts
upon a river of dreams and imaginations&mdash;and how hard
to reascend, against the current!&quot; He paused, stood a moment
with downcast eyes, measuring the table with his hand,
then drew a quick breath and spoke on. &quot;Given his parentage
and descent, his unhappy and hardly-treated boyhood,
the visions, the rebellions, the longings with which he must
have walked the hot and rank tobacco-fields; given the upward
struggle of his youth, so determined and so successful;
given the courage, the hardihood, the wide outlook of a man
who has neither inherited nor been granted, but has himself
hewn out and built up his holding in life; given genius and
sense of power, will, perseverance, and the fatal knowledge
that all events and all currents habitually bend to his hand,&mdash;given
all this and opportunity&quot;&mdash;He raised his head and
met her eyes. &quot;It is not strange and it is not monstrous that
Mr. Rand should have involved himself, to a greater or less
degree, in this attempt upon the West. God is my witness, I
would not have you think it strange and monstrous! Ambition
is, perhaps, the most human of all qualities. Many and
many an ambitious man has been loved, loved passionately,
loved deservedly!&mdash;many a conqueror, many a one of
those who failed to conquer and who were called by an ugly
name! Love does not love the ambition, it loves that which
is love-worthy below the iron grating and the tracery of
false gold! As the world goes, Lewis Rand and I are enemies;
but I could swear to you to-night that I see, that I have
always seen, a greatness in him! I believe it to be distorted
and darkened, but the quality of it is greatness. Were I
he&quot;&mdash;He paused for a moment, then continued, with dignity.
&quot;Were I he, I would say to the lady who, for love, had
given me her hand in wedlock,&mdash;'Love me still. My land
is one of storm and darkness, of rude wastes and frowning
strongholds whence sometimes issue robber bands. But it
is not a petty land, and side by side with all that is wrong
runs not a little that is heroic and right! Love me still and
help me there, even though&mdash;even though I am forsworn
to you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would not have you think,&quot; she said clearly,&mdash;&quot;I
would not have you even lightly dream, that his country is
not my country! I love him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that you do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no place so dark that I would not wait for him
there as for the dawn. There is no flood I would not cross to
him; there is no deep pit in which I would not seek him, were
he fallen there! He has done wrong, and I am unhappy for
it. But never think, never dream, that, though I see the dark
and broken ground, I would leave that country, or am less
than wholly loyal to its King!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have neither thought nor dreamed it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I&mdash;when I learned this thing, it shook me so!
My brain whirled, and then I thought of you and called
to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no service to which you could call me that I
would not thankfully render. I am your friend and your
people's friend. There is one thing more I should like to
say to you. Do not fear for him. There is no reason to
believe that this will ever be discovered. The lips of those
who know are sealed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On our side your uncles, my brother and I,&mdash;and your
cousin, I think, guesses. The President, also, is aware&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She reddened deeply. &quot;I know,&quot; she said, in a stifled
voice. &quot;The President, too, is generous&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On his&mdash;on Mr. Rand's side, certain men whom we
need not name. That he has secured their silence, events have
proved, and I take it for granted that he has been careful to
recall and to destroy any writing that might incriminate. He
is, I think, quite safe.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned from him and, sitting down by the table, laid her
head upon her arms. He regarded her for a moment with
compassion and understanding, chivalrous and deep, then,
moving to the window, stood there with his face to the evening
star. At last she spoke in a broken and tremulous voice
&quot;Mr. Cary&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He came to her side. &quot;It is a peaceful night, still and
bright. You will sleep, will you not? Leave all this to Time
and to the power of steadfast love! You may yet see in this
land the grandeur of the dawn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that I shall,&quot; she answered. &quot;And when I see it,
I shall think reverently of you. It was like you to come, like
you to help me so. Now, good-night!&quot;</p>

<p>She took his hand, and before he could prevent her, raised
it to her lips. &quot;No,&mdash;let me! You are generous and you
are noble. I acknowledge it from my heart. Good-night&mdash;good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>He showed for a moment his pent emotion, then strove
with and conquered it. &quot;I will go. Your cousin is from
home, and you are alone to-night. Would you prefer that she
should return?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I had rather be alone.&quot;</p>

<p>He took the hand that she gave him, kissed it, and said
good-night. When he was gone and his step had died from
the street, she stood for some moments as he had left her,
then, with a sobbing breath, turned to the table and took
the letters from the drawer.</p>

<h3>RAND AND MOCKET</h3>


<p>Tom Mocket, returning to Richmond twenty-four
hours after his friend and patron, found it too
late that evening to see Lewis and to report the
happy winding up of all matters in Williamsburgh. The
next morning he was at the office betimes, but though he
waited long, no Lewis appeared. At last Tom sent a boy
to the house on Shockoe, who returned with the statement
that Mr. Rand was gone to the Capitol. &quot;Then I'll go too,&quot;
thought Tom. &quot;I've got nerve as well as he!&quot;</p>

<p>It was the fourth day of the actual trial, and interest was
at white heat. Tom whistled to himself as he crossed the
Capitol Square where men blocked the paths or, on the grass
beneath the trees, recounted, disputed, and prophesied.
When he reached the building, it was with much difficulty
that he effected an entrance, and with more that he at last
edged himself into the Hall of the House of Delegates. Sturdy
perseverance and an acquaintance with a doorkeeper, however,
can accomplish much, and these finally placed Mocket
where, by dint of balancing himself upon an advantageous
ledge of masonry, he had a fair view of both participants and
spectators.</p>

<p>General William Eaton was being examined. The throng
sat or stood silently attentive, swayed forward as by a wind.
Marshall upon the bench, long and loose-jointed, with a
quiet, plain face, was listening with intentness; the opposing
counsel sat alert, gathered for the pounce; the prisoner,
with a contemptuous smile, regarded the witness, who indeed
cut but a poor figure. The District Attorney's voice,
deliberate and full, asked a question, and General Eaton
proceeded to give in detail Colonel Burr's expression of
treasonable intentions.</p>

<p>Mocket, who had at first looked and listened with a thumping
heart and a strong feeling that, visible to all, the letter
T might be somewhere sewn or branded upon his own person,
by degrees grew bolder. There wasn't any letter there,
that was certain, and a slight sense of personal danger might
even become a welcome sauce to such a great affair as this!
His fright vanished, and his ferret eyes began to rove.</p>

<p>There was Adam Gaudylock, still with his musket. It
was a day when men habitually journeyed with pistols in
their holsters or a dirk somewhere about them, but Adam
carried that musket merely because he loved it&mdash;like a dog
or a woman! Tawny and blue-eyed, light and lithe, indifferent
and pleased to see the show, the hunter listened to
General Eaton and laughed behind his hand to a fellow
woodsman. &quot;My certie, he's trained!&quot; thought Tom. &quot;It's
not much they'll get from him!&quot;</p>

<p>His eyes left Adam and travelled in search of Lewis Rand,
finding him at last where he sat at no great distance from
the group of central importance. His face was turned in
Mocket's direction, and the light from a high window fell
upon it. &quot;He doesn't see me,&quot; thought Tom to himself.
&quot;Who's he looking at like that?&quot;</p>

<p>The witness's voice, raised by suggestion of counsel to a
higher note, came athwart Mocket's speculations. &quot;I listened
to Colonel Burr's mode of indemnity; and as I had
by this time begun to suspect that the military expedition
he had on foot was unlawful, I permitted him to believe
myself resigned to his influence, that I might understand
the extent and motive of his arrangements. Colonel Burr
now laid open his project of revolutionizing the territory west
of the Alleghany; establishing an independent empire there;
New Orleans to be the capital, and he himself to be the chief;
organizing a military force on the waters of the Mississippi,
and carrying conquest to Mexico&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>On went Eaton's disclosures, punctuated by heated objections
from Wickham and Luther Martin, and once or twice
by a scornful question from Burr himself. It was damning
testimony, and the throng hung breathless on the various
voices. Mocket listened also, but listened with his eyes upon
his chief, and when there arose some interruption and dispute
over technicalities, his freed mind proceeded to deal
with Rand's change of aspect. It occurred to him to wonder
if the light which showed it to him could be falling through
a veil of storm cloud, but when he glanced at the high window,
there was only the blue August heaven. What, then,
gave Lewis so dark a look? &quot;The black dog he talks of has
got him sure,&quot; thought Tom. &quot;What's happened to anger
him like that?&quot;</p>

<p>The voice of the witness again made itself heard. &quot;Colonel
Burr stated that he had secured to his interests and attached
to his person the most distinguished citizens of Tennessee,
Kentucky, and the territory of Orleans; that the army of the
United States would act with him; that it would be reinforced
by ten or twelve thousand men from the above states and
territories, and that he had powerful agents in the Spanish
territory. He proposed to give me a distinguished command
in his army; I understood him to say the second in command.
I asked him who would command in chief. He said, General
Wilkinson. I said that General Wilkinson would act
as lieutenant to no man in existence. 'You are in error,' said
Mr. Burr. 'Wilkinson will act as lieutenant to me&mdash;'&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket moved with care along the ledge until he had
brought within his view another portion of the Hall. &quot;That
look of his isn't fixed on nothing! Now we'll see.&quot; He
stood on tiptoe, craned his neck, and surveyed the crowded
floor. &quot;Humph!&quot; he remarked at last. &quot;I might have known
without looking. If I were Ludwell Cary&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The counsel for the prisoner and the prisoner himself were
subjecting the witness to a riddling fire of cross-questions.
Mocket, on his coign of vantage, was caught again by the more
apparent drama, and looked and listened greedily. Eaton at
last retired, much damaged, and Commodore Truxtun was
sworn. This was a man of different calibre, and from side
to side of the long room occurred a subtle intensification of
respect, interest, and attention. On went the examination,
this time favourable, on the whole, to Burr. &quot;The prisoner
frequently, in conversation with me, mentioned the subject
of speculations in western lands, opening a canal and building
a bridge. Colonel Burr also said to me that the government
was weak, and that he wished me to get the navy of
the United States out of my head; that it would dwindle
to nothing; and that he had something to propose to me that
was both honourable and profitable; but I considered this
nothing more than an interest in his land speculations&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The August heat was maddening. Now and then a puff
of wind entered from the parched out-of-doors, but it hardly
refreshed. The flutter of the women's fans in the gallery
made a far away and ineffectual sound. &quot;All his conversations
respecting military and naval subjects and the Mexican
expedition,&quot; went on Truxtun's voice, &quot;were in event of a
war with Spain. I told him my opinion was, there would be
no war, but he was sanguine of it. He said that after the
Mexican expedition he intended to provide a formidable
navy; that he meant to establish an independent government
and give liberty to an enslaved world. I declined his
propositions to me because the President was not privy to
the project. He asked me the best mode of attacking the
Havana, Carthagena, and La Vera Cruz&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The day wore on. Truxtun was released, and the Attorney
for the United States called Blennerhassett's servants to
prove the array at the island and the embarkment upon
the Ohio. They did their best with a deal of verbiage, of
&quot;Colonel Burr said&quot; and &quot;Mr. Blennerhassett said,&quot; and
with no little bewilderment under cross-examination. &quot;Yes,
sir; I'm telling you, sir. Mr. Blennerhassett allowed that
Colonel Burr and he and a few friends had bought eight
hundred thousand acres of land, and they wanted young
men to settle it. He said he would give any young man who
would go down the river one hundred acres of land, plenty
of grog and victuals while going down the river, and three
months' provision after they got to the end; every young
man must have his rifle and blanket. When I got home, I
began to think, and I asked him what kind of seed we should
carry with us. He said we did not want any, the people had
seeds where we were going&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of what occupation were you upon the island?&quot; demanded
Mr. Wirt.</p>

<p>&quot;A gardener, sir. And then Mr. Blennerhassett said to
me, 'I'll tell you what, Peter, we're going to take Mexico,
one of the finest and richest places in the world!' He said
that Colonel Burr would be King of Mexico, and that Mrs.
Alston, daughter of Colonel Burr, was to be the Queen of
Mexico whenever Colonel Burr died. He said that Colonel
Burr had made fortunes for many in his time, but none for
himself, and now he was going to make something for himself.
He said that he had a great many friends in the Spanish
territory; that the Spaniards, like the French, had got
dissatisfied with their government, and wanted to <i>swap</i> it.
He told me that the British also were friends in this piece
of business. I told him that the people had got it into their
heads that Colonel Burr wanted to divide the Union. He
sent me to Mason County with a letter, but I wasn't to
deliver it until I had the promise that it should be burned
before me as soon as 't was read, for, says he, it contains high
treason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gad!&quot; thought Mocket to himself, &quot;I'm glad that some
one else's letters are burned as well! If I were as cool as
Aaron Burr looks&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. McRae questioned the witness: &quot;Well, who went off
this December night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Blennerhassett, sir, and the whole of the party.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At what time of the night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About one o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did all that came down to the island go away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All but one, who was sick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Had they any guns?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some of them had. Some of the people went a-shooting;
but I do not know how many there were.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of guns; rifles or muskets?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't tell whether rifles or muskets. I saw no pistols
but what belonged to Mr. Blennerhassett himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was there any powder or lead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They had powder and they had lead. I saw some powder
in a long, small barrel like a churn. Some of the men were
engaged in running bullets.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What induced them to leave the island at that hour of
the night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because they were informed that the Kenawha militia
were coming down.&quot;</p>

<p>The cross-examination of this witness and some desultory
firing by the opposed counsel ended the day's proceedings.
The court adjourned, and the crowd streamed forth to the
open air. Mocket, among the first to leave the hail, waited
for his chief beside the outer doors. Townspeople, country
neighbours, and strangers poured by, and he spoke to this
one or to that. A group of Federalists approached; among
them Ludwell Cary. They were talking, and as they passed
Mocket heard the words, &quot;When I return to Albemarle next
week&mdash;&quot; They went on down the steps; others streamed
by, and presently Rand appeared. His lieutenant joined
him, and together they left the Capitol and struck down the
parched slopes to Governor Street.</p>

<p>&quot;Things are all right at Williamsburgh,&quot; ventured Mocket,
finding the silence oppressive. &quot;I got in too late to see you
last night. Were you at the Capitol yesterday also?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man told me they had Adam on the stand. They got
nothing from him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've the papers all straight for the Winchester case.
What do you want me to do&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to be silent.&quot;</p>

<p>The other glanced aslant, with a lift of his brows and a
twist of his lip. &quot;That's a black rage,&quot; he thought; &quot;Gideon
and old Stephen and the Lord knows who beside all speaking
together!&quot;</p>

<p>They left Governor Street and presently arrived in silence
before Rand's office. Mocket unlocked the door and they
went in together. The senior partner dragged a chair before
the empty fireplace and, sitting down, stared at the discoloured
bricks as though he saw vistas through the wail.
Tom worked among the papers on his desk, moving his
fingers noiselessly, and now and then glancing over his
shoulder. The clock on the wall ticked loudly.</p>

<p>Rand spoke at last His voice had a curious suppressed
tone, and upon his forehead, between the eyes, was displayed
the horseshoe frown of extreme anger. Mocket had seen
it earlier in the day, and it was now distinct as a brand. &quot;I
am not going,&quot; he said, &quot;to take the Winchester case. This
damned business here will soon be over. I shall wait to hear
the verdict, and then I'm going to Albemarle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What d'ye think the verdict will be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'll acquit him. Barring Wirt, he has all the talent
on his side. I'll leave you here to clear up things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does Mrs. Rand wait here for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. She leaves Richmond with Miss Dandridge to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom took out his knife and began to whittle, an occupation
that in him denoted sustained mental exertion. The other
sat on before the empty fireplace, the mark upon his forehead,
his hand twitching where it lay upon the arm of his
chair. The clock ticked loudly; the sun, now low in the heavens,
sent its gold shafts through the window; outside, the
locusts shrilled in a dusty sycamore. Rand rose and, going
to the cupboard, took from it a bottle and a glass, poured out
brandy for himself, and drank it. In an age of hard drinking
he was accounted puritanically abstemious. Mocket,
glancing after him, knew that the draught meant disturbance
so deep that the organism needed, rather than craved, the
strength within the glass. Rand came back to the fireplace.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember when, in November, I burned here, or
thought I burned here, all papers, all letters&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do I?&quot; asked Mocket, with emphasis. &quot;There's nothing
happened to make me forget.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man cannot weave a net so fine that some minnow
will not slip through and become leviathan! It escaped and
has grown. Well, that too was in the nature of things.&quot; He
took the ash-stick from the corner of the hearth and handled
it as though he were again holding down burning papers.
&quot;So things are all right at Williamsburgh? I had a happy
home-coming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You always have that,&quot; said Tom simply. &quot;You've had
a wonderful fortune, and more there than anywhere. I'm
always telling Vinie&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Vinie!&quot; answered the other. &quot;Vinie would always
blindly worship on. The sun might darken and go out, but
where's the odds since she would never know it! Faith like
a dog's or a child's or Vinie's&mdash;there's comfort there! But
the awakened mind, and Judgment side by side upon the
throne with Love&mdash;Oh, there's verjuice in the world!&quot; He
broke into harsh laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I knew what ailed you,&quot; thought Mocket. &quot;I'll
try another tack.&quot; He stopped whittling and turned from his
desk. &quot;Coming out of the Capitol, I heard Ludwell Cary say
that he goes next week to Albemarle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is indifferent to me,&quot; replied the other, &quot;whether
he goes or stays.&quot; His hands closed upon the ash-stick until
his nails were white. Suddenly he spoke without apparent
relevance. &quot;He is one of those men who are summoned in
time of trouble&mdash;when the mind is tossed and the heart is
wavering. They always answer&mdash;they come down the street
at night, between the box bushes, up the steps beneath the
honeysuckle&mdash;on such an errand they would not fear the
lion's den! They are magnanimous, they are generous, they
are out of our old life, they can tell us what we ought to do!&quot;
He struck the ash-stick violently against the hearth. &quot;Honeysuckle
and box and the quiet of the night, and 'Yes, I knew,
I knew. 'Twas thus and so, and I would counsel you&mdash;'
Oh, world's end and hell-fire! forgiveness itself grows worthless
on such terms!&quot;</p>

<p>He threw the stick from him, rose abruptly, and walked
to the window.</p>

<p>&quot;The clouds pile up, but they do not break, and the heat
and fever of this August air grow intolerable. To abstract
the mind&mdash;to abstract the mind&quot;&mdash;He stood listening to
the locusts and all the indefinable hum of the downward-drawing
afternoon, then turned to Tom. &quot;Give me those
Winchester papers. Now what, exactly, did you do in Williamsburgh?&quot;</p>

<h3>THE RIVER ROAD</h3>


<p>The days of speeches, for the Government and for
Aaron Burr,&mdash;Hay, Wirt, and McRae against
Edmund Randolph, Wickham, Botts, Lee, and
Luther Martin,&mdash;went crackling by with bursts of heavy
artillery and with running fire of musketry. It was a day of
orators, and eloquence was spilled like water. At last the
case rested. The Chief Justice summed up, exhaustively,
with extraordinary ability, and with all the impartiality
humanly possible to a Federalist Chief Justice dealing with
a Republican prosecution. The jury, as is known, brought
in a Scotch verdict, whereupon the prisoner was immediately
upon his feet with a vehement protest. Finally the
&quot;Not proven&quot; was expunged from the record, and Aaron
Burr stood &quot;Acquitted.&quot; The famous trial for treason was
over.</p>

<p>As, throughout the summer, all roads led to Richmond,
now, in the fierce heat and dust of early autumn, there was
an exodus which left the town extremely dull after all the stir
and fascination of the Government's proceedings. Burr,
indeed, discharged for treason, was still held in bail to answer
for the misdemeanor, judges and lawyers were still occupied,
and many witnesses yet detained. But the result of the matter
was a foregone conclusion. Here, too, there would be a &quot;Not
proven,&quot; with a demand on the part of the accused for a &quot;Not
guilty,&quot; and a final direction by the judges to the jury to
return a verdict in the usual form. The trial of a man for
a misdemeanor in levying war with Spain&mdash;a misdemeanor
which, if proved, could entail only imprisonment&mdash;was an
infinitely less affair than a prosecution for high treason, with
the penalty of an ignominious death suspended like a sword
of Damocles. The little world in Richmond felt the subsidence
of excitement, realized how warm and dusty was the
town, and began to think of its plantations and of country
business. Witnesses and visitors of note took the homeward
road. The Swan, the Eagle, the Bell, the Indian Queen,
crowded all the summer, saw their patrons depart by stage,
by boat, in coach and chaise, and on horseback. Many private
houses were closed, and the quiet of the doldrums fell
upon the place.</p>

<p>Jacqueline and Unity had been ten days in Albemarle.
The two Carys, a servant behind them with their portmanteaus,
rode away from the Swan on the first day of September.
It was understood between the brothers that they were to
make all haste to Greenwood. But there were houses on the
way where kinsmen and friends might be trusted to do what
they could to detain the two. Both were anxious to be at
home&mdash;Fairfax the more eager, as was natural. The marriage
was set for the middle of the month. As they rode out
of town he had begun with, &quot;I'll see her in four days,&quot; and
the next morning, passing through the gates of the plantation
where they had slept, he had irrelevantly remarked, &quot;Now
it is but three.&quot; The elder brother laughed and wished him
Houssain's carpet.</p>

<p>Throughout the day they rode as rapidly as the heat permitted,
but when at dusk they were captured by a kinsman
with a charming wife and a bevy of pretty daughters, it was
evident that they would not resume the road at dawn. It
was noon, indeed, before they unclasped all these tendrils and
pursued their journey, and at sunset another plantation put
out a detaining hand. Fairfax Cary swore with impatience.
The other laughed again, but when, late next morning, they
got away with a message called to them from the porch,
&quot;You'll be at Elm Tree this afternoon. Tell Cousin William&mdash;&quot;
he looked kindly at his junior's vexed face and
proposed a division of forces.</p>

<p>&quot;We can't neglect Elm Tree, and then there's Cherry Hill
and Malplaquet still before us. Why shouldn't you just speak
to them at Elm Tree, then ride on to the inn at Deer Lick
and sleep there to-night? You could start with the first light,
ride around Cherry Hill, and give Malplaquet the slip. I'll
make your excuses everywhere. It's hard if a man can't be
forgiven something&mdash;when he's on the eve of marrying
Unity Dandridge! You'll be at Greenwood to-morrow night,
and I dare say they'll ask you to breakfast at Fontenoy.
Come, there's a solution!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're the best fellow! And what will you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll sleep to-night at Elm Tree and ride soberly on to-morrow,
take dinner at Cherry Hill, and sleep again at Malplaquet.
They'll all be disappointed at not seeing the prospective
bridegroom, but I'll make them understand that a
man in love can't travel like a tortoise! I'll ride from Malplaquet
by the river road and be at home that afternoon.
You had better take Eli with you.&quot;</p>

<p>They rode together to Elm Tree, and parted under these
conditions.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand left Richmond on the third of September.
He travelled rapidly. There were no kinsmen to detain him
on the road, and while he had hot partisans and was not
without friends, there was not within him the Virginian instinct
to loiter among these last, finding the flower in the
moment, and resolutely putting off the morrow. His quest
was for the morrow.</p>

<p>He rode now in the hot September weather, by field and
forest, hill and dale and stream, and rested only when he
would spare the horses. Young Isham was with him; Joab
had been sent on with Jacqueline. When night fell, he drew
rein at the nearest house. If he knew the people, well; if he
did not know them, well still; on both sides acquaintance
would be enlarged. Hospitality was a Virginian virtue; no
one ever dreamed of being unwelcome because he was a
stranger. In the morning, after thanks and proffers of all
possible service, he took the road again. It was his purpose
to make the journey, despite the heat, in three days.</p>

<p>The last night upon the road he spent at a small tavern
hard by an important crossroads. It was twilight when he
dismounted, the fireflies thick in the oak scrub and up and
down the pale roads, a crescent moon in the sky, and from
somewhere the sound of wind in the pine-tops. Young Isham
and the hostler took away the horses, and Rand, mounting the
steps to the porch, found lounging there the inn's usual half-dozen
haphazard guests. To most of these he was known
by sight, to all by name, and as, with a &quot;Good-evening,
gentlemen!&quot; he passed into the low, whitewashed main
room, he left behind him more animation than he had found.
When, a little later, he went into the supper-room, he discovered
at table, making heavy inroads upon the bacon and
waffles, an old acquaintance&mdash;Mr. Ned Hunter.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Hunter, good-evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey&mdash;what&mdash;the Devil! Good-evening to you, Mr.
Rand. So, after all, your party, sir, didn't hang Colonel
Burr!&quot;</p>

<p>The two ate supper with the long table between them, and
with no great amiability of feeling in presence. The Republican
was the first to end the meal, and the Federalist answered
his short bow with an even more abbreviated salute. Rand
went out into the porch, where there were now only one or
two lounging figures, and sat down at the head of the steps.
Mr. Hunter came presently, too, into the air, and leaned
against the railing, whistling to the dogs in the yard.</p>

<p>&quot;You are going on in the morning, Mr. Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. At dawn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll be in Charlottesville, then, by two o'clock. Earlier,
if you take the river road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall take the river road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is broken riding, but it is the quickest way. Well, I
won't be many hours behind you! My humble regards, if
you please, to Mrs. Rand. There's nothing now at Fontenoy
but wedding talk. I am sure I hope Miss Dandridge may be
happy! Here, Di! here, Rover! here, Vixen!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand arose. &quot;I've had a long day and I make an early
start. Good-night to you, gentlemen!&quot;</p>

<p>When, in the morning, Young Isham came to his door with
the first light, the boy found his master already up and partly
dressed. Rand stood by the window looking out at the pink
sky. &quot;A bad night, Young Isham,&quot; he said, without turning.
&quot;Sleep's a commodity that has somehow run short
with me. Are the horses ready?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yaas, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you had your breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yaas, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Help me here, then, and let's away. Roselands by one!&quot;</p>

<p>Young Isham held the gilt-buttoned waistcoat, then took
from the dresser the extravagant neckcloth of the period, and
wound it with care around his master's throat. Rand knotted
the muslin in front, put on his green riding-coat, and took
from the dresser his watch and seals. &quot;Bah! there's a chill
in these September dawns! Close the portmanteau. Where
did you put the holsters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dar dey is, sah, under yo' han'.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy, on his knees, worked at the straps of the portmanteau.
Rand, waiting for him to finish, drew out a pistol
from its leather case, looked it over and replaced it, then did
the same with its fellow. &quot;Are you done?&quot; he said at last.
&quot;Bring everything and come on. I'll swallow a cup of coffee
and then we'll be gone. We should pass Malplaquet by nine.&quot;</p>

<p>They rode away from the half-awakened inn. A mist was
over the fields, and when they presently came to a stretch of
forest, the leaves on either hand were wet. The grey filled
arcades and hollows, and the note of the birds was as yet
sleepy and without joyousness. They left the woods and,
mounting a hill, saw from its summit the sun rise in splendour,
then dipped again into fields where from moment to moment
the gold encroached. They rode rapidly in the freshness of
the morning, by wood and field and stream, so rapidly that it
was hardly nine when they passed a brick house with pillars
set on a hill-top in a grove of oaks. Rand looked at it fixedly
as he rode by. Malplaquet was a Cary place, and it had an
air of Greenwood.</p>

<p>Three miles further on, sunk in elder and pokeberry and
shaded by a ragged willow, there appeared a wayside forge.
The blacksmith was at work, and the clink, clink of iron made
a cheerful sound. Rand drew rein. &quot;Good-morning, Jack
Forrest. Have a look, will you, at this shoe of Selim's.&quot;</p>

<p>The smith stooped and looked. &quot;I'll give him a new one
in a twinkling, Mr. Rand! From Richmond, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; from Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Burr got off, didn't he? If the jury'd been from this
county, we'd have hanged him sure! Splitting the country
into kindling wood, and stirring up a yellow jacket's nest of
Spaniards, and corrupting honest men! If they won't hang
him, then tar and feathers, say I! Soh, Selim! You've been
riding hard, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I wanted to be at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis mortal weather. When September's hot, it lays over
July. We'll have a storm this afternoon, I'm thinking.
There's a deal of travel despite the heat, and I'm not complaining
of business. Mr. Cary of Greenwood is just ahead
of you. There, sir, that's done!&quot;</p>

<p>The smith arose, patted Selim on the shoulder, and stood
back. &quot;You've got a fine horse, Mr. Rand, and that's certain.
By Meteor, ain't he, out of Fatima?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Which of the Carys did you say&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwell Cary. He came from Malplaquet and rode by
an hour ago. The other passed yesterday&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did Mr. Cary say which road he would take at the
ford?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, he didn't. The main road, though, I reckon. The
river road's bad just now, and he seemed to have time
before him. Thankee, Mr. Rand, and good-day to you!&quot;</p>

<p>Followed by Young isham, Rand travelled on by the dusty
road, between the parching elder and ironweed, blackberry
and love vine. There was dust upon the wayside cedars, and
the many locust trees let fall their small yellow leaves. As the
sun mounted the heat increased, and with it the interminable,
monotonous, and trying <i>zirr, zirr</i>, of the underworld on blade
and bush. He rode with a dark face, and with lines of anger
between his brows. It had come to him like a chance spark
to a mine that Ludwell Cary was not at Greenwood, was
yet upon the road before him. He knew day and hour when
the other had left Richmond, and there had been more than
time to make his journey.</p>

<p>Before him, on the lower ground, a belt of high and deep
woods proclaimed a watercourse, and he presently arrived
beside a shrunken stream. Here was a mill, and the miller
and a man or two were apparent in the doorway. The ford
lay a hundred yards beyond, and on the far side of the stream
the river road and the main road branched. Travellers
paused as a matter of course to give and take the time of day,
and now the miller, dusty and white, came out into the road.
&quot;Morning, morning, Mr. Rand! From Richmond, sir? So
we couldn't hang Aaron Burr, after all. Well, he ought to
have been, that's all I've got to say!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me a gourd of water, will you, Bates? This dust is
choking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis that, sir. But we'll have a storm before the day is
over. There's a deal of travel just now. Mr. Cary of Greenwood
passed a short while ago.&quot;</p>

<p>A negro brought a dripping gourd. Rand put it to his lips
and drank the cool water. &quot;Which road,&quot; he asked, as he
gave back the gourd,&mdash;&quot;which road did Mr. Cary take?
The main road or the river road?&quot;</p>

<p>The miller looked over his shoulder. &quot;Jim and Bob and
Shirley, which road did Mr. Cary take?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't notice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reckon he took the main road, Bates.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn't looking, but you could hear his horse's hoofs,
and that wouldn't have been so on the river road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Twuz de main road, sah.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand and Young Isham went on, down by the mill and
along the bank to the clear, brown, shallow ford, crossed, and
paused beneath a guide-post upon the crest of the further
bank. The trees hid the mill. Before them stretched the main
road, to the right dipped between fern and under arching
boughs the narrow, broken river road. &quot;If he went this
way,&quot; said Rand slowly, &quot;I'll go that. Young Isham&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yaas, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The mare's spent. No need to give her this rough travelling.
Take the main road and take it slowly. Let her walk,
and when you reach Red Fields, stop and have her fed.
I'll go and go fast by the river road.&quot;</p>

<p>Master and slave parted, the latter keeping to the sunny
thoroughfare, the former plunging into the narrow, heavily
shaded track that ran through ravine and over ridge, now
beside the water and now in close woods of birch and hemlock.
The road was bad, but Selim and his master bent to it
grimly, with no nice avoidance of rut or stone or sunken
place. To the horse there was before him food and rest, to
the man his home. They took at the same pace the much
of rough and the little of smooth, and the miles fell behind
them. The sun was high, but there were threatening masses
of clouds, with now and then a distant roll of thunder. The
road was solitary, little used at any time, and to-day as lonely
a woodland way as might well be conceived.</p>

<p>Rand rode with closed lips, and with the mark between his
brows. Passion was having its way with him, such passion
as had lived with him, now drowsing, now fiercely awake,
in the days at Richmond between his return from Williamsburgh
and the close of the trial. He saw Roselands and
Jacqueline beneath the beech tree, but he also saw, and that
with more distinctness, the face and form of the man who
rode toward Greenwood. He longed for Jacqueline, but he
had not forgiven her. He knew that he would when he saw
her face&mdash;would forgive her with a cry for the waste of the hot,
revengeful days, the sleepless nights, since they had parted.
Her face swam before him, between the hemlock boughs,
but he was not ready yet to forgive, not yet, not until he got
to Roselands and she met him with her wistful eyes! He was
not a fool; the Absolute within him knew where lay the need
for forgiveness, but it was deeply overlaid with human pride
and wrath. He was at the old, old trick of anger with another
when the fault was all his own. As for Ludwell Cary&mdash;</p>

<p>His hand closed with force upon the bridle and his eyes
narrowed. &quot;From the first, from that day upon the Justice's
Bench, from that day when we gathered nuts together, I must
have hated. Now it is warp and woof, warp and woof!&quot; He
touched Selim with the spur. &quot;If there were truly a heaven
and truly a hell, and I, in flames myself, saw him in Abraham's
bosom, not to escape from that torment would I call
to him, 'Once we were neighbours, once it seemed that we
might have been friends&mdash;come down, come down and help
me, Cary!'&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed, a harsh sound that came back from the rock
above him. By no means always, far from even often, a
hardened or an evil man, to-day the stream of thought was
stirred and sullied from every black pool and weedy depth,
and there came floating up folly, waste, and sin. His reason
slept. Had he, by some Inquisitor not to be disobeyed, been
suddenly obliged to give why and wherefore for his hatred,
the trained intellect must have agreed with the questioner.
&quot;These causes fail of sufficiency.&quot; That was true, but the
truth was sophistry. He dealt now with the fact that he hated,
and in his mind, as he rode at speed along the river road, he
did not even review the past which had given birth to this
present. He hated, and his hand closed upon the rein within
it as though there was there, in addition, another thread.</p>

<p>A hemlock bough brushed violently against his face. He
struck it aside, and, coming to the rocky top of a little rise,
checked Selim for a moment of the fresher air. It came like
a sigh from the darkening clouds. Rand looked out over
field and forest to the massed horizon, then shook the reins,
and Selim picked his way down the ridge to a woodland
bottom through which flowed a stream. Rand heard the
ripple of the water. A jutting boulder, crowned by a mountain
ash, hid the road before him; he turned it and saw the
stream, some yards away, flowing over mossed rocks and
beneath a dark fringe of laurel. He saw more than the
stream, for a horseman had paused upon the little rocky
strand, and, hearing hoofs behind him, had partly turned his
own steed. Rand's hand dragged at the bridle-rein and Selim
stood still.</p>

<p>For a moment the two men, so suddenly confronted, sat
their horses and stared at each other. Between them was a
narrow rocky space, about Rand a heavy frame of leaves,
behind Cary the clear flowing stream. Above the treetops
the mounting clouds were dark, but the sun rode hot and high
in a round of unflecked azure. The silence held for a heartbeat,
then Rand spoke thickly: &quot;So you, too, took the river
road?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. It is rough but short. When did you leave Richmond?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As soon as I could. You would have been better pleased,
would you not, had I never left it? In your opinion, I should
be in durance there, laid by the heels with Aaron Burr!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not yourself, Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not push innocence upon the board! When did it
begin, your deep interest in my concerns? Before the world
was made, I think, for always we have been at odds. But
this&mdash;this especial matter, Ludwell Cary, this began with the
letter which you wrote and signed 'Aurelius'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A letter that told the truth, Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is as may be. Telling the truth is at times an occupation
full of danger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The nineteenth of February&mdash;ah, I have you there!
Was it not&mdash;was it not a pleasant employment for a snowy
night to sit by the fire and learn news of an enemy&mdash;news
the more piquant for the lips that gave it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are speaking, sir, both madly and falsely!&quot;</p>

<p>They pressed their horses more closely together. Cary was
pale with anger, but upon Rand's face was a curious darkness.
Men had seen Gideon look so, and in old Stephen Rand
the peculiarity had been marked. When he spoke, it was in a
voice that matched his aspect. &quot;Last October in the Charlottesville
court room&mdash;even that insult was not insult
merely, but a trap as well! It is to be acknowledged that
yours was the master mind. I walked into your trap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That which I did is not to be called a trap. Your ambition
enmeshed you then, as your passion blinds you now.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand's voice darkened and fell. &quot;Who gave you&mdash;who
gave you the right of inquisition? What has your soul or
your way of thinking to do with mine? You are not my
keeper. I would not take salvation at your hands&mdash;by God,
no! Why should the thought of you lie at the bottom of
each day? It shall not lie at the bottom of this one! I do
not know where first we met, but now we'll part. You have
laid your finger here and you have laid it there, now take
your hand away!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you well, and I will,&quot; said Cary sternly.</p>

<p>The other drew a labouring breath. &quot;Two weeks ago I
was in Williamsburgh, in the Apollo, listening in the heat to
idle talk&mdash;and you in Richmond, you came at her call!
You came down the quiet street, and in between the box
bushes, and up the steps under the honeysuckle. What did
you say to her there in the dusk, by the window? You were
a Cary&mdash;you were part and parcel of the loved past&mdash;you
had all the shibboleths&mdash;you could comfort, commiserate,
and counsel! Ha! I wish I might have heard. 'Aurelius'
dealing with the forsworn and the absent! 'Here the blot,
and there the stain, and yon a rent that's hard to mend.
If there's salvation, I see it not at present.' So you resolved
all her doubts, and laid within her hand every link of a long
chain. You have my thanks.&quot;</p>

<b>CARY SAW AND FLUNG OUT HIS ARM, SWERVING HIS HORSE, BUT TOO LATE</b>
<br /></div>

<p>&quot;I will not,&quot; said Cary, after a silence,&mdash;&quot;I will not be
moved by you now, and I will not talk with you now. You
are beside yourself. I will say good-day to you, Mr. Rand,
and in a less passionate hour I will tell you that you have
judged me wrongly.&quot;</p>

<p>He gathered up his reins and slightly turned his horse.
It had been wiser to break into violent speech, or even to
deal the other a blow. As it was, the very restraint of his action
was spark to gunpowder. Rand's hand fell to a holster,
drew and raised a pistol. Cary saw and flung out his arm,
swerving his horse, but too late. There was a flash and a
report. The reins dropped from Cary's grasp; he sank forward
upon his horse's neck, then, while the terrified animal
reared and plunged, fell heavily to earth and lay beside the
stream with a ball through his heart.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX" />CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>HOMEWARD</h3>


<p>The frightened birds rose in numbers from the forest
trees. Cary's horse, with a snort of terror, reared and
turned. Rand flung himself from Selim and dashed
forward to the black's bridle, but he was too late. The horse
clattered down the little strand, plunged into the flashing
water, and in another moment reached the opposite bank
and tore away along the river road.</p>

<p>The sound of hoofs died away. All sound seemed to die,
that of the stream, of the birds, of the air in the trees. It was
as still as the desert. Very quietly and subtly the outward
world put itself in accord with the inward; never again would
sky or earth, tree or leaf or crystal water, be what it was an
hour ago. Life and the scenery of life had a new aspect.</p>

<p>The murderer moved to the side of the murdered, knelt
stiffly, and laid his hand upon the heart. It, too, was still.
Rand stood up. The pistol was yet in his clasp; he swung
his arm above his head and hurled the weapon into the
stream. A pace or two away was a smooth and rounded rock
like a giant pebble. He sat down upon it, locked his hands,
and looked about him. The sky was blue, the leaves were
green, the sun shone hot, the water was at its ancient song&mdash;whence,
then, came the noxious change, and what was the
matter with the universe? Cary lay among the stones, with
head thrown back and one arm stretched out as though the
hand were pointing. The face was quiet, set in the icy beauty
of death, and young. There came a roll of thunder. Rand
looked at his clasped hands, opened them, and moved the
right one slightly to and fro. There was blood upon his
coatsleeve&mdash;a great smear. He drew a sighing breath. He felt
as a voyager might who awakened on a planet not his own
and at midnight saw the faint star where once he lived. As
yet the wonder numbed. The complete cessation of anger,
too, was confusing. There was only the plane of existence,
grey and featureless. This lasted some moments, then the
lights began to play.</p>

<p>He rose from the stone and, going to the water's edge,
knelt and tried to wash the blood from his sleeve, but without
success. He stood up with a frown. The clouds were high
above the treetops, though the sun yet shone. At a little
distance Selim was quietly grazing, the birds had returned
to their song, the squirrels to their play along the leafy boughs.
Rand looked at his watch. &quot;Twelve o'clock&mdash;twelve
o'clock.&quot; Suddenly a thought struck him. &quot;The pistol, with
my name engraved on it&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He had flung the weapon far into the water. The stream
was hardly more than a wide brook, but its bed was broken,
and above and below the little ford the water fell over ledges
into small, deep pools. Where had the pistol fallen? If into
one of these, he could not find it again. He had no time to
sound them one by one. He moved along the bank, his keen
eyes searching the water. The pistol was nowhere visible; it
must have gone into midstream, into a pool below a cascade.
If so, it might lie there, undiscovered, a thousand years. He
stood irresolute. Could he have done so, he would have
dragged the stream, but there was now no time to squander.
Once more he made certain that it lay nowhere in clear water
or near the shore, then abruptly left the search.</p>

<p>He stood in thought for another moment, then with deliberation
moved to his victim's side and looked down upon him
with a face almost as blank and still as the dead man's own.
Presently he spoke: &quot;Good-bye, Cary.&quot; The sound of his
own voice, strained and strange, hardly raised above a whisper
and yet, in the silence of this new world, more loud than
thunder, broke the spell. He uttered a strangled cry, dashed
up the strand to the grazing horse, flung himself into the
saddle, and applied the spur.</p>

<p>He and Selim did not cross the stream. His mind worked
automatically, but it was a trained mind, and knew what the
emergency demanded. He retraced the river road to a point
beyond the rock and the mountain ash, and there left it.
Once in the burned herbage under the trees, he looked back
to the road. There was rock and there was black leaf-mould.
If in the latter any hoof-prints showed confusedly, the coming
storm held promise of a pelting and obliterating rain.
He pushed into a thick-set wood, and began a desperate
ride across country. It was necessary to strike the main
road below Red Fields.</p>

<p>Their way was now dangerous enough, but he and Selim
made no stay for that. They went at speed over stock and
stone, between resinous pines, through sumach and sassafras.
Lightnings were beginning to play, and the thunder to roll
more loudly. The sunbeams were gone, the trees without
motion, the air hot and laden. Horse and man panted on.
Rand's mind made swift calculation. He had ordered Young
Isham to walk the mare. For all that time had seemed to
stop, there at the stream behind him, the minutes were no
longer than other minutes, and there had passed of them no
great number. He had ridden from the ford to the stream at
speed, and now he was going as rapidly. He would presently
reach the main road, and Young Isham would not have
passed.</p>

<p>It fell as he had foreseen. One last burst through brush
and vine and scrub and they reached the edge of the wood.
Before them through the trees he saw the main road. Rand
checked the horse. &quot;Stand a bit, Selim, while I play the
scout.&quot;</p>

<p>Dismounting, he moved with caution through a mass of
dogwood and laurel to the bank. At a distance beneath him
lay the road, bare under the storm clouds. Above and below
where he stood it was visible for some rods, and upon it
appeared neither man nor beast. He went back to Selim,
mounted, and together they made shift to descend the red
bank. As, with a noise of breaking twigs and falling earth
and stone, they reached the road, a man, hitherto hidden
by the giant bole of the oak beneath which he had sat down
to rest, rose and came round his tree to see what made the
commotion. Between the cause and the investigator was perhaps
fifty feet of road. Rand muttered an oath, then, with
a characteristic cool resolve, rode up to M. Achille Pincornet
and wished him good-day.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-day, Mr. Rand,&quot; echoed the dancing master, and
stared at the bank. &quot;Parbleu, sir! Why did you come that
way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I left my servant a little way down the road and struck
into the woods after a doe I started. I'll gallop back and
meet him now. Are you for Charlottesville, Mr. Pincornet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not to-day, sir. I have a dancing class at Red Fields.&quot;
Mr. Pincornet still stared. &quot;I would say, sir, that the chase
had been long and hard.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand laughed. &quot;Am I so torn and breathless? No, no;
it was short but rough&mdash;a few minutes and perhaps half a
mile! Well, I will rejoin my negro and we'll make for town
before the storm breaks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait here and your negro will come to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mahomet to the mountain? No; he is a sleepy-head, and
I shall find him loitering. Good-day, good-day!&quot;</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand he left the dancing master still
staring and turned Selim's head to the east. He rode quickly,
but no longer headlong, and he scanned with deliberation
the long stretch of the main road. When at last he saw that
which he sought, he backed his horse into the shadow of a
great wayside walnut, drew rein, and awaited Young Isham's
approach.</p>

<p>The boy and the mare came steadily on, moving at quickened
speed under the lowering skies. Young Isham did not
see his master until he was almost beneath the walnut tree;
when he did so, he uttered a cry and well-nigh fell from the
mare.</p>

<p>&quot;Gawd-a-moughty, marster!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand spoke without moving. &quot;Get down, Young Isham,
and come here.&quot;</p>

<p>The negro obeyed, though with shaking knees. &quot;Lawd
hab mercy, marster, whar you come f'om? I done lef' you at
de ford.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll speak to you of that presently. Whom have you
passed on the road since you left the ford? How many people
and what kind of people? Think now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ain' pass skeerce a soul, sah. Eberybody skurryin' in
f'om de storm. Jes' some niggahs wid mules, an' a passel
ob chillern, an' a man I don' know. Dey ain' stop ter speak
ter me, an I ain' stop ter speak ter dem.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand leaned from his saddle and laid the butt of his riding-whip
upon the boy's shoulder. &quot;Look at me, Young
Isham.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yaas, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did not leave me at the ford. We took the main road
together, and we've been travelling together ever since,
except that perhaps ten minutes ago I rode on ahead and
waited for you beneath this tree.&quot; He raised the whip handle
and brought it down heavily. &quot;Look at me, Young Isham,&mdash;in
the eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy whimpered. &quot;Yaas, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We crossed the ford at the mill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yaas, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And we kept on together by the main road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&mdash;Yaas, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have travelled together all the way from Richmond,
and we have travelled by the main road. Now say what I
have said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marster&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don', marster, don'! I'll say jes' what you say! We
done cross de ford an' tek de main road&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' we done keep de main road, jes' lak dis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's enough. If you forget and say the wrong thing,
Young Isham,&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don', marster! Fer de Lawd's sake, don' look at me lak
dat! I ain' gwine fergit, sah,&mdash;de Lawd Jesus know I
ain'!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand lifted the whip handle from his shoulder. &quot;Mount,
then, and come on. There's no good in idling here.&quot;</p>

<p>A few moments later they overtook and passed Mr. Pincornet,
now briskly walking, kit under arm, toward his dancing
class. They bowed in passing, and Rand, turning in his
saddle, looked back at the figure in faded finery. &quot;There's
danger there,&quot; he thought. &quot;Where isn't it now?&quot; As he
faced again toward Charlottesville, his glance fell upon Young
Isham, and he saw that the boy was looking fixedly at his
sleeve.</p>

<p>The master made no movement of avoidance. &quot;The
mare's going well enough,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;We'll draw
rein at Red Fields, and then hurry home. Use your whip and
bring her on.&quot;</p>

<p>They paused at Red Fields, then went on to the edge of
town. The forked lightnings were playing and the trees
beginning to sway. &quot;We'll stop a moment,&quot; Rand said
over his shoulder, &quot;at Mr. Mocket's.&quot;</p>

<p>Door and window of the small house where Tom and Vinie
lived were shut against the storm. Tom was yet in Richmond,
and Vinie was afraid of lightning. In the darkened
atmosphere the zinnias and marigolds up and down the path
struck a brave note of red and yellow. The grapevine on the
porch was laden with purple bunches that the rising wind
bade fair to break and scatter. Rand dismounted, with a
gesture bidding the boy to await him, entered the broken gate,
and, walking up the path between the marigolds, knocked
upon the closed door.</p>

<p>There was a sound within as of some one rising hastily,
an exclamation, and Vinie opened the door. &quot;I knew
'twas you! I just said to myself, 'That ith Mr. Rand's
knock,' and it was! Wait, thir, and I'll make the room
light.&quot;</p>

<p>She threw open the closed shutters. &quot;I'm jutht afraid of
lightning when I'm by myself. How are you, thir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well. Vinie, I want a basin of warm water and
soap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir. The kettle's on. I'll fix it in Tom's room.&quot;</p>

<p>In the bare little chamber Rand washed the blood from his
coat-sleeve. It was not easy to do, but at last the cloth was
clean. He came out of the room with the basin in his hands.
Vinie, waiting in the little hall, started forward. &quot;Open the
back door,&quot; he said, &quot;and let me throw this out.&quot; Vinie tried
to take the basin. &quot;I'll empty it, thir.&quot; Her eyes fell upon
the water. &quot;You've hurt yourself!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; answered Rand. &quot;I have not. It is nothing&mdash;a
bit of a cut that I gave myself.&quot;</p>

<p>He pushed the door open and poured out the stained water
upon the ground, then took fresh from a bucket standing by
and rinsed the basin before he set it down upon the table.
&quot;Vinie&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want a promise from you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, Mr. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've always been my good friend, ever since long ago
when you came from the little house in Richmond to this
little house in Charlottesville, and I was reading law with
Mr. Henning. Why, I don't know what I should do without
you and Tom!&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie's eyes filled. &quot;I couldn't&mdash;Tom and me couldn't&mdash;do
without you, Mr. Rand. You're our best friend, and
we'd die for you, and you know it. I'll promise you anything,
and I'll keep my promise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that you will. It's nothing more than this.
Vinie, I don't want it known that I stopped here to-day, and
I want you to forget&mdash;look at me, Vinie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to forget what I asked you for, and what I
did in Tom's room.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir,&quot; said Vinie, with large eyes. &quot;And that you
cut yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That, too. Everything, Vinie, except that, coming along
the main road, I stopped a moment at the gate to say how
d'ye do, and to tell you that Tom would be at home in two
or three days. That is all, and my coming into the house
and the rest of it never was. Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't say anything at all, thir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a promise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir. I promise.&quot;</p>

<p>They went out into the porch together. &quot;Ithn't there
anything else?&quot;</p>

<p>Rand, studying in silence the clouds and the whirling dust,
had started down the step or two to the path between the
marigolds. He paused. &quot;I can't think of anything, Vinie&quot;;
then, after a moment, and very oddly, &quot;Would you give me,
once more, a cup of cool water?&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie brought it in her hand. &quot;You always thaid this
water washed the dust off clean.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand drank, and gave back the cup. &quot;Thank you. I'll
go on now. How your vine has borne this year!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth. I'm going to make some wine this week. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>Her visitor passed through the little yard, between the vivid
flowers. At the gate he turned his head. &quot;Tom is really
coming, Vinie, in two or three days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, thir,&quot; said Vinie. &quot;I'll be mighty glad to see him.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand mounted, and he and Young Isham rode away.
Vinie stood upon the porch and watched them as far as the
turn in the road. A gust of hot wind blew against her, ruffling
her calico dress and lifting light tendrils of hair from her
forehead and neck. In the southwest the lightning flashed
fiercely and there came a crash of thunder. Vinie uttered
a startled cry, clapped her hands to her ears, and ran into
the house.</p>

<p>Rand rode through a portion of the main street of Charlottesville.
He kept the pace of a man who wishes to be at
home before the rain falls, but his manner of going showed
no undue haste and no trepidation. Faces at doors and windows,
men gathered before the Eagle and the post-office,
greeted him. He answered each salute in kind, and at the
Eagle drew rein long enough to reply to the inevitable questions
as to Richmond and the trial, and to agree that the
rain was needed, since the main road, from Bates's Mill on,
was nothing but a trough of dust.</p>

<p>&quot;That's so,&quot; chimed in one. &quot;If it wasn't so rough, the
river road would be pleasanter travelling. There's the first
drop!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand looked up at the clouds. &quot;I'll gallop on, gentlemen.
A rain is coming that will lay the dust.&quot;</p>

<p>Once upon the road to Roselands, neither horse nor mare
was spared. Rand travelled at speed beneath an inky sky.
At the turn to Greenwood he looked once toward the distant
house, half hidden by mighty oaks. It was no more
than once. He had a vision of a riderless horse, tearing away
from a stream, through the woods, and he thought, &quot;How
soon?&quot; He drew a difficult breath, and he put for a moment
his hand before his eyes, then spurred Selim on, and in
a little while came within sight of his own gates.</p>

<h3>HUSBAND AND WIFE</h3>


<p>As he rode up the drive, he saw Jacqueline waiting for
him, a gleam of white upon the grey doorstone, beyond
the wind-tossed beech. He dismounted, sent
Young Isham around with the horses, and walked across the
burned grass. She met him with outstretched arms, beneath
the beech tree. &quot;Lewis, Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>He held her to him, bent back her face, kissed her brow
and eyes and mouth. There was a wild energy in clasp and
touch. &quot;You love me still?&quot; he cried. &quot;That's true&mdash;that's
true, Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know&mdash;you know it's true! I was born only to
love you&mdash;and I thought that you would never come!&quot;</p>

<p>The thunder crashed above them, and the advance of the
rain was heard upon the beech leaves. &quot;Come indoors&mdash;come
out of the storm!&quot; She drew his hand that she held
to her and laid it on her bosom. &quot;Oh, welcome home, my
dear!&quot;</p>

<p>They went together into the house and into their own
chamber. The windows were dark with the now furious
rain, but a light fire burned upon the hearth. Rand stood
looking down upon it. His wife watched him, her arms resting
upon the back of a great flowered chair. Suddenly she
spoke. &quot;Lewis, what is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>He half turned toward her. &quot;I believed that you would see.
And yet you were blind to that earlier course of mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something dreadful is the matter. Tell me at once.&quot;</p>

<p>After a moment he repeated sombrely, &quot;'At once.' How
can I tell you at once? There are things that are slowly
brought about by all time, and to show them as they truly
are would require all time again. How can I tell you at all?
My God!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel,&quot; she answered, &quot;years older than I did two weeks
ago. If there was something then to forgive, I have forgiven
it. Our souls did not come together to share only the lit
paths, the honey in the cup. Tell me, Lewis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is black and bitter&mdash;there is no light, and it will kill
the sweetness. If I could live with you and you never know
it, I would try to do so&mdash;try to keep it secret from you as I
did that lesser thing. I cannot&mdash;even now, without a word,
you know in part.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me all&mdash;<i>that lesser thing</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand turned from the fire and, coming to the great chair
against whose back she leaned, knelt in its flowered lap and
bowed his forehead upon her hands. &quot;I am glad,&quot; he said,
in a voice so low that she bent to hear it,&mdash;&quot;I am glad now
that I have no son.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence while the rain dashed against the window-panes
and the thunder rolled overhead; then Jacqueline
pressed her cheek against his bowed head. &quot;What have you
done?&quot; she whispered. &quot;Tell me&mdash;oh, tell me!&quot;</p>

<p>After a moment he told her. &quot;I have killed a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Killed&mdash;It was by accident!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. It was not accident. I came upon him by accident&mdash;I'll
claim no more than that. The black rage was there to
blind me, make me deaf&mdash;mole and adder! But it was not
accident, what I did. I'll not cheat you here, and I'll not
cheat myself. The name of it is murder.&quot;</p>

<p>He felt her hands quiver beneath his forehead, and he
put up his own and clasped her wrist. &quot;Are you thinking,
'I should have left him in the tobacco-fields'? As for me,
I know that I ought never to have spoken to you there beneath
the apple tree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis, who was the man?&quot;</p>

<p>He made no answer, and after a moment or two, numbed
and grey, had passed, she needed none. The truth fell like a
stroke from glowing iron. With a cry she dragged her hands
from Rand's, left the chair, and, crossing the room, flung
herself down beside the chintz-covered couch and cowered
there with a hidden face. Rand arose and, walking to the
window, stared at the veil of rain and the stabbing lightning.
The clock ticked, a log upon the hearth parted with a soft
sound, from the back of the house came faintly the homely
cheer of the servants' voices. How deadly, how solemnly
still, how wet and cold, was now a rocky strand upon the
river road! He left the window and, coming to the couch,
looked down upon the crouching figure of his wife. His brain
was not numbed; it was pitilessly awake, and he suffered.
The name of his star was Wormwood.</p>

<p>At last she stirred, lifted her head from her arm, and
arose, moving stiffly and slowly as though she had grown old.
Her face was drawn and colorless. She moved, mechanically,
to the fire, laid fresh wood upon it, and, taking a small broom
from the corner, made the hearth clean; then, returning, sat
down upon the couch that was printed with bright roses and
held out her hands. &quot;Come,&quot; she said, in her low, musical
voice. &quot;Come, tell me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He sank upon his knees beside her and bowed his head
upon her lap. &quot;Jacqueline, Jacqueline! I rode away from
Richmond, in black anger&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He told her all, now speaking with a forced and hard
deliberation, now with a broken and strangled voice, short
words and short sentences&mdash;at the last, monosyllables.</p>

<p>When the tale was done, they stayed for a little, motionless.
There was yet bright lightning with long peals of thunder,
and the rain beat with passion against the panes. Jacqueline
moistened her ups, tried to speak, at last found a broken
and uncertain voice. &quot;You left him&mdash;lying there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The horse broke away&mdash;ran on through the wood. It
will have been caught ere now, or it will make its way to
Greenwood. Is Fairfax Cary at home?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He came last night. He was at Fontenoy this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand stood up. &quot;It is done, and all the rueing in the world
will not make the breath alight again.&quot; With a gesture,
singular and decided, he walked to the window and again
looked out at the rain and lightning. &quot;If I know&mdash;if I know
Fairfax Cary&mdash;Has the horse been captured&mdash;and where?
It may be known now, and it may not be known for hours.&quot;
He stood, reviewing chances, and the shaken soul began to
settle to its ancient base. At last he turned. &quot;There's danger
enough, but the struggle must be made. If you love me still,
I'll find the heart to make it; ay, and to succeed!&quot; Coming
back to her, he took her in his arms. &quot;You do love me?
That isn't dead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, Lewis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, by God, I'll fight it out! Jacqueline, Jacqueline&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She presently freed herself. &quot;What are you going to do&mdash;what
are you going to do now, Lewis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell you what I have done, and where the danger's
greatest&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The danger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The danger of discovery.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis&mdash;will you not tell them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell them&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it not&mdash;oh, Lewis, is it not the only thing to do? Sin
and suffering&mdash;yes, yes, the whole world sins and suffers!
But oh, ignoble to sin and to reject the suffering!&quot;</p>

<p>He stared at her incredulously. &quot;Do you know, Jacqueline,&mdash;do
you know what you are saying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will it be so hard?&quot; she asked, and put out her arms to
him. &quot;It is right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me understand,&quot; he said. &quot;When the mist cleared
and I saw him lying there, I sat down upon a stone, and I
said to myself, 'This is a strange land, and I am to eat the
fruits thereof.' For a while I did not think of moving. You
would have had me stay there as he stayed, watch there
beside him until men came?&quot;</p>

<p>She answered almost inaudibly, &quot;It had been nobler.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then and there to have given myself up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis, if it was right&mdash;I would have said to God and
the world and him, 'It is the least that I can do!'&quot;</p>

<p>He stared at her. &quot;By God, the <i>amende honorable!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>There came blinding lightning, followed by thunder which
seemed to shake the room. Rand crossed to the hearth and,
with his booted foot upon the iron dogs, rested his arm upon
the mantel-shelf and his head upon his hand. &quot;I'll think of
that awhile,&quot; he said harshly. &quot;That means disgrace and
may mean death.&quot;</p>

<p>He heard the drawing of her breath. There was a knock at
the door followed by Mammy Chloe's voice. &quot;De bread an'
meat an' wine on de table, marster.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, Mammy, I'll come presently,&quot; the master
answered; then, when she was gone, &quot;This is the earth,
Jacqueline. It was long while I sat there upon the stone
and saw matters as they might be upon another plane, but
that appearance passed. Because for those moments I saw
its shape, I know the aspect that is before your eyes. But it
is not reality that you see; it is an appearance, thin and
unsubstantial as the mist upon the hills. Expiation, purgation,
aided retribution, the criminal to spare Justice the search,
and the offender against Society to turn and throw his weight
into the proper scale!&mdash;that is a dream of the world as it
may become. This is the present earth,&mdash;earth of the
tobacco-fields, earth of the struggle, earth of the fight for
standing-room! I have fought&mdash;and I have fought&mdash;I cannot
cease to fight.&quot;</p>

<p>With his foot he pushed back the burning wood. &quot;I did
not kill him in self-defence. I killed him in anger. That is
murder. Say, for argument, that it is confessed murder. I
will tell you, as a lawyer, what that means. It means a full
stop. Life stopped, work stopped, fame stopped&mdash;a period
black as ink, and never to be erased! A stop deep as the
grave and sharp as the hangman's drop, and the record
that it closes empty, vile, read at the best with horror and
pity, read at the worst with a glance aside at every man and
woman whom the stained hand had ever touched! That is
what would come if I followed this appearance.&quot; He struck
the hand at which he looked against the mantel-shelf. &quot;And
if he says, 'Ay, Lewis Rand, it is so that I would do,' I will
answer, 'Yes! being you!&mdash;but what, Ludwell Cary, had
you lain in my cradle?&quot; His face worked and he turned
from the mantel to the great chair. &quot;Oh, <i>mother!</i>&quot; he said
beneath his breath.</p>

<p>Jacqueline came and knelt beside him. &quot;Lewis, Lewis,
is it all so dark?&quot;</p>

<p>He touched her hair with his fingers. &quot;Dark! I feel as
though I were in a bare, light place. Underground, you
know, but bare and flooded with light. Well, Jacqueline,
well&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She clung to him without speech, and he went on. &quot;There
is enough to create suspicion. We were travelling at the
same hour, and it is known that we were opponents. The
crossroads where I slept last night&mdash;there was nothing,
I think, said at the inn. Then the forge, and the mill. At
the mill they will swear to telling me that he took the main
road, and since they could not see the ford, they must suppose
that I, too, went that way. The main road. There's the insistence.
I kept to the main road. As for Young Isham, I
can manage him. That old Frenchman is more difficult.
Danger there&mdash;unless he holds his tongue. There's a witness
indeed lying at the bottom of some pool below the
strand, but the strand may sink into the sea before that witness
is found! There is this and there is that, but they'll serve
no warrant on the this and that the world can see. I have
won more difficult cases.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You propose,&quot; she cried, &quot;to lie&mdash;and lie&mdash;and lie!&quot;</p>

<p>After a moment he answered, with bitterness, &quot;I am not
unreasonable. I do not match white with black. The dyer's
hand accepts the hue it works in. I'll not win rest, forgiveness,
sleep! But, by God, I'll keep what men care for. I'll
keep strength and reputation, name, and room to work a
lever in! Ay, and I'll not endure the world to say, 'This was
his friend, and that his lover; look how they are stained!'
O God, O God!&quot;</p>

<p>She put her arms around him. &quot;There is no stain! I will
forever love you. Love casts off soil as it casts out fear. Will
you not come with me&mdash;and tell them?&quot;</p>

<p>He sat for some minutes, still in her clasp, then, leaning
forward, took her face in his hands and kissed her on the
brow. &quot;No!&quot; he said, with finality.</p>

<p>Another moment and he arose. &quot;I am hungry. I have not
eaten since daybreak. As for sleep&mdash;I don't know when
I slept. It is not only the darkness of the storm; it is growing
late. I think that we will hear nothing to-night. We will
sleep, and I need it.&quot; He moved to a table and took up
the pair of holsters which, on entering, he had laid there
In a corner of the room stood a heavy chest of drawers. He
placed the holsters in one of these, locked the drawer, and
withdrew the key. &quot;I'll think that out,&quot; he muttered, &quot;just
as soon as may be,&quot; then turned again to his wife. &quot;I'll go
now and get some meat and wine. Stay here by the fire,
Jacqueline, and try to see that all this must be fought, and
fought as I have said! Think of yourself, and think of Deb,
Unity, your uncles&mdash;at last you will come to see that there
is no other way.&quot;</p>

<p>He was gone. Jacqueline dragged herself from the chair
to the hearth, sank down before the glowing logs, and saw at
once a picture of the river road.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>She had been lying throughout the night almost without
motion, but toward three o'clock he was aware that she had
left the bed. A moment, and he heard the tap of her slippers
across the polished floor of the chamber, the hail, and the
dining-room. She paused, he could tell, at the sideboard;
when, presently, she slipped again into bed, she was trembling
violently. He turned and put his arms about her. &quot;I am so
cold,&quot; she said. &quot;It is cold indoors and out-of-doors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have brought you misery,&quot; he answered, and then lay
in silence.</p>

<p>They heard the clock ticking, and the sighing of the branches
after the storm. For awhile she was quiet within his clasp,
then the shuddering recommenced. He arose, put on his
dressing-gown, and, going to the fireplace where the logs yet
smouldered, threw on light wood and built a cheerful fire,
then took her in his arms and carried her to the great chair
of flowered chintz, set in the light of the dancing flames.
&quot;The wine will warm you. Look, too, what a fire I have
made!&quot;</p>

<p>She still shuddered, staring over her shoulder. &quot;Draw
the blinds closer. There's a sound as of some one sighing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is the wind in the beech leaves.&quot;</p>

<p>She put an arm across her eyes. &quot;How long is he to lie
there, stretched out upon the wet rocks, beside the stream?
Oh, heartless!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The storm and darkness have made it long. He will be
found this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He never was your enemy, Lewis. You thought him that,
but he never was, he never was!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to tell you,&quot; he said, &quot;that all rage is dead. I feel
as though I had left anger far behind, and why there was in
my mind so great venom and rancour I no longer know.
Envy and jealousy, too, are gone. They have been struck
out of life, and other things have come to take their place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; she cried, &quot;what other things! O God, O God!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, while the wind sighed in the
beech tree and the fire muttered on the hearth. Jacqueline
sat in the flowered chair, her raised arms resting upon its
back, her head buried in her arms. Rand, leaning against the
mantel, gazed with sombre eyes at her strained and motionless
form. As he stood there, his mind began to move through
the galleries where she was painted. He saw her, a child,
beneath the apple tree, and in her blue gown that day in the
Fontenoy garden, and then again beneath the apple tree, a
child no longer, but the woman whom he loved. He saw her
face above him the afternoon they laid him in the blue room,
and he saw her singing to her harp in the Fontenoy drawing-room,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The thirst that from the soul doth rise&mdash;&quot;</p></div>

<p>He saw the next morning&mdash;the summer-house, the box, the
mockingbird in the poplar tree, the Seven Sisters rose&mdash;and
then their marriage eve, and that fair first summer on
the Three-Notched Road, and all the three years of their
wedded life. The picture of her was everywhere, and not
least in the house on Shockoe Hill. He saw her as she had
been one snowy evening in February, and he saw her as she
had looked the hour of his return from Williamsburgh&mdash;the
pleading, the passion, and the beauty. And now&mdash;now&mdash;</p>

<p>The wind sighed again without the windows, and Jacqueline
drew a shuddering breath. He spoke. &quot;Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>She moved slightly. &quot;Yes, Lewis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The night is quiet, after the storm. He lies at rest beside
the stream. This morning he will be found, lifted tenderly,
lamented, mourned. It is not a gruesome place. I remember
trees and fluttering birds. He sleeps&mdash;he sleeps&mdash;like
Duncan he sleeps well at last. Is he to be so pitied?&quot;</p>

<p>She moaned, &quot;Yes&mdash;but you also, you also! Oh, break,
break!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, Jacqueline. It lacks but an hour of dawn. When
it is day, you may give me up. Rouse Joab and send for the
sheriff and your uncles and for Fairfax Cary. I will dress
and await them in the library. Indeed, you may do it now&mdash;there's
no need to wait for dawn.&quot;</p>

<p>She rose from her chair and went the length of the room,
resting at last, with raised arms and covered face, against
the farthest window. He spoke on. &quot;If all thought alike,
Jacqueline, if all saw action and consequence with one vision&mdash;but
we do not so, no, not on this earth! You and I are
sundered there. Perhaps it is to my shame that it is so,&mdash;I
cannot tell. What you asked for this afternoon, that confession,
that decision, that accord with justice and acceptance
of penalty, I cannot give freely and of conviction, Jacqueline.
Why did you think I had that exaltation of mind? I
have it not; no, nor one man in five hundred thousand! The
man I&mdash;murdered&mdash;perhaps possessed it; indeed, I
think that he did. But I&mdash;I do not own it, nor can I see
matters with another's vision. I see a struggle to prevent
disgrace and disaster, to retrieve and hold an endangered
standing-room&mdash;a struggle determined and legitimate. I
am capable of making it. But though I'll avow that another
man's vision transcends mine, I'll dispute with him the
power of loving! I love you with a passion as deep, strong,
and abiding as if I, too, walked in that rarer air. I am of
the earth and rooted in the earth, but I love you utterly.
If you want this thing, I will give it to you. It was unmanly
of me to say but now, 'You may do this, you may do that,
and I will not lift a finger to prevent you.' I will not leave it
to you, Jacqueline. I will awaken Joab and send him with
a note to your uncles.&quot;</p>

<p>He moved toward the door, but before he could reach it
his wife was before him, her weight thrown against him,
her raised hands thrusting him back to the hearth. She
shook her head, and her long hair shadowed her; she strove
for utterance, but could find only a strangled &quot;No&mdash;no&quot;;
then, still clinging to him, she slipped to her knees and so to
her face, and lay there in a swoon in the red zone of the
firelight.</p>

<h3>THE BROTHERS</h3>


<p>At Fontenoy the deluging rain and pitchy blackness of
the night sufficiently warranted Colonel Dick's assertion
that it was an evening for a sensible man to
stay where he was, and that a bowl of punch and wedding-talk
and Unity at the harpsichord were to be preferred to a
progress to Greenwood through such a downpour and a foot
of mud. Ludwell!&mdash;Ludwell wouldn't be there anyway.
He was a man of sense and would be sleeping at Red Fields,
if indeed he had ever left Malplaquet. Fairfax Cary was
persuaded, and after a very happy evening in the drawing-room,
went to bed and to sleep in the blue room.</p>

<p>Dressing, next morning, he gazed around him. The room
was familiar to him, and he had a liking for it, from the
mandarin on the screen to General Washington on the wall.
The storm had passed away early in the night, and it was
now a lovely morning, clear-washed, fresh, and fragrant.
He looked out of the window toward the blue hills, and
down into the garden where autumn flowers were in bloom,
and as he dressed he hummed an air that Unity had sung.</p>

<p>
&quot;Give me pleasure, give me pain,<br />
Give me wine of life again!<br />
Death is night without a morn,<br />
Give the rose and give the thorn.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>Downstairs he found Miss Dandridge and Major Edward
upon the wide porch. The wind had torn away a great
bough from one of the poplars, and Colonel Dick and Deb
upon the drive below were superintending its removal. Birds
were singing, delicate airs astir. &quot;It's going to be the divinest
day!&quot; said Unity, and led the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Breakfast went happily on with talk of politics, county
affairs, and now and then from Colonel Dick a sly allusion
to the approaching marriage. The meal was nearly over
when old Cato, coming in from the hail, said something in
a low voice to his master. Colonel Churchill pushed back
his chair. &quot;Excuse me a moment, Unity, my dear. There's
a man wants to see me.&quot;</p>

<p>He left the room. Fairfax Cary and Major Edward continued
a discussion of the latest Napoleonic victory; Unity
played with her spoon and thought of her wedding-gown;
Deb drank her glass of milk and planned a visit with Miranda
to a blasted pine tree, lived in, all the quarter agreed, by
a ha'nt that came out at night, like a ring of smoke out of
a great black pipe!</p>

<p>Colonel Dick's figure appeared for an instant in the doorway.
&quot;Edward, come here a moment, will you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A thousand hussars, and the thing went off like flaming
tinder,&quot; finished Major Edward. He laid down his napkin
and arose. &quot;Excuse me, Unity. Very well, Dick,&quot; and left
the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Unity,&quot; enquired Deb. &quot;Are there any ha'nts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, honey, no!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just make believe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just make believe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Deb, and fell to wondering if the ha'nt
would come out if only she and Miranda sat long enough
before the tree. It might get hungry.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you have another cup?&quot; asked Unity of the guest,
her hand upon the coffee-urn. &quot;No? Then let us go and
see what is the matter. They are not coming back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want,&quot; whispered Fairfax Cary, as they left the table,
&quot;to talk to you about&mdash;about two weeks from now. Don't
you think it would be sweet and shady this morning, under
the catalpa tree?&quot;</p>

<p>He managed to touch her hand, and she turned her velvety
eyes upon him with both laughter and moisture in
their black depths. &quot;I've chosen the place for Unity Dandridge's
grave. Would you like to see it? It's underneath
the flowering almond.&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary glanced behind him. The servants were out
of the room; Deb was gathering crumbs for the birds. &quot;Give
me one kiss! If you knew how much I love you! The world's
tuned to-day just to that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Such an old tune! The world has other things to think
of and other airs than that!&quot;</p>

<p>They went out into the hail. It was empty, but through the
open doors voices sounded from the porch at the back of the
house. Another moment and Major Edward appeared, stood
still at the sight of Cary, then came on up the hall to meet
the two. He looked intensely grey and meagre, and his thin
lips twitched. &quot;Fairfax,&quot; he said,&mdash;&quot;Fairfax, look here&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The other, who had been laughing, grew suddenly grave.
&quot;I have never heard you, sir, use a voice like that. Has
anything happened?&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward made a little noise in his throat, then
stiffened himself as if on parade. &quot;There may have been an
accident. It looks that way, Fair. It was Eli who came.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eli! What has happened at Greenwood? Ludwell's
home?</p>

<p>&quot;Unity, my dear,&quot; said the Major, &quot;let him come with
me. Let's go into the library, Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>But Fairfax Cary was halfway down the hail. The Major
hastened after him, and at the porch door laid a thin old
hand upon the other's arm. &quot;Fair, my boy, you are going
to need all a man's courage. Think of Dick and me as of
Fauquier Cary's&mdash;as of your father's&mdash;old, old friend
Come, now.&quot;</p>

<p>They found on the square porch at the back of the house,
Colonel Churchill, the negro Eli, and a white man, roughly
dressed. The first, seated on the steps, his elbows on his
knees and his face in his hands, looked up with a gasp.
&quot;Fair, Fair&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Cary spoke with steadiness &quot;What has brought you here,
Eli? Mr. Ludwell came home last night?&quot;</p>

<p>Eli, trembling violently, and of the ashen hue that a
negro takes in terror, tried to answer, but at first there came
only jabbered and meaningless words. He fell on his knees,
and finally became coherent. &quot;Marse Fair&mdash;Marse Fair&mdash;ain'
I done lif' you bofe in dese ahms w'en you wuz jes'
little fellers&mdash;he er lot de oldes' an' you nuttin' but er baby,
toddlin' after him eberywhar he went! Ain' I done ride behin'
you bofe dese yeahs an' yeahs? Oh, Gawd-a-moughty!
O Lawd, hab mercy&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Cary took him by the shoulder. &quot;Eli, stop that crying out
and tell me at once what is the matter! What has happened
to Mr. Ludwell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell you, Fair,&quot; answered the Major, in a shaking
voice. &quot;The negro can't do it. Ludwell did not come home
last night, and this morning James Wilson, here, found
Saladin&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Far up the river road, near my house,&quot; said the man
upon the steps. &quot;'Twas just about daybreak. I didn't
know, sir, whose horse he was, so I put him in my stable.
Then my son and me and Joe White, a neighbour of mine,
we set out down the river road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, <i>my</i> young marster! Oh, <i>my</i> young marster!&quot;
wailed Eli. &quot;De kindes' an' de bes'! Oh, Lawd hab mercy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was just dawn, sir, and we went down the road&mdash;we
were on horseback&mdash;quite a good bit of miles. There
wasn't any sign until we came to where Indian Run crosses
the road; but on the further side, where there's a strip of
rocks, you know, sir&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The speaker stopped short. &quot;They found him there,
Fair,&quot; finished Major Edward.</p>

<p>The young man turned squarely to the old. &quot;Thank you,
sir. You are the man for me. Was he&mdash;is he badly hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's nothing can ever hurt him more, my dear. It
is you, and we with you, who must suffer now. They found
him&mdash;they found him dead, Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence; then, &quot;Ludwell&mdash;Ludwell dead?&quot;
said Cary. &quot;I don't believe you, Major Churchill.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned, walked to a bench that ran along the wall,
and sat down. &quot;Eli, get up from there and stop that camp-meeting
wailing! Mr. Wilson, you perhaps do not yet know
my brother's horse&mdash;black with a white star. Colonel Dick,
they've got hold of the wrong end of some damned rigmarole or
other&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know the horse, sir,&quot; replied Wilson, not without
gentleness, &quot;for I've been out of the county for a long
time, and your brother used to ride a bay. But I knew your
brother, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I said, too, Fair,&quot; groaned Colonel Churchill
from the steps. &quot;I said it was all a damned mistake. But
I was wrong. You listen to Edward. Edward, tell him all!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Dick. It is true, Fair, damnably, devilishly true.
He had been dead for hours, Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joe White's something of a doctor, sir,&quot; put in Wilson.
&quot;Joe said he would have been lying there since before the
storm.&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary drew a gasping breath &quot;Lying there,
suffering, through the storm and darkness? Thrown? Ill
and fallen from his horse? Major Edward, don't play with
me!&quot; He started up. &quot;Where is he now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We left him there, sir, just as he was, with Joe White to
guard him. My son, he undertook to rouse the nearest people.
I happened to know, sir, that the sheriff was staying overnight
near Red Fields, and I sent him there first. I told
the coroner myself, and then I came as hard as I could
ride to Greenwood, where I heard that you were here&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was thought best not to move him at once, Fair. They
are intelligent men, and they were right.&quot; The Major's
hand closed around the other's wrist. &quot;He did not suffer,
Fair. He was not thrown. He was shot&mdash;shot through the
heart!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And there, by God,&quot; came from the steps Colonel Dick's
deep voice, &quot;there, at least, there's something to be done!
But oh, my poor boy, my poor boy!&quot;</p>

<p>Unity came from the doorway, took her lover's hands, and
pressed them to her lips. &quot;Fair,&quot; she whispered, &quot;Fair!&quot;</p>

<p>He kissed her on the forehead. &quot;There, dear! We won't
sit under the catalpa tree this morning. Eli! get the horses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have been ordered, Fair,&quot; said the Colonel. &quot;We'll
go together, you and Edward and I.&quot;</p>

<p>The little rocky strand above the stream upon the river
road lay half in sun and half in shade. After the storm the
air was crystal. Birds sang in the forest trees, and the
stream laughed as it slid over ledges into deep pools. The
sky was blue, the day brilliant, a cool wind rustled through
the laurels, and the wet earth sent out odours of mould
and trodden leaf. Perhaps a score of men and boys, engaged
in excited talk and in as close a scrutiny of one quiet figure
as a line which the sheriff had drawn would permit, turned
at the sound of rapid hoofs and watched the Churchills
and Fairfax Cary, with Wilson and Eli, come down to the
stream.</p>

<p>&quot;Back, all of you, men!&quot; ordered the sheriff, in a low
voice. &quot;That is Mr. Fairfax Cary&quot;; then turned to a spectator
or two of importance: &quot;Mr. Morris, Mr. Page&mdash;I hope
you'll be so good as to meet them with me? This is a dreadful
thing!&quot;</p>

<p>The Fontenoy party splashed through Indian Run and
dismounted. It was not an ungentle people, and the little
strand, from the woods to the water, was now free from intruding
figures. Only the sheriff, the coroner, and the two
planters, old friends and neighbours, remained, and these
joined the Churchills. Fairfax Cary walked alone to his
brother's side and stood, looking down.</p>

<p>Ludwell Cary lay peacefully. One arm was outstretched,
the head a little back, the face quiet, with nothing in it of
wrath or fear or pain. The storm had not hurt him. There
was little disarray. It was much as though he had thrown
himself down there, beside the water, with a sigh for the
pleasure of rest. The younger Cary waited motionless for
the blood to come back to his heart and the mist before his
eyes to clear. It cleared; he saw plainly his brother, guide,
and friend, and with a cry he flung himself down and across
the body.</p>

<p>The men at the water's edge turned away their faces. The
rudest unit of the small throng beneath the trees put up
a sudden hand and removed his cap, and his example was
followed. It had been a known thing, the comradeship of
these brothers, and there were few in the county more loved
than the Carys.</p>

<p>Moments passed. The sheriff spoke in a low voice to Mr.
Morris, whereupon the latter whispered to Colonel Churchill.
&quot;Edward,&quot; said the Colonel, &quot;time's being lost. Hadn't
you better try to get him away?&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward moved along the bank to the two forms and
stood in silence, gazing with twitching lips at the dead man's
countenance, so impassive, cold, remote, alien now from all
interests of this flesh, quite indifferent to love or to hate,
supremely careless as to whether his story were ever told.
The Major put his hand to his fierce old eagle eyes, and took
it away wet with tears, slow, acrid, and difficult. He stooped
and touched the living man. &quot;Fair,&mdash;come, Fair!&quot;</p>

<p>The other moved slightly, but did not offer to rise. Major
Edward waited, then touched him again. &quot;Fair, we want
to mark closely how he lies, and then we want to take him
to Greenwood. He has been here long, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>His words elicited only a low groan, but presently Cary
lifted himself from the body, remained for a moment upon
his knees, then rose to his feet. &quot;Yes, to Greenwood,&quot; he
said. &quot;He lay here last night in the wind and rain, and I
was warm and happy&mdash;I was asleep and dreaming! Why
did I leave him at Elm Tree? If I had been with him&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>His face changed, startlingly. He stooped with rapidity,
looked at and touched the dark stain upon the coat, straightened
himself, and turned violently upon the Major and the
little group which had now approached. &quot;Who?&quot; he demanded
in a voice that rose to a hoarse cry. &quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Churchill answered him. &quot;We don't know, Fair,
but by the living God, we'll find out!&quot; and the sheriff,
&quot;We've no clue yet, sir, but if 'twas plain murder&mdash;and
it looks that way, for your brother wasn't armed&mdash;then I
reckon the man who did it will as soon find his ease in hell
as in old Virginia!&quot;</p>

<p>The farmer who had been first upon the ground spoke from
the edge of the group. &quot;I never heard a soul in this county
say a hard word of Mr. Cary. I shouldn't ha' thought, barring
politics, that he had an enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha!&quot; said Major Edward, but not loudly.</p>

<p>The sheriff spoke again. &quot;Mr. Fairfax Cary, we've got
a kind of litter here, made of branches, and we'd best be
going on. The sooner the law has its hand on this, the
better. Shall we lift him now, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>All were by this time gathered about the form on the earth,
and the throng at the edge of the wood had also come nearer.
Fairfax Cary, who had looked at each speaker in turn, now
again bent his eyes upon his brother. That still figure, so
fixed, so uncaring in the midst of harsh emotion, had apparently
no accusation to make, was there only to state the all-inclusive
fact, &quot;I am in death, who, yesterday, could move
and speak, could feel joy and grief, like you and these.&quot;</p>

<p>The little knot of men, who had been gazing at the dead
as at the chief actor in a drama, began to look, instead, at
Fairfax Cary, and to look the more steadily for their first
glance. They saw a curious thing; they witnessed a transformation.
Had he, like Proteus, slipped before their eyes into
another shape, the vital change had hardly been more marked.
He had been, even this morning, a young man, handsome and
gallant, with a bright eye, a most happy manner, a charm and
spirit wholly admirable. All Albemarle knew and liked him
under that aspect. The men about him had seen grief and
horror and rage, each exhibited strongly out of a strong nature.
They now saw, from out of youth and the war of emotions,
the man emerge. He came slowly but steadfastly, a man
with a set purpose, which he was like to pursue through life.
The growth of years took place almost at once, though
not the growth that would have been but for this releasing
stroke. Latencies in the backward and abysm of inheritance
that would not have stirred under a less tremendous stimulus
stirred under this, grew, and pushed aside the gay and
even life that might have been. The growth was rapid and
visible, as visible the sharp turn from every former shining
goal to one which, an hour before, the runner had not seen.
The men who watched him somewhat held their breath.</p>

<p>The change that was wrought was profound. The man
who was stretched upon the earth looked now the younger
of the two. He seemed also to have given something of
the calmness of his state, for Fairfax Cary no longer grieved
with voice or gesture or convulsion of feature. He was quiet,
pale, and resolute, and he now spoke to the sheriff evenly
enough. &quot;Yes, Mr. Garrett, we'll take him home. Where
is the litter?&quot;</p>

<p>Four men brought it forward. Ludwell Cary was lifted
by his brother and Colonel Churchill and laid reverently
upon the stretcher of branches where the green leaves nodded
above his quiet face. The little procession formed and, with
the younger Cary walking beside the litter, crossed the shallow
ford and moved slowly up the winding river road.</p>

<h3>GREENWOOD</h3>


<p>The murder, by an unknown hand, of Ludwell Cary,
shot through the heart, beside Indian Run, as he
rode from Malplaquet to Greenwood, became the
overwhelming topic of interest in Albemarle, and a chief
subject far and wide throughout the great state. His kinsmen
and connections were numerous, and he had himself been
a man widely known, by many greatly liked, and by a few
well loved. There arose from town and country a cry of grief
and wrath, a great wave of sympathy for the one man left of
all the Greenwood Carys, solitary now in the old brick house
behind the line of oaks, and a loud demand for the speedy discovery
and apprehension of the murderer. Indignation was
high, the Court House and the Court House yard crowded on
the morning of the inquest, the verdict brought in by the coroner's
jury received by the county at large with incredulous
disappointment. Death at the hands of a person unknown.</p>

<p>No evidence was produced in the court room which threw
any clear light upon the commission of the deed, its motive,
or its perpetrator. There were ample accounts of the capture
of the horse, the finding of the body, its position, and the
nature of the wound,&mdash;medical opinion in addition that
death had been instantaneous, and probably received before
the breaking of the storm. If there had been any telltale
track or mark in the soil of the river road, the continued and
beating rain had made the way impossible to read. Witnesses
from Malplaquet told of Ludwell Cary's setting forth that
morning, and Forrest, the blacksmith, vouched for his passing
the forge, alone. Men from the mill at the ford swore to
his pausing to answer their questions as to the trial of Aaron
Burr, and to his riding on&mdash;by the main road. Here arose
the confusion. They were certain that Mr. Cary had taken
the main road. They thought so then, and they did not see
yet how they were mistaken. They told the next man who
came riding by that he had taken that road&mdash;the main road.
It was not the next man,&mdash;boatmen and others had passed
going up country,&mdash;but when Mr. Rand came up, they told
him that Mr. Cary was on the road before him&mdash;the main
road. Yes, sir, it was Mr. Rand and his negro boy, and he
could speak for it that Mr. Cary was supposed to be riding to
Greenwood by the usual road&mdash;the main road. The river
road was after all very little shorter, and everybody knew that
it was mortal bad.</p>

<p>Lewis Rand was called. He testified that he had left Richmond
upon the third, having with him a negro boy known
as Young Isham. The night of the sixth he had slept at the
Cross Roads Tavern and gone on the next morning, passing
Malplaquet about nine. His horse loosening a shoe, he
stopped at Forrest's forge, and there learned from the smith
that there was considerable travel, and that Mr. Cary of
Greenwood had passed some time before. &quot;You remember,
Forrest? I asked you if Mr. Cary had mentioned which
road he would take at the ford, and you answered that he
had not, but that you supposed the main road the other
had been very bad all summer. Again, at the mill below the
ford where I paused to ask for water, the miller, remarking
on the travel home from Richmond, informed me that Mr.
Cary had passed not long before. I asked him which road
Mr. Cary had taken, the main road or the river road. He
answered&mdash;or the men behind him answered, I cannot now
remember which&mdash;'The main road.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, that's what we said, and what we thought,&quot; interjected
the miller.</p>

<p>&quot;It was thus my impression, gained first at the forge,&quot;
continued the witness, &quot;that Mr. Cary was before me upon
the main road. Until then, knowing him to have left Richmond
several days before me, I had supposed him at Greenwood.
I was not averse to a word with him on certain matters,
and I rode rapidly, hoping to overtake him&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Upon the main road, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The main road, of course. As I did not do so, I concluded
that the approaching storm had caused him to hasten.
It was very threatening, and the few that my boy and I
passed were hurrying to shelter. At Red Fields I paused for
a moment&quot;&mdash;He looked toward a well-known planter,
standing near. &quot;Certainly, Mr. Rand,&quot; said the latter
promptly. &quot;We tried to make you stay out the storm, but
you would be getting home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From Red Fields my boy and I rode on into town. I
stopped at my partner's house to tell his sister when to expect
him home from Richmond, and at the Eagle I drew
rein for a moment and exchanged greetings with two or three
gentlemen upon the porch. The rain was close at hand, and
my boy and I pushed on to Roselands&mdash;where, next morning,
a neighbour brought the news of this murder. I corroborate,
sir, as I have been called to do, the statements of Mr. Forrest
and Mr. Bates that it was the impression of all who
greeted him as he passed that Mr. Cary was riding home by
the usual road&mdash;the main road. I have nothing further to
offer, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Rand,&quot; said the coroner, and the witness
left the stand.</p>

<p>He was followed by the keeper of a small ordinary upon the
main road, halfway between the ford and Red Fields. &quot;No,
sir, Mr. Ludwell Cary didn't travel by the main road. I sat
in my door with my glass and my pipe almost the whole
day&mdash;until after the storm broke, anyhow. There wasn't
any custom&mdash;folk seemed to know it was going to rain like
Noah's flood. There was hardly anybody on the road after
about ten. Yes, I might have shut my eyes now and then,
though I don't doze over my pipe and glass half as much as
some people say I do. Anyhow, Mr. Ludwell Cary didn't
ride that way&mdash;events prove that, don't they, sir? Yes, I
remember well enough when Mr. Rand passed. I wasn't
dozing then, for the negro boy spoke to me, said there
was going to be a big storm. It must have been after midday,
Mr. Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, something after midday.&quot;</p>

<p>The witness knew, for he always had his glass at noon.
He might have been dozing when the negro spoke to him,
but he spoke plain enough. &quot;'It's going to be an awful
storm,' he said, and then I believe you said something, sir,
though I don't remember what it was, and you both rode
on. I wasn't that sleepy that I couldn't see straight.
That's all that I know, Mr. Galt.&quot;</p>

<p>Two or three other witnesses were called, but they were
of the main road, and the main road had nothing to show
further than that it had been travelled upon by Lewis Rand
and his negro boy. They had not seen Mr. Ludwell Cary
since he rode to Richmond early in the summer. Yes, they
were sure they had seen Mr. Rand and his negro boy&mdash;but
the clouds were dark, and the dust blowing so that you had
to hold your head down, and people were thinking of getting
indoors. The boy was riding a mare with a white foot.</p>

<p>&quot;I think we can leave the main road, gentlemen,&quot; declared
the coroner. &quot;Now the river road and the stream
where this thing was done&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Indian Run&mdash;where did Indian Run come from or lead
to, and who might have been upon that lonely road, or lurking
in the laurel and hemlock that clothed the banks of the
stream? Three miles up the water was a camping-ground
used by gypsies; at a greater distance down the stream a
straggling settlement of poor whites, long looked at askance
by the county. It might be that some wandering gypsy,
some Ishmaelite with a grudge&mdash;The enquiry turned again
to Fairfax Cary.</p>

<p>&quot;When you went on, Mr. Cary, from Elm Tree, you too
supposed that your brother would follow by the same road?
You thought&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did not think at all,&quot; answered Cary harshly. &quot;I was
lost in my own self and my own concerns. I was a selfish
and heedless wretch, and I hurried away without a thought
or care. What he told me I forgot at the time. But I have
remembered it since. He told me that he would take the river
road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And on your own way home you repeated that to no
one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To no one. I never spoke of him, I do not know that I
ever thought of him from Elm Tree to Greenwood. Oh, my
brother!&quot;</p>

<p>A sigh like the wind over corn went through the room.
The coroner bent forward. &quot;Mr. Cary, can you think of
any one who bore him ill-will&mdash;a runaway negro, perhaps,
or some vagrant who might have been along that stream?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. His slaves loved him. We had no runaways. I do
not believe there is a man on Indian Run who would have
touched him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Cary, had he any enemy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He had one. He sits yonder. You have heard his testimony.&quot;</p>

<p>The court room murmured again. The old rivalry between
Lewis Rand and Ludwell Cary, the antagonism of
years, and the fact of a duel were sufficiently in men's minds&mdash;but
what of it all? The duel was a year gone by; political
animosities in Virginia might be, and often were, bitter
enough, but they led no further than to such a meeting.
The coroner looked disturbed. The murmur was followed
by a curious hush; but if for an instant an idea was poised
in the air of the court room, it did not descend, it was banished
as preposterous. The moment's silence was broken by Lewis
Rand. From his place at the side of the room he spoke with
a grave simplicity and straightforwardness, characteristic and
impressive, familiar to most there who had heard him before
now, in this court room, on questions of life and death.
&quot;Everything is to be pardoned to Mr. Fairfax Cary's most
natural grief. My testimony, sir, is as I gave it.&quot;</p>

<p>The coroner's voice broke in upon a deep murmur of assent.
&quot;I presume, Mr. Cary, that you bring no accusation
against Mr. Rand?&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary looked from under the hand with which, as
he sat, he shaded his brow. &quot;I have, here and now, no sufficient
proof whereon to base accusation of any man. I will
only say that I shall seek such proof.&quot;</p>

<p>A little longer, and the proceedings were over. The crowd
dispersed, unsatisfied, hungry for further details and hazardous
of solutions. The better class went home, but others
hung long about the Court House yard, reading the notices
pasted upon the Court House doors, the &quot;WHEREAS upon
the seventh day of September and on the river road where
it is crossed by Indian Run&quot;&mdash;commenting upon the rewards
offered, relating this or that story of the Greenwood
Carys, and recalling every murder in Albemarle since the
Revolution. &quot;Dole was shot down like that, three years
ago, in North Garden&mdash;but then, Fitch was suspected from
the first. Fitch had been heard to swear he'd do it, and they
knew, too, it was his gun, and a child had seen him come
and go. Lewis Rand was for the State. Don't you remember
the speech he made? No; Tom Mocket made it, but
Mr. Rand wrote it! Either way it hung Fitch. Curious,
wasn't it, that passage between Mr. Rand and Fairfax
Cary? D'ye suppose he thought&mdash;d'ye suppose Fairfax
Cary thought&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't what a man thinks,&quot; stated a surly farmer. &quot;It's
what a man can prove.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he couldn't prove that if he tried till doomsday!&quot;
cried another. &quot;That's not Lewis Rand's trade!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're right there, Jim,&quot; assented the group. &quot;WHEREAS
upon the seventh day of September and on the river road
where it is crossed by Indian Run&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Upon a September afternoon, clear and fair, full of the
ripeness and strength of the year, the body of Ludwell Cary
was given back to the earth. There was a service at Saint
Anne's, after which, carried by faithful slaves and followed
by high and low of the county, he was borne to the Cary
burial-ground at Greenwood. It crowned a low hill at no
great distance from the oaks about the house&mdash;a place
of peace and quietness, with bird-haunted trees and a tangle
of old flowers. Ludwell Cary was laid beside Fauquier
Cary, the &quot;Dust to dust&quot; was spoken, and the grave filled
in. All mourned who heard the falling earth, and the negroes
wailed aloud, but Fairfax Cary stood like a rock. It
was over. The throng melted away, leaving only the house
servants, two or three old and privileged friends, and the
living Cary. The last spoke to the first, thanked them, and
sent them away; then, addressing himself to the two Churchills
and the old minister, asked that he be left alone. They
went, Major Edward turning at once, the others following
more slowly He watched them below the hill-top, then sat
down beside the grave that was so raw and red for all the
masking flowers.</p>

<p>At sunset Eli and Major Edward, grey and anxious, watching
from the shadow of the oaks, saw him leave the burying-ground,
look back once as he closed the gate, and come slowly
down the hill. When he reached the house, and, after going
to his own room, came down into the library, it was to find
Major Churchill ensconced in an old chair by the western
window, with a book in his hand. He looked up with eyes
yet keen and dark beneath their shaggybrows. &quot;If you'll
allow me, Fair, I'll borrow this Hobbes of yours. It is
printed larger than mine, and it has no damned annotation!&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward spent the night at Greenwood, and the
two played chess until very late. The next morning, coming
stiffly down at an early hour, he found no host. Fairfax
Cary, he discovered on enquiry, had ordered his horse the
night before, and as soon as it was light, had ridden off alone.
Major Churchill passed the morning as best he might. He
looked once from the windows toward the little graveyard
on the hill, and thought of going there, then shook his head
and pressed his lips together. He was old, and now, when
he could, he evaded woe. The young had fibre and nerve
to squander; brittle folk must walk lightly. The Major
stared at the feathery trees that marked the place. The green
became a blur; he stamped his foot upon the floor with violence,
said something between his teeth, and turned from the
window to a desolate contemplation of the backs of books.</p>

<p>It was after midday when Fairfax Cary returned. He came
in, white and steady, apologized for his absence, and ordered
dinner. The two ate little, hardly spoke, but drank
their wine. As they passed out of the dining-room, the elder
said, &quot;You have been&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The river road.&quot;</p>

<p>They re&euml;ntered the library and, at Cary's suggestion, sat
down again at the chess-table. They played one game, then
fell idle, the young man staring straight before him at some
invisible object, the elder watching him covertly but keenly.</p>

<p>&quot;When,&quot; said the Major at last,&mdash;&quot;when will you come
with me, Fair, to Fontenoy?&quot;</p>

<p>The other shook his head. &quot;I do not know. Not now. I
must not keep you here, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have little to occupy me at home. You will tell me
when I can do nothing for you here. You must remember,
Fair, that Dick and Nancy and Unity and I and even little
Deb want you, very heartily and lovingly want you, with us
there. Unity&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The young man took from his breast a folded note. &quot;I
have this from Unity. Read it. It is like her.&quot;</p>

<p>He unfolded it and gave it to the Major, who read the line
it contained.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>FAIRFAX,&mdash;I will marry you to-morrow if you wish. I
know&mdash;I know it is lonely at Greenwood. UNITY.</p></div>

<p>Major Churchill cleared his throat. &quot;Yes, it is like her.
And why not, Fair? Upon my soul, I do advise it! I advise
it strongly. Not to-morrow, perhaps, but next day or the next.
It can be quietly arranged&mdash;there could have been no wiser
suggestion! Take her at her word, Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary shook his head, thrust the note back in its place, and,
rising with a quivering sigh, walked to the window. He stood
there for some moments, his brow pressed to the pane, then
returned to the table and, standing before the Major, spoke
with harsh passion &quot;Is marriage, sir, a thing for me to think
of now? No! not even marriage with Unity Dandridge. To
marry now&mdash;to forget with all possible haste&mdash;to lie close
and warm and happy and leave him there, cold, alone, and
unavenged! No. I'll not do that. Wedding-bells, even
slowly rung, would sound strangely, I think, to his ears. And
as for that murderer, he might say when he heard them,
'Are the dead so soon forgot? Then up, heart! for this bridegroom
will not trouble me.' Major Churchill, I will live
alone at Greenwood until I have proof which will convince
a judge and jury that my brother was not the only man who
spurred from that ford by the river road! Lewis Rand may
wind and double, but I'll scotch him yet, there by Indian
Run! I'll transfix him there, there on that very strand, and
call the world to see the man who murdered Ludwell Cary!
When that's done, I'll rest, maybe, and think of happiness.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Churchill sat back in the deep old armchair and
rested his head upon his hand. The hand was a trembling
hand; the old soldier, grey and stark, with his pinned-up
sleeve, looked suddenly a beaten soldier, conquered and fugitive.
The young man saw the shaking hand. &quot;You need no
proof, sir,&quot; he said harshly. &quot;I know that you know. You
knew there beside the stream, the day we found him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And did you not know that I knew?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have not been perfectly certain, but&mdash;yes, I believed
you to know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will not say that, knowing me,&mdash;for until now I have
hardly known myself,&mdash;but knowing my father, sir, could
you look for another course from his son? My brother's
blood cries from the ground. There is no rest and no peace
for me until his murderer pays!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot tell you what my brother was to me. Brother
of the flesh and of the spirit too&mdash;David&mdash;Jonathan. His
friends mine and his enemies mine, his honour mine&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Fair. It was so I loved Henry Churchill.&quot;</p>

<p>The young man checked his speech, gazed at his guest a
moment in silence, and turned away. The quiet held in the
old room where bygone Carys looked from the walls, but at
last the Major spoke with violence. &quot;Don't think that I do
not hate that man! Spare him, in himself, one iota of the
penalty&mdash;not I! Cheat justice, see the law futile to protect
an outraged people, stay the hangman's hand&mdash;am I one
to will that? No man can accuse me of a forgiving spirit!
I, too, loved your brother; I, too, believe in the blood debt!
Ask me of this man himself, and I say, 'Right! Let him
have it to the hilt&mdash;death and shame!' But&mdash;but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The Major's voice, high and shaking with passion, broke
with a gasp. He had sat erect to speak, but now he sank
back, and with his chin upon his hand looked again mere
grey defeat.</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary turned from the window. &quot;I am sorry,&quot; he
said coldly and harshly. &quot;In a lesser thing, Major Churchill,
that consideration might stop me. It cannot do so, sir, in
this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not asking that it should,&quot; answered the other.
&quot;I seldom ask too much of this humanity. You will do what
you must, and what you will, and I shall comprehend your
motive and your act. But I will stand clear of you, Fair.
After to-day, you plan without my knowledge, and work without
my aid!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it must be so, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have called myself,&quot; said Major Edward sombrely,
&quot;a Spartan and a Stoic. I believe in law and the payment
of debts. I believe that a murderer should be tracked down
and shown that civilization has no need of him. I loved your
brother. And I sit here, a weak old man, and say, 'Not if
it strikes through a woman's heart!' What a Stoic the Most
High must be!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think that I should know one thing, sir. Is it your belief
that he has told your niece?&quot;</p>

<p>The Major grew dark red, and straightened himself with
a jerk. &quot;Told my niece? Made her, sir, a confidante of his
villainy, leagued her to aid him in cajoling the world? I
think not, sir; I trust not! I would not believe even him so
universal an enemy. If I thought that, sir,&mdash;but no! I
have seen my niece Jacqueline twice since&mdash;&quot; the Major
spoke between his teeth&mdash;&quot;since Mr. Rand's return from
Richmond.&quot; He sat a moment in silence, then continued.
&quot;Her grief is deep, as is natural&mdash;do we not all grieve?
But if I have skill to read a face, she carries in her heart no
such black stone as that! Remember, please, that he told her
nothing of his plot with Burr. You will oblige me by no
longer indulging such an idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, sir. I know that Colonel Churchill has no
suspicion. He contends that it was some gypsy demon&mdash;will
not even have it that some poor white from about the
still&mdash;says that no man in this county&mdash;Well! I, too, would
have thought that once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My brother Dick has the innocence of a child. But
others apparently suspect as little. You and I are alone there.
And we have only the moral conviction, Fairfax. They were
enemies, and they were in the same county on the same day.
That is all you have to go upon. He has somehow made a
coil that only the serpent himself can unwind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man can but try, sir. I shall try. If you talk of an
inner conviction, I have that conviction that I shall not try
in vain.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward shaded his eyes with his hand. &quot;God
forbid that I should wish the murder of Ludwell Cary
unavenged! But&mdash;but&mdash;shame and sorrow&mdash;and Henry
Churchill's child&quot;&mdash;He rose from his chair and stalked
across the room. &quot;I am tired of it all,&quot; he said, &quot;tired of
the world, life, death, pro and con, affections, hatreds, sweets
that cloy, bitterness that does not nourish, the gash of events,
and the salt with which memory rubs the wound! Man that
is born of woman&mdash;Pah!&quot; He straightened himself, flung
up his grey head, and moved stiffly to a bookcase. &quot;Where's
Gascoigne's Steel Glasse? I know you've got a copy&mdash;Ludwell
told me so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is on the third shelf, the left side. Major Churchill,
you understand that, for all that has been said, I must yet
go my way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Fair, I understand,&quot; said the other. &quot;Do what you
must&mdash;and God help us all!&quot;</p>

<h3>FAIRFAX CARY</h3>


<p>The December frost lay hard upon the ground, and
a pale winter sky gleamed above and between bare
limbs of trees. In Vinie Mocket's garden withered
and bent stalk showed where had been zinnia and prince's
feather, and the grapevine over the porch was but a mass
of twisted stems. The sun shone bright, however, on this day,
and as there was no wind, it was not hard to imagine it warm
out-of-doors and the spring somewhere in keeping. It was the
week before Christmas, and the season unwontedly mild.</p>

<p>Vinie, seated upon the doorstep in the sun, a grey shawl
around her shoulders and her pink chin in her hand, stared
at the Ragged Mountains and wondered when Tom was
coming to dinner. A grey cat purred in the sun beside her.
Smut the dog, lying in a patch of light upon the porch floor,
broke out of a dream, got up, and wagged his tail.</p>

<p>&quot;Who do you hear, Smut?&quot; asked Vinie. &quot;<i>I</i> think it ith
Mr. Adam.&quot;</p>

<p>Adam came through the gate that had never been mended
and up the little, sunny path. He had his gun, and in addition
a great armful of holly and mistletoe, and he deposited
all alike upon the porch floor. &quot;A green Christmas we're
having,&quot; he announced cheerfully, &quot;so we might as well make
it greener! I thought these would look pretty over your chimney
glass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'll be lovely,&quot; answered Vinie. &quot;I just somehow
didn't think of fixing things up this Christmas. I'll put
them all around the parlour, Mr. Adam.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll put them for you,&quot; said Adam. &quot;This isn't mistletoe
like you get in the big trees south, and it isn't holly such as
grows down Williamsburgh way&mdash;but it's mistletoe and
it's holly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth,&quot; agreed Vinie listlessly. &quot;I don't know which
ith the prettier, the little white waxen berries or the red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like the red,&quot; returned the hunter. &quot;That in your hand&mdash;bright
and quick as blood-drops.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Vinie, and let the spray drop to the floor.
&quot;Blood ith darker than that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not if it's heart's blood&mdash;that's bright enough. What
is the matter, little partridge?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; Vinie replied, with an effort. &quot;I've been baking
cake all morning, and I'm tired. I reckon you couldn't
have Christmas without baking and scrubbing and sweeping
and dusting and making a whole lot of fuss about nothing&mdash;nothing
at all.&quot; Her voice dragged away.</p>

<p>&quot;You couldn't have it without hanging up mistletoe and
holly,&quot; quoth Adam. &quot;I've been a month in these parts, and
I've come around mighty often to see you and Tom. Why
won't you tell me?&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie turned upon him startled eyes. &quot;Tell you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me what ails you. Why, you aren't any more like&mdash;Don't
you remember that morning, a'most four years ago,
when I found you sitting by the blackberry bushes on the
Fontenoy road? Yes, you do. The blackberries were in
bloom, and you had on a pink sunbonnet, and I broke you a
lot of wild cherry for your very same parlour in there. You
had been crying that day, too,&mdash;oh, I knew!&mdash;but you
plucked up spirit and put the wild cherry all around the
parlour. And now, look at you!&mdash;you aren't a partridge
any longer, you're a dove without a mate. Well, why don't
you cry, little dove?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't feel like crying,&quot; said Vinie. &quot;There isn't anything
the matter with me. I'm going to put the green stuff
up, and Tom's got ever so many wax candles and two bottles
of Madeira, and you'll come to supper&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll send you a brace of wild turkeys Christmas Eve.
I'll shoot them over on Indian Run.&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie shrank back. &quot;You look,&quot; exclaimed Adam, &quot;as
though you were on Indian Run, and I had turned my gun
on you! Why did you go white and sick like that?&quot;</p>

<p>He glanced at her again with keen, deep blue eyes. &quot;Now
the colour has come back. Were you frightened over there in
those woods when you really were a bird? Indian Run! It is
more than three months, isn't it, since Mr. Cary's death?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;December,&quot; answered Vinie, in a fluttering voice, &quot;December,
November, October, and part of September&mdash;yeth,
more than three months. Suppose we go now and put the
holly up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's stay here a little in the sun. The holly won't wither.
I don't know a doorstep, East or West, that I like to sit on
better than this. There's a variety of log cabins that I'm
fond of, and maybe as many as four or five wigwams, but
I'd like to grow old sitting in the sun before this little grey
house! It isn't going to be long before the sap runs in the
sugar trees and it's spring. Then all the pretty flowers will
come up again and I'll help you draw cool water from the
well. Don't you ever wear that Spanish comb I brought
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've got it put away. It's lovely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It oughtn't to be put away. It ought to be stuck there,
dark shell above your yellow hair. You'll wear it, won't you,
Christmas Day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth, I'll wear it, Mr. Adam. Who's coming now,
Smut?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He hears a horse. Wear the Spanish comb, and Tom
shall brew us a bowl of punch, and we might get in some gay
folk and a fiddle and have a dance. I'd like to stand up
with you, little partridge.&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie put down her head and began to cry. &quot;It's nothing,
nothing! There isn't anything the matter! Don't think it,
Mr. Adam. I jutht get tired and cold, and Christmas isn't
like it used to be. Now I've stopped&mdash;and I'll dance with
you with pleasure, Mr. Adam.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Now, you dry your eyes, and
we'll go into the parlour and I'll make a fire, and we'll put
leaves and berries all around. Who is it coming by? Mr.
Fairfax Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeth,&quot; answered Vinie. &quot;He rides a black horse.&quot;</p>

<p>The hunter glanced at her again. &quot;Little bird,&quot; he thought,
&quot;your voice didn't use to have so many notes.&quot; Aloud he
said, &quot;He's grown to look like his brother. I met him in the
road the other day and we talked awhile. He's too stern and
quiet, though. All the time we talked I was thinking of a
Cherokee whom I once met following a war party that had
killed his wife. Fairfax Cary had just the same air as that
Indian&mdash;still, like an afternoon on a mountain-top. There's
no clue yet as to who shot his brother.&quot;</p>

<p>Fairfax Cary, going by on Saladin, lifted his hat to
the woman on the porch. &quot;Yes, he's like that Cherokee,&quot;
repeated Adam. &quot;Where's he riding?&mdash;to Fontenoy, I
reckon. Now, little partridge, let's go make the parlour look
like Christmas.&quot;</p>

<p>Vinie rose, and the hunter gathered up the green stuff.
She spoke again in the same fluttered voice. &quot;Mr. Adam, do
you think&mdash;do you think they'll ever find out&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Find out who shot Mr. Cary?&quot; asked Gaudylock.
&quot;They may&mdash;there's no telling. Every day makes a trail
like that more overgrown and hard to read. But if Fairfax
Cary is truly like my Cherokee, I'd not care to be the murderer,
even five years and a thousand miles from here and
now. You may be sure the Cherokee got <i>his</i> man. Now
you take the mistletoe and I'll take the holly, and we'll
make a Christmas bower to dance in.&quot; He raised his great
armful and went into the house singing,&mdash;</p>

<p>
&quot;Once I was in old Kentucky,<br />
Christmas time, by all that's lucky!<br />
Bear meat, deer meat, coon and possum,<br />
Apple-jack we did allow some,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">In Kentucky.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;Roaring logs and whining fiddle,<br />
Up one side and down the middle!<br />
Two foot snow and ne'er a flower,&mdash;<br />
But Molly Darke she danced that hour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">In Kentucky!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>The hunter's surmise was correct. Fairfax Cary rode
slowly on upon the old, familiar way to Fontenoy. All the
hills were brown, winter earth and winter air despite the
brightness of the sunshine. A blue stream rippled by, pine
and cedar made silhouettes against a tranquil sky, and crows
were cawing in a stubble-field. Cary rode slowly, plodding
on with a thoughtful brow. The few whom he met
greeted him respectfully, and he answered them readily
enough, then pursued his way, again in a brown study. The
Fontenoy gates were reached at last, and he was about to
bend from his saddle and lift the heavy latch, when a slim
black girl in a checked gown made a sudden appearance in
the driveway upon the other side. &quot;I'll open hit, sah! Don'
you trouble. Dar now!&quot;</p>

<p>The gate swung open, Cary rode through, and Deb appeared
beside Miranda. &quot;We've been walking a mile,&quot; she
announced. &quot;Down the drive and back again, through the
hollow, round the garden, and up to the glass door&mdash;that's
a mile. Are you going to stay to supper?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary dismounted and walked beside her, his bridle over
his arm. &quot;I don't think so, Deb,&mdash;not to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish you would,&quot; said Deb wistfully. &quot;You used to all
the time, and you most never do now. And&mdash;and it's
Christmas, and we aren't going to decorate, or have a
party, or people staying!&quot; Deb's chin trembled. &quot;I don't
like houses in mourning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Neither do I, Deb.&quot;</p>

<p>The colour streamed into his companion's small face. &quot;I
didn't mean&mdash;I didn't mean&mdash;I forgot! Oh, Mr. Fairfax,&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Deb, don't mind. I wish you were going to have a
Christmas as bright as bright! Won't there be any brightness
for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; answered Deb, with bravery. &quot;I am
going to have a lovely time. Uncle Dick says I can do what
I please with the schoolroom, and Miranda and I and the
quarter children&mdash;we're going to decorate. Unity's going
to show us how, and Scipio's going to put up the wreaths.
The quarter's to have its feast just the same, and I'm going
to help Unity give out the presents. I expect it will be
beautiful!&quot;</p>

<p>The two walked on, Miranda following. Cary took the
child's hand. &quot;I expect it will be beautiful too, Deb. Sometimes
ever so much brightness in just a little place makes up
for the grey all around. Aren't you going to let me see the
schoolroom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, would you like to?&quot; cried Deb, brightening. &quot;Certainly,
Mr. Fairfax. Christmas is lovely, isn't it? Unity
says that maybe she and I will slip down to the quarter
and watch them dancing. I'm sure I don't want parties,
nor people staying!&quot;</p>

<p>Deb squeezed her companion's hand, and kept silence from
the big elm to the lilac-bushes. Then she broke out. &quot;But
I don't understand&mdash;I don't understand at all&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Cary, looking down upon her, saw her little pointed chin
quiver again, and her brown eyes swim. &quot;What don't you
understand, poor little Deb?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand why I can't go to Roselands. I've
always gone the day after every Christmas, and it is always
like Christmas over again! And now Uncle Dick says, 'Stay
at home, chicken, this year,' and Uncle Edward says he
needs me to tell him stories, and Unity begged them at first
to let me go, but when they wouldn't, she said that she
couldn't beg them any more, and that she didn't think
the world was going right anyhow.&quot; The tears ran over.
&quot;And Jacqueline,&quot; continued Deb, in a stifled little
voice,&mdash;&quot;Jacqueline wrote me a letter and said not to come this year
if Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward wanted me at home. She
told me I must always obey and love them&mdash;just as if I
didn't anyhow. She said she loved me more than most anything,
but I don't think that is loving me&mdash;to think I'd
better not come to Roselands. She said I was most a woman,
and so I am,&mdash;I'm more than twelve,&mdash;and that I was to
love her always and know that she loved me. Of course I
shall love Jacqueline always&mdash;but I wanted to go to Roselands.&quot;
Deb felt in her pocket, found a tiny handkerchief,
and applied it to her eyes. &quot;It's not like Christmas not to
go to Roselands the day after&mdash;and I think people are
cruel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't think that of your sister, Deb,&quot; said Cary,
with gentleness. &quot;Your sister isn't cruel. Don't cry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not,&quot; answered Deb, and put carefully away a wet
ball of handkerchief. &quot;I hope you'll like the schoolroom,
Mr. Fairfax. It's all cedar and red berries, and Miranda's
and my dolls are sitting in the four corners. It's lovely
weather for Christmas&mdash;though I wanted it to snow.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward, seated at an old desk, going over old
papers, looked up as Cary entered the library. A fire of
hickory crackled and flamed on the hearth, making a light to
play over the portrait of Henry Churchill and over the swords
crossed beneath. An old hound named Watch slept under
the table, the tall clock ticked loudly, and through the glass
doors, beyond the leafless trees, showed the long wave of the
Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it you, Fair?&quot; demanded the Major. &quot;Come in&mdash;come
in! I am merely going over old letters. They can wait.
The men who wrote them are all dead.&quot; He turned in his
chair. &quot;Have you just come in?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unity was here awhile ago. She went through the glass
door&mdash;down to the quarter, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will stay here for a while, sir, if I may. Don't let me
disturb you. I will take a book.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do not disturb me,&quot; answered the Major. &quot;I was
reading a letter from Hamilton, written long ago&mdash;long
ago.</p>

<p>&quot;I met Deb in the driveway and we walked to the house
together. Poor little maid! She is mightily distressed because
she thinks there's a lack of Christmas cheer. I wish, sir, that
she might have a merry Christmas.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll do our best, Fair. Unity shall make it bright.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The servants, too,&mdash;I give mine the usual feast at Greenwood,
and I'm going down to the quarter for half an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Carys make good masters. In that respect all here,
too, goes on as usual. As for Deb, the child shall have the
happiest day we can give her.&quot; He took from a drawer a
small morocco case and opened it. &quot;She'll have from Dick
a horse and saddle, and I give her this.&quot; He held out the
case, and Cary praised the small gold watch with D.C.
marked in pearls. &quot;The only thing,&quot; continued Major
Edward wearily, &quot;is that she cannot go to Roselands. She
has cried her heart out over that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You declined the invitation for her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I made Dick do so. She is growing into womanhood.
It will not answer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, sir, Colonel Churchill must know&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn't 'know,'&quot; said the Major doggedly. &quot;Nobody
really knows. We may be all pursuing a spectre. I told
Dick enough to make him see that Deb should not be brought
into contact&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence. Cary studied the fire, and Major
Churchill unfolded deftly with his one hand a yellowing
paper, glanced over it, and laid it in a separate drawer. &quot;An
order from General Washington&mdash;the Andr&eacute; matter. Deb
shall not visit Roselands again. Dick and I are not going to
have both of Henry's children&quot;&mdash;The Major's voice broke.
&quot;Pshaw! this damned weather gives a man a cold that Valley
Forge itself couldn't give!&quot; He unfolded another paper.
&quot;What's this? Benedict Arnold! Faugh!&quot; Rising, he approached
the fire and threw the letter in, then turned impatiently
upon the younger man. &quot;Well, Fairfax Cary?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it still,&quot; asked Cary slowly, &quot;your opinion that she does
not know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward dragged a chair to the corner of the hearth
and sat heavily down. He bent forward, a brooding, melancholy
figure, a thin old veteran, grey and scarred. The fire-light
showed strongly square jaw, hawk nose, and beetle
brows. When he spoke, it was in a voice inexpressibly sombre.
&quot;I have seen my niece but three times since September. If
you ask me now what you asked me then, I shall answer differently.
I do not know&mdash;I do not know if she knows or
not!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think, sir, that I have a clue. The hour when he passed
Red Fields&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Major Churchill put up a shaking hand. &quot;No, sir! Remember
our bargain. I'll not hear it. I'll weigh no evidence
on this subject. Enough for me to know in my heart of hearts
that this man murdered Ludwell Cary, and that he dwells
free at Roselands, blackening my niece&mdash;that he rides free
to town&mdash;pleads his cases&mdash;does his work&mdash;ingratiates
himself, and grows, grows in the esteem of his county and his
state! That, I say, is enough, sir! If you have your clue, for
God's sake don't impart it to me! I've told you I will not
make nor meddle.&quot; Major Edward began to cough. &quot;Open
the window, will you? The room is damned hot. Well, sir,
well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll say no more, then, sir, as to that,&quot; Cary answered
from the window. &quot;I wish absolutely to respect your position.
It will do no harm, however, to tell you that I am going to
Richmond the day after Christmas.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Richmond! What are you going to Richmond for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want,&quot; replied the other, with restrained passion,&mdash;&quot;I
want to ride from Shockoe Hill at three o'clock in the afternoon,
with my face to Roselands, and in my heart the knowledge
that I have been foiled and thwarted in deep-laid and
cherished schemes by the one whom, for no especially good
reason, I have singled out of the world to be my enemy! I want
to feel the black rage of the Rands in my heart. I want to
sleep, the third night, at the Cross Roads Tavern, and I want
to go on in the morning by Malplaquet I want to learn at
Forrest's forge that Ludwell Cary is on the road before me.
Perhaps, by the time I reach the mill and cross the ford, I will
remember what it was that I did next, and how I managed to
be on two roads at once.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned, and took up from a chair his hat and riding-whip
&quot;'Tis no easy feat,&quot; he said, with grimness, &quot;to put
one's self in the place of Lewis Rand. But then, other things
are not easy either. I'll not grudge a little straining.&quot; He
stood before the Major, holding out his hand&mdash;a handsome
figure in his mourning dress, resolute, quiet, no longer
breathing outward grief, ready even, when occasion demanded,
to smile or to laugh, but essentially altered and
fixed to one point. &quot;I think, sir, I will look now for Unity.
There is something I wish to say to her. Good-bye, sir. I
shall not come again until after New Year.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Dandridge, mounting the hill from the quarter, and
sitting down to rest upon a great, sun-bathed stone beside
the foot-path, heard a quick step and looked up to greet her
betrothed. &quot;It is so warm and bright,&quot; she said, &quot;in this
fence-corner that I feel as though summer were on the way.
The stone is large&mdash;there's room for you, too, here in the
sunshine.&quot;</p>

<p>He sat down beside her. &quot;You have been making Christmas
for the quarter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been telling them that Christmas is to be bright. I
have not seen you for a week.&quot;</p>

<p>He took her hand and pressed it to his lips. &quot;Unity, I
have been sitting there at home at Greenwood, thinking,
thinking! Page came to see me, but I was such poor company
that he did not tarry long. I rode here to-day to say something
to you&mdash;Unity, don't you think you had better give
me up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! I don't&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not think it is fair to you. I am not the man you
knew&mdash;except in loving you I am not the man who sat with
you beneath the catalpa. I am bereaved of the better part
of me, and I see one object held up before me like a wand.
I must reach that wand or all effort is fruitless, and there is
no achievement and no harvest in my life. I may be years in
reaching it. I love you dearly and deeply, but I am not given
over to love. I am given over to reaching that wand. It has
seemed to me, sitting there at Greenwood, it has seemed to
me after Page's visit, that I should give you freedom&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to me, sitting here upon this stone,&quot; answered
Unity, &quot;that I will not take it! And what under the sun Mr.
Page's visit&mdash;I will wait until you are at leisure to love me
as&mdash;as&mdash;as you loved me that day under the catalpa when
you flung Elo&iuml;sa to Abelard into the rosebushes! Don't&mdash;don't!
I like to cry a little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have determined,&quot; he said, &quot;to tell you what I am
doing. You know that I seek to discover my brother's murderer,
but you have not guessed that I know his name. It
is Lewis Rand whom I pursue, and it is Lewis Rand whom
I will convict of that deed on Indian Run!&quot;</p>

<p>She gave a cry. &quot;Lewis Rand! Fair, Fair, that's impossible!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; he asked sombrely. &quot;Impossible to prove, perhaps,
though I'm not prepared to grant that either, but true,
Unity, true as many another black 'impossible' has been!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;but&mdash;No one thinks&mdash;no one suspects. Fair,
Fair! are you not mistaken?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Nor am I quite alone in my conviction. And one
day the world that suspects nothing shall know.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence; then, &quot;But Jacqueline,&quot; she whispered,
with whitening lips. &quot;Jacqueline&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;She chose,&quot; he answered. &quot;I cannot help it. She took
her road and her companion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean to bring him to justice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To break her heart and ruin her life&mdash;to bring down
wretchedness, misery, disgrace! Oh!&quot; She caught her breath.
&quot;And Deb&mdash;and Uncle Dick and Uncle Edward&mdash;Fair,
Fair, leave him alone!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must not ask me that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Ludwell would&mdash;Ludwell would have asked it!
Oh, do you think he would have endured to bring woe like
that upon her! Oh, Fair, Fair,&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Cary sprang to his feet, walked away, and stood with his
back to the great stone and his face toward Greenwood. He
saw but one thing there, the graveyard on the hill beneath the
leafless trees. When he came back to Unity, he looked as he
had looked beside the dead, that day on Indian Run.</p>

<p>&quot;We are alike, Ludwell and I,&quot; he said, &quot;but we are not
that much alike. I am little now but an avenger of blood. I
shall be that until this draws to an end.&quot; He came closer and
touched her shoulder with his hand. &quot;Take me or leave me
as I am, Unity. I shall not change, not even for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But for tenderness,&quot; she cried, &quot;for mercy, for consideration
of an old house, for Jacqueline whom your brother loved
as you love&mdash;as once you said you loved&mdash;me! For just
pity, Fair!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the other side,&quot; he answered, &quot;is justice. Don't urge
me, Unity. That is something your uncle has not done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Edward?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence; then, &quot;I see now,&quot; said Unity slowly.
&quot;I haven't understood. I thought&mdash;I didn't know what
to think. Uncle Edward, too,&mdash;oh me! oh me! That is why
Deb is not to go to Roselands.&quot; She considered through
blinding tears a little patch of sere grass. &quot;But Jacqueline,&quot;
she whispered,&mdash;&quot;Jacqueline does not know?&quot;</p>

<p>Cary looked at her. &quot;Do you think that, Unity?&quot;</p>

<p>Unity stared at the grass until the tears all dried. &quot;She
knows&mdash;she knows! That was a heart-breaking letter to
Deb, and I couldn't&mdash;I couldn't understand it! She does
not ask me there&mdash;does not seem to want to meet&mdash;I've
hardly seen her since&mdash;since&mdash;And when we meet, she's
strange&mdash;too gay at first for her, and then too still, with wide
eyes she will not let me read. And she talks and talks&mdash;she
talks now more than I do. She's not truly Jacqueline&mdash;she's
acting a part. Oh, Jacqueline, Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be very sure,&quot; he said, &quot;that I have for her only pity,
admiration, yes, and understanding!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you intend&mdash;you intend&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To bring Lewis Rand to justice. Yes, I intend that.&quot;</p>

<p>From the quarter below them came the blowing of the
afternoon horn. The short, bright winter day was waning,
and though the sun yet dwelt upon the hill-top, the hollow at
its base was filled with shadow. Unity rose from the stone.
&quot;I must go back to the house. I promised Deb I would read
to her.&quot; She caught her breath. &quot;It is the Arabian Nights&mdash;and
he gave it to her, and she's always talking of him. Oh,
all of us poor children! Oh, I used to think the world so
sweet and gay!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think,&quot; he said, &quot;of the one who turns it
bitter?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him with pleading eyes. &quot;Fair, Fair, will
you not forego it&mdash;forego vengeance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not vengeance,&quot; he answered. &quot;It is something
deeper than that. I don't think that I can explain. It seems
to me that it is destiny and all that destiny rests upon.&quot; He
drew her to him and kissed her twice. &quot;Will you wait for me,
wait on no other terms than these? If you will, God bless you!
If it is a task beyond your strength, God bless you still. You
will do right to give it up. Which, Unity, which? And if you
wait for me, you must go no more to that man's house. If
you wait for me, my brother is your brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will never give up Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not ask it. But you'll go no more to that house,
speak no more to the man she most unhappily wedded. That
is my right&mdash;if you wait for me.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned and threw herself into his arms. &quot;Oh, Fair, if
it is only he himself&mdash;if it is only that dark and wicked
man&mdash;if you do not ask me to stop loving her, or writing to
her, or seeing her when I can&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is all&mdash;only to speak no more to that dark and
wicked man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'll wait&mdash;I'll wait till doomsday! Oh, the world!
Oh, the thing called love! Don't&mdash;don't speak to me until
I cry it out.&quot;</p>

<p>She wept for a while, then dried her eyes and tried to smile.
&quot;That's over. Let us go now and&mdash;and read the Arabian
Nights. Oh me, oh me, if we are not merry here, what
must Christmas be at Roselands!&quot;</p>

<h3>THE IMAGE</h3>


<p>The murderer of Ludwell Cary unlocked the green
door of the office in Charlottesville, entered, and
opened the shutters of the small, square windows.
Outside was a tangle of rose-stems, but no leaf or bloom. The
January sunshine streamed palely in, whitening the deal floor
and striking against a great land map on the wall. Upon the
hearth had been thrown an armful of hickory and pine.
Rand, kneeling, laid a fire, struck a spark into the tinder, and
had speedily a leap and colour of pointed flames. He rose,
opened his desk, drew papers out of pigeon-holes and laid
them in order upon the wood, then pushed before it his
accustomed chair. He did not take the latter; instead, after
standing a moment with an indescribable air of weary uncertainty,
he turned, went back to the firelit hearth, sat down,
and, bending forward, hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>A cricket began to chirp upon the hearth, then the branch
of a sycamore, moved by the wind, struck violently against the
low eaves of the house. Rand arose, put his hands to his temples,
and moved away.</p>

<p>There were law-books on the shelves, and he took down
one and fell to studying statutes that bore upon a case he had
in court. He read for a time with a frown of attention, but by
degrees all interest flagged. He turned a page, looked at it
with vagueness, and turned no more. His chin fell upon his
hand, and he sat staring at the patch of sunshine on the floor.
It was like light on water&mdash;light on Indian Run.</p>

<p>Five minutes more and Mocket came in, soft and quick
upon his feet, sandy-haired and freckle-faced, with his
quaint, twisted smile, and watery blue eye, that glanced
aslant at his friend and partner &quot;Good-morning, Lewis&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-morning, Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket stood by the fire, warming his hands. &quot;If 'twas a
mild December, 'tis cold enough now! The wind is icy, and
it's blowing hard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it? I thought the air was still.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Rand arose, replaced the book on the shelf,
sat down at his desk, and began to unfold papers. &quot;Work!&quot;
he said presently, in a dull voice. &quot;Work! That is the straw
at which to catch! Perhaps one might make of it a raft to bear
one's weight. I have known the day when in work I have
forgotten hunger, thirst, weariness, calamity. I have worked
at night and grudged an hour to sleep. What I have done,
cannot I do again? But I would work better, Tom, if I could
get some sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry you have bad nights,&quot; said Tom; &quot;but if you
slept as deep and innocent as a babe, you couldn't do better
work. That was a praising piece about you in the Enquirer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing less than eulogy, Tom, nothing less! Well&mdash;get
to work! Get to work!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've brought the papers on this case that old Berry has
been copying.&quot; Tom threw more wood on the fire, then
moved to his own desk, dragging a chair after him. &quot;By the
way, I stopped at the Eagle for a dram to keep out the cold,
and who should come riding by but Fairfax Cary&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Rand. &quot;Is he home from Richmond?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know that he had been to Richmond.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He went two weeks ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hadn't observed it. Well, whenever he went, he's
back again. As I say, I was coming down the steps, buttoning
up my coat, and he drew rein&mdash;he was riding his brother's
horse and he looked like his brother&mdash;and he says to me,
says he, 'Mr. Mocket,&mdash;'&quot;</p>

<p>Tom broke off, turned the papers in his hand, and uttered
an exclamation of disgust. &quot;Old Berry is getting to be too
poor a copyist! You'll have to give this work somewhere
else.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand spoke in his measured voice. &quot;What did Fairfax
Cary say, Tom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, he didn't say much, and I'm sure I didn't get any
meaning out of what he did say! His words were, 'Mr.
Mocket, I wish I could remember all that, on several occasions,
I must have said to you.' Seeing,&quot; continued Tom,
&quot;that I haven't spoken to him more than a dozen times in
my life, I shouldn't consider there would be much difficulty
in that, and I told him as much. 'You're mistaken,' he said.
'It is difficult. We all have bad memories. I've been wondering,
seeing that I have talked to you of so much, if I ever
talked to you of that. On the whole, I don't think that I
ever have. Cultivate your memory, Mr. Mocket. Mine is
a damnably poor one.' And so,&quot; ended Tom, &quot;he rode
away and left me staring. I don't know whether his head is
turned or not, but he looked strong enough for anything
and all a Cary. If you know what he meant, it is more than
I do. These reports are all straight enough now. Do you
want to look over them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said his partner, and stood up, moving back his
chair with a grating sound. &quot;I don't know why&mdash;I'm
restless to-day.&quot; Walking across the room, he stopped before
the map upon the wall, and stood there a long while in silence.</p>

<p>&quot;How would it do, Tom,&quot; he asked at last, in a curiously
remote and dreamy voice,&mdash;&quot;how would it do to find two
or three great white-covered waggons, store them with all a
childless family would need, put to them teams sound and
strong, procure a horse or two besides, a slave or two, a
faithful dog,&mdash;then to take the long
road&mdash;west&mdash;south&mdash;somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;past the mountains and away,
away&quot;&mdash;His voice sank, then gathered strength and went
on. &quot;Flood and forest, low hills and endless plains, stillness
and a measure of peace! Left behind the demon care, full
before the eye the red, descending sun&mdash;at night the camp-fire,
at dawn the start, and in between mere sleep without a
dream! It is conceivable that, after much travel, in some
hollow or by some spring, after long days and after sleep,
one might stumble on new life.&quot; He struck the map with
his hand. &quot;Tom, sometimes I think that I will remove from
Virginia to the West.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'd be a fool to do that now,&quot; answered Tom succinctly.
&quot;But you won't do it. I don't know what has been
the matter with you this winter, but I reckon you still love
power. Next year you'll be named for Governor of Virginia.&quot;</p>

<p>He fed the fire again, then, going to the window, looked
down the street. &quot;The wind has fallen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am going,&quot; said Rand's voice behind him, &quot;to ride
down the Three-Notched Road. Mrs. Selden sends me word
that old Carfax is annoying her again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't I go for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I do not mind the ride. Get the papers ready for
court to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Mocket helped him on with his heavy bottle-green
riding-coat. &quot;Lewis,&quot; spoke the scamp, with a queer note of affection
and deprecation, &quot;why don't you see Dr. Gilmer?
You're growing thin, and do you know, you're haunted-looking!
Tell him you cannot sleep, and make him give you
bark or something. I couldn't carry on business without
you, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand looked at him with dark and sombre eyes. &quot;Couldn't
you, poor old Tom? Well, we'll keep it on awhile together.
I don't want the doctor. Once, long ago, I might have doctored
myself.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Now there's no bark in Peru&mdash;no
balm in Gilead. Well, what we cannot have, we must
do without! Look out, will you, and see if Young Isham is
there with Selim?&quot;</p>

<p>The Three-Notched Road stretched red and stark between
rusty cedars and gaunt trunks of locust trees. It was cold,
and overhead the sun was fighting with the clouds. Rand
went rapidly, his powerful horse taking the road with a long
and easy stride. Few were abroad; the bare and frozen
fields stretched on either hand to the hills, the hills rose to
the mountains, grey and sullen in the changing light. That
meadow, field, and hill had once been mantled with tender
verdure, and would be so again, was hard to believe, the land
lay so naked and so grim.</p>

<p>Mrs. Selden's small, red brick mansion appeared among
the leafless trees. Rand checked Selim slightly, gazing at the
place with the weary uncertainty he had before exhibited,
then turned for the moment from the task, irksome now as
were all tasks, and rode on past Mrs. Jane Selden's to the
house in which he had lived with his father and mother, and
had lived with Jacqueline.</p>

<p>The place had been rented out since that summer of 1804,
but the tenant, failing to make good, was gone, and for some
months the house had been vacant. Rand and Selim moved
slowly along the old, old familiar way. Every stick, every
stone, every fence-corner was known to both. The man let
his hand fall upon the brute's neck. &quot;We're going home,
Selim,&quot; he said. &quot;We're going home.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not now the small, clean place, fresh with whitewash
and bright with garden flowers, shone upon by the sun and
sung about by birds, to which he had brought Jacqueline.
The tenant had been dull, and the place was fallen into
disrepair. In the winter air and without a leaf or flower,
it looked again as it had looked when he and Gideon lived
there alone. He dismounted, fastened Selim to the fence,
and entered by the gate beneath the mimosa tree.</p>

<p>That the mimosa had ever shown sensitive leaf and mist
of rosy bloom ranked now among other impossibilities. He
stood for a moment looking at it in silence, then walked up
the narrow path, mounted the porch steps, and tried the
door. It was locked, but with an effort of all his wasted
strength he burst it open and so entered the house.</p>

<p>The rooms were unfurnished and forlorn. He went from
one to another, pausing in each in the middle of the floor,
and gazing around as if to replace in that empty square the
objects of the past. This progress made, he looked for a
place to rest, but there was neither chair nor bench. All was
bare, unswept, and desolate. He went into the kitchen, for
he remembered the old settle there upon the enormous
hearth. That they could not have removed, it was too heavy.
He found it, took off his riding-coat and made a pillow for his
head, then lay down full length upon the time-darkened
wood. He had lain so, often and often, a little boy, a larger
boy, a long-limbed, brooding youth. It had been his refuge
from the fields, though hardly a refuge from his father.
Gideon had been always there, lounging in his chair on the
other side of the hearth, black pipe in hand, heavy stick
beside him, revolving in his slow-moving mind, there in the
dusk after the day's work, tobacco&mdash;tobacco&mdash;tobacco&mdash;and
how he should keep Lewis from learning. &quot;It had been
better if he had succeeded,&quot; said Rand aloud.</p>

<p>With Gideon still before his eyes he fell asleep. Grim as
was that figure, there was in the vision of it a strange sense
of protection. It was his father, and, giddy from want of
sleep, he sank slowly into oblivion, much as before now he
had travelled there in the other's presence,&mdash;travelled with
a gloomy mind and a body sore from the latest beating.
Now the mind was full of scorpions, and the body stood in
deadly need of sleep. It took it with a strange reversion to
long gone-by conditions. The thought of Gideon's stick, the
feel of his heavy hand upon his shoulder, were with him as
of yore. The difference was that the man was comforted by
what had been the boy's leaden cross.</p>

<p>Exhausted as he was, he slept at first heavily, and without
a dream. This state lasted for some time, but eventually the
brain took up its work, and the visions that plagued him
recommenced. He turned, flung out his arm, moaned once
or twice, lay quiet, then presently gave a cry and started up,
pale and trembling, the sweat upon his brow. He wiped it
off, drew a long, shuddering breath, and sat staring.</p>

<p>The kitchen windows were small, and half darkened by
their wooden shutters. While he slept, the day had rounded
into an afternoon, with more of sunshine than the morning
had contained. The gold entered the room uncertainly,
dimly, filtering in by the small apertures and striking across
to the cavernous fireplace.</p>

<p>Rand knew it was but a trick of the light touching here and
there in mote-filled shafts,&mdash;a trick of the light aiding the
vagaries of an overwrought brain. He put forth his arm and
found that it was so&mdash;there was no chair there and no figure
seated in the chair. It was a trick of the light and an effect of
imagination, an imagination that was hounded, day by day,
from depth to pinnacle, from pinnacle to depth, back and
forth like a shuttlecock in giant hands. No chair was there
and no seated figure. He sank back on the settle and found
that he saw them both.</p>

<p>The first sick leap of the heart was past. What he saw, he
knew, was a mere effect of light and shadow and tragically
heightened fancy: when he moved in a certain direction, the
dim picture faded, broke into pieces, was gone; but lean far
back in the settle, look out with eyes of one awakened from
a maze of fearful dreams, and there it was again! He had no
terror of it; what was it at last but the projection of a face
and form with which his mind had long&mdash;had long been
occupied? It had ousted the vision of his father; and that,
too, was not strange, seeing that, day by day, the thought of
the one&mdash;the one&mdash;the one had grown more and yet more
insistent. &quot;Cary,&quot; said Rand, in a hollow voice, &quot;Cary!&quot;</p>

<p>The light and shadow made no answer. Rand waited,
gazing with some fixedness, and imagination at white heat
saw the head, the face, the form, the quiet dress, the whole
air of the man, the look within his eyes and the smile upon
his lips. The figure sat at ease, as of old it had sat upon the
Justice's Bench the day of the election, as it had sat beside
the bed in the blue room at Fontenoy. Imagination laid
Lewis Rand again in that room, showed him the mandarin
screen, the sunny, happy morning, the pansies in the bowl.
&quot;If,&quot; he cried,&mdash;&quot;if I had died then, I had not died a wicked
man. Cary&mdash;Cary&mdash;Cary! I am in torment!&quot;</p>

<p>There came no reply. Rand bowed his head. Without, in
the afternoon sky, a cloud hid the sun. When the solitary
man in the deserted house looked again, there were no shafts
of light, no dark between to create illusion; all was even
dusk, forbidding, grey, and cold. He rose from the settle and
left the room and the house. Selim whinnied at the gate, and
his master, coming swiftly down the path and out of the enclosure,
unknotted the reins, mounted, and rode off at speed.</p>

<p>Rand's haste did not hold. Remorse does not necessarily
break habit, and the habit of his lifetime was attention to
detail, system in matters of business, scrupulous response to
the call where he acknowledged the right. He drew rein at
Mrs. Selden's, dismounted, and lifted the knocker.</p>

<p>Cousin Jane Selden herself met him in the hail. &quot;Lewis!
I'm as glad to see you as if you brought the south wind!
Come in to the fire, and I'll ring for cake and wine. It is
bitter weather even for January. All's well at Roselands?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All's well.&quot;</p>

<p>They entered the small parlour and sat down before the
fire. &quot;I saw Jacqueline,&quot; continued Mrs. Selden, &quot;at church
last Sunday. I thought her looking very badly pale and
absent. I know, Lewis Rand, that you love each other
dearly. There has been no quarrel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No quarrel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; quoth Mrs. Selden, &quot;of which I'm most
sensible when it's in the air&mdash;an east wind or something
amiss. The wind's in the north to-day, but the latter's on
my mind. What is wrong, Lewis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear old friend, what should be wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is what I asked you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then nothing,&quot; he replied, &quot;nothing but the north wind.
Now about Carfax&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Advice given on the subject of all dealings with Carfax,
the adviser rose to take his leave. Mrs. Selden removed her
spectacles and laid them in her key-basket. It was a sign
with her that she was about to speak her mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Lewis,&quot; she said, &quot;I was a good friend to you once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do I not know that?&quot; he answered. &quot;The best friend
a poor boy ever had.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not quite that&mdash;except, perhaps, to help you a little
with Jacqueline. Mr. Jefferson was the best friend a poor
boy ever had.&quot;</p>

<p>Rand winced. &quot;You say true. The best friend a boy could
have. Give me another glass of wine, and then I'll go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man like that during youth and a woman like Jacqueline
for your manhood&mdash;you have had much to prop your
life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; she said sharply, &quot;don't let it fall. Grow upward,
Lewis, like the vine that gave its strength to make this generous
wine! If you don't, you'll disappoint your Maker, to
say nothing of some poor earthly friends! Don't fall&mdash;don't
run upon the earth like poison oak. You're meant for noble
uses&mdash;to help your kind, and to rejoice the heart of the
Maker of strong men. Don't you fail and fall, Lewis Rand!&quot;</p>

<p>Rand paused before her. &quot;How should I help my kind,
now&mdash;now?&quot;</p>

<p>His old friend looked at him a little wonderingly. &quot;Do the
simple right, my dear, whatever it is that you see before you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The simple right! And to rejoice the heart of my Maker&mdash;if
I have one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do the right strongly and surely, Lewis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever it is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever it is.&quot; Mrs. Jane Selden looked at him thoughtfully,
her hands clasped upon her key-basket. &quot;I'm only an
old woman&mdash;just a camp-follower with an interest in the
battle. I wish that you had had a friend of your own age&mdash;a
man, and your equal in power and grasp. Gaudylock and
Mocket and such&mdash;they're well enough, but you're high
above them, you're a sort of Emperor to them. Could
you but have had such a friend, Lewis&mdash;a man like the
Carys&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For God's sake, don't!&quot; cried Rand hoarsely. He poured
out a glass of wine, looked at it, and pushed it away. &quot;I will
go now, for there is work waiting for me in town, and at
home Do as I tell you about Carfax. Good-bye, good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>Out upon the road, passing through a strip of pine and
withered scrub, he raised his hand, and for some moments
covered his eyes. When he dropped it, he saw, in the strong
purples of the winter evening, again that misty figure, riding
this time, riding near him, not in the road, but apparent in
the air against and between the tall trunks of pines. &quot;Cary,&quot;
he said again, &quot;Cary!&quot;</p>

<p>There was no response from the figure in the air. &quot;Cary,&quot;
cried Rand, &quot;I would we had been friends!&quot;</p>

<p>Selim reached the open country; the pines fell away, the
form was gone. Rand touched his horse with the spur and
rode fast between brown stubble-fields darkening to the hills
and to the evening sky. &quot;Friends,&quot; he repeated, &quot;friends!
That would be on terms of my doing the simple right&mdash;the
simple right after the most complicated wrong! Terms! there
are no terms.&quot;</p>

<p>Leaving the fields, he rode down to a stream, crossed it,
and saw the shape against a pale space of evening sky. &quot;Is it
to be always thus?&quot; he thought. &quot;I would that I had never
been born.&quot;</p>

<h3>IN PURSUIT</h3>


<p>January passed and February passed. Fairfax Cary,
riding for the third time since the New Year from
Malplaquet toward Greenwood, marked the blue
March sky, the pale brown catkins by the brooks, and the
white flowers of the bloodroot piercing the far-spread carpet
of dead leaves. He rode rapidly, but he paused at Forrest's
forge and at the mill below the ford. This also he had done
before. Neither the smith nor the men at the mill knew the
idea that brought him there, but they may have thought&mdash;if
they thought at all&mdash;that he put strange questions. It was,
moreover, matter of regret to them, and of much comment
when he had passed, that Mr. Fairfax Cary had lost an old
and well-liked way of making a man laugh whether he would
or no. He didn't jest any more, he didn't smile and flash out
something at them fit to make them hold their sides. He had
aged ten years since September, he had the high look of the
Carys, but he was even quieter than his brother had been&mdash;all
the sparkle and play dashed out as by a violent hand. The
smith and the men at the mill thought it a great pity, shook
their heads as they looked after him, then fell again to work,
or to mere happy lounging in the first spring airs.</p>

<p>The lonely horseman crossed the ford below the mill, drew
rein beneath the guide-post, and halted there for some minutes,
deep in thought. At last, with a shake of the head and
an impatient sigh, he spoke to Saladin, and once again they
took the main road. &quot;It is the third time,&quot; thought the rider.
&quot;There is luck in the third time.&quot;</p>

<p>The quiet highroad, wide and sunny, seemed to mock
him, and the torn white clouds sailing before the March wind
might have been a beaten navy, carrying with it a wreck of
hope. The gusty air brought a swirl of sere leaves across
his path, and the dust rose chokingly. &quot;Caw! caw!&quot; sounded
the crows from a nearby field. The dust fell, the wind passed,
the road lay quiet and bright. &quot;Never!&quot; said Cary between
his teeth. &quot;I will never give up!&quot;</p>

<p>Half an hour's riding, and he came in sight of a small
ordinary, its low porch flush with the road, a tall gum tree
standing sentinel at the back, and on the porch steps a figure
which, on nearer approach, he recognized as that of the innkeeper.
He rode up, dismounted, and fastened Saladin to the
horse-rack, then walked up to and greeted a weight of drowsy
flesh, centre to a cloud of tobacco smoke, and wedded for life
to the squat bottle and deep glass adorning the step beside it.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-morning, Mr. Cross.&quot;</p>

<p>The innkeeper stirred, removed his pipe, steadied himself
by a hand upon the step, and turned a dull red face upon the
speaker. &quot;Morning, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Cary! Which way did you
come, sir? I never heard you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came up from the ford. You were asleep, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Cross denied the imputation. &quot;Not at this hour, sir,
never at this hour&mdash;not at ten o'clock in the morning, sir!
Later, maybe, when I've had my grog, I'll take my forty
winks&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not ten o'clock. It is nearly twelve, Mr. Cross.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; returned Mr. Cross, whose face, blushing
all the time, showed at no particular instant any particular
discomfiture. &quot;I must just have dropped off a bit. There's
little business nowadays, and a man had better sleep than do
worse! What'll you have, sir? I'll call my girl Sally to serve
you.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing at the moment, Mr. Cross.&quot; Cary sat down
upon the step beside the other. &quot;I stopped here a month
ago&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did,&quot; answered the innkeeper. &quot;You stopped in
January, too, didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. In January.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I remember plain. You wanted to know this and you
wanted to know that, but you certainly treated me handsome,
sir, and I'm far from grudging you any information
Joe Cross can give!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We will go back to the same subject,&quot; said Cary. &quot;Any
recompense in my power to make I should consider but your
due, Mr. Cross, could you tell me&mdash;could you tell me what
I want to know.&quot;</p>

<p>He had spoken at first guardedly, but at last with an irresistible
burst of feeling. The innkeeper looked at him with
dull wonder. &quot;I'd do anything to oblige ye, Mr. Cary, I
certainly would! But when we come to talking about the
road, and who goes by, and who doesn't go by, and about
the seventh of September, and wasn't I asleep and dreaming
just before the big storm broke?&mdash;why, I say, sir, No! I
don't think I was. 'Tween man and man, Mr. Cary, I don't
mind telling your father's son, sir, that 'tis possible I might
ha' had a drop more than usual, and ha' been asleep earlier!
But I wasn't asleep when the negro spoke to me. 'Hit's
gwine ter be an awful storm,' says he, just that way, just as if
he were lonesome and frightened. His voice came to me as
plain as my hand, and I know the mare he was riding. 'Hit's
gwine ter be an awful storm,' says he&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The other&mdash;the other!&quot; exclaimed Cary impatiently.
&quot;It is the other I would know of!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you before, and I tell you now,&quot; replied Mr
Cross, &quot;that I don't seem somehow clearly to remember
what the other said. I'll take my oath that he said something,
for he's one that don't miss speaking to a voter when
he finds him! It's just slipped my mind&mdash;things act sometimes
as though there was a fog, but I wasn't drunk and
I wasn't asleep. No, sir! no more than I was just now when
you come up and spoke to me&mdash;and it don't stand to reason,
sir, that I could ha' seen two horses instead of one!&quot;</p>

<p>Cary, sitting moodily attentive, chin in hand, and his eyes
upon the sunny road, started violently. &quot;Two horses instead
of one,&quot; he repeated, with a catch of the breath. In a moment
he was upon his feet, and the innkeeper, had he looked
up and had he been less blear-eyed and dull, might have seen
an approach to the old Fairfax Cary&mdash;colour in cheek and
light in eye.</p>

<p>&quot;I am your debtor, Mr. Cross. That's it&mdash;that's precisely
it! You heard it asserted by all around you that he
had gone by, and your keen mind arrived at the same conclusion.
You saw and heard&mdash;in a fog&mdash;the negro boy,
and later on your strong imagination provided him with a
companion. Just that&mdash;you thought you saw two where
there was but one! I'm your servant, Mr. Cross, your very
humble, very obliged servant!&quot;</p>

<p>He drew out his purse, abstracted from it all the gold it
contained, and gently slid the pieces into the hand which
happened to rest upon the steps in an apt position for their
reception. &quot;A trifle of drink-money, Mr. Cross! If I might
suggest a toast, I would have you drink to the next Governor
of Virginia! Good-day, Mr. Cross, good-day! I think
I begin to remember.&quot;</p>

<p>He mounted and rode away. &quot;I begin to remember&mdash;I
begin to remember. The boy and I were not always together
upon the main road! Did we part at the guide-post? Then
where did we come together again?&quot;</p>

<p>He rode through March wind and sun, by fields where men
were ploughing and copses where the bloodroot bloomed,
beneath the branches of a great blasted oak, and past a red
bank shelving down to the road from the forest above, then
on by Red Fields, and so at last into Charlottesville. Here he
turned at once to the office of an agent and man of business
much respected in Albemarle.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith rubbed his hands and asked what he could
do for Mr. Cary&mdash;who was looking well, extremely well!
&quot;Spring is here, sir, spring is here! We all feel it. On a day
like this I cultivate my garden, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I also,&quot; said Cary. &quot;Mr. Smith, my affair is short. I
will thank you to keep it secret also. I want to buy, if possible,
a negro boy called Young Isham, who is owned by Lewis
Rand. You may offer any price, but my name is not to appear.
Manage it skilfully, Mr. Smith, but manage it! I
have reasons for wishing to own the boy. You will bear it in
mind that my name is not to appear as purchaser.&quot;</p>

<p>An hour later, nearing the Greenwood gates, he saw before
him another horseman, bent from the saddle and engaged
with the fastening. Cary rode up. &quot;Ned Hunter, is it you?
Why, man, I have not seen you this long while! Where have
you been in hiding?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have visited,&quot; answered Mr. Hunter, &quot;New York and
the Eastern Shore. You are looking well, Cary; better than
you did at Christmas. I was in this quarter, and so I thought
I would stop at Greenwood.&quot;</p>

<p>The two rode together up the hill, beneath the arching
oaks. The servants appeared, the horses were taken, and
Cary and his guest entered the quiet old house. A little later,
in the drawing-room, over a blazing fire and a bottle of wine,
Mr. Hunter laid aside a somewhat quaint air of injured
dignity, and condescended to speak of Fontenoy and of how
very changed it was since the old days. &quot;Nothing like so
bright, sir, nothing like so bright! I have not thought Miss
Dandridge looking cheerful for more than a year&mdash;and she
used to be the gayest thing! always smiling, and with something
witty to say every time I came near! I hate changes.
This is good wine, Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I do not, on the whole, think Fontenoy so changed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you? I do. Well, well, it is not the only place that
has changed! You've no sign yet, have you, Cary, of the
murderer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He still goes free.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If there's a man in the county that I dislike,&quot; remarked
Mr. Hunter, &quot;it is Lewis Rand. But if he had taken the river
road that day as he said he should, he and your brother
might have travelled together, and the two would have been
a match for the damned gypsy, or whoever it was, that shot
Mr. Cary. Have you ever noticed what little things make
all the difference? Shall I pour for you, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>As he said he should.</i> How do you know that he said he
should?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, he and I slept the night of the sixth of September at
the Cross Roads Inn&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, one gets strange housemates at an inn. Well, after
supper I went out on the porch and began calling to the dogs,
and he was there sitting on the steps in the dusk. The wind
was blowing, and there were fireflies, and the dogs were jumping
up and down. 'Down, Rover!' said I, 'Down, Di!
Down, Vixen!' And then Rand and I talked a bit, and I said
to him, 'The river road's bad, but it's much the shortest.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What,&quot; demanded Cary, in a strained voice,&mdash;&quot;what did
he answer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He answered, 'I shall take the river road.'&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter helped himself to wine. &quot;I was tired, and he
was tired, and I didn't like him anyway, and wasn't interested,
so I went on calling to the dogs, and we didn't speak
again. He and his negro boy went on at dawn, and he took,
after all, the main road. He isn't,&quot; finished Mr. Hunter,
&quot;the kind of person you think of as changeable, and it's a
thousand pities he didn't hold to his first idea! Things might
have been different.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary rose from the table. &quot;Would you swear, Hunter, to
what he said?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, certainly&mdash;before all the justices in Virginia. I
don't believe,&quot; said Mr. Hunter, &quot;that my parents could have
had good memories, for somehow things slip away from me&mdash;but
when I do remember, Cary, I remember for all time!&quot;
He drank his wine and looked around him. &quot;I haven't been
in this room, I don't believe, for five years! That was before
it was all done over like this. What a lot of Carys you've
got hanging on the walls&mdash;and just one left to sit and look at
them! You haven't a portrait of your brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Not upon the walls. If you're not fatigued, would
you object to riding with me to West Hill? That's the nearest
justice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not at all fatigued. But I can't see what you want it
taken down for&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; answered Cary patiently, &quot;but you'll
swear to it, all the same?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Mr Hunter, &quot;I can have no possible objection
to seeing my words in black and white. I'll take another
glass, and then I'll ride with you wherever you like.&quot;</p>

<p>At sundown Fairfax Cary, returning to Greenwood alone,
gave his horse to Eli, and presently entered the library. It
was a dim old room, unrenewed and unimproved, but the
two brothers had loved and frequented it. Now, in the
March sunset, with the fire upon the hearth, with the dogs
that had entered with the master, the shadowy corners, and
many books, it had an aspect both rough and gracious. It
was a room in which to remember, and it had an air favourable
to resolve.</p>

<p>The last of the Greenwood Carys walked to the western
window and stood looking out and up. He looked from a
hill-top, but the summit upon which lay the Cary burying-ground
was higher yet. The flat stones did not show, nor the
wild tangle of dark vine, but the trees stood sharp and black
against the vivid sky. Cary stood motionless, a hand on either
side of the window frame. The colour faded from the sky,
and there set in the iron grey of twilight. He left the window,
called for candles, and when they had been brought, sat
down at the heavy table and began to draw a map of the
country between the ford and Red Fields.</p>

<p>Three days later he rode into Charlottesville and stopped
at the office of Mr. Smith, whom he found at the back of the
house, watching from a chair planted in the sunshine the
springing of a line of bulbs. &quot;You see, sir,&quot; quoth the agent,
&quot;I cultivate my garden! Tulips here, crocus there, yonder
hyacinths. Red Chalice has been up two days, and my white
Amazon peeped out of the earth yesterday. King Midas and
Sulphur and Madame Mere are on the way. Well, Mr. Cary,
I tried my level best with that commission of yours, and I
failed! The boy is not for sale.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Cary, and stooped to examine the white
Amazon. &quot;I hardly expected, Mr. Smith, that he would be
for sale. At no price, I presume?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At no price. He is one of the house servants, and his
master is attached to him. I am very sorry, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>His client rose from the contemplation of the springing
hyacinth. &quot;Give yourself no uneasiness, Mr. Smith. I am
not disappointed. There are reasons, no doubt, why Mr.
Rand declines to part with him. Let us put it out of mind.
What a bright little garden you will have, sir, when tulip,
crocus, and hyacinth are all in bloom!&quot;</p>

<p>He took his leave, and rode homeward through the keen
March weather. &quot;I am beginning to remember quite
plainly,&quot; he said. &quot;Presently I'll know it like an old
refrain&mdash;every word, Saladin, every word, every word, down
to the last black one.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII" />CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h3>THE SIMPLE RIGHT</h3>


<p>An important case in a neighbouring county called
Lewis Rand from home, and kept him an April week
in the court room or in a small town's untidy tavern.
It was his habit, known and deferred to, never to accept at
such times the hospitality sure to be pressed upon him. The
prominent men of his party urged him home with them, but
accepted his refusal with a nod of understanding, and rode
on strong in the conviction that a man so absorbed, so given
over to watching and guarding his client's interests, was
assuredly a man to be relied upon in any litigation. A great
lawyer was like a great general&mdash;headquarters on the field.
As for Lewis Rand and the next election&mdash;if he wanted to be
Governor of Virginia, men who heard him in the court room
were not the ones to say him nay! To a rational man his
genius vindicated his birth. If he wanted the post, and if it
was to the interest of the state, in God's name let him have
it&mdash;old Gideon to the contrary!</p>

<p>Rand won the case, and turned Selim's head toward Albemarle.
There had been a weary half day of thanks and
protestations, and he was conscious of a dull relief when the
last house was left behind, when the cultivated fields fell
away, and the Virginian forest, still so dominant in the landscape,
opened its dark arms and drew him in.</p>

<p>He rode slowly now, with drooping head. Young Isham,
some yards behind, almost went to sleep in his saddle, so dragging
was the tread the mare must follow. The dark aisle of
the forest led presently through a gorge where the woods
were in effect primeval. Upon the one hand rose a bank, thick
with delicate moss and fern and shaded by birch and ash; on
the other the ravine fell precipitously to hidden water, and
was choked by towering pine and hemlock. The air was
heavy, cool, and dank, the sunshine entering sparsely. The
place was, however, a haunt of birds, and now a wood robin
answered its mate.</p>

<p>Rand rode more and more slowly. The way was narrow,
but here and there, between it and the bank, appeared grey
boulders sunk in all the fairy growth of early spring. He
drew rein, bared his head, and looked about him, then
dismounted and spoke to Young Isham, coming up behind.
&quot;I will sit here a little and rest, Young Isham. Take Selim
with you around the turn and wait for me there. I'm tired,
tired, tired!&quot;</p>

<p>The negro obeyed, and the master was left alone Beside
the road, beneath the mossy bank, lay a great fallen rock
Rand flung himself down upon this, and as he did so, he remembered
a river-bank, a sycamore, and a rock upon which
a boy of fourteen had lain and watched, coming over the
hill-top, distinct against the sunset sky, the god from the
machine It was such a stone as this, and it was seventeen
years ago &quot;Seventeen years. And a thousand years in
Thy sight&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The past weeks had seen a change in the condition of his
brain. He was yet all but sleepless, and the physical strain
had weakened his frame and sharpened his features, but the
sheer force of the man, asserting itself, had put down the
first wild inner tumult. Imagination was not now whipped to
giddy heights, it kept a full, dark level. When, at long intervals,
he slept, it was to dream, but not so dreadfully. He had
no more visions such as had haunted him in January. The
thought of Cary was with him, full and deep, a clean and
bitter agony, but he saw him no more save with the eye of the
mind. He was as rational as a sleepless man with a murder
on his soul might well be, and he suffered as he had hardly
suffered before.</p>

<p>With his face buried in his arms he lay very still upon
the rock. He lay in shadow, but the sunlight was on the treetops
above him. The wood robin yet uttered its bell-like note,
the moist wind brought down the bank the fragrance of the
fringe tree to blend with the deeper odour of the pine and
hemlock. Rand lay without moving, the fingers of one outstretched
hand clenched upon the edges of the rock. &quot;A
thousand years in Thy sight&mdash;and my day is as a thousand
years. Oh, my God!&quot;</p>

<p>The minutes passed, deep and grave, slow and full, with
the sense of afternoon, of solemn and trackless woods, unbreathed
air, silence and high heaven, then the April wind
swept up the gorge and brought the sound of water. Rand
sat up, resting his head upon his hands, and stared down the
shadowy steep. There were flowers growing close to him,
violets and anemones, and on a ledge of rock above, the
maiden-hair fern. His eyes falling upon them, they brought
to his mind, suddenly and sadly enough, Deb and her flower
ladies, all in a ring beneath the cedars&mdash;Faith and Hope and
Charity, Ruth and Esther and the Shulamite.</p>

<p>The recollection of that morning was followed by a thought
of the night before&mdash;of the Fontenoy drawing-room and of
all who had been gathered there. He saw the place again, and
he saw every figure within it&mdash;the two Churchills, the two
Carys, Unity, Jacqueline. &quot;There is not one,&quot; he thought,
&quot;to whom I've worked no harm. All that I have touched, I
have withered.&quot;</p>

<p>The wind again rushed up the gorge, a great stir of air that
swayed the trees, and filled the ravine with a sound like the
sea. Rand listened dully, staring down the steeps of pine and
hemlock, giant trees that had dwelt there long. A desolation
came upon him. The air appeared to darken and grow cold,
the wind passed, and the gorge lay very still. Rand bowed
himself together, and at last, with a dull and heavy throb, his
heart spoke. &quot;What shall I do,&quot; it asked, &quot;O God?&quot;</p>

<p>The Absolute within him made answer. &quot;The simple
right.&quot;</p>

<p>The wind returned, and the trees of the forest shook to the
blast. The simple right! Where was the simple right in so
complex a wrong? Step forward, backward, to either side&mdash;harm
and misery every way! And pride, and ambition,
and love, and human company&mdash;to close the door, to close
the door on all! &quot;No,&quot; said Rand, and set his teeth. &quot;No,
no!&quot;</p>

<p>The afternoon deepened in the gorge of the Blue Ridge.
Now the wind swept it and now the wind was still. The sunlight
touched the treetops, or fell through in shafts upon the
early flowers. From the mould of a million generations stalk
and leaf arose for their brief hour of light and life. When
it was spent, they would rest for aeon, then stir again. In
the silence was heard the fall of the pine cone.</p>

<p>Rand lay, face down, upon the rock. In his mind there was
now no thought of Cary, no thought of Jacqueline, nor of
Fairfax Cary, nor of any other of the dead and living. It was
the valley of the shadow of death, and his soul was at grips
with Apollyon.</p>

<p>He lay there until all the sunlight was withdrawn from the
gorge, and until Young Isham, frightened into disobedience,
came and touched him upon the shoulder. He lifted a grey
and twisted face. &quot;Yes, yes, Young Isham, it is late! Go
back, and I will come in a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>The negro went, and Rand arose from the rock, crossed
the road, and stood looking down toward the hidden water.
From somewhere out of the green gloom sounded the bird's
throbbing note, then all again was quiet, dank, and still. He
raised his arms, resting them and his face upon them against
the red bark of a giant pine. The thought of death in the
pool below came to him, but he shook his head. The door
was open, truly, but it led nowhere. His soul looked at the
chasm it must cross, shuddered, and crossed it. His arms
dropped from the tree and he raised his eyes to the blue
above. He was yet in a land of effort and anguish, but the
god within him saw the light.</p>

<h3>M. DE PINCORNET</h3>


<p>Malplaquet was a Cary place, leagued in friendship
as in blood with Greenwood. For seven
months it had esteemed itself in mourning for the
kinsman who had ridden from its gates to a violent death.
But there were young girls in the house, and now, in the
bright May weather, it was hard not to put forth leaf and
bud and be gay once more. Actual gayety would not do, the
place felt that, and very heartily; but pleasure that was
also education, pleasure well within bounds, and education
insisted upon, this might now be temperately indulged in.
There seemed no good reason why, in mid-spring, the dancing
class should not be held at Malplaquet, since it was the
most convenient house to a large neighbourhood, and there
were in the family three young girls.</p>

<p>The age esteemed dancing a highly necessary accomplishment,
and its acquisition meant work, and hard work, no
less than delightful play. Half a dozen young people came
to stay three days at the house; half a score more drove or
rode over in the afternoons, going home after ten by moonlight
or by starlight Their elders came with them, it was a
business of minuets and contra-dances, painstakingly performed
and solicitously watched A large old parlour gave
its waxed floor, Mr Pincornet's violin furnished the music,
and Mr Pincornet himself, lately returned to Albemarle
from his season in Richmond, imparted instruction and directed
the dance. The house was full from garret to cellar,
neighbours' horses in the stables, neighbours' servants in the
quarter. The long, low brick office standing under the big
oaks in the yard made, according to custom, a barracks for
the young men who, high of mettle, bold, and gay, rode in
from twenty miles around, ready to dance from dusk till
dawn, and then, in a bright garden and May weather, to
pursue some bits of muslin throughout a morning. Malplaquet
was in a state of sober glee when, inconveniently
enough, the one Cary whose mourning had not lightened
chanced, in ignorance of the dancing class, to ride through
the gates and up the hill.</p>

<p>It was his intention, it appeared, to spend the night which
was fast falling, and to ride back to Charlottesville in the
morning. The head of the Malplaquet Carys met him with
affection and apology. &quot;Young people will be young, Fair,
and Molly and I thought it best to humour them in this
no great thing! It's a mere lesson they're having. But
I'm sorry, cousin&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You need not be, sir,&quot; said the other. &quot;Ludwell would
have been the last man on earth to wish their spirit less, or
their pleasure less. It's time and the weather, sir,&mdash;Malplaquet
feels it with all the world. You must not be troubled,
and you must not disturb my cousins. I might ride on&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, Fair! No, no!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I won't. Give me a room in the office&mdash;I see the
house is full&mdash;and let Remus bring me supper there. If
you'll come over later, sir, we'll talk Embargo, and I'll give
you the up-county news. I'll to bed early, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I could come! By George, it would be a relief to
get away from all the bowing and scraping! You're sure
you aren't hurt, Fair?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite sure,&quot; answered the other, with his old smile.
&quot;I'll go now to the office, if I may. No need even to tell them
I am here.&quot;</p>

<p>Not to tell them was a thing more easily said than done.
Time was when Fairfax Cary would have been hailed delightedly,
drawn at once to the centre of things, and kept there by
the quick glances of young women, the emulative gaze of
neighbourhood gallants, and the approving consideration of
the elder folk. His presence was wont to make itself felt.
Now, when the news spread that he was at Malplaquet, there
was a break in the dance, a pause, a hush. &quot;What shall we
do?&quot; asked in distress the daughters of the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on dancing,&quot; was the reply. &quot;He'll have no difference
made. But when the lesson's over, you'll remember,
one and all, that he is here.&quot;</p>

<p>In the far room of the office, quiet, and with a porch of its
own, Cary got rid of the dust of the road, then ate the supper,
bountiful and delicate, brought by Remus and presided over
by the mistress of the house, who talked to him of Greenwood
and of his father. &quot;The best dancer, Fair, and, after
Henry Churchill, the handsomest man,&mdash;with <i>the</i> air, you
know, and always brave and gay and true as steel! They
said he was a good hater, and I know he was a good friend.
You take after him, Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwell did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know, I know&mdash;but you the most. Ludwell had
much from your mother&mdash;that strength and patience and
grace were Lucy Meade's. Well, well, I cry when I think of
it, so I'll not think! Is there nothing more you'll have?
Remus is to wait upon you&mdash;you hear, Remus? And now,
Fair, I'll go back to the children&quot;</p>

<p>Cary kissed her. &quot;Give them all three my love, and tell
little Anne to mind her steps. I've got a book to read, and
I'll go to bed early.&quot;</p>

<p>He sat over his book until nearly ten, then extinguished
his candles and stepped out upon the small, moonlit porch.
From the house, a hundred yards away, came the sound of
the violin, and of laughter, subdued but genuine. Cary drew
a chair to the porch railing and sat down, resting his elbow
upon the wood, his cheek upon his hand. The violin brought
the thought of Unity. The laughter did not grate upon him.
His nature was large, and the mirth at Malplaquet did no
unkindness as it meant none. He sat there quietly until the
music stopped and the lesson came to an end. The pupils
not staying overnight went away, as testified the sound of
wheel and stamp of hoof, the laughing voices and lingering
good-byes, audible from the front of the house. This noise
died, then, after an interval, lights appeared in upper windows.
Slender arms and hands, put far out, drew to the
wooden shutters; clear, girlish voices said good-night, and
were answered by fervent and deeper tones below.</p>

<p>The quiet proper to the hour drew on, the lighted windows
darkened one by one, and presently there appeared at the
office the master of the house, accompanied by two or three
young men. These greeted Cary soberly, but with much
kindness. &quot;We've put,&quot; said the host, &quot;all the talkative
rattlepates away in the house, and given you three sensible
men! Mr. Bland has the room at the other end, Jack Minor
and Nelson the one next to him, and in the little room beside
yours, Fair, we'll stow Mr. Pincornet. They've all danced
themselves tired, and the whole place is to have a quiet
night.&quot; The three sensible men went, after a little, to their
several quarters, and the kinsman continued: &quot;The class
ends to-night, Fair. To-morrow morning all go away except
the Blands and the Morrises and George Harvie's little
Dorothea. The house will be quiet, and you are not to ride
away from us in the morning! Good-night&mdash;God bless
you!&quot;</p>

<p>Cary, left alone, watched the lights go out in the rooms of
Mr. Bland, Mr. Minor, and Mr. Nelson. He thought, &quot;I
will go to bed and go to sleep&quot;; then, so bright was the
moonlight, so sweet and fragrant and now silent the night,
that he stayed on upon the little porch, his arms against the
railing, his eyes now on the moon, now on the quiet great
house and the shadowy clumps of trees. Presently Mr.
Pincornet, the moon whitening his old brocade and his
curled wig, came from the house, crossed the grass, and
mounted to the porch upon which his small room opened.</p>

<p>He started as he saw the figure by the railing. &quot;Who is
it?&quot; he demanded, in his high, cracked voice; then, &quot;Ah, I
see, I see! A thousand pardons, Mr. Cary,&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are to be neighbours to-night,&quot; said Cary. &quot;It has
been long since we met, Mr. Pincornet. I am glad to see you
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been in Richmond,&quot; said the dancing master,
&quot;since&mdash;since September.&quot;</p>

<p>Cary touched a chair near him with a gesture of invitation.
&quot;Won't you sit down? It is too beautiful a night to go early
to bed, and I do not think we will disturb the others' slumbers.
But perhaps you are tired&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The practice of my art does not tire me,&quot; answered Mr.
Pincornet. &quot;I will watch the moon with you for as long as
you please. We had nights such as this near Aire, when I
was young&quot;</p>

<p>He sat down, leaning his chin upon his beruffled hand. The
light falling full on his companion showed the dark dress and
above it the quiet, much altered face. Mr. Pincornet sighed,
and tapped nervously upon the railing with the fingers of his
other hand. &quot;Mr Cary, I have not seen you since&mdash;Pray
accept my profound condolences, my sympathy, and my admiration.&quot;</p>

<p>His old pupil thanked him. &quot;All my brother's friends
and mine are most kind. I should guess that you have yourself
seen many sorrows, Mr. Pincornet.&quot;</p>

<p>The Frenchman's face twitched. &quot;Many, sir, many. I have
experienced the curse of fortune. Eh bien! one pays, and all
is said! I have grieved with you, sir, I beg you to believe
it. I admired your brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was worthy of admiration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the south, near Maul&eacute;on, I lost such an one&mdash;brother
not in blood but in friendship, a friendship pure as the
flowers of spring and strong as the vintage of autumn. His
own troops turned Jacobin and scoundrel, mutinied, shot
him down&mdash;Ha!&quot; Mr. Pincornet drew out his box and took
snuff with trembling fingers. &quot;Well! the King's side was
uppermost for a while down there, and we had our revenge&mdash;we
had our revenge&mdash;we had our revenge! But,&quot; he ended
sadly, &quot;it could not bring back my poor Charles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you think of it as revenge?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I thought of it as justice. It was that, sir. Those
soldiers paid, but they owed the debt&mdash;every sou they owed
it! He was,&quot; continued Mr. Pincornet, &quot;gallant and brave,
a great lover, a great fighter. He was to my heart, though not
of my blood&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man that I have lost,&quot; said Cary, &quot;was of my blood
and to my heart. I am left alone of an old house. And I pursue
justice, Mr. Pincornet, I pursue justice, I pursue justice.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Pincornet looked at the face opposite him. &quot;I think,
sir, you will capture that to which you give chase. I have
been in town, away from the country, but I hear the talk,
and sometimes I read the papers. You have not taken the
murderer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is strange!&quot; exclaimed the other. &quot;And no one suspected?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suspect,&quot; answered Cary sternly, &quot;but the world in
general does not, or suspects wrongly. You were not at the
inquest which was held?&quot;</p>

<p>The dancing master shook his head. &quot;In your sorrow, sir,
such matters were, naturally, not brought to your notice.
I fell ill, in the first days of September, at Red Fields, of a
cold upon the lungs. I gave up my art and lay at death's
door. My head was light; I heard and I thought of nothing
but the faces and the voices around about Aire where I was
young. I recovered, and, in the stage, I went to Richmond.
To ask who is it you suspect would be a question indiscreet&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Cary sat with his eyes upon the dark azure above the treetops.
&quot;Not yet,&quot; he said, in a brooding voice; &quot;I have him
not yet. Did you, Mr. Pincornet, have any scruple when
you took vengeance, near Maul&eacute;on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None, sir! I served justice. Soldiers are not levied to
murder at once their faith and their officers. No more scruple
than is yours in hunting down the wild beast that killed
your brother! You have my wishes there for a good hunting!&quot;</p>

<p>The Ancien R&eacute;gime put up his snuffbox and brushed the
fallen grains from his old, old red brocade. &quot;What a night
for music and for love! The road down yonder&mdash;it is like
the silver ribbon they wear&mdash;they wore&mdash;at court!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The road&mdash;the road!&quot; exclaimed Cary. &quot;I travel it in
my sleep. It haunts me as I haunt it. I know all its long
stretches, all its turns&mdash;&quot; He sighed, and moved so as to
face the whitened ribbon.</p>

<p>&quot;You ride,&quot; said the dancing master; &quot;but, for my own
convenience, I go afoot, and it is probable that I know it
best.&quot;</p>

<p>They sat gazing down past garden and hillside to the still
highway. &quot;I have not walked upon it, however,&quot; continued
Mr. Pincornet reflectively, &quot;since September. I then went
afoot from Clover Hill to Red Fields, where I was taken ill.
It was the seventh of September.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The seventh of September!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I remember the day,&quot; continued Mr. Pincornet, &quot;because
I sat down under a tree beside the road to rest, and I
had an almanac in my pocket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You remember it by nothing else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, by one thing more,&quot; answered the other. &quot;I sat
there, my head on my hand, perhaps thinking of nothing,
perhaps thinking of France&mdash;an empty road and in the sky
black clouds&mdash;when suddenly&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;<i>clatter,
crash!</i> through the wood opposite and down a tall
red bank to the road came another pupil of mine&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; said Cary. &quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>Something fell to the floor with a slight sound. It was the
book that had rested upon Cary's crossed knee. He stooped
and picked it up, then, straightening himself, looked again
at the silver ribbon. &quot;Black clouds in the sky,&quot; he said, in
a curious voice, &quot;and the seventh of September, M. de
Pincornet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the other, &quot;by the almanac. That was
two days, was it not, before your brother's death?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My brother, sir, was murdered upon the seventh of
September.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The seventh! The ninth! You mean the ninth! I heard it
so when I recovered&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You heard it wrongly. It was the seventh.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence; then, &quot;Indeed,&quot; said the dancing
master, in a curious dry and shocked voice. &quot;The seventh.
At what hour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not known. Perhaps about midday, perhaps a little
later&mdash;when there were black clouds in the sky.&quot;</p>

<p>The silence fell again, hard and full of meaning, then Cary
leaned forward and laid his hand upon the other's arm
&quot;I've hunted long alone, now we'll hunt for a moment
together! Tell me again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He came down the bank in a great noise and rolling of
stone and earth. There were thick woods on the top of the
bank. He came out of them like Pluto out of the earth&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alone. But he had a negro waiting for him down the
road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He told you that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I left my tree and we talked a little. He was torn, he was
breathless. He explained that he had started a doe and had
followed through the woods. He left me and went down the
road to meet his negro. They passed me, and when I came to
Red Fields, I was told they had paused there. I said nothing
of our meeting. I was very tired and the storm was breaking.
Before it was over I was hot and cold and shaking and ill in
my bed. I was ill, as I have told you, for a long time. The
ninth! I always thought it was the ninth&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would you know again the place where this chase occurred?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He came down the bank opposite the blasted oak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; breathed Cary; then, after a moment, &quot;I stopped
my horse beneath that tree this morning, and my eyes rested
upon that red bank. And I did not know! We are very
blind.&quot; He rose. &quot;Will you come indoors, sir? I wish to
light the candles again.&quot;</p>

<p>They entered the small bedroom. Cary lighted the candles,
placed them upon the table, and closed the shutters of the one
window. From the breast of his riding-coat he took a rolled
paper. &quot;This is a map of the country below Red Fields.
I made it myself. Now let us see, sir, let us see!&quot;</p>

<p>He pinned the map down with ink-well, sand-box, book,
and candlestick, which done, the two bent over it. &quot;Call it,&quot;
said Cary, &quot;a military map of your country near Maul&eacute;on.
Now, sir, look! Here is what a man did.&quot;</p>

<p>The demonstration proceeded, and it was carried out with
keenness and with a very fair approach to accuracy. &quot;Here is
Malplaquet, which one passes about nine in the morning,
and there by the candlestick is Red Fields, certainly on the
main road and certainly paused at by&quot;&mdash;he glanced aside
at the other's face&mdash;&quot;by the murderer, M. de Pincornet!
Now let us mark this fox that doubles on himself.&quot;</p>

<p>The long, curled wig of the Frenchman and the younger
man's handsome head with the hair gathered back into a
black ribbon bent lower over the map. &quot;Forrest's forge, the
mill, the ford, he passed these places under such and such
circumstances&mdash;here, where I rest the pen, stands the guide-post.
This line is your silvered ribbon, this is the main road
that makes a sweep around the broken country. This heavy,
black, and jagged line is the river road. They both took the
river road, as both had said they would&mdash;my brother to me,
the murderer to a man at the Cross Roads Inn. The negro
boy kept on by the main road. Where is this riven oak?&quot;
He dipped the quill into the ink-well. &quot;I correct my map
according to my better knowledge. That tree stands two
miles below Red Fields, just above the turn where, fifty years
ago, was the Indian ambush. We'll mark it here, black and
charred. Here is the bank, crowned by woods. The growth
is very thick between it and&quot;&mdash;his hand, holding the pen,
travelled across the sheet&mdash;&quot;the river road just east of
Indian Run.&quot;</p>

<p>He laid down the pen, and turned from the table to the
open door. &quot;The moon is not bright enough, or I would go
to-night. I want sunlight, or I want storm-light, for that ride
across from road to road! Five hours till morning.&quot; He returned
to the dancing master. &quot;When, in your country, the
man you loved was to be avenged, and his murderers punished,
you were glad of aid, were you not? I shall be thankful
for every least thing that you can tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He came,&quot; said the &eacute;migr&eacute;, &quot;like Pluto out of the earth.
He was breathless as one out of prison&mdash;his linen was
torn. There was,&quot; the narrator's voice halted, then hardened
in tone,&mdash;&quot;there was blood upon his sleeve. At the time I
supposed that, in bursting through that grille of the forest,
branch or briar had drawn it. There was blood, sir, about
your brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. If the murderer stooped to know if life was out, it
might have happened so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was not pale, I think, but he spoke in a strange
voice. 'Ha!' he said, 'I started a doe ten minutes since,
and gave her chase through the wood. Now I will rejoin
my boy a little way down the road. Are you on your way to
Charlottesville?' I told him I would go to Red Fields, upon
which he said adieu and turned his horse. A little later he
and his boy passed me, riding in a cloud of dust and under
black skies.&quot; The dancing master raised a glass of water
that was upon the table and moistened his lips. &quot;This,
Mr. Cary, is all my aid. I admired your brother, and there is,
sir, a something about you that returns Charles to my memory.
If it pleases you, and if our host will lend me a horse,
I will ride with you in the morning, as far at least as the oak
and that red bank down which he came.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I accept your offer, sir,&quot; answered the other, &quot;with gratitude.
You did not chance to notice his holsters?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;except that his saddle had holsters. I have seen
his pistols. I saw them one night at Monticello. He told
me that they were a gift from his patron.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. They were given by Mr. Jefferson, and the other's
name is upon them. Moreover, he travelled armed from
Richmond to Roselands. I acquired that knowledge in the
autumn. I would that iron could speak&mdash;if it could, and if
human effort be of avail, I would yet have those pistols in
my holding!&quot;</p>

<p>He took the map from the table, rolled it up, and restored
it to its place. &quot;It grows late,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us to bed and to
sleep. It is the eve of a decisive engagement, M. de Pincornet.
If you'll permit me, I will call you at five. Remus shall make
us coffee, and we'll make free with a horse for you from the
stables. Then the road again! but this time I go no farther
than the ford, on that white ribbon yonder. You shall keep
the highroad, but I will take the river road, and yet I'll hold
tryst with you beneath that riven oak!&quot; He began to put out
the candles. &quot;I shall sleep and sleep well until dawn, and I
wish for you, sir, as good a night. For the aid which you have
given me, I am most heartily your servant.&quot;</p>

<p>Alone in the little room, he straightened, mechanically, the
objects upon the table, paced for a time or two the narrow,
cell-like place, then went out again upon the porch and stood
with his hands on the railing, and his eyes raised to the white
moon, full and serene in the cloudless night. &quot;For without,&quot;
he said, &quot;are dogs and sorcerers and murderers and whosoever
loveth and maketh a lie.&quot; He stood for a long while
without movement, but at last let fall his hands, turned, and
went indoors. When, a little later, he threw himself upon his
bed and drew his hand across his eyes, he found that it was
wet with tears. He spoke aloud, though hardly above his
breath. &quot;No, Ludwell, no! In this sole thing I am right.
It is not revenge. I am not vindictive, I am not revengeful.
This is justice, and I can no other than pursue it. It will
not grieve you where you are.&quot; He turned and buried his
face in the pillow. &quot;O brother&mdash;O friend&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The emotion passed and he lay staring at the ceiling,
reconstructing midday of September the seventh beside

<h3>UNITY AND JACQUELINE</h3>


<p>The library at Fontenoy lay west and north. In the
afternoon the sun struck through the windows and
through the glass door, brightening the tall clock-face,
the faint gilt and brown of old books, and the portrait
of Henry Churchill with the swords crossed beneath. Upon
the forenoon in question, and even though the month was
May, the room looked a sombre place, chill and dusk, shaded
and grave as a hermit's cell.</p>

<p>In the great chair upon the hearth sat Colonel Churchill,
somewhat bowed together and with his hand over his eyes. By
the window stood Major Edward, very upright, very meagre,
soldierly, and grey. The northern light was upon him; with
his pinned-up sleeve and lifted head he looked a figure of old
defeats and indomitable mind. From the middle of the room
Fairfax Cary faced both the Churchills.</p>

<p>In his dark riding-dress, standing with his gloved hand
upon the table, he gave in look and attitude a suggestion of
formality, a subtle conveyance of determination. He had been
speaking, and now, after an interruption from one of the
brothers, he continued. &quot;That was two weeks ago. I have
it clear, and I have my witness. The murderer, leaving the
body of my brother beside Indian Run, turned his horse, and,
at a point just east of the rock where grows the mountain ash,
he quitted the road for the mountain-side. It is desperate
riding over that ridge, but he made it as, two weeks ago, I
made it, and he came out, as I came out, upon the high
bank above the main road, a few yards below the blasted
oak. That, Colonel Churchill, is what he did, and what a
jury shall see that he did.&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Dick let fall his hand. &quot;Fair, Fair, I never gainsaid
that he was a villain&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He appeared,&quot; continued the younger man, &quot;before my
witness, torn and breathless. There was blood upon his
sleeve. Now see what he does. He rejoins his negro, and, if
I know my man, he intimidates this boy into silence like the
grave. Together they pause at Red Fields, a precaution that
quite naturally suggests itself to the lawyer mind. But it is
in the gloom of the storm, and he does not dismount&mdash;a
course which, again, he knows to be wise. Apparently Red
Fields notices nothing. He rides on. But he has yet to pass
through town, to be accosted here, there, at the Eagle, the
post-office, to be forced, perhaps, under peril of his refusal
being scanned, to get down from his horse, answer questions,
drink and talk with acquaintances. He is torn, dishevelled.
There is blood upon his sleeve. What does he think as he
rides from Red Fields? He thinks, 'Where can I best put
myself in order, and remove this witness?' That would be
his thought, and he would have the answer ready. He rode on
to the edge of town, and there he stopped at Tom Mocket's.&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward left the window. As he passed his brother,
he laid for a moment his hand upon the elder's shoulder.
The touch was protective, almost tender. &quot;It's a rough
wind, Dick! Bow your head and let it go over.&quot; He marched
away, dragged a chair to the table, and sat down. &quot;Very
well,&quot; he said. &quot;He stopped at Tom Mocket's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but not merely at the gate, as he testified. He
went into the house, and there he washed the blood-stain
from his sleeve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you prove that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can prove that he went into the house. A negro, running
from the storm, saw him enter. When that girl&mdash;Vinie
Mocket&mdash;is put upon the stand, I expect to prove the remainder.
Now, the pistol&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Dick rose, walked heavily to the glass door, then
back to the hearth. &quot;You stand there, as I have seen your
father stand. Well, go on! We are men, Edward and I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His pistols are handsome ones, the gift of Mr. Jefferson.
The murderer's name is engraved upon them. He has made,
since September, a number of journeys, and he travels always
with holsters to his saddle. Well, not long ago, I bribed the
hostler of a tavern where I knew he was to sleep. I have seen
the arms he carries. Two holsters, two pistols&mdash;but the
latter do not match! A different maker, a heavier weight, and
the owner's name but indifferently etched. And yet there is in
Richmond a man who will swear to Mr. Rand's leaving town
with the President's gift intact! The inference is, I think, that
somewhere between Indian Run and Roselands the weapon
vanished&mdash;how and when and where I have yet to find. I
expect to recover it, and in the mean time I expect to force
an explanation of those mismatched pistols.&quot;</p>

<p>He had been standing without motion&mdash;manner, voice,
and attitude restrained and somewhat formal. He now
moved, took his hand from the table, and folded his arms.
&quot;I came,&quot; he said, &quot;to tell you, Colonel Churchill, and you,
Major Edward, you who were my brother's friends and my
father's friends, I came to tell you that I shall apply for and
obtain a warrant for the arrest of Lewis Rand.&quot;</p>

<p>The words fell heavily, and when they were spoken, there
was a silence in the library. Major Edward broke it. &quot;You
are determined, and I waste no breath in challenging the
inevitable. So be it! The child will come home to us, Dick.&quot;</p>

<p>The elder brother walked the length of the room and
paused before the picture of Henry Churchill. When at last
he turned, his ruddy face was pale, his eyes wet. &quot;Henry
was a proud man. We grow old, and we grow to be thankful
that the dead are dead! Well, Edward, well! we've weathered
much&mdash;I reckon we can weather more.&quot; He halted at the
glass door and stared out into the flowering garden. &quot;My
little Jack!&quot; he muttered, and drew his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>Cary spoke from where he yet stood beside the table. &quot;I
am aware&mdash;how can I be other than aware?&mdash;of the sorrow
and anxiety which I bring upon this house. As regards
myself, you have but to indicate your wishes, sir. I will come
no more to Fontenoy, if my coming is unwelcome. One interest
here I confidently entrust to your generosity. For the
rest I will bow to your decision. If you tell me so, sir, I will
come no more&mdash;though Fontenoy is well nigh as dear to me
as Greenwood, and though I love and honour every inmate
here.&quot;</p>

<p>His voice broke a little. There was a silence, then Colonel
Dick swung around from the glass door. &quot;Don't talk
damned nonsense, Fair,&quot; he said gruffly.</p>

<p>Major Edward spoke from the old green chair. &quot;We'll
bring no unnecessary factors into this business, Fairfax. I
don't conceive that it is necessary for us to quarrel. It is not
you who have wrought the harm&mdash;that burden rests elsewhere.
Have you seen Unity?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then we had better send for her.&quot; The Major rose and
pulled the bell-rope. &quot;Some one must go to Roselands.
When do you propose to act?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very soon, sir. Almost at once. I anticipate no resistance
and no flight. I'll give him his due. He is bold and he is
ready, and the court room is his chosen field, where his gods
fight for him. He'll give battle.&quot;</p>

<p>The last of the Greenwood Carys moved from his place,
walked to the window, and stood there in the light from the
north. &quot;Before Unity comes, sir, there is something I would
like to say. It pertains to myself. You have known me, both
of you, all my life, and you knew my father before me. You
know what my brother was to me&mdash;brother, guardian,
friend. You two have lived your life together; think, each of
you, how bitter now would be the other's loss. What if all
was yet youth and fire and promise&mdash;and a villain struck
one down, put out life at a blow, and denied the deed!
Denied! went on with trumpets to place and honour! What
would you do, Colonel Churchill, or you, Major Edward?
You would do as I have done, and you would weigh no
circumstance, as I have weighed none. Moreover, right is
right, and law and justice must not curtsy even to pity for
the innocent and tenderness for those who suffer! It is right
that this man should feel the hand of Justice. And I can see
it as no other than right that I&mdash;when all her paid soldiers
failed&mdash;should have taken it on myself to bring him there,
before her bar. It is this which I shall do, and the end is not
with me, but with right and law and order, with the weal of
society, yes, and with the man's own proper reaping of the
harvest which he sowed! Else he also is monstrous, and there
is nothing not awry.&quot; He paused, made a slight and dignified
gesture with his hands, and went on. &quot;I have done that
which I had to do. I abide the consequences. But it is hard
to bring trouble on you here, and to bring great trouble on&mdash;on
one other. I wish you to know that, though I go my way,
I go with a pained and heavy heart.&quot;</p>

<p>He broke off, and stood with his eyes upon the younger of
the two brothers; then, after a moment and with a note of
appeal in his voice, &quot;Major Edward&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Major Edward raised his hawk eyes and resolute face.
&quot;Trouble enough, yes, heavy trouble&mdash;but I should have
done as you have done! It is all in the great battle, Fair.
We'll be friends still, Fontenoy and Greenwood. There is
Unity at the door.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From the Fontenoy coach Unity, who had not been to
Roselands since December, regarded the quiet old place
through a sudden mist of tears. The driveway from the gate
was sunk in green; a hundred trees kept the place secluded,
sylvan, and still. Hardly any bloom appeared,&mdash;the flowers
were all in the quiet garden hidden by the house,&mdash;but
through a small open space could be seen the giant beech
tree by the doorstone.</p>

<p>Unity dried her eyes with her handkerchief, and bit her
lips until they were red again. &quot;If you're nothing but a bird
of omen,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;at least you needn't show it!
Oh, this world!&quot; then, &quot;What if he is not from home?&quot;</p>

<p>In the early winter she had advanced several pretexts
for not troubling Roselands, had found them accepted by
Jacqueline with an utter lack of comment, and had ceased to
make them. She kept away, and her cousin made no complaint.
What pretext, now, she wondered, would serve to explain
this visit? She thought that pretext would be needed
at first&mdash;just at first. And what if Lewis Rand were at
home?</p>

<p>He was not at home. Jacqueline met her upon the great
doorstone, kissed her, and held her hand, but made no
exclamation of surprise and asked no questions. The coach
and four, with old Philip and Mingo, rolled away to the
stable, and the cousins entered the cool, wide hall. &quot;You will
lay aside your bonnet?&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;Such a lovely
bonnet, Unity!&mdash;and your blue lutestring! Come to my
room.&quot;</p>

<p>In the chamber Unity untied her blue bonnet-strings and
laid the huge scoop of straw upon the white counterpane;
then, at the mirror, slowly drew off her long gloves, and took
from her silken bag her small handkerchief. The action
of her hands, now deliberate, now hurried, was strange for
Unity, whose habit it was to be light and sure. &quot;Do you
remember,&quot; she asked, with her face still to the mirror,&mdash;&quot;do
you remember the last time I wore this gown?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You wore it,&quot; said Jacqueline, in a trembling voice, &quot;to
church, in August&mdash;to Saint John's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. That Sunday when all the world was there. I smell
the honeysuckle again, and hear FitzWhyllson's viol! That
was our last old, happy day together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it was. The very next day the world seemed somehow
to change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that a way the world has?&quot; asked Jacqueline.
&quot;Change and change and change again&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Unity, &quot;but never to the same, never to
the same again&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>A silence fell in the room that was all flowered chintz.
Unity, raising her eyes to the glass, saw within it her cousin
where she leaned against a chair&mdash;saw the face, the eyes, the
lips&mdash;saw the mask off. Unity gasped, wheeled, ran to the
chair, and, falling on her knees beside it, clasped her cousin
in her arms. &quot;O Jacqueline! O Jacqueline, Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline rested her hands upon the other's shoulders.
&quot;Why did you come to-day, Unity? The last time was December.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I came&mdash;I came&quot;&mdash;sobbed Unity, &quot;just to bring you
their love&mdash;Uncle Dick's and Uncle Edward's and Aunt
Nancy's&mdash;and to say that Fontenoy is still home, and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jacqueline. &quot;But this is my home now, Unity.
It has been&quot;&mdash;she raised her arms&mdash;&quot;it has been my home
for many and many a day! You may tell them that; you may
tell it to Fairfax Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't&mdash;don't think of him as an enemy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think of him as he is. What is the message, Unity?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have none&mdash;I have none,&quot; cried Unity, &quot;except that
whatever happens&mdash;whatever happens, Jacqueline, you are
the darling of us all&mdash;of the old home and Uncle Dick and
Uncle Edward and Aunt Nancy and Deb and me and all the
servants! There is none at Fontenoy that does not love and
honour you! Think of us, and come to us&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When? When, Unity?&quot;</p>

<p>Unity rose. &quot;Now, if you will, darling&mdash;dearest&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline smiled. &quot;Now? When you are married, you
will find that you cannot leave home so easily.&quot; She crossed
the bedroom floor to a window, and stood with her hands on
either side of the casement, and with her face lifted to the
pure blue heaven.</p>

<p>Unity waited with held breath. &quot;She knows&mdash;she
knows,&quot; said her beating heart.</p>

<p>Jacqueline came back to the middle of the room. &quot;Thank
them for me, Unity, and tell them that I cannot leave my
husband now.&quot; Her touch, clay-cold and fluttering, fell upon
her cousin's arm. &quot;There are wisdom and goodness in the
world, and they wish to see things rightly, if only they had the
power. Tell them at Fontenoy, and tell Fairfax Cary, too,
that they have not altogether understood! Even he&mdash;even
the one who is dead&mdash;did not quite do that, though he came
more nearly than any. It is my hope and my belief that now
he understands, forgives, and sees&mdash;and sees the dawn in
the land!&quot;</p>

<p>She raised her head, and the expression of her face was
exquisite. No longer wan, she stood as though the flush of
dawn were upon her. It paled, and the air of tragedy enfolded
her again, but the light had been there, and it left her
majestic. The grace within her and the sweetness were
unfailing. She came now to her cousin, put an arm around
her, and kissed her on the cheek. &quot;You love truly, too,&quot;
she whispered. &quot;When trouble comes, you'll understand&mdash;you'll
understand!&quot;</p>

<p>Unity held her to her and wept. &quot;O Jacqueline!&mdash;O
Jacqueline!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You put on the blue gown to remind me, didn't you?&quot;
asked Jacqueline. &quot;I didn't need any reminding, dear. It is
all with me, all the old, frank, happy days; all the time when
I was a girl and we used to sit, just you and I, by my window
and watch the stars come out between the fir branches! And
I love you all, every one of you. And I do not blame Fairfax
Cary. It is destiny, I think, with us all. But I want you to
know&mdash;and you can tell them that, too,&mdash;that there is
one whom I love beyond every one else, beyond life, death,
fear, anguish, meeting, and parting. Loving him so, and not
despairing of a life to come when we are all washed clean,
my dear, when we are all washed clean&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Her voice broke and she moved again to the window. The
clock ticked, the sun came dazzling in, a fly buzzed against
the pane. Jacqueline turned. &quot;Tell them that they are all
dear to me, but that my home is here with my husband. Tell
them that Lewis Rand&mdash;that Lewis Rand&quot;&mdash;She put her
hands to her breast. &quot;No. I have not power to tell you that&mdash;not
yet, not yet! But this I say&mdash;my uncles were soldiers,
and they fought bravely and witnessed much, but I have seen
a battlefield&quot;&mdash;She shuddered strongly and brought her
hands together as if to wring them, then let them fall instead
and turned upon her cousin a face colourless but almost
smiling. &quot;It is strange,&quot; she said, &quot;what pain we grow to call
Victory. Let's talk of it no more, Unity.&quot; She caressed the
other's hand, raised it to her lips, and kissed it.</p>

<p>&quot;I did not come to stay,&quot; said Unity brokenly. &quot;You had
rather be alone. The evening is falling and they look for me
at home. When you call me, I will come again. Are you sure&mdash;are
you sure, Jacqueline, that you understand what they&mdash;what
they sent me to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand enough,&quot; said Jacqueline, in a very low
voice, and kissed her cousin upon the brow.</p>

<h3>THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR</h3>


<p>Rand closed the heavy ledger. &quot;It is all straight,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>&quot;It's as straight as if 'twas a winding-up forever,&quot;
answered Tom. &quot;Are you going home now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's almost nothing on the docket. I've seen no such
general clearance since you began to practise and took me
in. You say you're going to refuse the Amherst case?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have refused it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; quoth Tom, &quot;I might as well go fishing. The
weather's right, and every affair of yours is so cleaned and
oiled and put to rights that there's nothing here for a man to
do. One might suppose you were going a long journey. If
you don't want me to-morrow, I'll call on old Mat Green&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't go fishing to-morrow, Tom,&quot; said Rand from the
desk, &quot;but don't come here either. Stay at home with Vinie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won't be coming in from Roselands?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't be coming here.&quot; Rand left the desk and stood
at the small window where the roses were now in bloom. &quot;I
shall send you a note, Tom, to-morrow morning. It will tell
you what&quot;&mdash;He paused for a moment. &quot;What comes
next,&quot; he finished. &quot;There will be a message in it for Vinie.&quot;
He turned from the window. &quot;I am going home now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a good time for a holiday,&quot; remarked Tom, &quot;and
you needn't tell me that you don't need it, Lewis! I'll lock
up and go to the Eagle for a while. What are you looking
for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; answered the other. &quot;I was looking at the
room itself. I always liked this office, Tom.&quot;</p>

<p>As he passed, he touched his subaltern upon the shoulder.
There was fondness in the gesture. &quot;Good-bye,&quot; he said,
and was gone before Tom could answer.</p>

<p>Outside, in the bloom and glow of the May evening, he
mounted Selim and rode out of the town. The people whom
he met he greeted slightly, but with no change of manner
which they afterwards could report. It was sunset when he
passed the last houses, and turned toward the west and his
own home. He rode slowly, with his eyes upon a great sea of
vivid gold. By degrees the brightness faded, changing to an
amethyst, out of which suddenly swam the evening star. The
land rose into hills, the summits of the highest far and dark
against the cold violet of the sky. From the road to Roselands
branched the road to Greenwood. It was dusk when horse
and rider reached this opening. Selim had come to know the
altered grasp upon the rein just here, and now, according to
wont, he fell into the slower pace. Rand turned in his saddle
and looked across the darkening fields to the low hill, crowned
with oaks, from which arose the Greenwood house. He gazed
for a full minute, then spoke to his horse and they went on
at speed. A little longer and he was at the gates of home.</p>

<p>His wife met him upon the doorstone. &quot;I heard you at the
gate&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He put his arm around her. &quot;What have you been doing
all the long day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I worked,&quot; she answered, &quot;and saw to the house, and read
to Hagar at the quarter. She's going fast. How tired your
voice sounds! Come into the light. Supper is ready&mdash;and
Mammy Chloe has said a charm to make you sleep to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>They went indoors to the lighted rooms. &quot;You are wearing
your amethysts,&quot; said Rand, &quot;and the ribbon in your hair&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She turned upon him a face exquisite in expression. &quot;They
are the jewels that you like&mdash;the ribbon as I wore it long ago.
Come in&mdash;come in to supper.&quot;</p>

<p>The brief meal ended, they returned to the drawing-room.
Rand stood irresolutely. &quot;I have yet a line to write,&quot; he told
her. &quot;I will do it here at your desk. When I have finished,
Jacqueline, then there is something I must say.&quot;</p>

<p>He sat down and began to write. She moved to the window,
then restlessly back to the lighted room and sat down
before the hearth, but in a moment she left this, too, and
moved again through the room. She passed her harp, and as
she did so, she drew her hand across the strings. The sweet
and liquid sound ran through the room. Rand turned. &quot;I
have not heard,&quot; he said, in a low voice,&mdash;&quot;I have not heard
that sound since&mdash;since last August. Will you sing to me
now?&quot;</p>

<p>She touched the harp again. &quot;Yes, Lewis. What shall I
sing?&quot;</p>

<p>He rose, walked to the window, and stood with his face to
the night. &quot;Sing those verses you sang that night at Fontenoy&quot;;
then, as she struck a chord, &quot;No, not To Althea&mdash;the
other.&quot;</p>

<p>She sang. The noble contralto, pure, rich, and deep,
swelled through the room.</p>

<p>
&quot;The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Doth ask a drink divine&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Her voice broke and her hands dropped from the strings.
She rose quickly and left the harp. &quot;I cannot&mdash;I cannot
sing to-night. The air is faint&mdash;the flowers are too heavy.
Come out&mdash;come out to the wind and the stars!&quot;</p>

<p>Without the house the evening wind blew cool, moving the
long branches of the beech tree, and rustling through the
grass. To the west the mountains showed faintly, in the valley
a pale streak marked the river. The sky was thick with
stars. Behind them, through the open door, they heard the
tall clock strike. &quot;I did not tell you,&quot; said Jacqueline, &quot;of
all my day. Unity was here this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unity!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. For an hour. She came with&mdash;with messages. My
uncles send me word that they love me, and that Fontenoy is
my home always&mdash;as it used to be. Whenever I wish, I am
to come home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you answer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I answered that they were all dear to me, but that my
home was here with you. I told Unity to tell them that&mdash;and
to tell it, too, to Fairfax Cary.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a silence; then, &quot;It does not matter,&quot; said
Rand slowly. &quot;Whether it is done my way, or whether it is
done his way, Fairfax Cary will not care. He is concerned
only that it shall be done. You understood the message,
Jacqueline?&quot;</p>

<p>She answered almost inaudibly. &quot;Yes, I understood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seven months&mdash;and Ludwell Cary lies unavenged. I
have been slow. But I had to break a strong chain, Jacqueline.
I had fastened it, link by link, around my soul. It was
not easy to break&mdash;it was not easy! And I had to find a
path in a desert place.&quot;</p>

<p>She bowed her head upon her arms. &quot;Do I not know what
it was? I have seen&mdash;I have seen. O Lewis, Lewis!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is broken,&quot; he said, &quot;and though the desert is yet
around me, my feet have found the path. To-morrow,
Jacqueline, I give myself up.&quot;</p>

<p>She uttered a cry, turned, and threw herself into his arms.
&quot;To-morrow! O Love!&quot;</p>

<p>He bent over her with broken words of self-reproach. She
stopped him with her hand against his lips. &quot;No, I am not
all unhappy&mdash;no, you have not broken my heart&mdash;you
have not ruined my life! Don't say it&mdash;don't think it! I
love you as I loved you in the garden at Fontenoy, as I loved
on our wedding eve, in the house on the Three-Notched
Road! I love you more deeply now than then&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have come,&quot; he answered, &quot;to be sorry for almost all
my life. Even to my father I might have been a better son.
The best friend a young man ever had&mdash;that was Mr. Jefferson
to me! and it all ended in the letter which he wrote last
August. I was a leader in a party in whose principles I believed
and still believe, and I betrayed my party. To-night I
think I could give my life for one imperilled field, for one
green acre of this land&mdash;and yet I was willing to bring
upon it strife and dissension. Ingrate and traitor&mdash;hard
words and true, hard words and true! I might have had a
friend&mdash;and always I knew he was the man I would have
wished to be&mdash;but, instead, I thought of him as my foe and
I killed him. I have brought trouble on many, and good to
very few. I have wronged you in very much. But I never
wronged you in my love&mdash;never, never, Jacqueline! That is
my mountain peak&mdash;that is my cleansing sea&mdash;that is that
in my life which needs no repenting, that is true, that is right!
Oh, my wife, my wife!&quot;</p>

<p>The night wind blew against them. Fireflies shone and
grey moths went by to the lighted windows; above the treetops
a bat wheeled and wheeled. The clock struck again, then
from far away a whippoorwill began to call. They sat side by
side upon the doorstone, her head against his shoulder, their
hands locked.</p>

<p>&quot;What will you do?&quot; he said. &quot;What will you do? Day
and night I think of that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Could I stay on here? I would like to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have put all affairs in order. The place and the servants
are yours. I'vee paid every debt, I think. Mocket knows&mdash;he'll
show you. But to live on here alone&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be the less alone. Don't fear for me&mdash;don't think
for me. I will find courage. To-morrow!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is best,&quot; he said, &quot;that I should tell you that which others
may think to comfort you with. It is possible, but I do not
consider it probable, that the sentence will be death. It will
be, I think, the Penitentiary. I had rather it was the other.&quot;</p>

<p>After a time she spoke, though with difficulty. &quot;Yes&mdash;I
had rather&mdash;for you. For myself, I feel to-night that just to
know you were alive would be happiness enough. Either
way&mdash;either way&mdash;to have loved you has been for me my
crown of life!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have written to Colonel Churchill, and a line to Fairfax
Cary. There was much to do at the last. Now it is all done,
and I will go early in the morning. You knew that it was
drawing to this end&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I knew&mdash;I knew. Lewis, Lewis! what will you
do yonder all the days the months&mdash;the&mdash;the years to
come? Oh, unendurable! O God, have mercy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will work,&quot; he answered. &quot;It is work, Jacqueline, with
me&mdash;it is work or die! I will work. That which I have
brought upon myself I will try to endure. And out of effort
may come at last&mdash;I know not what.&quot;</p>

<p>They sat still upon the stone. The wind sank, the air grew
colder; near and far there gathered a feeling of the north, a
sense of loneliness and untrodden space. The whippoorwill
called again.</p>

<p>Rand shuddered. &quot;Our last night&mdash;it is our last night.
Look!&mdash;a star shot over the Three-Notched Road.&quot;</p>

<p>Jacqueline slipped from his clasp and stood upright, with
her hands over her ears. &quot;Come indoors&mdash;come indoors! I
cannot bear the whippoorwill!&quot;</p>

<p>Early the next morning he rode away. Halfway down the
drive he looked back and saw her standing under the beech
tree. She raised her hand, her scarf fluttering back from
it. It was the gesture of a princess, watching a knight ride
from her tower. The green boughs came between them; he
was gone, and she sank down upon the bench beneath the
tree. It was there that Major Edward found her, an hour
later.</p>

<p>Rand passed along the old, familiar road. He travelled
neither fast nor slow, and he kept a level gaze. The May
morning was fresh and sweet, the land to either side ploughed
earth or vernal green, the little stream laughing through the
meadow. He passed a field where negroes were transplanting
tobacco, and his mind noted the height and nature of the leaf.
At the Greenwood road he looked mechanically toward the
distant house, but upon this morning he hardly thought of
Cary. He thought of Gideon Rand, and of the great casks of
tobacco which he and his father used to roll; of the old, strong
horses, and of a lean and surly dog that they had owned; of
the slow journeys, and of their fires at night, beneath the gum
and the pine, beside wastes of broom sedge.</p>

<p>He came into Charlottesville and rode down Main Street
to the Eagle, where he dismounted. A negro took his horse.
&quot;Put him up,&quot; directed Rand, &quot;until he is called for.&quot; He
kept his hand for a moment upon Selim's neck, then turned
and walked down the street and into the Court House yard.</p>

<p>The shady place had always a contingent of happy idlers,
men and boys lounging under the trees or upon the Court
House steps. These greeted Lewis Rand with deference,
and turned from their bountiful lack of occupation to watch
him cross the grass and enter the Court House. &quot;He's gone,&quot;
remarked one, &quot;straight to the sheriff's office. What's his
business there?&quot;</p>

<p>The next day and the next the idlers in the Court House
yard knew all the business, and rolled it under their tongues.
They loved a tragedy, and this curtain had gone up with
promise. Had they not seen Lewis Rand walk into the yard&mdash;had
they not spoken to him and he to them&mdash;had they
not watched him enter the Court House? The boy who
minded the sheriff's door found himself a hero, and the words
treasured that fell from his tongue. It was true that he had
been sent away and so had heard but little, but the increasing
crowd found that little of interest. &quot;Yes, sir, that's what he
said, and just as quiet as you are! 'Is the sheriff in, Michael?'
he asked. 'Tell him, please, that I want to see him.' That's
what he said, and Mr. Garrett he calls out, 'Come in, Mr.
Rand, come in!'&quot;</p>

<p>Other voices claimed attention. &quot;And when they dragged
Indian Run yesterday, there was the pistol at the bottom of
a pool&mdash;his name upon it, just as he told them it would
be&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fairfax Cary was in the court room yesterday when he
was committed. He and Lewis Rand spoke to each other,
but no one heard what they said.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy came to the front again. &quot;I didn't hear much that
morning before Mr. Garrett sent me away, but I heard why
he gave himself up. I thought it wasn't much of a reason&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The crowd pressed closer, &quot;What was it, Michael, what
was it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It sounds foolish,&quot; answered the boy, &quot;but I've got it
right. He said he must have sleep.&quot;</p>

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
