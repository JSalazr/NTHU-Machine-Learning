  SIR JAMES KNOTT</h2>

  <p>MY DEAR SIR JAMES,</p>

  <p>We have travelled far since those early days when you and I,
  who are of totally different tastes and temperament, first met
  and became friends. I was attracted by your wide knowledge,
  versatile vigour of mind, and engaging personality, which
  subsequent years have not diminished. You were strenuously
  engaged at that time in breaking down the weevilly traditions of
  a bygone age, and helping to create a new era in the art of
  steamship management, and, at the same time, studying for the
  Bar; and were I writing a biography of you, I would have to
  include your interesting travels in distant lands in quest of
  business and organizing it. That must be left for another
  occasion, when the vast results to the commercial life of the
  country to which you contributed may be fittingly told.</p>

  <p>At the present time my vision recalls our joyous yachting
  cruises on the Clyde, when poor Leadbitter added to the charm
  that stays. Perhaps best of all were the golden days when we
  habitually took our week-end strolls together by the edge of the
  inspiriting splendour of the blue North Sea, strolls which are
  hallowed by many memories, and gave me<a name="Page_6" id=
  "Page_6"></a> an opportunity of listening to your vehement
  flashes of human sympathies, which are so widely known now. It is
  my high appreciation of those tender gifts and of your personal
  worth, together with the many acts of kindness and consideration
  shown to me when I have been your guest, that gives me the desire
  to inscribe this book to you and Lady Knott, and to the memory of
  your gallant sons, Major Leadbitter Knott, D.S.O., who was killed
  while leading his battalion in a terrific engagement in Flanders,
  and Captain Basil Knott, who fell so tragically a few months
  previously at his brother's side.</p>

  <p>With every sentiment of esteem,<br />
  I am, dear Sir James,<br />
  Ever yours sincerely,<br />
  <br />

  <h2><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><a name="PREFACE" id=
  "PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p>This book has evolved from another which I had for years been
  urged to write by personal friends. I had chatted occasionally
  about my own voyages, related incidents concerning them and the
  countries and places I had visited, the ships I had sailed in,
  the men I had sailed with, and the sailors of that period. It is
  one thing to tell sea-tales in a cosy room and to enjoy living
  again for a brief time in the days that are gone; but it is
  another matter when one is asked to put the stories into book
  form. Needless to say for a long time I shrank from undertaking
  the task, but was ultimately prevailed upon to do so. The book
  was commenced and was well advanced, and, as I could not depict
  the sailors of my own period without dealing&mdash;as I thought
  at the time&mdash;briefly with the race of men called buccaneers
  who were really the creators of the British mercantile marine and
  Navy, who lived centuries before my generation, I was obliged to
  deal with some of them, such as Hawkins, Drake, Frobisher,
  Daimper, Alexander Selkirk of Robinson Crusoe fame, and others
  who combined piracy with commerce and sailorism. After I had
  written all I thought necessary about the three former, I
  instinctively slipped on to Nelson as the greatest<a name=
  "Page_8" id="Page_8"></a> sea personality of the beginning of the
  last century. I found the subject so engrossing that I could not
  centre my thoughts on any other, so determined to continue my
  narrative, which is not, and never was intended to be a life of
  Nelson. Perhaps it may be properly termed fragmentary thoughts
  and jottings concerning the life of an extraordinary human force,
  written at intervals when I had leisure from an otherwise busy
  life.</p>

  <p>Even if I had thought it desirable, it was hardly possible to
  write about Nelson without also dealing with Britain's great
  adversary and Nelson's distracted opinion of him.</p>

  <p>It would be futile to attempt to draw a comparison between the
  two men. The one was a colossal human genius, and the other,
  extraordinary in the art of his profession, was entirely without
  the faculty of understanding or appreciating the distinguished
  man he flippantly raged at from his quarterdeck.</p>

  <p>But be that as it may, Nelson's terrific aversion to and
  explosions against the French and Napoleon, in whose history I
  had been absorbed for many years, seem to me to be the deliberate
  outpouring of a mind governed by feeling rather than by knowledge
  as to the real cause of the wars and of how we came to be
  involved and continue in them. Nor does he ever show that he had
  any clear conception of the history of Napoleon's advent as the
  Ruler of the People with whom we were at war.</p>

  <p>I have given this book the title of "Drake, Nelson and
  Napoleon" because it seemed to me <a name="Page_9" id=
  "Page_9"></a>necessary to bring in Drake, the prototype, and
  Napoleon, the antagonist of Nelson.</p>

  <p>Drake's influence bore fruit in what is known as the Fleet
  Tradition, which culminated in the "Nelson touch." No excuse is
  needed, therefore, for writing a chapter which shows how little
  the seaman's character has changed in essentials since that time.
  To-day, our sailors have the same simple direct force which
  characterized the Elizabethan seamen and those of Nelsonian
  times.</p>

  <p>Of Napoleon I have written fully in my book "The Tragedy of
  St. Helena," and have contented myself here with pointing out how
  the crass stupidity and blind prejudice of his opponents have
  helped largely to bring about the world-war of our own times. I
  have also endeavoured to contrast the statesmanlike attitude of
  Napoleon with the short-sighted policy of England's politicians
  and their allies at that time.</p>

  <p>Having planned the book on such lines, it inevitably follows
  that Nelson must occupy a larger space in it than either Drake or
  Napoleon, but for that I offer no apology.</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>The great sailors of the Elizabethan era&mdash;Hawkins, Drake,
  Frobisher, Howard, Davis, and Sir Humphrey Gilbert&mdash;were the
  prototypes of the sailors of the nineteenth century. They
  discovered new lands, opened up new avenues of commerce, and
  combined these legitimate forms of enterprise with others which
  at this date would be regarded as rank piracy. Since, however,
  they believed themselves to be the ambassadors of God, they did
  everything in His name, whether it were the seizing of Spanish
  treasure or the annexing of new worlds by fair means or foul,
  believing quite sincerely in the sanctity of what they did with a
  seriousness and faith which now appear almost comic.</p>

  <p>For many years the authorities of the Inquisition had
  plundered goods and put to death English seamen and merchants,
  and Spanish Philip, when remonstrated with, shrugged his
  shoulders and repudiated the responsibility by saying that he had
  no power over the "Holy House." Drake retaliated by taking
  possession of and bringing to England a million and a half of
  Spanish treasure while the two countries were not at war.
  <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>It is said that when Drake
  laid hands on the bullion at Panama he sent a message to the
  Viceroy that he must now learn not to interfere with the
  properties of English subjects, and that if four English sailors
  who were prisoners in Mexico were ill-treated he would execute
  two thousand Spaniards and send him their heads. Drake never
  wasted thought about reprisals or made frothy apologetic speeches
  as to what would happen to those with whom he was at religious
  war if they molested his fellow-countrymen. He met atrocity with
  atrocity. He believed it to be his mission to avenge the burning
  of British seamen and the Spanish and Popish attempts on the life
  of his virgin sovereign. That he knew her to be an audacious
  flirt, an insufferable miser, and an incurable political
  intriguer whose tortuous moves had to be watched as vigilantly as
  Philip's assassins and English traitors, is apparent from
  reliable records. His mind was saturated with the belief in his
  own high destiny, as the chosen instrument to break the Spanish
  power in Europe. He was insensible to fear, and knew how to make
  other people fear and obey him. He was not only an invincible
  crusader, but one of those rare personalities who have the power
  of infusing into his comrades his own courage and enthusiasm. The
  Spanish said he was "a magician who had sold his soul to the
  devil." The Spanish sailors, and Philip himself, together with
  his nobles, were terror-stricken at the mention of his name. He
  was to them an invincible dragon. Santa Cruz warned his <a name=
  "Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>compatriots that the heretics "had
  teeth, and could use them." Here is another instance, selected
  from many, of the fanatical superstitions concerning Drake's
  irresistible power. Medina Sidonia had deserted the Andalusian
  squadron. Drake came across the flagship. Her commander said he
  was Don Pedro de Valdes, and could only surrender on honourable
  terms. The English commander replied, "I am Drake, and have no
  time to parley. Don Pedro must surrender or fight." So Don Pedro
  surrendered to the gallant captain of the <i>Revenge</i>, and
  lavished him with praise, evidently glad to have fallen into the
  hands of so famous and generous a foe. Drake is said to have
  treated his captive with elaborate generosity, while his crew
  commandeered all the vast treasure. He then sent the galleon into
  Dartmouth Harbour, and set off with his prisoners to chase Medina
  Sidonia.</p>

  <p>In the whole range of Drake's adventurous career there does
  not appear to be any evidence of his having been possessed with
  the idea of supernatural assistance, though if perchance he
  missed any of Philip's treasure-ships he complacently reported
  "the reason" to those in authority as "being best known to God,"
  and there the incident ended. On the other hand, the Deity was no
  mystery to him. His belief in a Supreme Power was real, and that
  he worked in harmony with It he never doubted. When he came
  across anything on land or sea which he thought should be
  appropriated for the benefit of his Queen and country, or for
  himself and those who were <a name="Page_20" id=
  "Page_20"></a>associated with him in his piratical enterprises,
  nothing was allowed to stand in his way, and, generally speaking,
  he paralysed all resistance to his arms into submission by an
  inexorable will and genius. The parsimonious Elizabeth was always
  slyly willing to receive the proceeds of his dashing deeds, but
  never unduly generous in fixing his share of them. She allowed
  her ships to lie rotting when they should have been kept in sound
  and efficient condition, and her sailors to starve in the streets
  and seaports. Never a care was bestowed on these poor fellows to
  whom she owed so much. Drake and Hawkins, on the other hand, saw
  the national danger, and founded a war fund called the "Chatham
  Chest"; and, after great pressure, the Queen granted
  &pound;20,000 and the loan of six battleships to the Syndicate.
  Happily the commercial people gave freely, as they always do.
  What trouble these matchless patriots had to overcome! Intrigue,
  treason, religious fanaticism, begrudging of supplies, the
  constant shortage of stores and provisions at every critical
  stage of a crisis, the contradictory instructions from the
  exasperating Tudor Queen: the fleet kept in port until the
  chances of an easy victory over England's bitterest foes had
  passed away! But for the vacillation of the icy virgin, Drake's
  Portugal expedition would have put the triumph of the Spanish
  Armada to the blush, and the great Admiral might have been saved
  the anguish of misfortune that seemed to follow his future daring
  adventures for Spanish treasure on land and sea until the shadows
  of failure compassed <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>him
  round. His spirit broken and his body smitten with incurable
  disease, the fleet under his command anchored at Puerto Bello
  after a heavy passage from Escudo de Veragua, a pestilential
  desert island. He was then in delirium, and on the 28th January,
  1596, the big soul of our greatest seaman passed away beyond the
  veil. His body was put into a lead and oak coffin and taken a few
  miles out to sea, and amidst manifestations of great sorrow he
  was lowered down the side and the waters covered him over. Two
  useless prize ships were sunk beside him, and there they may
  still lie together. The fleet, having lost their guiding spirit,
  weighed anchor and shaped their course homewards.</p>

  <p>Drake was not merely a seaman and the creator of generations
  of sailors, but he was also a sea warrior of superb naval genius.
  It was he who invented the magnificent plan of searching for his
  country's enemies in every creek into which he could get a craft.
  He also imbued Her Gracious Majesty and Her Gracious Majesty's
  seamen with the idea that in warfare on sea or land it is a first
  principle to strike first if you wish to gain the field and hold
  it. Having smashed his antagonist, he regarded it as a plain duty
  in the name of God to live on his beaten foes and seize their
  treasures of gold, silver, diamonds, works of art, etc., wherever
  these could be laid hold of. The First Lady of the Land was
  abashed at the gallant sailor's bold piratical efforts. She would
  not touch the dirty, ill-gotten stuff until the noble fellow had
  told her the fascinating story <a name="Page_22" id=
  "Page_22"></a>of his matchless adventures and slashing successes.
  Doubtless the astute Admiral had learned that his blameless Queen
  was only averse to sharing with him the plunder of a risky voyage
  until he had assured her again and again that her cousin, Philip
  of Spain, had his voracious eye on her life, her throne, and all
  her British possessions, wherever they might be.</p>

  <p>The valiant seaman appears to have played daintily and to good
  effect with the diabolical acts of the Spaniards, such as the
  burning of English seamen, until they roused in Elizabeth the
  spirit of covetousness and retaliation. It was easy then for her
  incorruptible integrity (!) to surrender to temptation. A
  division of what had been taken from Philip's subjects was
  forthwith piously made. Elizabeth, being the chief of the
  contracting parties, took with her accustomed grace the queenly
  share. On one occasion she walked in the parks with Drake, held a
  royal banquet on board the notorious <i>Pelican</i>, and knighted
  him; while he, in return for these little attentions, lavished on
  his Queen presents of diamonds, emeralds, etc. The accounts which
  have been handed down to us seem, in these days, amazing in their
  cold-blooded defiance of honourable dealing. But we must face the
  hard facts of the necessity of retaliation against the revolting
  deeds of the Inquisition and the determined, intriguing policy of
  worming Popery into the hearts of a Protestant nation, and then
  we realize that Drake's methods were the "invention" of an
  inevitable alternative either to fight this <a name="Page_23" id=
  "Page_23"></a>hideous despotism with more desperate weapons and
  greater vigour than the languid, luxury-loving Spaniards had
  taken the trouble to create or succumb to their tremendous power
  of wealth and wickedness. Drake was the chosen instrument of an
  inscrutable destiny, and we owe it to him that the divided
  England of that day was saved from annihilation. He broke the
  power of Spain at sea, and established England as the first naval
  and mercantile Power in the world. He was the real founder of
  generations of seamen, and his undying fame will inspire
  generations yet unborn to maintain the supremacy of the seas.</p>

  <p>The callous, brutal attitude of Elizabeth towards a race of
  men who had given their lives and souls so freely in every form
  of danger and patriotic adventure because they believed it to be
  a holy duty is one of the blackest pages of human history. The
  cruelties of the Spanish Inquisition and the treatment of sailors
  in the galleys were only different in degree, and while there are
  sound reasons for condemning the Queen and the ruling classes of
  that time for conduct that would not be tolerated in these days,
  it is unquestionably true that it was a difficult task to keep
  under control the spirit of rebellion of that period, as it is
  to-day. Doubtless those in authority were, in their judgment,
  compelled to rule with a heavy hand in order to keep in check
  wilful breaches of discipline.</p>

  <p>Attempts to mutiny and acts of treason were incidents in the
  wonderful career of Francis Drake which frequently caused him to
  <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>act with severity. Doughty,
  the Spanish spy, who was at one time a personal friend of
  Drake's, resolved to betray his commander. Doughty was caught in
  the act, tried by a court composed of men serving under Drake,
  found guilty, and after dining with the Admiral, chatting
  cheerfully as in their friendly days, they drank each other's
  health and had some private conversation not recorded; then
  Doughty was led to the place of execution and had his head
  chopped off, Drake exclaiming as it fell, "Lo, this is the end of
  traitors!" Then Drake relieved Fletcher of his duties as chaplain
  by telling him softly that he would "preach this day." The ship's
  company was called together and he exhorted them to harmony,
  warning them of the danger of discord. Then in his breezy
  phraseology he exclaims, "By the life of God, it doth even take
  my wits from me to think of it." The crew, it appears, was
  composed of gentlemen, who were obviously putting on airs, and
  sailors, who resented their swank as much as did the great
  captain. So Drake proceeds to lay the law down vehemently. "Let
  us show ourselves," said he, "all to be of one company, and let
  us not give occasion to the enemy to rejoice at our decay and
  overthrow. Show me the man that would refuse to set his hand to a
  rope, but I know that there is not any such here." Then he
  proceeds to drive home his plan of discipline with vigour. "And
  as gentlemen are necessary for government's sake in the voyage,
  so I have shipped them to that and to some further intent." He
  does not say <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>quite what it is,
  but they doubtless understand that it is meant to be a warning
  lest he should be compelled to put them through some harsh form
  of punishment. He concludes his memorable address with a few
  candid words, in which he declares that he knows sailors to be
  the most envious people in the world and, in his own words,
  "unruly without government," yet, says he, "May I not be without
  them!" It is quite clear that Drake would have no class
  distinction. His little sermon sank deep into the souls of his
  crew, so that when he offered the <i>Marigold</i> to those who
  had lost heart, to take them back to England, he had not only
  made them ashamed of their refractory conduct, but imbued them
  with a new spirit, which caused them to vie with each other in
  professions of loyalty and eagerness to go on with him and comply
  with all the conditions of the enterprise.</p>

  <p>The great commander had no room for antics of martyrdom. He
  gave human nature first place in his plan of dealing with human
  affairs. He did not allow his mind to be disturbed by trifles. He
  had big jobs to tackle, and he never doubted that he was the one
  and only man who could carry them to a successful issue. He took
  his instructions from Elizabeth and her blustering ministers,
  whom he regarded as just as likely to serve Philip as the Tudor
  Queen if it came to a matter of deciding between Popery and
  Protestantism. He received their instructions in a courtly way,
  but there are striking evidences that he was ever on the watch
  for their <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>vacillating pranks,
  and he always dashed out of port as soon as he had received the
  usual hesitating permission. Once out of reach, he brushed aside
  imperial instructions if they stood in the way of his own
  definite plan of serving the best interests of his country, and
  if the course he took did not completely succeed&mdash;which was
  seldom the case&mdash;he believed "the reason was best known to
  God."</p>

  <p>John Hawkins and Francis Drake had a simple faith in the
  divine object they were serving. Hawkins thought it an act of
  high godliness to pretend that he had turned Papist, in order
  that he might revenge and rescue the remnant of his poor comrades
  of the San Juan de Ulloa catastrophe, who were now shut up in
  Seville yards and made to work in chains. Sir John hoodwinked
  Philip by making use of Mr. George Fitzwilliam, who in turn made
  use of Rudolfe and Mary Stuart. Mary believed in the genuineness
  of the conspiracy to assassinate Elizabeth and set up the Queen
  of Scots in her place, to hand over Elizabeth's ships to Spain,
  confiscate property, and to kill a number of anti-Catholic
  people. The Hawkins counterplot of revenge on Philip and his
  guilty confederates was completely successful. The comic audacity
  of it is almost beyond belief. The Pope had bestowed his blessing
  on the conspiracy, and the Spanish Council of State was
  enthusiastically certain of its success. So credulous were they
  of the great piratical seaman's conversion, that an agreement was
  signed pardoning Hawkins for his acts of piracy in the West
  Indies and other places; a <a name="Page_27" id=
  "Page_27"></a>Spanish peerage was given him together with
  &pound;40,000, which was to be used for equipping the privateer
  fleet. The money was duly paid in London, and possibly some of it
  was used for repairing the British squadron which Hawkins had
  pronounced as being composed of the finest ships in the world for
  him to hand over to Philip, even though they had been neglected
  owing to the Queen's meanness. The plausible way in which the
  great seaman put this proposition caught the imagination of the
  negotiators. They were captivated by him. He had caused them to
  believe that he was a genuine seceder from heresy and from
  allegiance to the Queen of England, and was anxious to avow his
  penitence for the great sins he had committed against God and the
  only true faith, and to make atonement for them in befitting
  humility. All he asked for was forgiveness, and in the fullness
  of magnanimity they were possibly moved to ask if, in addition to
  forgiveness, a Spanish peerage, and &pound;40,000, he would like
  to commemorate the occasion of his conversion by a further token
  of His Spanish Majesty's favour. It is easy to picture the
  apparent indifference with which he suggested that he did not ask
  for favours, but if he were to ask for anything, it would be the
  release from the Inquisition galleys of a few poor sailor
  prisoners. The apparently modest request was granted. Hawkins had
  risked his life to accomplish this, and now he writes a letter to
  Cecil beginning "My very good Lord." I do not give the whole of
  the letter. Suffice it to <a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>say
  that he confirms the success of the plot so far as he is
  concerned, and in a last paragraph he says, "I have sent your
  Lordship the copy of my pardon from the King of Spain, in the
  order and manner I have it, with my great titles and honours from
  the King, from which God deliver me."</p>

  <p>The process by which Hawkins succeeded in obtaining the object
  he had in view was the conception of no ordinary man. We talk and
  write of his wonderful accomplishments on sea and land, as a
  skilful, brave sailor, but he was more than that. He was, in many
  respects, a genius, and his courage and resolution were
  unfailingly magnificent.</p>

  <p>I dare say the prank he played on Philip and his advisers
  would be regarded as unworthy cunning, and an outrage on the
  rules of high honour. Good Protestant Christians disapproved
  then, as now, the wickedness of thus gambling with religion to
  attain any object whatsoever, and especially of swearing by the
  Mother of God the renunciation of the Protestant faith and the
  adoption of Roman Catholicism. The Spaniards, who had a hand in
  this nefarious proceeding, were quite convinced that, though
  Hawkins had been a pirate and a sea robber and murderer, now that
  he had come over to their faith the predisposition to his former
  evil habits would leave him. These were the high moral grounds on
  which was based the resolve to execute Elizabeth and a large
  number of her subjects, and take possession of the throne and
  private <a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>property at their
  will. It was, of course, the spirit of retaliation for the
  iniquities of the British rovers which was condoned by their
  monarch. In justification of our part of the game during this
  period of warfare for religious and material ascendancy, we stand
  by the eternal platitude that in that age we were compelled to
  act differently from what we should be justified in doing now.
  Civilization, for instance, so the argument goes, was at a low
  ebb then. I am not so sure that it did not stand higher than it
  does now. It is so easy for nations to become uncivilized, and
  we, in common with other nations, have a singular aptitude for it
  when we think we have a grievance. Be that as it may, Hawkins,
  Drake, and the other fine sea rovers had no petty scruples about
  relieving Spaniards of their treasure when they came across it on
  land or on their ships at sea. Call them by what epithet you
  like, they believed in the sanctity of their methods of carrying
  on war, and the results for the most part confirmed the accuracy
  of their judgment. At any rate, by their bold and resolute deeds
  they established British freedom and her supremacy of the seas,
  and handed down to us an abiding spirit that has reared the
  finest seamen and established our incomparable merchant fleet,
  the largest and finest in the world.</p>

  <p>There is no shame in wishing the nation to become imbued with
  the spirit of these old-time heroes, for the heritage they have
  bequeathed to us is divine and lives on. We speak of the great
  deeds they were guided to perform, but <a name="Page_30" id=
  "Page_30"></a>we rarely stop to think from whence the inspiration
  came, until we are touched by a throbbing impulse that brings us
  into the presence of the great mystery, at which who would dare
  to mock?</p>

  <p>It is strange that Hawkins' and Drake's brilliant and tragic
  careers should have been brought to an end by the same disease
  within a short time of each other and not many miles apart, and
  that their mother, the sea, should have claimed them at last in
  the vicinity of the scene of their first victorious encounter
  with their lifelong enemies, the Spaniards. The death of the two
  invincibles, who had long struck terror into the hearts of their
  foes, was the signal for prolonged rejoicings in the Spanish Main
  and the Indies, while the British squadron, battered and
  disease-smitten, made its melancholy way homeward with the news
  of the tragedy.</p>

  <p>For a time the loss of these commanding figures dealt a blow
  at the national spirit. There are usually long intervals between
  C&aelig;sars and Napoleons. Nations have, in obedience to some
  law of Nature, to pass through periods of mediocre rule, and when
  men of great genius and dominating qualities come to clear up the
  mess, they are only tolerated possibly by fear, and never for
  long by appreciation. A capricious public soon tires of these
  living heroes. It is after they are dead that they become abiding
  examples of human greatness, not so much to their contemporaries
  as to those generations that follow them. The historian has a
  great deal to do with the manner in which the fame of a great man
  is handed down <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>to posterity,
  and it should never be forgotten that historians have to depend
  on evidence which may be faulty, while their own judgment may not
  always be sound. It is a most difficult task to discipline the
  mind into a perfectly unbiased condition. The great point is to
  state honestly what you believe, and not what you may know those
  you are speaking to wish you to say. The contemporaries of
  Hawkins and Drake unquestionably regarded them with high
  admiration, but I question whether they were deified then as they
  are now. The same thing applies to Nelson and Collingwood, of
  whom I shall speak later on, as the historian has put the stamp
  upon their great deeds also.</p>

  <p>Drake and Hawkins attracted attention because of their daring
  voyages and piratical enterprises on Spanish property on sea and
  land. Every obstacle was brushed aside. Danger ever appealed to
  them. They dashed into fortified ports filled with warships fully
  equipped, silenced the forts, sank and set fire to Philip's
  vessels, and made everything and everybody fly before them in the
  belief that hell had been let loose. To the superstitious Spanish
  mind it seemed as though the English must be under Satanic
  protection when they slashed their way undaunted into the midst
  of dangers which would inevitably spell death for the mere
  mortal. These corsairs of ours obviously knew and took advantage
  of this superstition, for cannon were never resorted to without
  good reason, and never without effect. The deliberate defiance of
  any written or unwritten <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>law
  that forbade their laying hands on the treasure they sought so
  diligently, and went far and near to find, merely increased
  public admiration. Elizabeth pretended that they were very trying
  to her Christian virtues. But leave out of count the foregoing
  deeds&mdash;which no one can dispute were prodigious, and quite
  equal to the part these men played in the destruction of the
  Armada&mdash;what could be more dashingly brilliant in naval
  warfare than Drake's raids on San Domingo, Carthagena, Cadiz, and
  other ports and cities of old and new Spain, to which I have
  already briefly alluded? It was their great successes in their
  great undertakings, no matter whether it was "shocking piracy" or
  not, that immortalized these terrible creators of England's
  greatness all the world over!</p>

  <p>Thomas Cobham, a member of a lordly and Protestant family,
  became a sailor, and soon became fascinated with the gay life of
  privateering. Once when in command of a vessel, eagerly scouring
  the seas for Spanish prizes, one was sighted, bound from Antwerp
  to Cadiz. Cobham gave chase, easily captured her in the Bay of
  Biscay, and discovered there were forty Inquisition prisoners
  aboard. After rescuing the prisoners, the captain and crew of the
  Spanish vessel were then sewn up in their own mainsail and tossed
  into the sea, no doubt with such sententious expressions of
  godliness as was thought befitting to sacred occasions of that
  period. This ceremony having been performed, the vessel was
  scuttled, so that she might nevermore be used in trading with
  <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>British sailors or any one
  else for Inquisition purposes. When the story became known, the
  case was discreetly inquired into, and very properly the gallant
  Cobham was never punished, and was soon running here and there at
  his old game.</p>

  <p>It may be taken for granted that there was no mincing matters
  when an opportunity for reprisals occurred. The Spaniards had
  carried barbarism to such a pitch in seizing our ships and
  condemning their crews to the galleys, that Queen Elizabeth was
  never averse to meeting murder and plunder by more than the
  equivalent in retaliation, except when she imagined that Philip
  was showing signs of overpowering strength; she then became timid
  and vacillating. She was never mentally disturbed by the moral
  side of the great deeds that brought her vast stores of plunder.
  Moreover, she could always find an accommodating bishop to put
  her qualms (if she ever had any, except those of consequence to
  herself) at rest on points of conscience. One noted personage,
  who held high ecclesiastical office, told her that it was a
  virtue to seize treasure when she knew it would otherwise be used
  for the purpose of murdering her Protestant subjects. Sir Arthur
  Champernowne, a noted vice-admiral of Elizabeth's reign, in
  writing to Cecil of the vessel that had put into Plymouth through
  stress of weather with the needy Philip's half-million of ducats
  on board, borrowed, it is said, from a Genoa firm of financiers,
  said it should be claimed as fair booty. Sir Arthur's view was
  that anything taken from so perfidious a nation was both <a name=
  "Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>necessary and profitable to the
  Commonwealth. No doubt a great deal of pious discussion would
  centre round the Vice-Admiral's easy moral but very logical
  opinions. The main thing in his mind, and in that of everybody
  else who was free from poisoned cant, was that the most shocking
  crimes were being openly advocated by Philip, King of Spain,
  against all European Protestants, rich or poor, who came within
  the clutches of the savages that administered the cruelties of
  the Inquisition. The canting crowd shrieked against the monstrous
  impiety of such notions, but their efforts to prove purity of
  motive were unavailing.</p>

  <p>After considered thought by a committee of men of high
  rectitude, it was decided to act without fear or favour in a
  strictly impartial manner, so Philip's half-million of bullion
  was divided between the Prince of Orange and the rigid moralist,
  Elizabeth, who is credited with having spent her share on the
  Navy, a very admirable way of disposing of it.</p>

  <p>This act was the cause of a deluge of reprisals on the part of
  Spain. But, from all accounts, Elizabeth's corsairs had always
  the best of it in matters of material importance. The Spanish are
  naturally a proud, brave race. In the middle of the sixteenth
  century their power dominated two-thirds of the universe, and had
  they stuck to business, and not so feverishly to the spreading of
  their religious faith by violent means, they might have continued
  a predominant nation.</p>

  <p>Their civil, naval, and military position was <a name=
  "Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>unequalled. The commerce and wealth of
  the whole world was pre-eminently in their hands, and in common
  with other nations who arrive at heights of power, prosperity,
  and grandeur (which last sits so easily on the Spaniard), they
  gave way to pleasures and to the luxury of laziness which
  invariably carries with it sensuality. Wherever they found
  themselves in the ascendancy, they intrigued to impose the Roman
  faith on the population, and if that method did not succeed with
  felicity, whenever the agents of their governing classes,
  including their king, met with opposition from prominent men or
  women, their opponents were put to the rack, burnt, or their
  heads sent flying. In this country no leading Protestant's life
  or property was safe. Even Elizabeth, during the reign of her
  half-sister, Mary, was obliged to make believe that her religious
  faith was Roman in harmony with that of the Queen. It was either
  adoption, deception, or execution, and the future queen outwitted
  all their traps and inventions until Mary passed on, and
  Elizabeth took her place on the throne.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Spain, as I have indicated, was tampering with
  abiding laws. Catastrophe always follows perilous habits of life,
  which were correctly attributed to the Spanish. As with
  individuals, so it is with nations; pride can never successfully
  run in conjunction with the decadence of wealth. It is manifestly
  true that it is easier for a nation to go up than to realize that
  it has come down, and during long years Spain has had to learn
  this bitter lesson. It was not <a name="Page_36" id=
  "Page_36"></a>only imperious pride of race and extravagant
  grandeur that brought the destruction of her supremacy of the
  seas, and the wealth and supremacy of many lands, but their
  intolerable religious despotism towards those who were not
  already, and refused to become, as I have said, adherents of the
  Roman Catholic creed. Poor wretches who were not strong enough to
  defend themselves had the mark of heretics put on them; and for
  nearly thirty years Spaniards carried on a system of burning
  British seamen whenever they could lay hands on them. They kept
  up a constant system of spying and plotting against the British
  Protestant Queen and her subjects of every position in life. The
  policy of the Spanish King and government was to make the British
  and other races vassals of the Pope. Philip, like all powerful
  monarchs and individuals who are put into power without any of
  the qualities of fitness to fill a high post, always believed
  that his presence on earth was an act of supreme Providence.
  Philip, in proclaiming his glorious advent for the good of
  mankind, explained it with a decorum that had a fascinating
  flavour. Unlike some imitators of great personalities, he was
  never vulgarly boastful in giving expression to the belief that
  his power came from above and would be sustained by the mystery
  that gave him it in such abundance, but, in fact, he never
  doubted what was known as the doctrine of the divine right of
  kings.</p>

  <p>The human support which kept him in authority did not enter
  into his calculations. The popular <a name="Page_37" id=
  "Page_37"></a>notions of the democracies then was that no
  physical force could sever the alliance which existed between God
  and monarchs; and there is no evidence that Philip was ever
  disillusioned. He regarded his adversaries, especially Hawkins
  and Drake, in the light of magicians possessed of devilish
  spirits that were in conflict with the wishes of the Deity. His
  highly placed and best naval officer, Santa Cruz, took a more
  realistic view than his master, though he might have had doubts
  as to whether the people who were at war with Spain were not a
  species of devil. But he expressed the view which even at this
  distance of time shows him to have been a man of sane, practical
  thought. Philip imagined he could agree with the acts of
  assassins (and also support the Holy Office) in their policy of
  burning English sailors as heretics. Santa Cruz reflected more
  deeply, and advised the King that such acts were positively
  courting disaster, because "the British corsairs had teeth, and
  could use them."</p>

  <p>Spain looked upon her naval position as impregnable, but
  Elizabeth's pirates contemptuously termed it "a Colossus stuffed
  with clouts." Priests, crucifixes, and reliance on supernatural
  assistance had no meaning for them. If any suggestion to impose
  on them by such means had been made, they would have cast the
  culprits over the side into the sea. They were peculiarly
  religious, but would tolerate no saintly humbugs who lived on
  superstition. When they had serious work in hand, they relied on
  their own <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>mental and physical
  powers, and if they failed in their objective, they reverently
  remarked, "The reason is best known to God"&mdash;a simple,
  unadorned final phrase.</p>

  <p>Some of the sayings and doings, reliable or unreliable, that
  have been handed down to us, are extremely comical, looking at
  them from our religious standpoint in these days; for instance,
  Drake's method of dealing with insubordination, his idea of how
  treason was to be stamped out, and the trial of Doughty, the
  traitor.</p>

  <p>People who sit in cosy houses, which these early sailors made
  it possible for them in other days and now to acquire, may regard
  many of the disciplinary methods of Drake and his sea
  contemporaries as sheer savage murder, but these critics are not
  quite qualified to judge as to the justice or injustice of the
  actions of one man who is responsible for the safe and proper
  navigation of a vessel, no matter whether on an enterprising
  voyage of piracy, fair trade, or invasion. If a nautical project
  is to be carried out with complete success, the first element in
  the venture is discipline, and the early seafarers believed this,
  as their successors have always done, especially during the
  different periods of the sailing-ship era. A commander, if he
  wishes to be successful in keeping the spirit of rebellion under,
  must imbue those under him with a kind of awe. This only succeeds
  if the commander has a magnetic and powerful will, combined with
  quick action and sound, unhesitating judgment. All the greatest
  naval and military chiefs have had and <a name="Page_39" id=
  "Page_39"></a>must have now these essential gifts of nature if
  they are to be successful in their art. The man of dashing
  expediency without judgment or knowledge is a great peril in any
  responsible position. When either a ship or nation or anything
  else is in trouble, it is the cool, calculating, orderly
  administrator, who never makes chaos or destructive fuss, that
  succeeds. That is essential, and it is only this type of person
  that so often saves both ships, armies, and nations from
  inevitable destruction. The Duke of Wellington used to say that
  "In every case, the winning of a battle was always a damned near
  thing." One of the most important characteristics of Drake's and
  Hawkins' genius was their fearless accurate methods of putting
  the fear of God into the Spaniards, both at sea and ashore. The
  mention of their names made Philip's flesh creep. Even Admiral
  Santa Cruz, in common with his compatriots, thought Drake was
  "The Serpent"&mdash;"The Devil." And the Spanish opinion of him
  helped Drake to win many a tough battle. Amongst the thrilling
  examples are his dashes into Corunna and Cadiz. Drake never took
  the risk before calculating the cost and making certain of where
  the vulnerable weak spot of the enemy lay, and when and where to
  strike it. The complete vanquishing of the Armada is another
  instance of Drake's great qualities of slashing yet sound
  judgment put accurately into effect.</p>

  <p>Of course, the honours of the defeat of the Armada must always
  be shared with other naval experts who had acquired their
  knowledge of <a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>sea warfare in
  what is called the piratical line. But the spirit that inflamed
  the whole British fleet was that of Drake, Hawkins, Frobisher,
  Seymour, and Howard, and the inspiration came mainly from the two
  former. On the Spanish side, as a naval battle, it was a fiasco,
  a mere colossal clerical burlesque. Neither naval strategy nor
  ordinary seamanship was in evidence on the part of the chief
  commander or his admirals. The men fought with rough-and-tumble
  heroism. The sailors were only second in quality to our own, but
  there was no plan of battle, and the poor Duke of Medina Sidonia
  had neither knowledge of naval affairs nor courage. Philip's
  theory seems to have been that any lack of efficiency in the art
  of war by his commanders would be made up by the spiritual
  encouragement of the priests dangling their crucifixes about the
  decks amongst the sailors and soldiers, who had been put through
  a course of instruction on spiritual efficacy before sailing on
  their doomed expedition. They were made to believe that the
  Spanish cause was so just that assistance would be given from God
  to defeat the "infernal devils" and to invade their country.</p>

  <p>This great battle transferred the sea supremacy from the
  Spanish to the British, who have held it, with one interval, ever
  since, and will continue to hold it, provided that Philip's
  theories of relying merely on the help that comes from above be
  supplemented by, first, the appointment of a proper head at the
  Admiralty with some nautical instinct and knowledge of affairs;
  and secondly, the keeping <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>up
  of an efficient fleet, manned with efficient officers and men.
  Heaven helps those who help themselves. No department of
  government can be properly managed by novices. The reckless,
  experimental appointment of untried men to positions of grave
  responsibility on which the happiness, comfort, and life of the
  whole public may depend, and the very existence of the country be
  put in jeopardy, is a gamble, and may be a crime.</p>

  <p>It is always risky to assume that any person holding authority
  in the bigger affairs of life is in consequence an instrument of
  Providence. Had the conception of the Armada and the organization
  of every detail been put into the hands of experienced and
  trained experts with sound judgment in naval matters, such as
  Admiral Santa Cruz, and had it not been for Philip and his
  landsman ideas of the efficacy of priests and crucifixes, and
  greenhorns such as the Duke of Medina Sidonia and his landlubber
  colleagues, Spain might never have been involved in the Armada
  fight, and if she had, it is scarcely likely that so appalling a
  disaster could have come to her. Apart from any fighting, the
  fact of having no better sea knowledge or judgment than to anchor
  the Spanish ships in an open roadstead like Calais was courting
  the loss of the whole Spanish fleet. One of the fundamental
  precautions of seamanship is never to anchor on a lee shore or in
  an open roadstead, without a means of escape. The dunderheaded
  Spanish commanders made their extermination much more easy for
  the highly trained British seamen of all <a name="Page_42" id=
  "Page_42"></a>grades, none of whom had any reason to hide their
  heads in shame for any part they individually took in the
  complete ruin of the Spanish Navy.</p>

  <p>One cannot read the sordid story without feeling a pang of
  pity for the proud men, such as Recaldo, who died on landing at
  Bilbao; or Oquendo, whose home was at Santander. He refused to
  see his wife and children, turned his face to the wall, and died
  of a broken heart begotten of shame. The soldiers and sailors
  were so weak they could not help themselves, and died in hundreds
  on the ships that crawled back to Spain. The tragic fate of these
  vessels and their crews that were dashed to pieces on the rocks
  of the Hebrides and Ireland added greatly to the tale of horror.
  Philip was crushed, but was a man of tender sympathies, and free
  from vindictive resentment against those who were placed in
  charge of his terrific and ill-fated navy. He worked and exhorted
  others to relieve the sufferers in every possible way. He
  obviously regarded the disaster as a divine rebuke, and
  submissively acquiesced with true Spanish indolence, saying that
  he believed it to be the "great purpose of Heaven."</p>

  <p>On the authority of the Duke of Parma, "The English regarded
  their victory with modesty, and were languidly indifferent to
  their valour." They looked upon the defeat of the Spanish Navy as
  a token of the Ruler of all things being decidedly partial to the
  Protestant faith. The Spaniards, as a whole, would not allow that
  Heaven was against them or that the verdict was that of
  Providence. They declared that it was entirely the <a name=
  "Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>result of the superior management of
  the English ships and the fighting quality of their crews. With
  this chivalrous testimonial no one could then or will now
  disagree. It was very sporting of them to admit the superiority
  of the British ships and seamanship.</p>

  <p>Drake and his compeers had reason to be proud of their efforts
  in the great naval contest. Their reputations were enhanced by it
  all over the world, though never a sign or word came from
  themselves about their gallantry. They looked upon these matters
  as mere incidents of their enterprising lives.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>But it is really in the lesser sea encounters, though they
  probably had just as great results, that we become enthralled by
  Drake's adventurous voyages. The Armada affair was more like the
  battle of Trafalgar, one of the differences being that in the
  latter engagement the Spanish ships did not risk going far into
  the open sea, but wisely kept Cadiz open for retreat, which they
  availed themselves of after receiving a dreadful pounding.
  Drake's voyage in the <i>Pelican</i> excelled anything that had
  ever been accomplished by previous sea rovers, and his expedition
  to the West Indies was a great feat. He always had trouble with
  Queen Elizabeth about money when organizing his voyages. Her
  Spanish brother-in-law's power was always in her thoughts. He
  never allowed her to forget <a name="Page_44" id=
  "Page_44"></a>that if he were provoked he would invade England,
  and notwithstanding her retort that England had a long arm which
  he would do well to fear, her courage alternated with some
  nervousness at times. Elizabeth was not so much concerned about
  his threat of excommunication of her as the sly tricks in
  conjunction with the Pope in spreading the spirit of rebellion in
  Ireland, and in other ways conspiring against her. Her mood was
  at one time to defy him, and at another conciliatory and fearful
  lest her pirate chiefs should do anything to provoke Spanish
  susceptibilities. Drake was much hampered by her moods when he
  wanted to get quickly to business, and never lost an opportunity
  of slipping out of her reach when his eloquence on the
  acquisition of untold wealth and the capture of some of Philip's
  distant colonies had appealed to her boundless avarice and made
  her conscience easy. His expedition to the West Indies might
  never have been undertaken had he not been a dare-devil fellow,
  to whom Burleigh's wink was as good as a nod to be off. He
  slipped out of port unknown to her, and his first prize was a
  large Spanish ship loaded with salt fish. He pounced upon her
  after passing Ushant, and the excellent cargo was suitably
  distributed amongst the fleet.</p>

  <p>There were 25 privateers, and a company of 2,500 men on this
  expedition. All were volunteers, and represented every grade of
  society, high and low. There was never any difficulty in getting
  a supply of men. On this occasion the applications largely
  outnumbered the posts available. <a name="Page_45" id=
  "Page_45"></a>Drake could always depend upon volunteers, and,
  like all men of superb action, he had no liking for conscription.
  He knew that in the performance and carrying out of great deeds
  (and nearly all of his were terrific) it is men aflame with
  courage and enthusiasm that carry the day, and take them as a
  whole, conscripts are never wholehearted. The two great
  characteristics of the British race&mdash;initiative and
  endurance&mdash;are due to this burning flame of voluntarism.</p>

  <p>The West India expedition was organized and all expenses
  guaranteed by private individuals. The capital was &pound;60,000,
  and its allocation was &pound;40,000 for expenses and
  &pound;20,000 to be distributed amongst those who had volunteered
  to serve. Both men and officers had signed on without any
  stipulation for wages. They knew they were out for a piratical
  cruise, and welcomed any danger, great or small, that would give
  them a chance of making it not only a monetary success, but one
  that would give Spanish autocracy another shattering blow. These
  ancient mariners never trifled with life, and no sombre views or
  fatal shadows disturbed their spirited ambition or caused them to
  shrink from their strenuous and stupendous work. They went forth
  in their cockleshell fleet as full of hope and confidence as
  those who are accustomed to sail and man a transatlantic liner of
  the present day. Some of their vessels were but little larger
  than a present-day battleship's tender. Neither roaring forties
  nor Cape Horn hurricanes intimidated them. It is only when we
  stop to think, that we realize <a name="Page_46" id=
  "Page_46"></a>how great these adventurers were, and how much we
  owe to their sacred memories.</p>

  <p>In addition to being ridiculously small and shabby in point of
  efficiency in rigging, sails, and general outfit, it will always
  be a mystery how it was that so few were lost by stress of
  weather or even ordinary navigable risks. They were veritable
  boxes in design, and their rig alone made it impossible for them
  to make rapid passages, even if they had wished to do so. As I
  write these lines, and think of my own Western Ocean experiences
  in well-designed, perfectly equipped, large and small sailing
  vessels during the winter hurricane months, when the passages
  were made literally under water and every liquid mountain seemed
  to forebode immediate destruction, it taxes my nautical knowledge
  to understand how these inferior and smaller craft which Drake
  commanded did not succumb to the same elements that have carried
  superior vessels in later years to their doom. One reason that
  occurs to me is that they were never deeply laden, and they were
  accustomed to ride hurricanes out when they had plenty of sea
  room at their sea anchors.</p>

  <p>But nothing can detract from what our generation may describe
  as their eccentric genius in combining navigation with piracy and
  naval and military art. Talk about "human vision"! What is the
  good of it if it turns out nothing but unrestrained confusion?
  The men of the period I am writing about had real "vision," and
  applied it with accuracy without disorganizing the machinery of
  life and making the world a <a name="Page_47" id=
  "Page_47"></a>miserable place to live in. They were all for
  country and none for self.</p>

  <p>After the capture of the Spanish ship and the appropriation of
  her cargo of fish, Drake's fleet went lounging along towards
  Vigo. In due course he brought his ships to anchor in the
  harbour, and lost no time in coming in contact with Don Pedro
  Bendero, the Spanish governor, who was annoyed at the British
  Admiral's unceremonious appearance. Don Pedro said that he was
  not aware that his country was at war with Britain. Drake quickly
  disillusioned him, and demanded, "If we are not at war, why have
  English merchants been arrested?" Don Pedro said an order had
  come for their release. Drake landed forthwith a portion of his
  force, and seeing that he meant business that foreboded trouble,
  the governor sent him wine, fruit, and other luxurious articles
  of food in abundance. The ships were anchored in a somewhat open
  roadstead, so Drake resolved to take them farther up the waterway
  where they would lie comfortably, no matter from what direction
  the threatening storm might break. But he had another shrewd
  object in view, which was to make a beginning in acquiring any of
  the valuable and treasured possessions adorning the churches. A
  trusted officer who was in his confidence, and a great admirer of
  his wisdom and other personal qualities, was sent to survey the
  passage and to find a suitable anchorage. He was a man of
  enterprise, with a strong dislike to the Roman Catholic faith,
  and never doubted that he was perfectly justified in relieving
  the <a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>churches of plate and
  other valuables. These were, in his eyes, articles of idolatry
  that no man of puritanic and Protestant principles could refrain
  from removing and placing under the safe keeping of his revered
  chief, who was no more averse to robbing a church than he was to
  robbing a ship carrying gold or fish.</p>

  <p>As the vessel in charge of this intrepid officer, whose name
  was Carlile, approached the town where it was proposed to anchor
  the fleet the inhabitants fled, taking with them much of the
  church plate and other things which the British had covetously
  thought an appropriate prize of theirs. Carlile, being a man of
  resource, soon laid hold of other church treasure, which amply
  compensated for the loss of that which was carried off by the
  fleeing inhabitants at the mouth of the harbour. The day
  following Christopher Carlile's satisfactory survey the fleet was
  anchored off the town. The sight of it threw the whole district
  into panic. A pompous governor of Galicia hastened to Vigo, and
  on his arrival there he took fright at the number of ships and
  the dreaded name of the pirate chief who was in command. It would
  be futile to show fight, so he determined to accommodate himself
  to the Admiral's terms, which were that he should have a free
  hand to replenish the fleet with water and provisions, or any
  other odds and ends, without interference. This being
  accomplished, he agreed to sail, and no doubt the governor
  thought he had made a judicious bargain in getting rid of him so
  easily. But Drake all the time had the <a name="Page_49" id=
  "Page_49"></a>Spanish gold fleet in his mind. Sacrifices must be
  made in order that it may be captured, so off he went for the
  Cape de Verde islands, and found when he got there that the
  treasure-ships had arrived and sailed only a few hours before.
  The disappointment was, according to custom, taken with Christian
  composure. He had the aptitude of switching his mind from one
  form of warfare to another. As I have said, he would just as soon
  attack and plunder a city as a church or a ship. Drake had missed
  the gold fleet, so he turned his attention to the treasures of
  Santiago. When the governor and population were made aware that
  the distinguished visitor to their island was the terrible "El
  Draque," they and their spiritual advisers as usual flew to the
  mountains, without neglecting to take their money and priceless
  possessions with them. Drake looted as much as was left in the
  city of wine and other valuables, but he got neither gold nor
  silver, and would probably have left Santiago unharmed but for
  the horrible murder of one of his sailor-boys, whose body was
  found hacked to pieces. This settled the doom of the finest built
  city in the Old World. "El Draque" at once set fire to it and
  burnt it to ashes, with that thoroughness which characterized all
  such dealings in an age when barbaric acts justified more than
  equivalent reprisals.</p>

  <p>It would have been a wiser course for the governor to have
  treated for the ransom of the town than to have murdered a poor
  sailor lad who was innocently having a stroll. It is <a name=
  "Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>balderdash to talk of the Spaniards as
  being too proud to treat with a person whom they believed to be
  nothing better than a pirate. The Spaniards, like other
  nationalities, were never too proud to do anything that would
  strengthen or maintain their supremacy. Their apparent pride in
  not treating with Drake at Santiago and on other rare occasions
  was really the acme of terror at hearing his name; there was
  neither high honour nor grandee dignity connected with it. As to
  Philip's kingly pride, it consisted in offering a special reward
  of &pound;40,000 to have Elizabeth's great sailor assassinated or
  kidnapped. There were many to whom the thought of the bribe was
  fascinating. Numerous attempts were made, but whenever the
  assassins came within sound of his name or sight of him or his
  ships they became possessed of involuntary twitchy sensations,
  and fled in a delirium of fear, which was attributed to his being
  a magician.</p>

  <p>As soon as Drake had avenged the sailor-boy's murder he sailed
  for the West Indies. When he got into the hot latitudes the
  plague of yellow fever appeared, and nearly three hundred of his
  men died in a few days. Arriving at Dominica, they found the
  Caribs had a deadly hatred of the Spanish, and when they learned
  that the British were at war with Spain they offered to prescribe
  a certain cure for yellow jack which was eminently effectual.
  After disinfecting the ships, and getting supplied with their
  requirements, the fleet left for San Domingo, via St. Kitts,
  which was uninhabited at that time. Domingo was one of the
  <a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>most beautiful and most
  wealthy islands in the world. Columbus and his brother, Diego,
  are buried in the cathedral there. The population believed
  themselves to be immune from harm or invasion on this distant
  island home, but Drake soon disillusioned them. His devoted
  lieutenant, Christopher Carlile, was selected as usual to find a
  suitable channel and landing, a hazardous and almost unattainable
  quest, but in his and Drake's skilful hands their object was
  accomplished. The ships were brought into port, and in his usual
  direct way Drake demanded that the garrison of the castle should
  surrender without parley, and it was done. Drake was not finished
  with them yet; he wished to know from the governor what terms he
  was prepared to offer in order that the city should be saved from
  pillage. A negro boy was sent with this dispatch, and raging with
  the disgrace of surrendering to the British Admiral, an officer
  ran a lance through the boy's body. The poor boy was just able to
  get back, and died immediately, close to where Drake was. The
  Spaniards had allowed their vicious pride to incite them to
  commit murder and to insult the British Admiral, who promptly
  avenged both deeds by having two friars taken to the place where
  the boy had been stabbed, and there hanged. "El Draque" sent a
  further note to the governor informing him that unless the
  officer who murdered his messenger was executed at once by the
  Spanish authorities he would hang two friars for every day that
  it was put off. Needless to say, no more friars were hung, as the
  officer paid the <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>penalty of
  his crime without further delay. The lacerated dignity of the
  Spaniards was still further tried by the demand for the ransom of
  the city, and their procrastination cost them dear.</p>

  <p>Drake's theology was at variance with that of the Founder of
  our faith. His method was rigid self-assertion, and the power of
  the strong. The affront he conceived to have been laid upon him
  and upon the country he represented could only be wiped out by
  martial law. Theoretic babbling about equality had no place in
  his ethics of the universe. He proceeded to raid and burn both
  private dwellings, palaces, and magazines; and the Government
  House, which was reputed to be the finest building in the world,
  was operated upon for a month, until it was reduced to dust.
  These are some of the penalties that would have gladdened the
  heart of the gallant Beresford and his Albert Hall comrades of
  our time had they been carried out against the Germans, who have
  excelled the Spaniards of Philip's reign in cultured murder and
  other brutalities in a war that has cost William II his throne
  and brought the period of civilization perilously near its end.
  It may be that the instability of petty statesmanship is to
  disappear, and that Providence may have in unseen reserve a group
  of men with mental and physical powers capable of subduing human
  virulence and re-creating out of the chaos the Germans have made
  a new and enduring civilization; and when they shall appear their
  advent will be applauded by the stricken world.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>Incidentally, it may be
  added that the German nation, which has endangered the existence
  of civilization, would never have been despised or thought ill of
  on account of its defeat by the Allies. It is their unjustifiable
  method of beginning the war, and the dirty brutal tricks by which
  they sought to win it, which have created enduring mistrust and
  animosity against them. The law of human fairness is no more
  exacting to small communities or individuals than it is to
  nations.</p>

  <p>Drake continued his relentless reprisals against San Domingo.
  The burning of British sailors as heretics possessed his mind.
  The distracted governor would have given his soul to get rid of
  him, but Drake demanded money, and this the governor pleaded was
  not available, but he was ultimately forced to provide 25,000
  ducats, equalling &pound;50,000. This was accepted after the town
  had been shattered to pieces and the shipping destroyed. The
  cathedral was the only important building left intact, the
  probable reason being that the remains of the great navigator,
  Columbus, were entombed there. Already the mortality amongst
  Drake's crew had been alarmingly heavy, and he was too wise a man
  to gamble with their lives until the bad season came on, so he
  settled up and hurried away into the fresh sea breezes,
  determined to give many more Spanish possessions a thorough
  shaking up. The news that the freebooters were near at hand, and
  that they were committing shocking deeds of theft and destruction
  on the way, had filtered <a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>to
  the Carribean Sea, and struck the somnolent population with
  terror. Carthagena, a magnificent city and the capital of the
  Spanish Main, was Drake's next objective. He had large hopes of
  doing well there. The health of most of his crew had improved and
  was now robust, and their fighting spirits had been kindled to a
  high pitch by their gallant chief, whose eye of genius was
  centred on a big haul of material things. On arrival off the
  port, Carlile, whose resource and courage were always in demand,
  was put in charge of a strong force. He led the attack, mounted
  the parapets, drove the Spanish garrison away in confusion,
  killed the commander, and subsequently destroyed a large number
  of ships which were lazily lying in the port. Many English
  prisoners were released, which was a godsend in filling the
  places of those who had died.</p>

  <p>The combative pretensions of the governor had received a
  severe shock. He was beaten, and Drake, like a true sportsman,
  asked him and his suite to dine with him, and with an air of
  Spanish dignity he accepted. The occasion was memorable for the
  royal way the distinguished guests were treated. The governor was
  studiously cordial, and obviously wished to win the favour of his
  remorseless visitors, so asked Drake and his officers to do him
  the honour of accepting his hospitality in return, which they
  did. What form the interchange of civilities took is not quite
  clear, but the governor's apparent amiableness did not in any way
  move Drake to exercise generosity. His object was ransom, and if
  this <a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>was agreed to
  good-naturedly, all the better for the Spaniards, but he was
  neither to be bought nor sold by wily tactics, nor won over by
  golden-tongued rhetoric. The price of the rugged Devonshire
  sailor's alternative of wild wrath and ruin was the modest sum of
  100,000 ducats in hard cash. Mutual convivialities and flowing
  courtesies were at an end; these were one thing and reparation
  for the incarceration and burning of unoffending British sailors
  as heretics was another.</p>

  <p>"Deeds of blood and torture can never be atoned for in money
  or destruction of property. I am Drake, 'El Draque' if you like,
  and if you don't comply with my terms, you shall be
  destroyed."</p>

  <p>It was his habit openly to express himself in this way to
  Philip's subjects, whether hostile or not, and we can imagine
  that similar views were uttered in the Carthagena negotiations.
  The Spaniards regarded his terms as monstrous impiety; they were
  aghast, pleaded poverty, and protested and swore by the Holy
  Office that the total amount they could find in the whole city
  was only 30,000 ducats. Drake, with commendable prudence, seeing
  that he wished to get away from the fever zone without delay,
  appears to have accepted this amount, though authorities are at
  variance on this point. Some say that he held out for his first
  claim and got it. I have not been able to verify which is the
  correct amount, but in all probability he got the 100,000 ducats.
  In any case, he piously charged them with deception in their plea
  of poverty, but came <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>to terms,
  declaring, no doubt, that his own magnanimity astonished him.</p>

  <p>But for the sudden outbreak of sickness amongst his crew, the
  Carthagenians would not have fared nearly so well. The city might
  have been, not only pillaged, but laid in ruins. As it was, he
  had emptied a monastery and blown the harbour forts to
  pieces.</p>

  <p>Drake's intention was to visit Panama, but the fever had laid
  heavy hands on his men. Only a third of those who commenced the
  voyage with him were well enough to do work at all,
  notwithstanding the replenishment by released prisoners, so he
  was forced to abandon further enterprises and shape his course
  homewards as quickly as skilful navigation and the vagaries of
  wind and weather would allow. Great deeds, even on this trip,
  stood to the credit of himself and crew. The accomplishments were
  far below what was expected at the outset in point of money
  value, but the priceless feature of the voyage was the enhanced
  respect for Drake's name which had taken possession of the
  Spanish race in every part of the world and subsequently made the
  defeat of the Armada an easier task.</p>

  <p>This eager soul, who was really the pioneer of a new
  civilization, had still to face hard fate after the reluctant
  abandonment of his intention to visit Panama. The sufferings of
  the adventurers from bad weather and shortness of water was
  severely felt on the passage to Florida. But the rough leader
  never lost heart or spared himself in any way. He was obliged to
  heave-to at Cape <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>Antonio
  (Cuba), and here with indomitable courage went to work, putting
  heart into his men by digging with pick and shovel in a way that
  would have put a navvy to the blush, and when their efforts were
  rewarded he took his ships through the Bahama Channel, and as he
  passed a fort which the Spaniards had constructed and used as a
  base for a force which had murdered many French Protestant
  colonists in the vicinity, Drake landed, found out the murderous
  purpose of the fort, and blew it to pieces. But that was not all.
  He also had the satisfaction of saving the remainder of an
  unsuccessful English settlement founded by Sir Walter Raleigh,
  and of taking possession of everything that he could lay hands on
  from the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine. This was the last
  episode of plunder connected with an expedition that was ripe
  with thrilling incidents, and added to the fame of the most
  enterprising figure of the Elizabethan reign.</p>

  <p>In point of profit to those who had financed the voyage it was
  not a success; but its political and ultimate commercial
  advantages were enormous. These early seamen of the seventeenth
  century, many of them amateurs, laid the foundation of the
  greatest navy and mercantile marine of the world. It is to these
  fascinating adventurers, too, that the generations which followed
  are indebted for the initiative in human comforts and progress.
  The superficial self-righteous critic may find it an agreeable
  pursuit to search out their blemishes; but these men cannot be
  airily dismissed in that manner. They towered above <a name=
  "Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>their fellows, the supreme product of
  the spirit of their day in adventure and daring; they fulfilled
  their great destiny, and left their indelible mark upon the life
  of their nation and of the world. Their great emancipating
  heroism and reckless self-abnegation more than counterbalanced
  the faults with which the modern mind, judging their day by ours,
  is too prone to credit them, and whatever their deeds of perfidy
  may have been, they were imbued more with the idea of patriotism
  than with that of avarice. They were remarkable men, nor did they
  come into the life of the nation by chance, but for a purpose,
  and their memories are enshrined in human history.</p>

  <p>Drake sailed for home as soon as he had embarked what was left
  of Raleigh's colonists at Roanoke River, Virginia, and after a
  protracted and monotonous passage, arrived at Plymouth on the
  28th July, 1586. The population received the news with
  acclamation. Drake wrote to Lord Burleigh, bemoaning his fate in
  having missed the gold fleet by a few hours, and again placing
  his services at the disposal of his Queen and country.</p>

  <p>The most momentous of all his commissions, especially to his
  own country, was in 1587, when he destroyed a hundred ships in
  Cadiz Harbour. It was a fine piece of work, this "singeing of the
  King of Spain's beard" as he called it, and by far excelled
  anything he had previously done. He captured the <i>San
  Philip</i>, the King of Spain's ship, which was the largest
  afloat. Her cargo was valued at over one million sterling, in
  addition to which papers were found on board revealing <a name=
  "Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>the wealth of the East India trade.
  The knowledge of this soon found a company of capitalists, who
  formed the East India Company, out of which our great Indian
  Empire was established. When the <i>San Philip</i> was towed into
  Dartmouth Harbour, and when it became known generally, the whole
  country was ablaze with excitement, and people travelled from far
  and near to see the leviathan.</p>

  <p>Drake bore himself on this occasion with that sober modesty
  that characterized him always under any circumstances. His
  reputation stood higher now than ever, and it was no detriment to
  him that Philip should shudder, and when he became virtuously
  agitated speak of him as "that fearful man Drake." Everywhere he
  was a formidable reality, strong, forbidding and terrible; his
  penetrating spirit saw through the plans of the enemies of his
  country and his vigorous counter-measures were invariably
  successful. The exalted part he took in the defeat of the Armada
  has been briefly referred to in another part of this book. He was
  then at the height of his imposing magnificence and fame, but
  owing to the caprice of his royal mistress, who had an insatiable
  habit of venting her Tudor temper indiscriminately, he fell under
  her displeasure, and for a time was in disgrace; but she soon
  discovered that his services, whatever his lack of success on
  apparently rash enterprises may have been, were indispensable at
  so critical a moment. He was recalled, and soon after sent on his
  melancholy last voyage. He had worn <a name="Page_60" id=
  "Page_60"></a>himself out in the service of his country. Born at
  Tavistock in 1539, his eager spirit passed into the shadows off
  Puerto Bello on the 28th January, 1596, and, as previously
  stated, he was buried three miles out at sea, and two of his
  prizes were sunk and laid beside him.</p>

  <p>The following beautiful lines of Sir Henry Newbolt not only
  describe his patriotic and heroic end, but breathe the very
  spirit of the man who was one of the most striking figures of the
  Elizabethan age:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The tradition created by Drake and Hawkins was carried on by
  Nelson and Collingwood in a different age and under different
  conditions, and the same heroic spirit animated them all. Nelson
  must certainly have been familiar with the enthralling tales of
  these men and of their gallant colleagues, but without all the
  essential qualities born in him he could not have been the victor
  of Trafalgar. Men have to do something distinctive, that sets the
  human brain on fire, before they are really recognized as being
  great; then all others are put in the shade, no matter how
  necessary their great gifts may be to fill up the gaps in the man
  of initiative and of action. Drake could not have done what he
  did had he not had the aid of Frobisher, and Jervis would not
  have become Earl St. Vincent had he not been supported by Nelson
  at the battle of that name; and we should never have seen the
  imposing monument erected in Trafalgar Square had Nelson been
  without his Collingwood. Victorious and valiant performances do
  not come by chance, and so it comes to pass in the natural
  <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>course of human law that if
  our Jervises, Nelsons, and Collingwoods, who are the prototypes
  of our present-day heroes, had not lived, we should not have had
  our Fishers, Jellicoes, and Beattys.</p>

  <p>Nelson was always an attractive personality and by no means
  the type of man to allow himself to be forgotten. He believed he
  was a personage with a mission on earth, and never an opportunity
  was given him that did not confirm this belief in himself.</p>

  <p>Horatio Nelson was the son of the Rev. Edmund Nelson, and was
  born at Burnham Thorpe on the 29th September, 1758. His mother
  died in 1767, and left eight children. Her brother, Captain
  Maurice Suckling, was appointed to the <i>Raisonable</i> three
  years after her death, and agreed, at the request of Horatio
  himself and the instigation of his father, after some doubtful
  comments as to the boy's physical suitableness for the rough life
  of a sailor, to take him; so on the 1st January, 1771, he became
  a midshipman on the <i>Raisonable.</i> On the 22nd May he either
  shipped of his own accord or was put as cabin-boy on a merchant
  vessel which went to the West Indies, and ended his career in the
  merchant service at the end of an eventful voyage. In July 1772
  he became midshipman on board the <i>Triumph</i>. This was the
  real starting-point of his naval career and of the development of
  those great gifts that made him the renowned Admiral of the
  world. Twenty-two years after joining his uncle's ship he was
  made captain of the <i>Agamemnon</i>. At the siege of Calvi in
  1794 he was wounded in the right <a name="Page_65" id=
  "Page_65"></a>eye and lost the sight of it. Three years
  afterwards he lost his right arm while commanding an attack on
  Santa Cruz, and although he had put so many sensational events
  into his life up to that time, it was not until the battle of St.
  Vincent that he began to attract attention. He had been promoted
  Rear-Admiral before the news of the battle was known, and when
  the news reached England the public enthusiasm was irrepressible.
  Jervis was made an Earl, with &pound;3,000 a year pension, and
  the King requested that he should take his title from the name of
  the battle. Nelson refused a baronetcy, and was made, at his own
  request, a Knight of the Bath, receiving the thanks of the City
  of London and a sword. All those who were in prominent positions
  or came to the front in this conflict received something. It was
  not by a freak of chance that the authorities began to see in
  Nelson the elements of an extraordinary man. Nor was it mere
  chance that they so far neglected him that he was obliged to
  force himself upon the Admiralty in order to get them to employ
  him. The nation was in need of a great spirit, and Providence had
  been preparing one for many years before the ruling authorities
  discovered that Nelson was their man of the future.</p>

  <p>For several months he was tearing about the seas in search of
  the French fleet. He popped into Naples on the 17th June, 1798,
  ostensibly to know if anything had been heard of it, and no doubt
  he took the opportunity of having a word with Sir William and
  Lady Hamilton, who were <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>to
  come so romantically into his life. He found the French fleet at
  anchor in Aboukir Bay and sailed upon it with such amazing
  audacity that the heart was knocked out of them at the very
  outset. Neither the French Admiral nor anybody else would have
  expected the British fleet to run their ships between them and
  the shore at the risk of grounding. The <i>Culloden</i>
  <i>did</i> ground. The French had 11 out of 13 ships put out of
  action, but the British fleet suffered severely also, and the
  loss of men was serious.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
  "FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
  "fnanchor">[1]</a> Out of a total of 7,401 men, 218 were killed
  and 678 wounded. Nelson himself was badly wounded on the
  forehead, and as the skin fell down on his good eye and the blood
  streamed into it, he was both dazed and blinded. He shouted to
  Captain Berry as he was staggering to a fall, "I am killed;
  remember me to my wife." But there was a lot more work for him to
  do before the fatal day. He was carried below, believing the
  injury would prove fatal, in spite of the assurances to the
  contrary of the surgeon who was in attendance.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>Although Nelson's courage
  can never be doubted, there is something very curious in his
  constant, eccentric foreboding of death and the way in which he
  scattered his messages about to one and another. This habit
  increased amazingly after his conflict with the French at the
  Nile. He seems to have had intermittent attacks of hypochondria.
  The wound incident at Aboukir must have given great amusement as
  well as anxiety to those about him. Unquestionably the wound had
  the appearance at first of being mortal, but the surgeon soon
  gave a reassuring opinion, and after binding up the ugly cut he
  requested his patient to remain below. But Nelson, as soon as he
  knew he was not going to die, became bored with the inactivity
  and insisted on writing a dispatch to the Admiralty. His
  secretary was too excited to carry out his wishes, so he tackled
  it himself. But his suffering being great and his mind in a
  condition of whirling confusion, he did not get far beyond the
  beginning, which intimated that "Almighty God had blessed His
  Majesty's arms." The battle raged on. The <i>Orient</i> was set
  on fire and her destruction assured. When Nelson was informed of
  the terrible catastrophe to the great French line-of-battle ship,
  he demanded to be assisted to the deck, whereupon he gave
  instructions that his only boat not destroyed was to be sent with
  the <i>Vanguard's</i> first lieutenant to render assistance to
  the crew. He remained on deck until the <i>Orient</i> blew up,
  and was then urged to go to bed.</p>

  <p>But sleep under the circumstances and in view <a name=
  "Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>of his own condition would not come.
  All night long he was sending messages directing the plan of
  battle the news of which was to enthral the civilized world.
  Nelson himself was not satisfied. "Not one of the French vessels
  would have escaped," he said, "if it had pleased God that he had
  not been wounded." This was rather a slur on those who had given
  their best blood and really won the battle. Notwithstanding the
  apparent egotism of this outburst, there are sound reasons for
  believing that the Admiral's inspiring influence was much
  discounted by his not being able to remain on deck. The sight of
  his guiding, magnetic figure had an amazing effect on his men,
  but I think it must be admitted that Nelson's head was not in a
  condition at that time to be entirely relied upon, and those in
  charge of the different ships put the finishing touches to the
  victory that was won by the force of his courage and commanding
  genius in the initial stages of the struggle.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>Nelson was a true descendant of a race of men who had never
  faltered in the traditional belief that the world should be
  governed and dominated by the British. His King, his country, and
  particularly the profession to which he belonged, were to him the
  supreme authorities whose destiny it was to direct the affairs of
  the universe. With unfailing comic seriousness, intermixed with
  <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>occasional explosions of
  bitter violence, he placed the French low down in the scale of
  the human family. There was scarcely a sailor adjective that was
  not applied to them. Carlyle, in later years, designated the
  voice of France as "a confused babblement from the gutters" and
  "scarcely human"; "A country indeed with its head cut off"; but
  this quotation does not reach some of the picturesque heights of
  nautical language that was invented by Nelson to describe his
  view of them. Both he and many of his fellow-countrymen regarded
  the chosen chief on whom the French nation had democratically
  placed an imperial crown as the embodiment of a wild beast.</p>

  <p>The great Admiral was always whole-hearted in his declamation
  against the French people and their leaders who are our present
  allies fighting against that country which now is, and which
  Napoleon predicted to his dying day would become, one of the most
  imperious, inhuman foes to civilization. Nelson and his
  government at that time thought it a merciful high policy of
  brotherhood to protect and re-create Prussia out of the wreck to
  which Napoleon had reduced it; the result being that the military
  spirit of Prussia has been a growing, determined menace to the
  peace of the world and to the cause of human liberty in every
  form since the downfall of the man who warned us at the time from
  his exiled home on the rock of St. Helena that our policy would
  ultimately reflect with a vengeance upon ourselves, and involve
  the whole world in a great effort to save itself from
  destruction. He foresaw <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>that
  Prussia would inveigle and bully the smaller German states into
  unification with herself, and, having cunningly accomplished
  this, that her perfidy would proceed to consolidate the united
  fabric into a formidable power which would crush all others by
  its military superiority; this dream of universal control of
  human life and affairs was at one time nearly realized.</p>

  <p>The German Empire has bankrupted herself in men, necessaries
  of life, and money. But that in no degree minimizes the disaster
  she has wrought on those who have had to bleed at every pore to
  avoid annihilation. The Allies, as well as the Central Powers,
  are no longer going concerns. It will take generations to get
  back to the point at which we started in 1914. But the tragic
  thought of all is the enormous sacrifice of life, and the mental
  and physical wrecks that have survived the savage, brutal
  struggle brought on a world that was, and wished to remain, at
  peace, when in 1914 the Central Powers arrogantly forced the pace
  which caused an alliance to be formed quickly by their enemies to
  save them from the doom which Napoleon, with his clear vision,
  had predicted would come.</p>

  <p>It was fitting that Nelson should by every conceivable means
  adopt methods of declamation against the French, if by doing so
  he thought it would inspire the men whom he commanded with the
  same conquering spirit he himself possessed. His country was at
  war with the French, and he was merely one of the instruments
  appointed to defeat them, and this may account for his <a name=
  "Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>ebullitions of hatred from time to
  time. I have found, however, no record that would in any way show
  that it was intended as surface policy, so it may be concluded
  that his dislike was as deep-seated as it appeared. Nelson never
  seems to have shown evidences of being a humbug by saying things
  which he did not believe. He had a wholesome dislike of the
  French people and of Bonaparte, who was their idol at that time.
  But neither he nor his government can be credited with the
  faculty of being students of human life. He and they believed
  that Paris was the centre of all that was corrupt and brutal.
  Napoleon, on the other hand, had no real hatred of the British
  people, but during his wars with their government his avowed
  opinion was that "all the ills, and all the scourges that afflict
  mankind, came from London." Both were wrong in their conclusions.
  They simply did not understand each other's point of view in the
  great upheaval that was disturbing the world. The British were
  not only jealous and afraid of Napoleon's genius and amazing rise
  to eminence&mdash;which they attributed to his inordinate
  ambition to establish himself as the dominating factor in the
  affairs of the universe&mdash;but they determined that his power
  should not only not be acknowledged, but destroyed, and their
  policy after twenty years of bitter war was completely
  accomplished.</p>

  <p>The merits or demerits of British policy must always remain a
  matter of controversy. It is too big a question to deal with
  here. Napoleon said himself that "Everything in the life of man
  <a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>is subject to calculation; the
  good and evil must be equally balanced." Other true sayings of
  his indicate that he, at any rate, <i>was</i> a student of human
  life, and knew how fickle fortune is under certain conditions.
  "Reprisals," he declared, "are but a sad resource"; and again, no
  doubt dwelling on his own misfortunes, but with vivid truth all
  the same, he declares that "The allies gained by victory will
  turn against you upon the bare whisper of our defeat."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>After his victory on the Nile, Nelson fully expected to be
  created a Viscount, and his claim was well supported by Hood, his
  old Admiral. He was made Baron Nelson of the Nile, and given a
  pension of &pound;2,000 per annum&mdash;a poor recompense for the
  great service he had rendered to his country. But that was by no
  means the measure of the public gratitude. He was acclaimed from
  every corner of Great Britain as the national hero. The City of
  London presented him with a two hundred guinea sword, and a vote
  of thanks to himself, officers and men. There was much prayer and
  thanksgiving, and several women went as daft as brushes over him.
  One said her heart was absolutely bursting with all sorts of
  sensations. "I am half mad," says she, and any one who reads the
  letter will conclude that she understated her mental condition.
  But of all the many letters received by Nelson none <a name=
  "Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>surpasses in extravagance of adulation
  that written by Amy Lyon, the daughter of a village blacksmith,
  born at Great Neston in Cheshire, in 1761, who had come to London
  in the early part of 1780, fallen into evil ways and given birth
  to a little girl. She was then left destitute and sank as low as
  it is possible for a woman to do. She rose out of the depths into
  which she had fallen by appearing as the Goddess of Health in the
  exhibition of a James Graham. Sir Henry Featherstonehaugh took
  her under his protection for close on twelve months, but owing to
  her extravagance and faithlessness he turned her out when within
  a few months of a second child, which was stillborn. The first
  was handed over to her grandmother to take care of. Charles
  Greville, the second son of the Earl of Warwick, then took her to
  live with him. She had intimate relations with him while she was
  still Featherstonehaugh's mistress, and he believed the child
  about to be born was his. At this time Amy Lyon changed her name
  to Emily Hart. Greville went to work on business lines. He struck
  a bargain that all her previous lovers were to be dropped, and
  under this compact she lived with him in a respectable manner for
  nearly four years. He gave her some education, but she seems to
  have had natural genius, and her beauty was undisputed.</p>

  <p>Emily Hart sat to Romney,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
  "FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
  "fnanchor">[2]</a> the artist, and it is said that twenty-three
  portraits were painted, <a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>though
  some writers have placed the number at over forty. "Marinda,"
  "Sibyl," and the "Spinstress" were amongst them. The pictures
  bring high prices; one, I think called "Sensibility," brought, in
  1890, over &pound;3,000. Notwithstanding her lowly birth (which
  has no right to stop any one's path to greatness) and lack of
  chastity, she had something uncommon about her that was
  irresistibly attractive. Sir William Hamilton, Greville's uncle,
  returned to England some time in 1784 from Naples, where he was
  the British Minister. It was said that he was in quest of a
  second wife, the first having died some two years before.
  Greville did not take kindly to the idea of Sir William marrying
  again, because he was his heir. He thought instead that, being in
  financial trouble himself, he would try to plant Emma on his
  uncle, not with the object of marriage, but of her becoming his
  mistress. Sir William was captivated with the girl, which made it
  easy for the shameless nephew to persuade his uncle to take her
  off his hands. Emma, however, was in love with Greville, and
  there were indications of revolt when the astute lady discovered
  that serious negotiations were proceeding for her transference
  from nephew to uncle. It took twelve months to arrive at a
  settlement.</p>

  <p>There does not appear to have been a signed agreement, but
  there certainly was a tacit understanding that Sir William was to
  assist Greville out of his difficulties, in return for which Emma
  was to join him at Naples, ostensibly as a visitor. <a name=
  "Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>She writes imploringly to Greville to
  answer her letters, but never an answer came, and in utter
  despair she tells him at last that she will not become his
  uncle's concubine, and threatens to make Hamilton marry her. This
  poor wretched woman was human, after all, and indeed she gave
  convincing proofs of many high qualities in after-years, but in
  the passion of her love for the dissolute scamp who bartered her
  away she pleaded for that touch of human compassion that never
  came. She knew that her reprobate lover was fearful lest she
  should induce his uncle to marry her, and she may have had an
  instinctive feeling that it was part of the contract that she was
  to be warded off if any attempt of the kind were made likely to
  endanger his prospects of becoming Hamilton's heir. His
  indifference made her venomously malignant, and she sent him a
  last stab that would at least give him a troubled mind, even
  though it should not cause him to recall her; she would then
  pursue her revenge by ignoring him.</p>

  <p>It is a sordid story which smears the pages of British
  History.</p>

  <p>Emma lived with the British Ambassador at Naples as his
  mistress. He was popular in this city of questionable morals at
  that time. She was beautiful and developed remarkable talents as
  a singer, and was a bright, witty, fascinating conversationalist.
  She worked hard at her studies, and became a fluent speaker of
  the Italian language. Hamilton had great consideration for her,
  and never risked having her affronted because of the liaison. Her
  singing was a triumph. It is <a name="Page_76" id=
  "Page_76"></a>said she was offered &pound;6,000 to go to Madrid
  for three years and &pound;2,000 for a season in London. She
  invented classic attitudes. Goethe said that "Sir William
  Hamilton, after long love and study of art, has at last
  discovered the most perfect of the wonders of nature and art in a
  beautiful young woman. She lives with him, and is about twenty
  years old. She is very handsome, and of a beautiful figure. What
  the greatest artists have aimed at is shown in perfection, in
  movement, in ravishing variety. Standing, kneeling, sitting,
  lying down, grave or sad, playful, exulting, repentant, wanton,
  menacing, anxious, all mental states follow rapidly one after
  another. With wonderful taste she suits the folding of her veil
  to each expression, and with the same handkerchief makes every
  kind of head-dress. The Old Knight holds the Light for her, and
  enters into the exhibition with his whole soul." Sir William had
  twelve of the "Representations" done by a German artist named
  Frederick Rehberg, entitled "Drawings faithfully copied from
  Nature at Naples."</p>

  <p>Hamilton married Emma in 1791 in England, and when they
  returned to Naples she was presented to the Queen, and ultimately
  became on intimate terms with Her Majesty of Naples, whose
  questionable morals were freely spoken of. Emma quickly attained
  a high social standing, but it is doubtful whether she exercised
  that influence over the Queen of which she liked to boast.</p>

  <p>In September, 1793, Nelson was at Naples by orders, and was
  the guest of the Hamiltons for <a name="Page_77" id=
  "Page_77"></a>a few days. He had not been there for five years,
  yet the precious Emma, without decorum or ceremony, sent him a
  written whirlwind of congratulations on the occasion of his
  victory at the Nile. Every line of the letter sends forth
  crackling sparks of fiery passion. She begins, "My dear, dear
  Sir," tells him she is delirious, that she fainted and fell on
  her side, "and am hurt," when she heard the joyful news. She
  "would feel it a glory to die in such a cause," but she cannot
  die until she has embraced "the Victor of the Nile." Then she
  proceeds to describe the transports of Maria Carolina. "She
  fainted too, cried, kissed her husband, her children, walked,
  frantic with pleasure, about the room, cried, kissed and embraced
  everybody near her." Then she continues, "Oh! brave Nelson! Oh!
  God bless and protect our brave deliverer! Oh! Nelson, Nelson!
  Oh! Victor! Oh! that my swollen heart could now tell him
  personally what we owe to him. My dress from head to foot is
  Allah Nelson. My earrings are Nelson's anchors." She sends him
  some sonnets, and avers that she must have taken a ship to "send
  all what is written on you." And so she goes on, throwing herself
  into his arms, metaphorically speaking, at every sentence.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Vanguard</i> arrived at Naples, Nelson invited
  Lady Hamilton on board and she was no sooner on the deck than she
  made one dramatic plunge at him, and proceeded to faint on the
  poor shattered man's breast. Nelson, whose besetting weakness was
  love of approbation, became <a name="Page_78" id=
  "Page_78"></a>intoxicated with the lady's method of making love.
  Poor gallant fellow! He was, like many another, the victim of
  human weakness. He immediately believed that he and Emma had
  "found each other," and allowed himself to be flattered with
  refined delicacy into a liaison which became a fierce passion,
  and tested the loyalty of his closest friends to breaking-point.
  How infinitely pathetic is this piteous story from beginning to
  end!</p>

  <p>Like most sailors, Nelson had a fervent, religious belief in
  the Eternal, and never went to battle without casting himself on
  the mercy of the Infinite Pity which alone can give solace. He
  was fearless and strong in the affairs of his profession, and it
  may be safely assumed that, even if it went no deeper, he had a
  mystic fear of God, and was lost to all other fear.</p>

  <p>I think it was Carlyle who said, "God save us from the madness
  of popularity. It invariably injures those who get it." There
  never was a truer thing said, and it is sadly true of our great
  national hero. Not many months had passed before the dispenser of
  his praises had become his proprietor. It is doubtful whether
  Emma ever loved him, but that does not concern any one. What does
  concern us is the imperious domination she exercised over him. No
  flighty absurdities of fiction can equal the extravagance of his
  devotion to her, and his unchecked desire to let every one know
  it. He even informs Lady Nelson that Lady Hamilton is the very
  best woman in the world and an honour to her <a name="Page_79"
  id="Page_79"></a>sex, and that he had a pride in having her as a
  friend. He writes to Lord St. Vincent that she is "an angel," and
  has honoured him in being his Ambassadress to the Queen and is
  worthy of his confidence. Again he writes, "Our dear Lady
  Hamilton, whom to see is to admire, but to know are to be added
  honour and respect; her head and heart surpass her beauty, which
  cannot be equalled by anything I have seen."</p>

  <p>It is impossible to suppose that a man could fall so violently
  in love with this extraordinary creature and permit her to come
  so intimately into his life without injury to his judgment and to
  those keen mental qualities which were needed at that time in the
  service of his country. Such loss of control must surely have
  been followed by mental and intellectual deterioration. This lady
  of varied antecedents was the intermediary between the Court of
  Naples and himself, and it is now an authentic fact that it was
  on the advice of the Queen and Emma that Naples entered into a
  war, the result of which was the complete defeat of the
  Neapolitans; the Court and the Hamiltons had to fly to Palermo
  and Nelson again lived with the Minister and his wife. He again
  pours out the virtues and charms of Lady Hamilton, to whom he
  gives the credit of engineering the embarkation of the Royal
  Family and two and a half million sterling aboard the
  <i>Vanguard</i>. After giving St. Vincent another dose of Emma,
  he goes on to say, "It is my duty to tell your Lordship the
  obligations which the whole Royal Family, <a name="Page_80" id=
  "Page_80"></a>as well as myself, are under on this trying
  occasion to her Ladyship." Her Ladyship, still hankering after
  her old friend Greville, writes him, "My dear adorable queen and
  I weep together, and now that is our only comfort." It is no
  concern of ours, but it looks uncommonly as though Greville still
  held the field, and the opinion of many that Nelson would not
  have had much chance against her former lover is borne out by
  many facts.</p>

  <p>Amongst the saddest stories that raged about the Hamiltons,
  their friends, and Nelson was the scandal of gambling for large
  stakes. Some are persistent in the assertion that the report was
  well founded, and others that it was not so bad as it was made
  out to be. Lady Hamilton asserted that the stories were all
  falsehoods invented by the Jacobinical party, but her Ladyship's
  veracity was never to be relied upon. Perhaps a foundation of
  truth and a large amount of exaggeration sums up the reports, so
  we must let it go at that. Troubridge seems to have been
  convinced that his Admiral was in the midst of a fast set, for he
  sends a most imploring remonstrance to him to get out of it and
  have no more incense puffed in his face. This was fine advice,
  but the victor of the Nile made no response.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p>Nelson was little known to his countrymen before the St.
  Vincent battle. But after the <a name="Page_81" id=
  "Page_81"></a>victory of the Nile his name became immortal, and
  he could take any liberty he liked with our national
  conventionalisms. Even his love affairs were regarded as heroics.
  He refused occasionally to carry out instructions when he thought
  his own plans were better, and it was winked at; but had any of
  them miscarried, the memory of St. Vincent and the Nile would not
  have lived long.</p>

  <p>When he arrived with the Hamiltons in London after his long
  absence and victorious record, the mob, as usual, took the horses
  from the carriage and dragged him along Cheapside amid tumultuous
  cheers. Whenever he appeared in public the same thing happened.
  At Court, things were different. His reception was offensively
  cold, and George III ran some risk when he affronted his most
  popular subject by turning his back on him. Whatever private
  indiscretions Nelson may have been guilty of, nothing could
  justify so ungrateful an act of ill-mannered snobbery. The King
  should have known how to distinguish between private weakness,
  however unconventional, and matchless public service. But for the
  fine genius and patriotism of this noble fellow, he might have
  lost his crown. The temper of a capricious public in an era of
  revolution should not be tested by freaks of royal
  self-righteousness, while its imagination is being stirred by the
  deeds of a national hero. His action might have brought the
  dignity of George's kingliness into the gutter of ridicule, which
  would have been a public misfortune.</p>

  <p>The King's treatment of Nelson was worse <a name="Page_82" id=
  "Page_82"></a>than tactless; it was an impertinence. King Edward
  VII, whose wisdom and tact could always be trusted, might have
  disapproved, as strongly as did George III, Nelson's disregard of
  social conventions, but he would have received him on grounds of
  high public service, and have let his private faults, if he knew
  of them, pass unnoticed, instead of giving him an inarticulate
  snub. Still, a genius of naval distinction, or any other, has no
  right to claim exemption from a law that governs a large section
  of society, or to suppose that he may not be criticized or even
  ostracized if he defiantly offends the susceptibilities of our
  moral national life. And it is rather a big tax on one's patience
  for a man, because of his exalted position and distinguished
  deeds of valour and high services rendered to the State, to
  expect that he may be granted licence to parade his gallantries
  with women in boastful indifference to the moral law that governs
  the lives of a large section of the community. There are
  undoubtedly cases of ill-assorted unions, but it does not lie
  within our province to judge such cases. They may be victims of a
  hard fate far beyond the knowledge of the serene critics, whose
  habit of life is to sneak into the sacred affairs of others,
  while their own may be in need of vigilant enquiry and
  adjustment.</p>

  <p>It would hardly be possible, with the facts before us, to say
  a word in mitigation of Nelson's ostentatious infatuation for
  Lady Hamilton, were it not that he can never be judged from the
  same standpoint as ordinary mortals. That is not to say that a
  man, mentally constituted as he was, <a name="Page_83" id=
  "Page_83"></a>should not be amenable to established social
  laws.</p>

  <p>Nelson was a compound of peculiarities, like most men who are
  put into the world to do something great. He was amusingly vain,
  while his dainty vanity so obscured his judgment that he could
  not see through the most fulsome flattery, especially that of
  women. At the same time he was professionally keen, with a
  clear-seeing intellect, dashing, flawless courage, and a mind
  that quickly grasped the weak points of the enemy's position or
  formation. He fought the old form of sea warfare by methods that
  were exclusively his, and sent his opponents staggering into
  confusion. Once a plan of battle had been arranged, he never
  faltered in his judgment, and only manoeuvred as circumstances
  arose, but always with that unexpected rush and resource which
  carried with it certain victory.</p>

  <p>Nelson's great talents and his victories caused society
  outwardly to overlook his connection with the notorious Lady
  Hamilton. But the gossips were always at work. On this point he
  does not seem to have realized that he was playing pranks with
  society, though there were abundant evidences of it. He was
  offended because at Dresden, on their way to England, the
  Electress refused to receive his mistress on account of her
  antecedents, and no Court was held during their stay. Of course
  Emma was given the cold shoulder in England by the Court and by
  society. Nelson told his friend Collingwood of his own treatment,
  and added that, either <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>as a
  public or private man, he wished nothing undone which he had
  done. He told Collingwood of his cold reception by the King, but
  it seems quite obvious that he maintained his belief that his
  connection with Emma had no right to be questioned by His Majesty
  or any of his subjects, and he held this view to the last. He
  would have none of the moralists' cant lavished on him, and by
  his consistent attitude seemed to say, "Hands off my private
  life! If I <i>did</i> introduce Lady Hamilton to my wife at her
  apartments on my arrival in England after two and a half years'
  absence, when she was on the point of becoming the mother of
  Horatia, what business is that of yours? I will have none of your
  abstract morality. Get away, and clean up your own morals before
  you talk to me of mine." The above is what I think a man of
  Nelson's temperament might say to the people who wished to warn
  him against the dangerous course he was pursuing. Lady Nelson
  does not seem to have been a woman who could appeal to a man like
  Nelson. The fact is she may have been one of those unamiable,
  sexless females who was either coldly ignoring her husband or
  storing up in her heart any excuse for hurling at him the most
  bitter invective with which she might humiliate him. She does not
  appear to have been a vulgar shrieker, but she may have been a
  silent stabber, which is worse. In any case, Nelson seems to have
  made a bad choice, as by his actions he openly avowed that he
  preferred to live with the former mistress of Featherstonehaugh,
  Greville, and <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>Hamilton, rather
  than with his lawful wife; and he, without a doubt, was the best
  judge as to which of them suited him best. The truth remains that
  Emma was attractive and talented, and although lowly born, she
  became the bosom companion of kings, queens, princesses, princes,
  and of many men and women of distinction.</p>

  <p>Nelson must have been extraordinarily simple to imagine that
  his wife, knowing, as all the world knew, that Lady Hamilton was
  his mistress and a bold, unscrupulous rival, would receive her
  with rapturous friendliness. The amazing puzzle to most people,
  then and now, is why she received her at all, unless she wished
  to worm out of her the precise nature of the intimacy. That may
  have been her definite purpose in allowing the visits for two or
  three months; then one day she flew into a rage, which conjures
  up a vision of hooks and eyes bursting like crackers from her
  person, and after a theatrical display of temper she disappears
  like a whirling tempest from the presence of her faithless
  husband, never again to meet him. This manner of showing
  resentment to the gallant sailor's fondness for the wife of Sir
  William Hamilton was the last straw. There was nothing dignified
  in Lady Nelson's tornado farewell to her husband; rather, if the
  records may be relied on, it was accompanied by a flow of abuse
  which could only emanate from an enraged termagant.</p>

  <p>Nelson now had a free hand. His wife was to have a generous
  allowance on condition that she left him alone freely to bestow
  his affections on the seductive Emma, whose story, retold by Mr.
  <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>Harrison, shows Lady Nelson to
  have been an impossible woman to live with. She made home hell to
  him, so he said. And making liberal allowance for Emma's fibbing
  propensities, there are positive evidences that her story of
  Nelson's home life was crammed with pathetic truths of domestic
  misery. Nelson corroborates this by a letter to Emma almost
  immediately after his wife's ludicrous exit. The letter is the
  outpouring of an embittered soul that had been freed from
  purgatory and was entering into a new joy. It is a sickening
  effusion of unrestrained love-making that would put any personage
  of penny-novel fame to the blush. I may as well give the full
  dose. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Now, my own dear wife: for such you are in the sight of
    Heaven, I can give full scope to my feelings, for I dare say
    Oliver will faithfully deliver this letter. You know, my
    dearest Emma, that there is nothing in this world that I would
    not do for us to live together, and to have our dear little
    child with us. I firmly believe that this campaign will give us
    peace, and then we will set off for Bronte. In twelve hours we
    shall be across the water, and freed from all the nonsense of
    his friends, or rather pretended ones. Nothing but an event
    happening to him could prevent my going; and I am sure you will
    think so, for, unless all matters accord, it would bring a
    hundred of tongues and slanderous reports if I separated from
    her, which I would do with pleasure the moment we can be
    united. I want to see her no more; therefore we must manage
    till we can quit this country, or your uncle dies. I love you:
    I never did love any one else. I never had a dear pledge of
    love till you gave me one; and you, thank my God, never gave
    one to anybody else. I think before March is out, you will
    either see us back, or so victorious that we shall ensure a
    glorious issue to our toils. Think what my Emma will feel at
    seeing return safe, perhaps with <a name="Page_87" id=
    "Page_87"></a>a little more fame, her own dear Nelson. Never,
    if I can help it, will I dine out of my ship or go on shore,
    except duty calls me. Let Sir Hyde have any glory he can catch,
    I envy him not. You, my beloved Emma, and my country, are the
    two dearest objects of my fond heart. <i>A heart susceptible
    and true.</i> Only place confidence in me, and you shall never
    be disappointed. I burn all your dear letters, because it is
    right for your sake; and I wish you would burn all
    mine&mdash;they can do no good, and will do us both harm if any
    seizure of them; or the dropping even one of them would fill
    the mouths of the world sooner than we intend. My longing for
    you, both person and conversation, you may readily imagine
    (especially the person). No, my heart, person, and mind are in
    perfect union of love towards my own dear, beloved Emma, the
    real bosom friend of her, all hers, all Emma's.</p>

    <p>NELSON AND BRONTE.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Prince of Wales had dined with and paid suspicious
  attentions to Emma, and her fond lover, knowing this, advised her
  to warn him off. He probably had an instinct that his "beloved
  Emma," who is "the dearest object of his fond heart," was not
  quite strong enough to resist temptation. Especially would she be
  likely to fall under the fascinating influence of this little
  princely scamp. Nelson's mind turned to his wife, and he
  emphasized the desire that he might never see his aversion again.
  Nor did he.</p>

  <p>Some of his contemporaries doubted the paternity of Horatia;
  Nelson never did, and it would be hard to find a more beautiful
  outpouring of love than that which he unfailingly gave to his
  little daughter. Every thought of his soul was divided between
  her and the audacious flirt of a mother whom Nelson, always
  lavish, calls "his love"; "his darling angel"; "his
  heaven-<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>given wife"; "the
  dearest, only true wife of his own till death." The "till death"
  finish is quite sailorly!</p>

  <p>No one will doubt his amazing faculty for love-making and
  love-writing, and it must always be a puzzle how he managed to
  mix it so successfully with war. His guilty love-making was an
  occasional embarrassment to him, and though he was the greatest
  naval tactician of his time, his domestic methods were hopelessly
  clumsy and transparent. For instance, in pouring out his
  grievances to his mistress he refers to himself by the name of
  Thompson, and to Lady Nelson as Aunt. Here are a few
  examples:&mdash;"Thompson desires me to say he has never wrote
  his Aunt since he sailed." "In twelve hours we shall be across
  the water, and freed from all the nonsense of his friends, or
  rather, pretended ones." "His" means Hamilton, and "friends"
  means the Prince of Wales, whom he looked upon as a rival for
  Emma's accommodating affections. Again, he says, "If I separated
  from her, which I would do with pleasure the moment we can be
  united." "Her" is Lady Nelson, but in discussing delicate matters
  of domestic policy he thinks it desirable to conceal that he
  would not weep were he to hear of Sir William's death, or be
  broken with grief to separate entirely from Lady Nelson, so that
  he might become "united to his heaven-given wife," "our darling
  angel, Emma."</p>

  <h3><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>V</h3>

  <p>The Admiralty did a great injustice to the victor of the Nile
  by appointing Sir Hyde Parker commander-in-chief, instead of one
  who was known to be the most brilliant officer in the Navy. It
  must have cut deeply into Nelson's proud soul to have to serve
  under a man who had not a particle of initiative; and, but for
  the splendid bravery and matchless talents of his second, the
  wooden walls of old England would have been sent to Davy Jones by
  the forts of Copenhagen and the Danish fleet. Sir Hyde did not
  relish having Nelson with him at all. He sulked, and treated him
  in a way that was observed and resented by those who served under
  him. The commander-in-chief acted like a jealous maiden, his
  intention being to freeze and humiliate the man who was destined
  to win the victory and save the British fleet from entire
  destruction. There always has been tremendous jealousy in the
  Navy. But Sir Hyde Parker should have known that he was dealing
  with an officer (who was the genius of the Navy) who would stand
  no nonsense from any Lord High Admiral or other fussy dignitary
  whom he could put in his pocket whenever he liked to exercise his
  personality. Nelson never shirked responsibility when his
  country's interests were being endangered by a dignified snob.
  Discipline, so far as he was concerned until his object was
  gained, was pushed aside, and the great spirit swept into the
  vortex <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>of the danger and
  extinguished all opposition. He said on one occasion, "I hate
  your pen-and-ink men. A fleet of British warships are the best
  negotiators in Europe."</p>

  <p>I have said that Parker was in the "sulks," so Nelson adopted
  a humorous plan of thawing the ice by catching a turbot on the
  Dogger Bank on the passage out to the Baltic. A sly seaman had
  told him that this kind of fish was easily caught, so when they
  arrived on the Bank the fishing commenced, and the turbot was
  caught. Nelson knew his commander-in-chief was never averse to
  eating, so he gave orders to have it sent to Sir Hyde, and
  although the sea was dangerous for a small boat, the fish was in
  due course presented to Parker, who sent back a cordial note of
  thanks. This ingenious stratagem eased the strained relations
  between the two men, but there still remained a feeling on the
  part of the commander-in-chief that the electric and resourceful
  spirit of Nelson would, in any engagement, be the dominating
  factor, with or without official sanction. He knew how
  irresistibly Nelson's influence permeated the fleet, for no man
  knew better than this much-envied Vice-Admiral how to enthuse his
  comrades (high and low) in battle, and also what confidence the
  nation as a whole had in what he called the "Nelson touch." Sir
  Hyde Parker, knowing Nelson's superb qualities, should have
  paused and considered the consequences before he slyly sought to
  put such a man in the shade. There was not a man in the whole
  squadron who would <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>not have
  gone to his doom under Nelson's lead rather than live under any
  other's. Nelson inspired men with the same love of glory which he
  craved for himself. No real sailor ever did like to sail under a
  hesitating, nervous commander. Parker, at the battle of
  Copenhagen, gives one (from all accounts) the impression of
  unsureness, afraid to take any risk lest it be the wrong one.
  Nelson was always sure, and never hesitated to put into practice
  his considered views.</p>

  <p>Parker, at a critical moment in the battle of Copenhagen,
  hoisted No. 39, which meant "Leave off action." Nelson shrugged
  his shoulders, and Said, "No, I'm damned if I do," and kept his
  own "Engage the enemy more closely" flying. He then added to
  Captain Foley, "I have only one eye, and have a right to be blind
  sometimes." He then put the telescope to his blind eye, and said,
  "I really do not see the signal." Unfortunately, some of the
  ships retired, and one able fellow, Captain Riou, who knew it was
  a wrong move, was so distressed that he called out in despair to
  one of his officers beside him, "What will Nelson think of us?"
  The poor captain was subsequently killed. There can be no doubt
  now that the signal 39 was not permissive or optional, nor that
  Nelson, having the enemy by the throat, refused to let go until
  he had strangled him, nor that he did dramatically act the
  blind-eye trick. He deliberately disobeyed orders, and saved
  England's honour and fleet by doing so. It was one of his
  splendid performances, and the story of it will live on into
  distant ages.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>Who can calculate the loss
  of national prestige or the lives that have been thrown away by
  putting severely decorous senior officers over the heads of men
  who knew their business better and had the courage and capacity
  to carry through big naval or military tasks? And how tempting it
  must be to many a gallant fellow to take the business into his
  own hands! Nelson knew well enough that he had laid himself open
  to the full penalty of naval law, but he knew also that if any of
  the moth-eaten crew at Whitehall even hinted it there would be
  "wigs on the green." No man knew the pulse of the nation better,
  and no commander played up to it less. One can imagine hearing
  him say to some of his officers (perhaps Captain Hardy of
  Trafalgar fame), after he had wrecked the Danish fleet and
  battered the forts into a dilapidated condition, "Well, I have
  fought contrary to orders, and they will perhaps hang me; never
  mind, let them." A significant "let them" this, which means more
  than he cares to express. The Danes frankly admitted that they
  had been beaten, and that even their defence was destroyed, as
  the Crown batteries could not be held. Instead of any talk of
  "hanging" him because of his "disobedience," he was made a
  Viscount and his Rear-Admiral (Graves) a Knight of the Bath.
  These were the only two significant honours conferred. When he
  landed at Copenhagen, it is said that the people viewed him with
  a mixture of admiration and hostility. He thought they were
  extremely amiable. They cheered and shouted "God bless Lord
  Nelson!" <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>There can be no
  reason for their doing this, except gratitude to him for not
  blowing the city down about their ears.</p>

  <p>Whatever the cause, it is quite certain that the Crown Prince
  and some of the Danish statesmen treated him with studied
  cordiality. Sir Hyde Parker was a drag, and indeed, an
  intolerable nuisance to him. When the armistice was sealed and
  settled for fourteen weeks, he wished to get of to Reval and
  hammer the Russian squadron there, but the commander-in-chief
  shirked all responsibility, and his victim was made to say in a
  letter to Lord St. Vincent "that he would have been in Reval
  fourteen days before, and that no one could tell what he had
  suffered," and asks my dear Lord "if he has deserved well, to let
  him retire, and if ill, for heaven's sake to supersede him, for
  he cannot exist in this state." Lord Nelson conducted the British
  case with the Danes with consummate statesmanship, but
  notwithstanding this, the fine sensitive nature of the noble
  fellow could not fail to be hurt when His Majesty (the same who
  lost us America) stated that, "under <i>all</i> the
  circumstances, he had thought well to approve." Nelson replied
  that he was sorry the armistice was only approved under
  <i>all</i> the circumstances, and then gives His Majesty a slap
  in the eye by informing him that every part of the <i>all</i> was
  to the advantage of the King and Country. St. Vincent, the First
  Lord of the Admiralty, subsequently made amends for His Majesty's
  error by writing to say that his "whole conduct was approved and
  admired, and that he <a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>does not
  care to draw comparisons, but that everybody agrees there is only
  one Nelson." This strong and valiant sailor was never at any time
  unconscious of his power. What troubled him was other people's
  lack of appreciation of it, though he accepted with a whimsical
  humour the grudging spirit in which credit was given to his
  unerring judgment and unequalled bravery. Nor can we examine the
  great deeds of his career without feeling a thrill of pride in
  the knowledge that he belonged to us.</p>

  <p>The spirit which animated Nelson was the same as that which
  lived in those heroes of old who were used by Providence as
  instruments in their country's destiny, and we may believe that
  this same spirit will live in those God-sent men of the future
  who will be necessary for the carrying out of some special task
  or for the destruction of evil. Apparently, long intervals elapse
  between the appearance of men such as Napoleon or Nelson.
  Napoleon's name still stirs the blood, and now, more than a
  century after his death, any one of the Powers who had a share in
  his tragic end would give worlds to get back some of his force
  and genius. Nelson in a much less degree and in a different way
  was another of those sent by Providence to take part in his
  country's struggles and, like many another great man, was
  subjected to cruel indignities at the hands of his inferiors. He
  often complained about his treatment, but this never prevented
  him from doing his work. But as his instructions were not always
  in accordance with his view of success, he occasionally <a name=
  "Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>disobeyed them for the country's good.
  It might be a gain to borrow <i>his</i> spirit for a while at the
  present time to electrify the British Admiralty. Nelson was more
  successful in his conflicts with the enemy than with the chiefs
  of his calling afloat and ashore. He was not really strong and
  audacious enough in his dealings with them. "Jacky Fisher" (as he
  is fondly called) who lives in our disturbed time, would have had
  similar sandbags jettisoned in quick time. The modern Nelson has
  had his troubles with inferior superiors too, but he flattened
  out some of them. The modern man is all business, and does not
  show vanity if he has any. The "Only Nelson" was strong, weak,
  and vain. If no one else gratuitously sounded his praises, he
  would do so himself in the most comical way, not altogether in
  public, but to "Santa Emma," whose function it was to spread them
  abroad.</p>

  <p>After the battle of Copenhagen, Sir Hyde Parker sailed for
  Carlscrona, and left Nelson to hoist his flag as
  commander-in-chief on the <i>St. George</i>, which was not ready,
  and was possibly being refitted after rough handling. He tells
  Emma of Parker's departure, and adds, "if there is any work to
  do," i.e. any fighting, "he is pretty certain they will wait for
  him" before commencing it. And then he adds, "<i>Nelson will be
  first</i>. Who can stop him?" On the eve of the battle of
  Copenhagen he wrote to her, "Before you receive this, all will be
  over with Denmark. Either your Nelson will be safe, and Sir Hyde
  Parker victor, <a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>or your own
  Nelson will be laid low." What deep and genuine love-lunacy to be
  found in a terrific warrior, whose very name terrified those who
  had the honour to fight against him! The incongruity of it
  baffles one's belief, and seems to reverse the very order of
  human construction. In matters concerning his profession and
  highly technical State affairs there was no more astute man, but
  as soon as his thoughts centre on this female nightmare, he loses
  control of his wonderful gifts, and his mind becomes deranged
  with the idea of her being an object on which he should bestow
  reverence and infinite adulation. If ever there was a creature of
  lamentable contradictions, surely it was this genius, who
  immortalized our national glory at the Nile, Copenhagen, and
  Trafalgar! That a man of his calibre, surrounded with eternal
  fame, should be inflamed with a passion for a woman of negative
  morals who was refused admittance to the same circle that, but
  for this attachment would receive him as their triumphant hero,
  is an example of human eccentricity that never has and never can
  be accounted for. It may be taken for granted that at the very
  time he was writing to her about "her own Nelson" she would be
  carrying on a love intrigue with some old or new acquaintance,
  possibly the Prince of Wales, whom as I have said, her gallant
  lover wished her to avoid. He was known to be a cheat, a liar,
  and a faithless friend to men and to women, while in accordance
  with the splendid ethic of this type of person, he believed
  himself to be possessed of every saintly virtue. But any one who
  is curious <a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>to have a
  fascinating description of the "little dapper" should consult
  Thackeray.</p>

  <p>Well, there was no fighting to be done when the fleet under
  Nelson arrived at Reval, and the Emperor Paul's death and the
  dilatoriness of Parker saved the Russian fleet from
  extermination. They had sailed into safer anchorage and the
  British Admiral had to content himself by paying an official
  visit to the authorities at Reval, and receiving another ovation
  from the populace, which appealed to his whimsical love of
  approbation. As is his custom, he sends Emma an account of his
  Reval experiences. He says he would not mention so personal an
  incident to any one else, as it would appear so uncommonly like
  vanity, but between her and himself, hundreds had come to have a
  look at Nelson, and he heard them say, "<i>That is him!</i> That
  is <i>him</i>!" It touches his vanity so keenly that he follows
  on by intimating that he "feels a good name is better than
  riches, and that it has a fine feeling to an honest heart." "All
  the Russians," says he, "are of opinion that I am like Suwaroff,
  le Jeune Suwaroff." As may be imagined, Nelson was bitterly
  disappointed at so sudden a collapse of his hopes, but, always
  master of the situation, he wrote a most courteous letter to
  Count Pahlen, the Russian Minister, who had complained that his
  presence was calculated to make a breach of the good feeling
  between the two countries. The Admiral's reply was tactful and
  unconsciously humorous. The tone was that of a person who had
  never been so unjustly hurt in his life. "He <a name="Page_98"
  id="Page_98"></a>had come to pay his respects to His Imperial
  Majesty, and as his motives had been so entirely misunderstood,
  he would put to sea at once."</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p>His health was beginning to feel the enormous strain that had
  been imposed upon him for many months. This, together with his
  longing to be in the congenial society of Lady Hamilton, caused
  him to ask to be relieved of his command, and he was delighted to
  receive a letter from his old chief, Lord St. Vincent, stating
  that it was almost an impossible task to find a suitable
  successor, as in all his experience he never knew any one, except
  Troubridge, who had the art of enthusing others with his own
  unequalled spirit as he had. The command was handed over to Sir
  Charles Pole, and Nelson, almost wild with joy, sailed from the
  Baltic in the brig <i>Kite</i> on the 19th June, and arrived at
  Yarmouth on the 1st July, 1801. Nelson always claimed that if the
  command had been given to him in February many lives would have
  been saved, and our prestige would not have suffered.</p>

  <p>We cannot describe all the fascinating pleasure we get when we
  read and think of the wonders this strange mortal performed in
  the ordinary course of his profession; when, however, he departs
  from that and begins to make stagey love to Lady Hamilton, it
  tries one's Christian patience. What business had he, as the
  first sailor in <a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>the world, to
  enter into such a compact with another man's wife? However, he
  must not be judged by this liaison alone, but by the
  circumstances that led to it.</p>

  <p>We know that his domestic life had been made irritating and
  unbearable to his sensitive and highly strung nature, but he
  found in Emma Hamilton one who played upon his vanity, and made
  him feel that he was regarded as an idol as well as an idolatrous
  lover. He thirsted for reverence and the love of soul for soul,
  and she, in her own way, gave both with lavish profusion, whereas
  his wife's austere indifference to his amazing accomplishments
  fell upon his large heart like ice, and who can estimate his
  sufferings before he decided to defy society? He believed and
  hoped that he would be exonerated, and became in the sight of
  Heaven (as he avowed) the husband of a woman who, there can be
  little doubt, did not keep her honour unstained, but who, to him,
  was the guiding spirit of his remaining days: and whatever
  impressions we may have forced upon us of the liaisons of this
  noxious creature, there is nothing on record that suggests that
  he was ever unfaithful to her after the bond of union was made.
  Nor does he appear to have been openly charged with illicit
  intimacy with other women after his marriage to Mrs. Nisbet,
  other than with Lady Hamilton.</p>

  <p>We may talk of his wonderful career being morally blunted, but
  his own belief in the sanctity of the verbal arrangement was
  sound to the core, and he hazarded the opprobrium of our stern
  <a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>conventional system. To him,
  Lady Hamilton had an enduring charm which influenced his wild,
  weak, generous soul, and was in fact an inspiration to him. It is
  a truism that the life-story of all men has its tragedy and
  romance, and in this, Nelson's was only similar to others; and
  who can help loving his memory?</p>

  <p>The Hamiltons lived with him at Merton when he was on leave.
  They shared the cost of the home, which Lady Hamilton had, with
  elaborate, artistic taste, prepared for him. A document written
  by Sir William makes it clear that the relations of man and wife
  were strained at times to breaking-point, for, as he states, "I
  am old and she in the beauty and vigour of youth"; and then he
  proceeds: "I have no complaint to make, but I feel that the whole
  attention of my wife is given to Lord Nelson and his interest at
  Merton." Obviously, this is the old gentleman's dull way of
  expressing his idea that there was a gamble going on with the
  marriage vow, and then, with delightful simplicity, he nullifies
  his suspicious thoughts by stating that he well knows the purity
  of Lord Nelson's friendship for Emma and himself and that he
  knows how uncomfortable it would make his Lordship, our best
  friend, if a separation should take place; therefore he was
  determined to do all in his power to prevent such an extremity,
  which would be essentially detrimental to all parties, but would
  be more sensibly felt by "<i>our dear friend than by
  us</i>."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He is willing to go on
  provided the expenses do not go <a name="Page_101" id=
  "Page_101"></a>on increasing, but as he cannot expect to live
  many years, every moment is precious to him, and hopes that he
  may be allowed to be his own master <i>and pass his time in his
  own way</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He continues: "I am
  fully determined not to have any more silly altercations that too
  often arise between us, and embitter his present moments
  exceedingly. If we cannot live comfortably together," he
  continues, "a wise and well-concerted separation would be
  preferable." He says he knows and admires her talents and many
  excellent qualities, but <i>he is not blind to her
  defects</i>,[5] and confesses to having many himself, and pleads
  "for God's sake to bear and forbear."</p>

  <p>Throughout this pathetic document we find evidences that his
  heart was torn with the consciousness of the mean advantage being
  taken of his friendship. There is a droll, vacillating belief in
  the virtue of his wife and the purity of Nelson's motives, but
  every sentence indicates that his instinct led him to believe
  that another had taken his place. It may have been that he saw it
  dimly, and that he shrank from making any direct accusation, not
  wishing to break with the man with whom he had long been on close
  terms of friendship. It is highly improbable that either his own
  or Emma's past histories escaped his memory when he was penning
  his grievances. Indeed, there are evidences gleaming through his
  memorandum that his reflections were harassed by the remembrance
  of his own conduct, which had plunged to epic depths of
  wrongdoing in other <a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>days.
  These and other considerations would doubtless have a restraining
  effect on the action that might have been taken under different
  circumstances. Sir William Hamilton must have pondered over the
  parentage of Horatia, who was born on the 29th January, 1801. Is
  it possible that he knew that Nelson was her father, and believed
  in the purity of his friendship for Emma and himself? I think
  everything goes to prove that he knew of his friend's relations
  with his wife and condoned it. Nelson, in his clumsy, transparent
  way, tried to conceal the origin of the child, so he proceeds to
  write a letter to Lady Hamilton, which I shall quote later on. To
  say that Sir William Hamilton, a man of the world with vast
  experience of human deceptions and intrigues, could have been put
  off the scent, in view of all the circumstances, is too great a
  tax on credulity, but it is wholly characteristic of Nelson's
  ideas of mystification. But even if there were any further proof
  needed, Lady Hamilton has settled the matter by preserving the
  correspondence Nelson urged her to destroy. This will be referred
  to later on.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, it is hardly thinkable that Nelson, who had such a
  high sense of honour in other affairs of life, and who had
  accepted the hospitality and been the honoured guest of Sir
  William Hamilton at Naples, should have made the occasion an
  opportunity of establishing illicit relations with his wife. The
  whole matter must ever remain a blot on the great Admiral's fame,
  even though his host appeared to, or really did, connive at it.
  The price was too high to pay for both of them.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>The following extract
  from a letter from Lord Minto to his wife indicates the mode of
  life of the family party. He says:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>I went to Lord Nelson's (Merton) on Saturday. The whole
    establishment and way of life makes me angry as well as
    melancholy. I do not think myself obliged to quarrel with him
    for his weakness, though nothing shall ever induce me to give
    the smallest countenance to Lady Hamilton. She looks ultimately
    to the chance of marriage, as Sir William will not be long in
    her way, and she probably indulges a hope that she may survive
    Lady Nelson. She is in high looks, but more immense than ever.
    She goes on cramming Nelson with trowels of flattery, which he
    takes as quietly as a child does pap. The love she makes to him
    is ridiculous and disgusting. The whole house, staircase and
    all, are covered with pictures of her and him of all sorts and
    sizes. He is represented in naval actions, coats of arms,
    pieces of plate in his honour, the flagstaff of
    <i>L'Orient</i>. If it were Lady Hamilton's house, there might
    be pretence for it; but to make his own a mere looking-glass to
    view himself all day is bad taste.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This letter was written on the 22nd March, 1802, and Nelson
  writes that Sir William Hamilton died in his arms and in Lady
  Hamilton's on the 6th April, 1803, passing on "without a
  struggle, and that the world had never lost a more upright and
  accomplished gentleman";<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id=
  "FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class=
  "fnanchor">[5]</a> which, be it said, is rather a stagey
  performance of his wife's lover. <a name="Page_104" id=
  "Page_104"></a>But the mistress excels her lover in the record of
  the death-bed drama. "Unhappy day," says she in profusion of
  tears, "for the forlorn Emma. Ten minutes past ten dear beloved
  Sir William left me." Emma was poorly provided for; only
  &pound;700 a year jointure and &pound;100 a year for her mother
  for life. She and Nelson appealed to Lord Minto to urge on Mr.
  Addington her claim for a pension, and she vowed to Minto that
  her connection with Nelson was pure, and he says he can believe
  it, which is hardly consistent with the description he gives his
  wife as to "their open and disgusting proceedings," or with his
  comments on a visit paid to the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim,
  where the Duke had treated the gallant naval chief and his party
  as though they were mere ordinary trippers who had come to see
  the wonders of his possessions. He condescendingly ordered
  refreshments to be given to them, which sent Nelson into a fury
  of indignation, and Minto excuses the Duke by stating that Nelson
  persuaded himself that all the world should be blind because he
  chose to extol Emma's "virtues." Obviously, Minto was not firmly
  convinced of her chastity.</p>

  <p>Nelson, with his heart full of blind adoration, had quite a
  simple, sailorly conviction that no one ought to question the
  innocence of his attachment to Emma, since he called Hamilton her
  "Uncle"; and, because he wished the public to believe in his
  innocence, he took it for granted that they would believe it. The
  Duke of Marlborough evidently had heard and believed in the
  <a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>impure tale, but that did
  not justify him in treating his noble guest and his friends in
  the snobbish and ill-mannered way he did. It is hardly likely
  that Nelson would have paid the visit without being asked, and in
  ordinary decency he should have been received or not asked at
  all. He was a greater figure and public servant than the Duke,
  and His Grace would not have suffered in dignity had he met
  Nelson on terms of equality. He could not have done less, at all
  events. On the other hand, the great Admiral showed a peevishness
  at the treatment which was unworthy of his fame and position; he
  could well afford to ignore the affront, more especially as he
  prided himself that the lady the Duke took exception to was "in
  the sight of Heaven his wife," and no one had any right to
  question his choice.</p>

  <p>The views held by Hamilton and recorded in various conflicting
  versions give the impression that he was puzzled, and could not
  determine whether to believe in the fidelity of Nelson or not.
  Some writers think that he winked at the liaison because of the
  difference between his own age and that of his wife; others, that
  he thought the relations were innocent, and a token of
  high-spirited friendship for himself; but all delicately indicate
  their conviction that he knew what was going on. Meanwhile,
  Nelson steadfastly avows his unyielding fidelity to his friends,
  and, with this exception, I think we may conclude that his
  devotion to them could always be relied upon; indeed, his
  attachment to Hamilton was of an affectionate character, even
  when many people <a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>believed he
  was betraying him. Whether Sir William knew and believed that the
  association between his wife and Nelson was pure or not,<a name=
  "FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
  class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he evidently desired that no one else
  should believe it, for in a codicil to his will he bequeaths "The
  copy of Madam Le Brun's picture of his wife in enamel, and gives
  to his dearest friend, Nelson, a very small token of the great
  regard he has for his Lordship, the most virtuous, loyal, and
  truly brave character I ever met with." Then he finishes up with
  God's blessing to him and shame to those who do not say "Amen."
  This is a wonderful testimony of friendship from a man who had
  been wronged, and might well have shaken the belief of those who
  founded their opinions on the startling improprieties they had
  beheld between the man whom he designated "the most virtuous,
  loyal, and truly brave character he had ever met with" and his
  wife. That Sir William connived at what looked uncommonly like
  infidelity may or may not be doubtful, but that he saw more than
  would have impressed an ordinary man or woman with suspicion is
  unquestionable, and the best that can be said for his attitude is
  that he was so mentally constituted that he could only see or
  preferred to see in Nelson's extravagant attentions to his wife a
  guileless symbol of high friendship for her, which he took as a
  compliment <a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>to himself. On
  the other hand, if he not only suspected but knew that he was
  being betrayed, and bitterly resented the passion which no
  remonstrances from him could have controlled, he at any rate
  determined to let the world see "how a Christian could die," and
  refrained from uttering the unutterable. Napoleon on the rock at
  St. Helena acted in the same magnanimous way towards the
  adulterous Marie Louise, of whose faithlessness he also
  unguardedly let slip his opinion.</p>

  <p>It is an odious habit, but we are apt to believe, without any
  reserve, disparaging stories, that may or may not be true,
  concerning men of distinction, and the more prominent the man or
  woman, the more viciously the scandal-mongers pursue their
  contemptible occupation. These vermin invariably belong to a
  class of industrious mediocrities who have been born with a
  mental kink, and their treachery, falsehood, and cowardice are
  incurable. They are merely hurtful creatures who spoil the earth,
  and are to be found dolefully chattering about what they conceive
  to be other men's and women's lapses from the paths of stern
  virtue. Their plan of life is to defame other people, and by this
  means proclaim their own superiority over other weak mortals.
  Give the unsexed woman a chance, and she will let fly with
  unrestrained industry. How many innocent people have had their
  names dragged into the public gaze by this vice! The report may
  arise from professional or political jealousy, and may grow into
  incredible accusations of immorality. Who can estimate the
  suffering caused to Lord Melbourne, the then Prime Minister, and
  to his <a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>relatives and
  friends, and even to some of his political opponents, and to the
  Hon. Mrs. Norton, one of Sheridan's beautiful daughters (who was
  the wife of as unscrupulous a scamp as was ever permitted to
  live), by the engineering of an accusation of infidelity that
  forced the Prime Minister and Mrs. Norton into the Courts to
  defend themselves against what was proved to be a malicious and
  unfounded story? The plaintiff's case, resting as it did upon a
  tissue of fabricated evidence, takes a fine place in history
  because of the judge's impartiality and sagacious charge, and the
  verdict of the jury for the defendants which was received with
  tumultuous cheers, characterized by the judge as "disgraceful in
  a court of justice." His Lordship's remonstrance was futile, and
  again and again the cheers were given, both in the court and
  outside, where the wildest enthusiasm prevailed. No one who took
  part in this disgraceful action came out of it with a higher
  reputation than Sir John Campbell, who acted for Melbourne. His
  entrance to the House of Commons that night was the occasion of
  an outburst of delirious cheering, the like of which had never
  been witnessed in the House. "The Tories" are said to have
  "affected to cheer." I give this as a notable case whereby two
  innocent people were threatened with ruin and disgrace by the
  poisonous slander circulated for both private and political ends
  and fostered by the worthless husband of a virtuous and amiable
  woman.</p>

  <p>It is common knowledge that Nelson and Sir William Hamilton
  were assailed by the same <a name="Page_109" id=
  "Page_109"></a>stinging wasps as Melbourne and Mrs. Norton (if it
  be proper to make a comparison), but they were different types of
  men living in a different atmosphere and under different
  circumstances. It is true that Nelson had scruples about the
  unwisdom of his unconventional connection with Lady Hamilton,
  and, big-hearted fellow that he was, he would have struggled hard
  to avoid giving pain to his relations and friends; and who knows
  that he did not? For though his actions may belie that
  impression, his whole attitude was reckless, silly, and
  whimsical. To whatever extent he may have had scruples, he
  certainly did not possess the faculty of holding his inclinations
  in check. Indeed, he made no secret of the idea that "every man
  became a bachelor after passing the Rock of Gibraltar," and in
  this notion he carried out the orthodoxy of the old-time
  sailor.</p>

  <p>He disliked marriage and loved glory, and being a popular
  hero, he was forgiven all his amorous sins, which were by many
  looked upon as being part of his heroism. His laughable efforts
  to obscure the facts might have satisfied those who wished to
  rely on Hamilton's benedictory absolution, had not Nelson and
  Emma, as I have already said, left behind them incriminating
  letters and documents which leave no doubt as to what they were
  to each other. The great Admiral industriously destroyed much of
  the massive correspondence, but had overlooked some of the hidden
  treasures. Lady Hamilton promised to destroy all hers, but failed
  to do so. Hence <a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>the
  documentary proof written by his own hand and that of Emma's
  cancels Nelson's childish device to throw a too critical public
  off the scent.</p>

  <p>Nelson was alternately weak, nervous, careless, and defiant in
  his attitude in regard to public opinion concerning his private
  life. He at one time asserted the right of living in any way he
  might choose, and resented the criticism of a few cackling
  busybodies, even though it was not in accordance with the views
  of the late Mr. Edward Cocker. It was his affair, and if his
  ideas differed from those of his critics, it was no business of
  theirs. His independence in this, as well as in the practical
  concerns of his profession, coincided with the opinions held by
  Sandy Mackay in "Alton Locke," who declared that he would "never
  bow down to a bit of brains." But these independent views
  alternated with weaker ones. He was as indiscreetly lavish with
  his love as he was with his money; at one time he would
  contemptuously defy the poisoned arrows that were darted at him,
  and when beset by the sullen storm-cloud of scandal, he let fly
  with red-hot courage and audaciously upheld his honour: at
  another time he was timid, vacillating, and ridiculous in his
  attempts to avert the public eye from his love affair and its
  consequence. People who knew him intimately were aware that
  Horatia was his daughter, and in order to throw them off their
  guard he proceeded to invent a cock-and-bull story of how he came
  by the child. Here is his letter to Lady Hamilton written in the
  middle <a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>of 1804: "I am now
  going to state a thing to you and to request your kind assistance
  which, from my dear Emma's goodness of heart, I am sure of her
  acquiescence in. Before we left Italy, I told you of the
  extraordinary circumstances of a child being left to my care and
  protection. On your first coming to England, I presented you the
  child, dear Horatia. You became, to my comfort, attached to it,
  so did Sir William, thinking her the finest child he had ever
  seen. She is become of that age when it is necessary to remove
  her from a mere nurse, and to think of educating her. I am now
  anxious for the child's being placed under your protecting wing";
  a clumsy, transparent piece of foolery, which at once confirms
  its intention to mislead! But we are saved the trouble of
  interpretation, for the father goes on to write on another piece
  of note-paper, "My beloved, how I feel for your situation and
  that of our dear Horatia, our dear child." It is almost
  incredible that Nelson could have written such a silly
  fabrication. In the early part of 1804, Emma gave birth to
  another child, of which he believed himself to be the father. He
  asked the mother to call <i>him</i> what she pleased (evidently
  he hoped and expected a boy), but if a girl, it was to be named
  Emma. It was a girl, so it was called after the mother, but it
  did not live long, and the father never saw it.</p>

  <p>As though he thought the letter written about little Miss
  Thompson (Horatia, be it understood) were not sufficiently
  delusive, he sends an equally absurd production to his niece,
  Charlotte Nelson, <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>who lived
  a good deal at Merton, in which he says that he is "truly
  sensible of her attachment to that dear little orphan, Horatia,"
  and although her parents are lost, yet she is not "without a
  fortune; and that he will cherish her to the last moment of his
  life, and <i>curse</i> them who <i>curse</i> her, and Heaven
  bless them who bless her." This solemn enthusiasm for the poor
  orphan puts Nelson out of court as a cute letter-writer. The
  quality of ingenious diplomacy had been left entirely out of him,
  and like any one else who dallies with an art for which they have
  no gift, he excites suspicions, and more often than not discloses
  the very secret he is so anxious to keep. Every line of these
  letters indicates a tussle between a natural tendency to frank
  honesty and an unnatural and unworthy method of deception.
  Obviously, the recipient of this precious document would have her
  curiosity excited over the disingenuous tale of romance. She
  would ask herself first of all, "Why should my kinsman be so
  desirous to tell me that the orphan in whom he has so fond an
  interest is not without a fortune? and why should the
  responsibility of rearing and educating the child have been
  entrusted to him, the most active and important Admiral in the
  British Navy? And if it be true that she is an orphan, surely
  there could be no object in supposing that any one would
  '<i>curse</i> her,' especially as he declared that she was 'not
  without fortune,' and that she was to be known as his adopted
  child." The niece, being a quick-witted girl, would naturally
  think the problem out for herself, and decide that there <a name=
  "Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>was something fishy involved in the
  mystery of these unnecessary phrases.</p>

  <p>In dealing with his domestic complications, Nelson's mind
  seems to have been in a constant whirlwind, dodging from one
  difficulty into another, never direct, and for ever in conflict
  with his true self. He was brave and resourceful in everything
  that appertained to the service he adorned, and yet a shivering
  fear came over him now and again lest the truth concerning his
  attachment to his friend's wife should be revealed. When he was
  seized with these remorseful thoughts, he could not be silent; he
  was not possessed of the constitutional gift of reticence, and
  could only find relief by constant reference to the matter he
  wished kept secret in such a way as to cause people to put two
  and two together and arrive at the very truth he wished to
  hide.</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <p>But whatever his ruling passion may have been, his belief in
  the Power that rules us all never forsook him. He believed in
  religious forms as of a spiritual force. He often committed
  himself to it, and claimed the privilege of asking for Heaven's
  guidance. Call it eccentricity or superstition, or what you like,
  but to him it was a reality. One of the many amusing instances of
  his devotion to religious rites was the occasion when he and Lady
  Hamilton stood as godfather <a name="Page_114" id=
  "Page_114"></a>and godmother at the christening of their
  daughter, Horatia Nelson Thompson,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=
  "FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class=
  "fnanchor">[7]</a> by which name she was baptized. To the
  puritanic, orthodox mind (keeping in view all the circumstances
  of parentage) this will be looked upon as an act of abominable
  hypocrisy and sacrilege, but to him it was a pious duty.</p>

  <p>Like all highly strung and overwrought mortals, he was often
  moody, depressed, and, worst of all, a victim to premonitions of
  his early demise. His superstitious temperament was constantly
  worrying him, as did his faith in the predictions of a gipsy
  fortune-teller who had correctly described his career up to the
  year 1805, and then stopping had said, "I can see no further."
  This creepy ending of the gipsy's tale was afflicting him with a
  dumb pain and depression when he unexpectedly came across his
  sister Catherine in London. She referred to his worn, haggard
  look with a tenderness that was peculiarly her own. He replied,
  "Ah! Katty! Katty! that gipsy!" and then relapsed into morbid
  silence. The foreboding bore heavily on his mind, and the story
  may well make one's heart throb with pity for the noble fellow
  who was so soon to fulfil his tragic destiny. Well may we exclaim
  that fame seems to be the most wretched of mockeries!</p>

  <p>The Duke of Wellington, of whom it is said no dose of flattery
  was too strong for him to swallow, <a name="Page_115" id=
  "Page_115"></a>has left on record an interesting account of his
  meeting Nelson at the Colonial Office. He gives the account of
  it, thirty years after Nelson's death, to John Wilson Croker at
  Walmer, and here is what he says of Collingwood's great
  comrade:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>WALMER, <i>1st October, 1834</i>.</p>

    <p>We were [that is, Croker and he] talking of Lord Nelson, and
    some instances were mentioned of the egotism and vanity that
    derogated from his character. "Why," said the Duke, "I am not
    surprised at such instances, for Lord Nelson was, in different
    circumstances, two quite different men, as I myself can vouch,
    though I only saw him once in my life, and for, perhaps, an
    hour. It was soon after I returned from India. I went to the
    Colonial Office in Downing Street, and there I was shown into
    the little waiting-room on the right hand, where I found, also
    waiting to see the Secretary of State, a gentleman, whom, from
    his likeness to his pictures and the loss of an arm, I
    immediately recognized as Lord Nelson. He could not know who I
    was, but he entered at once into conversation with me, if I can
    call it conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all
    about himself, and in, really, a style so vain and so silly as
    to surprise and almost disgust me. I suppose something that I
    happened to say made him guess that I was <i>somebody</i>, and
    he went out of the room for a moment, I have no doubt to ask
    the office keeper who I was, for when he came back he was
    altogether a different man, both in manner and matter. All that
    I had thought a charlatan style had vanished, and he talked of
    the state of this country and the probabilities of affairs on
    the Continent with a good sense, and a knowledge of subjects
    both at home and abroad, that surprised me equally and more
    agreeably than the first part of our interview had done; in
    fact, he talked like an officer and a statesman. The Secretary
    of State kept us long waiting, and certainly, for the last half
    or three-quarters of an hour, I don't know that I ever had a
    conversation that interested me more. Now, if the Secretary of
    State had been punctual, and admitted Lord Nelson in the first
    quarter of an hour, I should have had the same impression of a
    light and trivial character that other people have had;
    <a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>but luckily I saw enough
    to be satisfied that he was really a very superior man; but
    certainly a more sudden and complete metamorphosis I never

  <p>We must not be too critical of the Duke's opinions of the
  vanity of the Admiral, but it calls for some notice, inasmuch as
  the Duke himself is reputed to have had an uncommonly good amount
  of it himself, though it took a different form and created a
  different impression. Wellington showed it in a cold, haughty,
  unimaginative, repelling self-importance; fearful of unbending to
  his inferiors lest his dignity should be offended. Nelson's
  peculiarities were the very antithesis; it was his delightful
  egotism and vanity that added to his charm and made him such a
  fascinating personality. His direct slap-dash, unconventional
  phrases and flashes of naval brilliancy, whether in search of, or
  engaged in battle with the enemy, together with a natural
  kindness to his officers and men of all ranks, filled them with
  confidence and pride in having him as their chief. The "Nelson
  touch," the "drubbing" he swore in his own engaging way that Mr.
  Villeneuve&mdash;as he called him to Blackwood&mdash;was to have
  when he caught him, the putting of the telescope to his blind eye
  at Copenhagen when the signal was flying to leave off action, and
  then "No, damn me if I do," had an inspiring effect on his men
  and strengthened the belief in his dauntlessness and sagacity.
  "What will Nelson think of us?" remarked one of the men aboard
  <a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>one of the frigates that
  obeyed the signal. But Nelson went on fighting with complete
  success. "Luckily," says Wellington, "I saw enough to be
  satisfied that he was really a very superior man." Why "luckily"?
  What difference would his lack of knowledge have made? The Duke
  was hardly the type of man to understand the powerful personality
  whose style, "so vain and silly, surprised and almost disgusted"
  him. That view does not stand to <i>his</i> credit, and no one
  else held it.</p>

  <p>But let us see what a greater man than either Wellington or
  Nelson says of both. Napoleon, at St. Helena, spoke in very high
  terms of Lord Nelson,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id=
  "FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class=
  "fnanchor">[9]</a> and indeed attempted to palliate that one
  stigma on his memory, the execution of Carraciolli, which he
  attributed entirely to his having been deceived by that wicked
  woman Queen Caroline, through Lady Hamilton, and to the influence
  which the latter had over him. He says of the Duke: "Judging from
  Wellington's actions, from his dispatches, and, above all, from
  his conduct towards Ney, I should pronounce him to be a
  poor-spirited man, without generosity, and without greatness of
  soul ('Un homme de peu d'esprit, sans
  g&eacute;n&eacute;rosit&eacute;, et sans grandeur d'&acirc;me').
  Such I know to be the opinion of Benjamin Constant and of Madame
  de Sta&euml;l, who said that, except as a general, he had not two
  ideas. As a general, however, to find his equal amongst your own
  nation, you must <a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>go back to
  the time of Marlborough, but as anything else, I think that
  history will pronounce him to be a man of limited capacity ('Un
  homme born&eacute;')."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id=

  <p>"Nelson is a brave man. If Villeneuve at Aboukir and Dumanoir
  at Trafalgar had had a little of his blood, the French would have
  been conquerors. I ought to have had Dumanoir's head cut off. Do
  you not think more highly of Nelson than of the best engineers
  who construct fortifications? Nelson had what a mere engineer
  officer can never acquire. It is a gift of nature."</p>

  <p>The Emperor, in his eulogy of Nelson, is not unmindful of the
  terrible crime he was led to commit at the instigation of that
  human viper, Queen Caroline, and the licentious Emma Hamilton.
  He, to some extent, whittles down Nelson's share of the
  responsibility by putting the whole blame on them. But who can
  read the gruesome story of the trial and hanging of the aged
  Prince Carraciolli without feeling ashamed that a
  fellow-countryman in Nelson's position should have stamped his
  career with so dark a crime? At the capitulation of St. Elmo,
  Carraciolli made his escape. He commanded a Neapolitan warship
  called the <i>Tancredi</i>, and had fought in Admiral Hotham's
  action on the 14th March, 1795, and gained distinction,
  accompanying the Royal Family to Palermo. He was given permission
  by the King to return for the purpose of protecting his large
  property. The French had entered Neapolitan territory and seized
  his estates, on the <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>ground
  that he was a Royalist, and the only way he could recover them
  was by agreeing to take command of the Neapolitan fleet. The
  French were obliged to evacuate the country, and left their
  friends to settle matters for themselves as best they could.
  Carraciolli concealed himself, but was discovered in disguise and
  put on board the <i>Foudroyant</i> with his hands tied behind his
  back. Captain Hardy, who was a man with a heart, was indignant
  when he saw the old man subjected to such gross indignity, and
  immediately ordered his hands to be liberated.</p>

  <p>Nelson committed him for trial, which commenced at ten
  o'clock, and at twelve he was declared guilty. At five o'clock he
  was hanged at the yardarm of the Neapolitan frigate
  <i>Minerva</i>. This poor old man was tried solely by his enemies
  without being allowed to have counsel or call witnesses. A
  miscreant called Count Thurn, a worse enemy than all, presided
  over the court. Carraciolli asked Lieutenant Parkinson to obtain
  for him a new trial. Nelson, who had ordered the first, could not
  or would not grant a second. Carraciolli asked to be shot, and
  this also was refused. On the grounds of former association, he
  sought the aid of Lady Hamilton, but she, being an approving
  party to the execution, only came from her concealment to enjoy
  the sight of the old Prince's dead body dangling at the yardarm.
  "Come, Bronte, come," said she, "let us take the barge and have
  another look at Carraciolli"; and there they feasted their eyes
  on the lifeless remains of their former associate, <a name=
  "Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>who had assuredly cursed them both
  with his last dying breath. It is the custom when sailors are
  buried at sea to weight their feet so that the body may sink in
  an upright position. The same course was adopted with
  Carraciolli; shot was put at his feet, but not sufficient, and he
  was cast into the sea. In a few days the putrified body rose to
  the surface head upwards, as though the murdered man had come
  again to haunt his executioners and give them a further
  opportunity of gazing at the ghastly features of their
  victim.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The sight of his old
  friend emerging again terrified Ferdinand, and he became
  afflicted with a feeling of abiding horror which he sought to
  appease by having the body interred in a Christian burial-ground.
  But the spirit of his executed friend worried him all his
  remaining days, and the act of burial did not save Naples from
  becoming a shambles of conflict, robbery, and revolution. Neither
  did Emma Hamilton escape her just deserts for the vile part she
  played in one of the most abominable crimes ever committed. Her
  latter hours were made terrible by the thought of the mockery of
  a trial, and the constant vision of the Prince's ghost glowering
  at her from the <i>Minerva's</i> yardarm and from the surface of
  his watery tomb from which he had risen again to reproach her
  with the inhuman pleasure she had <a name="Page_121" id=
  "Page_121"></a>taken in watching the dreadful act. Nor did her
  shrieking avowal of repentance give the wretched Jezebel of a
  woman the assurance of forgiveness. She sought for distractions,
  and found most of them in wickedness, and passed into the
  presence of the Great Mystery with all her deeds of
  faithlessness, deceit, and uncontrollable revenge before her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>It is sad to read of and hear the insensate rubbish that is
  talked of new earths that are to evolve from war, as though it
  could be divorced from wounds and death, unspeakable crime,
  suffering in all its varied forms, and the destruction of
  property which must always be a direct result. The spectacle of
  it can never be other, except to the martially-minded, than a
  shuddering horror. I would ask any one who is imbued with the
  idea that out of wars spring new worlds to name a single instance
  where a nation that has engaged in it has not been left bleeding
  at its extremities, no matter whether it emerges as victor or
  vanquished. I would further ask the writer or orator who talks in
  this strain if he imagines that the sending of myriads of men to
  death can contribute to the making of new earths. The
  consequences are much too tragically serious to the nation, and
  indeed to the world, to be played with by smug diplomatists who
  seek to excite the populace into support of their calamitous
  efforts at statesmanship by shallow bursts of eloquence about the
  new conditions of life which are to accrue from their imitation
  of Germanism.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>No doubt Nelson thought,
  when he had poor old Prince Carraciolli hung, that he would
  create a new earth by striking terror into the hearts of the
  Neapolitan race, but natural laws are not worked out by methods
  of this kind, and Nelson had the mortification of seeing his plan
  of regulating human affairs create a new and more ferocious
  little hell on earth. His judgment at this time was very much
  warped through the evil influence of the Court of Naples and more
  especially by his infatuation for Lady Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Greville, and subsequently Sir William Hamilton, had taken
  great pains to educate Emma Hart. Hamilton writes to his nephew:
  "I can assure you her behaviour is such as has acquired her many
  sensible admirers, and we have good man society, and all the
  female nobility, with the Queen at their head, show her every
  mark of civility." Hamilton writes further: "Hitherto, her
  behaviour is irreproachable, but her temper, as you must know,
  unequal." Lady Malmesbury (with a decidedly sly scratch) says of
  her: "She really behaves as well as possible, and quite
  wonderfully, considering her origin and education." Sir George
  Elliot says: "Her manners are perfectly, unpolished, very easy,
  but not with the ease of good breeding, but of a barmaid;
  excessively good-humoured, wishing to please and be admired by
  everybody that came in her way. She has acquired since her
  marriage some knowledge of history and of the arts, and one
  wonders at the application and pains she has taken to make
  herself what she is. With men her language <a name="Page_123" id=
  "Page_123"></a>and conversation are exaggerations of anything I
  ever heard anywhere; and I was wonderfully struck with these
  inveterate remains of her origin, though the impression was very
  much weakened by seeing the other ladies of Naples." A naval
  lieutenant at Naples stated he "thought her a very handsome,
  vulgar woman." There is no stabbing with a sneer about this
  opinion. It expresses in a few words the candid opinion of the
  sailor. Mrs. St. George thinks her "bold, daring, vain even to
  folly, and stamped with the manners of her first situation much
  more strongly than one would suppose, after having represented
  Majesty and lived in good company fifteen years. Her dress is
  frightful. Her waist is absolutely between her shoulders. Her
  figure is colossal, but, excepting her feet, which are hideous,
  well shaped. The shape of all her features is fine, as is the
  form of her head, and particularly her ears; her teeth are a
  little irregular, but tolerably white; her eyes light blue, with
  a brown spot in one, which, though a defect, takes nothing away
  from her beauty or expression. Her eyebrows and hair, which, by
  the bye, is never clean, are dark and her complexion coarse. Her
  expression is strongly marked, variable, and interesting; her
  movements in common life ungraceful, her voice loud, yet not
  disagreeable." This female critic seems to have been overburdened
  with the weight of Emma's defects, mental and physical! Elliot
  says: "Her person is nothing short of monstrous for its enormity,
  and is growing every day. Her face is beautiful." The latter view
  <a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>tones down the apparent
  desire not to say too much in her favour.</p>

  <p>We are persuaded, in fact, that the foregoing views of Lady
  Hamilton's personal appearance are not correct. They give the
  impression that the opinions of her critics are based on the
  woman's lowly origin, and that they assume that because she was
  the offspring of poor parents she ought to be described as a fat
  hoyden with the manners of the kitchen. The people who knew her
  intimately do not make her out to be a stout, unwholesome,
  East-End Palestiner. The sister of Marie Antoinette, be it
  remembered, was her close companion, and many English ladies
  living in Naples and visiting there were scarcely likely to
  associate with a person who could not display better looks and
  manners than those set forth. Nelson, the Prince of Wales, and
  her many other men admirers, were hardly likely to tumble over
  each other in competition for her smiles and favours if "her
  dress was frightful," "her waist between her shoulders," "her
  hair dirty," "her feet hideous," "her bones large," "her
  complexion coarse," and "her person monstrous for its enormity,
  growing every day."</p>

  <p>We are inclined to place little dependence on the accuracy of
  people who seem to have described her according to their moods or
  perhaps according to the manner of her admirers towards
  themselves. That she was clever and attractive there can be no
  doubt, and it is equally certain that she won for herself the
  mortal enmity of many ladies who saw her powerful influence over
  <a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>prominent men and women whom
  they themselves bored. Some importance must be given to her
  husband's position as British representative; his influence must
  have been great, especially in Neapolitan circles. This would
  help her natural gifts of fascination, even though her breeding
  and education did not reach the standard of her blue-blooded
  critics. She had something that stood her in greater stead than
  breeding and education: she had the power of enslaving gallant
  hearts and holding them in thrall with many artful devices. They
  liked her Bohemianism, her wit, her geniality, her audacious
  slang, and her collection of droll epithets that fittingly
  described her venomous critics of a self-appointed nobility. When
  she could not reach the heights of such superior persons she
  proceeded to ridicule them with a tongue that rattled out vivid
  invective which outmatched anything they could say of <i>her</i>.
  It probably made her more enemies, but it satisfied her temper
  and pleased her admirers. She never appears to have been
  conscious of any inferiority in herself. We are inclined to agree
  with the opinion expressed by the naval lieutenant at Naples, who
  said "She was a very handsome, vulgar woman." All her portraits
  confirm what the sailor says about her beauty, and the most
  reliable records are confirmatory so far as his view of her
  vulgarity is concerned.</p>

  <p>But in any case, whatever may have been her physical
  dimensions, they were not understated by the crowd who gave vent
  to their aversion in this and in many other deplorable ways.
  There <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>are only a few
  evidences of Nelson being aware of and resenting some of the
  disparaging remarks made about his "wife in the sight of Heaven,"
  and these do not seem to have diminished his infatuation for her.
  He was accustomed to say in connection with his professional
  duties that whenever he followed his own head he was in general
  much more correct in his judgment than by following other
  people's opinions. He carried this plan into his private life so
  far as Emma was concerned, but men and women who were his
  intimate friends would not support the view that by following his
  head in <i>this</i> particular case his judgment was sound. We
  may term the infatuation a deteriorated state of mind, but
  <i>he</i> was sustained by the belief that she was a spirit unto
  him while he lived, and with his last gasp, as he was passing
  into the shadows, he bestowed her as a legacy to his country. We
  shall have something to say hereafter as to how the British
  Government dealt with their great Admiral's dying injunction.</p>

  <p>The Neapolitan atmosphere was vile enough, and might well have
  made even men and women who knew the loose side of life shrink
  from it, but it can never be claimed that it had a demoralizing
  influence on Emma, who at an early age became familiar with
  unspeakable vices which left her little to learn at the time
  Greville sold her to his uncle, who took her to a centre of
  sordid uncleanness, there to become his wife after a brief
  association as his mistress. We may have no misgiving as to her
  aptitude in acquiring anything <a name="Page_127" id=
  "Page_127"></a>she chose that was left for her to learn from a
  community of debauchees and parasites.</p>

  <p>The wonder is that her brain did not succumb to the poisonous
  influences by which she was surrounded, and that the poor girl
  did not sink into the depths of that luxurious sensuality which
  characterized Neapolitan society at that time. It was a more
  distinguished and fascinating type of debauchery than that which
  she had known in other days in England, and from which Greville
  had rescued her. The temptation to plunge into the boisterous
  merriment of a higher order of depravity than that to which she
  had been accustomed must have been very great to such a
  temperament as hers. But she worthily kept her wild, wayward
  spirit under restraint, and, according to Sir William Hamilton,
  she conducted herself in a way that caused him to be satisfied
  with his reforming guidance. She adapted herself to the ways of
  the more select social community of her new existence, and at the
  time Nelson made her acquaintance she had really become a
  creditable member of the society in which she moved. In every
  respect she was congenial to him. He never lost a chance of
  applauding her gifts and brazenly exempting himself from all
  moral restrictions, except, as I have said before, when he was
  seized with a spontaneous fit of goodness. He would then clumsily
  try to conceal the passion that obsessed him. He did not brood
  long over trifles of this kind, merely because he had lost, if
  ever he possessed, the power of consecutive reasoning in matters
  of moral convention. His Neapolitan <a name="Page_128" id=
  "Page_128"></a>associates were a cunning, lying, luxury-loving,
  depraved lot, and however strongly his principles were fixed,
  there can be but one opinion&mdash;that such an atmosphere was
  harmful to him. He speaks of Naples himself as being a country of
  poets, whores, and scoundrels; and Southey does not attempt to
  mince words, for in vigorous terms he describes England's
  "alliances to superannuated and abominable governments of the
  Continent." These are the states that we shed British blood and
  squandered British money over, and in truth Southey describes
  them as they were!</p>

  <p>The King of Naples was a great hero to stand up against the
  bravest, best-trained troops the world! He shivered at the
  thought of Nelson going out of his sight, and whimpered him into
  staying to guard him and his rotten kingdom. It was at this
  period of his gallant activity that Nelson became the victim of
  fulsome flattery and the associate of the most cunning, knavish
  charlatans in the world. These creatures never ceased to inveigh
  against the wrongs they were suffering for the uplifting of human
  rights, and because their great British ally was in need of their
  disinterested and distinguished co-ordination. Nelson was well
  aware of all this, but could not shake himself free. He loathed
  the slavering way in which flattery was extended to him, because
  it had a sickly resemblance to weeping. He declares of the
  Neapolitan officers, "They are boasters of the highest order, and
  when they are confronted with the duty of defending hearth and
  home, their courage ends in vapour." He avers <a name="Page_129"
  id="Page_129"></a>that they "cannot lose honour, as they have
  none to lose," and yet he makes no serious effort to unshackle
  himself from a detestable position. Emma, the Queen, and King of
  Naples, and others, have a deep-rooted hold on him, and he cannot
  give up the cheap popularity of the Neapolitans. He persuades
  himself that the whole thought of his soul is "Down, down, with
  the French," and that it shall be his "constant prayer."
  Throughout the whole course of his brilliant career it was never
  doubted that the French were his great aversion, because they
  were his country's enemies. But the hysterical tears of Lady
  Hamilton and those of the Neapolitan Queen proved too strong for
  him. The King's beseeching fears were also added to an already
  difficult situation, which, he persuaded himself, could not be
  ignored without damaging the interests he was sent to protect; so
  his stay in the reeking cesspool of Neapolitanism was prolonged,
  but there is no reason for supposing that his "constant prayer"
  for the extinction of the French was any the less ardent. The
  fatal day of their catastrophe was only postponed. The praying
  went on all the same, with more or less belief in the Almighty's
  preference for Englishmen.</p>

  <h3>VIII</h3>

  <p>This is a form of cant to which those whom we regard as great
  men are a prey. But this pride of race is not confined to the
  mighty men of valour. <a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>The
  humble soldier and sailor, and poorest and richest of civilians,
  have the same inherent belief in British superiority. They talk
  to the Great Giver of all power in the most patronizing way, and
  while they profess to believe in His ordinances they treat them
  as though He were their vassal and not their Lawgiver. They call
  upon Him to break His own laws and help them to smite those whom
  they regard as enemies, never doubting the righteousness of their
  cause. The enemy, on the other hand, believe that <i>they</i>
  have a monopoly of God, and avow that <i>their</i> cause is His,
  and <i>being</i> His, they grimly ask Him to settle the dispute
  by coming down on their side; but should they win the fight, the
  glory of it is seldom given to the Power whose assistance is
  implored, but ascribed to their own genius.</p>

  <p>Cromwell is a singular and distinguished exception. He always
  gave all the glory to God. Take as an example the battle of
  Dunbar (though there are many instances of a similar character
  that could be quoted during the Civil War). The battle-cry of the
  Parliament forces was "The Lord of Hosts," and at the opportune
  moment the commander of the Parliament army shouted, "Now let God
  arise, and His enemies shall be scattered." The Ironsides made a
  fearless and irresistible rush at their foes, and almost
  immediately Cromwell saw the Covenanters in confusion; again he
  shouted, "They run! I profess they run!" The quotation from the
  68th Psalm was always an inspiration to these religious warriors.
  Old Leslie, the Scotch Covenanting general, with <a name=
  "Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>the patience of stupidity, had been
  mumbling petitions for hours to the God of the Anointed to form
  an alliance with him to crush the unholy rebellion against King
  and Covenant. "Thou knowest, O God, how just our cause is, and
  how unjust is that of those who are not Thy people." This
  moth-eaten crowd of canting hypocrites were no match for the
  forces who believed that they were backed by the Lord of Hosts,
  and they were completely routed.</p>

  <p>Sir Jacob Astley, another Royalist, on one occasion during the
  Civil War breathed a simple prayer with uplifted eyes. "O Lord,"
  said he, "Thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget
  Thee, do not Thou forget me." Then he gave the word of command to
  "March." He was nevertheless defeated at Stow, and seems to have
  been offended at the Deity for His forgetfulness, as he bitterly
  reproached his conquerors by telling them that they might go to
  play unless they fell out amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>Napoleon carried on warfare under a sterner and more
  self-reliant code. He had confidence in and depended on his own
  genius and on nature's laws. There are shoals of instances in his
  short and terrific career that indicate this belief in himself.
  He said to a regiment of horse chasseurs at Lobenstein two days
  before the battle of Jena, "My lads! you must not fear death;
  when soldiers brave death, they drive him into the enemy's
  ranks." On another occasion he said: "You must not fight too
  often with one enemy, or you teach him all your art of war." This
  is a <a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>thrilling truth which
  always tells in war, and yet behind all the apparent indifference
  to the great mysterious force that holds sway over human affairs
  there was a hidden belief in the power of the Deity to guide
  aright and give aid in the hour of need, even to men of
  unequalled talents like Napoleon himself. His spontaneous
  exclamations indicate that he did not doubt who created and ruled
  the universe, but how much he relied on this power he never
  really disclosed, and it can only be a supposition gathered from
  utterances recorded by some of his contemporaries that he had a
  devout belief in the great power of Christianity. "Ah!" said he
  one day, "there is but one means of getting good manners, and
  that is by establishing religion." At that time the spiritual
  life of France was at a low ebb, and the subject of religion was
  one of the most unpopular and risky topics to raise, but Napoleon
  knew that it would have to be tackled in the open sooner or
  later, and it is a matter of authentic history that he struggled
  to bring and ultimately succeeded in bringing back religious
  ordinances to France. He declared that no good government could
  exist for long without it. His traducers proclaimed him an
  atheist, and we hear the same claptrap from people now who have
  not made themselves acquainted with the real history of the man
  and his times. We do not say he was a saint, but he was a better
  Christian, both in profession and action, than most of the kings
  that ruled prior to and during his period. In every way he excels
  the Louis of France, the Georges of Great Britain and Hanover,
  <a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>the Fredericks of Prussia,
  and the Alexanders of Russia. The latter two he puts far in the
  shade, both as a statesman, a warrior, and a wise, humane ruler
  who saw far into futurity, and fought against the reactionary
  forces of Europe, which combined to put an end to what was called
  his ambition to dominate the whole of creation. He foretold with
  amazing accuracy that from his ashes there would spring up
  sectional wars for a time, and ultimately the selfsame elements
  of vicious mediocrity that destroyed him would bring about a
  world-conflict which would destroy itself.</p>

  <p>The laws of life are simple, but at the same time very
  terrible in their consequences if ignored or disobeyed. What
  folly to imagine that any great figure or great tragedy comes
  into existence by chance! Napoleon was just as necessary to the
  world as was Cromwell. Both had the righting of wrongs and the
  clearing away of the accumulation of centuries of chaos and
  misgovernment, and it was not to be expected that they could
  carry out the necessary reforms without making the authors of
  such an intolerable state of things angry and resentful at their
  iron methods of discipline. Napoleon and Cromwell possessed the
  combined arts of war and statesmanship to a higher degree than
  any of their contemporaries. Cromwell excelled Napoleon in
  professional Christianity. The latter never paraded his ideas of
  religion, though he acted on them silently and gave occasional
  expression to the thoughts of his soul. Indeed, he was too much
  given to publicly disavowing the very principles he believed in
  <a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>privately. This plan or
  habit was said to be for the purpose of creating controversy. Be
  that as it may, when the natural spirit moved him he would
  declare his views in the most robust way. On one of many
  occasions he startled the Council of State by reminding them that
  a man did not risk being killed for a few pence a day or for a
  paltry distinction. "You must speak to the soul," he declared,
  "to electrify the man." Another very notable expression is here
  worth referring to, as it instances how practical and human were
  his views. "The heart," said he, "warms the genius, but in Pitt
  the genius withers the heart, which is a very different thing";
  and so it is that Cromwell and he were not dissimilar in many of
  their attributes. Indeed, it is said that Napoleon never tired of
  quoting or having quoted to him some striking characteristic of
  Cromwell. We could hardly, with any degree of good judgment, put
  Leslie the Covenanter or Sir Jacob Astley the Royalist, or Nelson
  the matchless naval strategist and national hero, on a par with
  either Cromwell or Napoleon. They are only here referred to in
  connection with the two unequalled constructive statesmen and
  military generals as representing a type of peculiarly religious
  men who have occupied high military and naval positions in the
  service of the State.</p>

  <p>Hawkins, Drake, Frobisher, Blake in Cromwell's time, Nelson in
  Napoleon's, were all fire-eating religious men, always asking
  favours and guidance in their perilous undertakings from the
  great <a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>mystic Power in whom
  they believed. Collingwood was a great admiral and a Christian
  gentleman, who never mixed religion with hysterical or dramatic
  flashes of quarterdeck language. He was ostentatious in nothing,
  and seemed to observe a strictly decorous attitude. Nelson, on
  the other hand, resembled a restless squirrel, always swift in
  his instincts, with an enthusiasm which was contagious. In many
  ways he did not adhere to what is called cricket in sporting
  phrase. He was accustomed to say, "Never mind the justice or the
  impudence of this or that, only let me succeed." Then he would
  proceed to ask the Almighty in feverish zeal to aid him in the
  object he had in view.</p>

  <p>He would scatter a profusion of curses about in relation to
  the treatment of the Admiralty towards himself, or at his
  disappointment in not getting to grips with the French fleet, and
  then proceed to ask Lady Hamilton if they had a nice church at
  Merton, so that they may set an example of goodness to the
  under-parishioners, and "admire the pigs and poultry," etc. He
  finds on several occasions that a picture of Emma is much admired
  by the French Consul at Barcelona, and feels sure it would be
  admired by Bonaparte, and then he continues, "I love you most
  dearly, and hate the French most damnably." Sometimes he said he
  hated the French as the devil hated holy water, which at that
  time was considered to be the orthodoxy of a true Briton. It was
  quite a pro-British attitude to patronize the maker of kings who
  had kept the world in awe for nearly a quarter of a century, by
  expecting him to admire a portrait <a name="Page_136" id=
  "Page_136"></a>of a loose woman to whom he referred in the most
  scathing manner while at St. Helena. Her reputation and Nelson's
  connection with her seems to have been known to him, as was also
  her connection with the Neapolitan Court. His indictment was
  terrible.</p>

  <p>Nelson had a weary, anxious time on the Toulon station. He
  called it his home, and said they were in fine fighting trim and
  wished to God the ships were the same, but they were in a very
  dilapidated condition, not fit to stand the bad weather they were
  sure to encounter. The British Minister at Naples wished to send
  a Frenchman who could be relied on with information as to the
  whereabouts of the French fleet. Nelson replied that he would not
  on any account have a Frenchman in the British fleet except as a
  prisoner. He would be grateful to him for any information he
  could give, but not a Frenchman would be allowed to come to him,
  and adds that "his mother hated the French." He was enraged at
  the report spread by a fussy French Admiral named M. la
  Touche-Treville, who was in command at Toulon. It was said that
  he was sent to beat Nelson as he had done at Boulogne. But he was
  shy about coming out and trying a tussle. Nelson said he was a
  miscreant, a poltroon, and a liar. The Frenchman had boasted in a
  publication that he had put the British fleet to flight. The
  British Admiral took the charge so seriously to heart that he
  sent a copy of the <i>Victory's</i> log to the Admiralty to
  disprove the statement of the lying Admiral la Touche, and in a
  letter to his brother Nelson <a name="Page_137" id=
  "Page_137"></a>says, "You will have seen La Touche's letter of
  how he chased me, and how I ran. I keep it; and by God if I take
  him, he shall eat it." La Touche cheated Nelson of a sweet
  revenge by dying like a good Christian before the outraged
  British Admiral could get hold of him. The newspapers of France
  said he died of fatigue caused by walking so often to the signal
  post at Sepet, to watch the British fleet; and Nelson stated
  "that he was always sure that would be the death of him, and that
  if he had come out to fight him it would have added ten years on
  to his life." Poor Nelson was very sensitive when his
  professional qualities were assailed. He thought, and thought
  rightly, that the blockade at Toulon was an unparalleled feat of
  human patience and physical endurance. He had only been out of
  his ship three times from May 1803 to August 1805. We may write
  and speak about this wonderful devotion to duty, but it is only
  if we take time to think of the terrific things which the central
  figure who commanded, and the crews of the fleet of rickety,
  worn-out, leaky baskets&mdash;proudly spoken of as the "wooden
  walls of Old England"&mdash;had to contend with and actually did,
  that we comprehend the vast strain and task of it all. It was
  because Nelson was ever being reminded by some clumsy act of the
  Admiralty or thoughtless, ignorant criticism on the part of the
  politicians and civilian public generally that the work he and
  the men under him were doing was not appreciated as it should be,
  that he gave way to outbursts of violent resentment. But so far
  as the <a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>present writer has
  been able to discover, his love of approbation was so strong that
  an encouraging word of praise soon put him in love for the time
  being with those whom he had lately cursed.</p>

  <p>He never shrank from disobeying the instructions of whatever
  authority was over him if his judgment led him to the conclusion
  that he would serve his country better by disobedience and by
  following his own judgment; whenever he was driven to do this he
  was right and those above him were wrong, and in each case he was
  so conclusively right that no authoritative power dare
  court-martial him, or even censure his conduct, since the public
  believed more in him than in them. When the spirit of
  well-balanced defiance was upon him, he seemed to say to the
  public, to himself, and to those who were responsible for his
  instructions, "Do you imagine yourselves more capable of judging
  the circumstances, and the immeasurable difficulties surrounding
  them, than I am, whose business it has been to watch minutely
  every changing phase? Or do you think my love of country or glory
  so incomparably inferior to yours that I would risk any harm
  coming to it, or to myself and the men under me, if I was not
  sure of my ground? For what other reason do you think I disobeyed
  orders? Do you suppose I did it in order that some disaster
  should be the result? Or do you still think that your plan, right
  or wrong, should have been carried out, even though it would be
  accompanied with appalling consequences to life and property? If
  these are your views, I wish to remind you that <a name=
  "Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>I am the Indomitable Nelson, who
  will stand no damned nonsense from you or from the enemy when I
  see that my country, or the interests that I represent, are going
  to be jeopardized by your self-assertive instructions, and I wish
  to intimate to you that there is only one way of dealing with a
  Frenchman, and that is to knock him down when he is an enemy. You
  have obviously got to learn that to be civil to a Frenchman is to
  be laughed at, and this I shall never submit to." The Admiralty
  censured Nelson for disobeying Lord Keith's orders and, as they
  claimed, endangering Minorca, and also for landing seamen for the
  siege of Capua, and told him "not to employ the seamen in any
  such way in future." The Admiralty were too hasty in chastising
  him. He claimed that his success in freeing the whole kingdom of
  Naples from the French was almost wholly due to the employment of
  British sailors, whose valour carried the day.</p>

  <p>Nelson sent the First Lord a slap between the eyes in his best
  sarcastic form. He said briefly, "I cannot enter into all the
  detail in explanation of my motives which led me to take the
  action I did, as I have only a left hand, but I may inform you
  that my object is to drive the French to the devil, and restore
  peace and happiness to mankind"; and he continues, "I feel I am
  fitter to do the action than to describe it." And then he curtly
  and in so many words says to his Chief, "Don't you be troubled
  about Minorca. I have secured the main thing against your wish
  and that of Lord Keith, and you may be assured that <a name=
  "Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>I shall see that no harm comes to
  the Islands, which seems to be a cause of unnecessary anxiety to
  you." Incidentally, the expulsion of the French from Naples and
  seating Ferdinand on the throne was, as I have previously stated,
  not an unqualified success, nor was he accurate in his statement
  that he had restored happiness to millions. The success was a
  mere shadow. He had emancipated a set of villains. Troubridge
  says they were all thieves and vagabonds, robbing their
  unfortunate countrymen, selling confiscated property for nothing,
  cheating the King and Treasury by pocketing everything that their
  sticky fingers touched, and that their villainies were so deeply
  rooted that if some steps were not taken to dig them out, the
  Government could not hold together. Out of twenty millions of
  ducats collected as revenue, only thirteen millions reached the
  Treasury, and the King had to pay four ducats instead of one.
  Troubridge again intimates to his superior that Ferdinand is
  surrounded with a nest of the most unscrupulous thieves that
  could be found in all Europe. "Such damned cowards and villains,"
  he declared, "he had never seen or heard of before."</p>

  <h3>IX</h3>

  <p>The French did not mince matters when their opportunity came.
  They, too, regarded them as vermin, and treated them according to
  the unrestrained edicts of the Reign of Terror, organized
  <a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>and administered by their
  late compatriots Sardanapalus, Danton, Maximilian Robespierre,
  and their literary colleague, the execrable Marat, who, by the
  way, was expeditiously dispatched by the gallant Charlotte
  Corday.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>This method of bestowing the blessings of Liberty, Equality,
  and Fraternity was received by the Neapolitans with a frenzy from
  which there sprang a demoniac retaliation. Societies were formed
  to carry out the most atrocious crimes against the Neapolitan
  revolutionists, whom the Royalists hated more than they did the
  French. The fishermen and other miscreants came to a solemn
  conclusion that it was clearly their duty as a Christian people
  to combine, and each choose one whom they should privately
  guillotine when the opportunity offered. With the idea of paying
  a high compliment to Troubridge, who had so <a name="Page_142"
  id="Page_142"></a>splendidly protected the Royalists, fought the
  French, and subdued the revolutionists, they made him the
  recipient of a decapitated head which had proudly sat on the
  shoulders of a revolutionist. This trophy was actually sent to
  him with his basket of breakfast grapes. In making the present
  the gallant fisherman conveyed his compliments to the Admiral,
  and reminded him that it was a token of his high appreciation of
  the Admiral's brilliant services to the Royalist cause.</p>

  <p>The Court was infested with traitors who would first carry out
  their vengeance against their rebellious compatriots and then
  cunningly lay the blame on those under whose protection they
  were. One of their judges informed Troubridge that he must have a
  Bishop to excommunicate some of the traitor priests before he
  could have them executed, and the fine sailor, who was sick of
  the crafty devils and the task he had been allocated to carry
  out, replied, "For the love of God hang the damned rascals first,
  and then let the Bishop deal with them if he did not think
  hanging was a sufficient degradation." Nothing in the annals of
  history can surpass the effrontery of these intriguers, which
  throws a lurid light on the class of administrators who
  associated with the British nation and spilt the blood of the
  flower of our land in bolstering up a government that was a
  disgrace and put all human perfidy in the shade.</p>

  <p>These allies of ours, who were joyously butchering and robbing
  each other, demanded a British warship to take the priests to
  Palermo, <a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>so that they might
  be degraded in a proper, Christian fashion and then brought to
  Naples for execution. Troubridge was audaciously requested to
  appoint a hangman (it may be he was asked to combine this with
  his other naval duties), and knowing the fine sense of noble
  dignity in the average sailor, we can easily imagine the flow of
  adjectives that accompanied the refusal, and how he would relate
  the outrage to which he had been subjected in quarterdeck
  language, that need not be here repeated, to his superior
  officer, Admiral Nelson, who must have felt the degradation of
  being selected to carry out as dirty a piece of work as ever
  devolved upon a public servant. To fight for his King and country
  was the joy of his soul, but to be selected as wet-nurse to the
  kingdom of Naples and the dignitaries that were at the head of it
  would have been an unbearable insult to his sense of proportion
  had it not been for the fulsome flattery, to which he was so
  susceptible, which was adroitly administered by the ladies of the
  Court, headed by the Queen and supplemented by the wife of Sir
  William Hamilton.</p>

  <p>There is always some fatal weakness about a great man that
  lures him into littleness, and this was an overwhelming tragedy
  in Nelson's career. The approbation of men was gratefully
  received and even asked for, but the adoration of women reduced
  him to helplessness. He was drugged by it, and the stronger the
  doses, the more efficacious they were. They nullified the vision
  of the unwholesome task he was set to carry out until his
  <a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>whole being revolted against
  the indignity of it, when he would pour out his wrath to Lady
  Hamilton as he did at the time when Troubridge would report to
  him his own trials. No doubt this caused him to realize the
  chaotic condition of public affairs, for he writes to the lady
  that "politics are hateful to him, and that Ministers of Kings
  are the greatest scoundrels that ever lived." The King of Naples
  is, he suspects, to be superseded by a prince who has married a
  Russian Archduchess. This, presumably, had been arranged by the
  "great political scoundrels." He stands loyally by Ferdinand, but
  soon all the work of that part of his life that gave him socially
  so much pleasure and professionally so much misery is to be left
  for evermore, and his great talents used in other and higher
  spheres.</p>

  <p>He had retaken Naples from the French, who had set up the
  Parthenopean Republic in 1799, and placed the tyrant King on his
  throne again; after a few more chequered years a treaty of
  neutrality was signed between France and Naples, which was
  treacherously broken by Naples. Ferdinand had to fly to Sicily,
  the French troops entered the capital, and Bonaparte, who had
  been marching from one victory to another, cleared out
  deep-rooted abuses and introduced reforms wherever he could. He
  had become the terror and the enemy of the misgoverning monarchs
  of that period, and the French nation had proclaimed him Emperor
  in 1804. He placed his brother Joseph on the throne of Naples in
  February 1806; Joseph ruled with marked moderation and <a name=
  "Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>distinction, sweeping away much of
  the foul canker of corruption and introducing many beneficent
  reforms during his two years of kingship. He then, much against
  his own wishes, became King of Spain, and was succeeded by his
  brother-in-law, Prince Joachim Murat, the dashing cavalry
  officer, whose decorative exterior awed friend and foe, and
  helped to win many a battle. His reign lasted from 1808 until
  1815, and was no less distinguished than that of Joseph's. The
  fall of the Napoleonic r&eacute;gime was followed by the fall of
  Murat, and the despicable and treacherous Ferdinand became again
  the king, and brought back with him the same tyrannical habits
  that had made his previous rule so disastrous to the kingdom and
  to himself. No whitewasher, however brilliant and ingenious, can
  ever wipe out the fatal action of the British Government in
  embarking on so ill-conceived a policy as that of supporting the
  existence of a bloodsucking government, composed of a miscreant
  ruling class headed by an ignoble king, all living on the misery
  and blood of a semi-civilized population. It is a nauseous piece
  of history, with which, under sagacious administration, we should
  never have been connected.</p>

  <p>The main idea was to humble the pride of France, that
  thenceforth there might be peace in Europe. The Neapolitan
  revolutionists believed that the French intention was to set up a
  free government and deliver them from an unbearable despotism.
  Quite naturally, the Court took an opposite view in believing
  that it foreshadowed deportation, so they lost no time in
  proclaiming it to be conquest <a name="Page_146" id=
  "Page_146"></a>and merciless plunder. Nelson urged the
  vacillating King to advance against the French, to trust in God's
  blessing being bestowed upon him, his army, and his cause, and to
  die like a hero, sword in hand, or lose his throne. The King,
  always dauntless in the absence of danger, replied that he would
  do this, trusting in God and Nelson. His Majesty, in tickling the
  Admiral's susceptible spot by associating his name with that of
  the Deity, doubtless made a good shot, and had Nelson's sense of
  humour been equal to his vanity, he might not have received the
  oily compliment with such delightful complacency.</p>

  <p>We can imagine the scorn with which Troubridge would have
  received the potentate's reply had he given the same advice as
  Nelson. It is highly probable that had it been given on the
  quarterdeck of his ship, the King would have been treated to a
  vocabulary that would have impressed him with the necessity of
  scrambling quickly over the side. Nelson, it is stated, turned
  the French out of Naples, and they were subsequently overpowered
  by a plan put in force by Nelson and Troubridge, and carried into
  effect by men from the fleet. Captain Hallowell was ordered to
  proceed to Civita Vecchia and Castle St. Angelo to offer terms of
  capitulation. He reported the position to Troubridge, who ordered
  a squadron in command of Captain Louis to proceed and enforce the
  terms. The French, on the other hand, offered terms, but
  Troubridge, like Drake on another occasion, said that he had no
  time to parley, that they must agree to his terms or <a name=
  "Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>fight. The French Ambassador at Rome
  argued that the Roman territory belonged to the French by
  conquest, and the British commander adroitly replied "that it was
  his by reconquest." The inevitable alternative was
  impressive&mdash;capitulation. This was arranged, and the Roman
  States came under the control of the victors. Captain Louis
  proceeded in his cutter up the Tiber and planted the British
  colours at Rome, becoming its governor for a brief time. The
  naval men had carried out, by clever strategy and pluck, an
  enterprise which Sir James Erskine declined to undertake because
  of the insurmountable difficulties he persisted in seeing.
  General Mack was at the head of about 30,000 Neapolitan troops,
  said to be the finest in Europe. This, however, did not prevent
  them from being annihilated by 15,000 French, when General
  Championnet evacuated Rome. The King entered with all the swagger
  of an Oriental potentate. The Neapolitans followed the French to
  Castellana, and when the latter faced up to them they stampeded
  in disordered panic. Some were wounded, but few were killed, and
  the King, forgetting in his fright his pledged undertaking to go
  forth trusting in "God and Nelson," fled in advance of his
  valiant soldiers to the capital, where they all arrived in
  breathless confusion. General Mack had been introduced to Nelson
  by the King and Queen, the latter exhorting him to be on land
  what the Admiral had been on sea.</p>

  <p>Nelson seems to have formed an adverse opinion of Mack, who
  was extolled by the Court as the military genius who was to
  deliver Europe from <a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>the
  thraldom of the French. He had expressed the view that the King
  and Queen's incomparable general "could not move without five
  carriages," and that <i>he</i> "had formed his opinion" of him,
  which was tantamount to saying that Mack was both a coward and a
  traitor. Perhaps it was undue consideration for the feelings of
  Caroline, sister to the late Marie Antoinette, that caused him to
  restrain his boiling rage against this crew of reptiles, who had
  sold every cause that was entrusted to their protection.</p>

  <p>Nelson was infatuated with the charms of Caroline, and as this
  astute lady knew how to handle him in the interests of the
  Neapolitan Court, he reciprocated her patronage by overlooking
  misdeeds that would, under different circumstances, have
  justified him in blowing swarms of her noble subjects out of
  existence. "I declare to God," he writes, "my whole study is how
  to best meet the approbation of the Queen." An open door and
  hearty reception was always awaiting their Majesties of Sicily on
  board Nelson's flagship when they found it necessary to fly from
  the wrath of their downtrodden subjects or the aggressive
  invasions of the French troops. The anxiety of Nelson in
  conveying them to their Sicilian retreat was doubly increased by
  the vast treasure they never neglected to take with them, and
  neither the sources from which it came nor the means of spending
  it gave trouble to their consciences. The British Government,
  always generous with other person's money, fed these insufferable
  royal personages by bleeding the life's <a name="Page_149" id=
  "Page_149"></a>blood out of the British public, though it is fair
  to say that the Government did not carry out to the full the
  benevolent suggestions Nelson consistently urged in their behalf.
  "His heart was always breaking" at some act of parsimony on the
  part of the Government in so tardily giving that which he pleaded
  was an urgent necessity for them to have. He frankly avowed that
  he would prefer to resign if any distinction were to be drawn
  between loyalty to his rightful sovereign and that of his
  Sicilian Majesty, who was the faithful ally of his King. The
  solemn audacity of this statement reveals a mind so far fallen to
  pieces by infatuation that it has lost the power of
  discrimination.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that this gracious ally promised Nelson
  that he would go forth at the head of his troops and conquer or
  die, and then scampered off in front of his army through Rome to
  Naples, and, after a few days' concealment from the mob, secretly
  bundled into boats with his retinue on a stormy night of great
  peril, embarked on the Admiral's ship, and sailed for
  Palermo.</p>

  <p>Lady Hamilton is credited with planning (with heroic skill)
  means by which the Royal Family could be taken to the shore,
  where Nelson was to receive and convoy them in barges to the
  <i>Vanguard</i>. Lady Hamilton had explored a subterranean
  passage which led from the palace to the beach, and pronounced it
  a fairly safe and possible means of exit. The plan apparently
  succeeded, and the royal party, after a few days' <a name=
  "Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>precautionary stay in the Bay of
  Naples, were conveyed in safety to Palermo, notwithstanding the
  hurricane that was encountered and only weathered by a perfection
  of seamanship that was unequalled in our naval and merchant
  services at that period of our trying history. The voyage was not
  made without tragedy, for the youngest of the princes became ill,
  and as it is always inevitable to attach a heroine to
  circumstances that are sensational (when there is one at hand),
  their Majesties in their grief fixed on her who had braved the
  perils of investigating the possibilities of the subterranean
  tunnel which had proved a safe though hazardous passage for the
  conveyance of themselves and their vast treasure. Nor do they
  appear to have been unmindful of her devotion to themselves
  during the storm, which was the severest that Nelson said he had
  ever experienced&mdash;though this is a platitude, as sailors are
  always prone to regard the last storm as the most terrific of
  all! But that it was severe there can be no doubt. We may be
  assured that the royal parents were not in a condition to give
  succour to their stricken son, so he was vouchsafed to pass
  beyond the veil in the arms of Lady Hamilton, who had bravely
  defied the tempest and behaved with a compassion that must always
  stand to her credit.</p>

  <p>They arrived at Palermo the day after the young Prince's
  death, and soon settled down to their gambling and other
  pleasures in which Nelson, as already stated, was involved.
  Troubridge, with touching fidelity, pleads with him to shun
  <a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>the temptations by which he
  is beset. "I dread, my Lord," he says, "all the feasting, etc.,
  at Palermo. I am sure your health will be hurt. If so, all their
  saints will be damned by the Navy"; and then he goes on to say,
  "The King would be better employed digesting a good Government;
  everything gives way to their pleasures. The money spent at
  Palermo gives discontent here; fifty thousand people are
  unemployed, trade discouraged, manufactures at a stand. It is the
  interest of many here to keep the King away; they all dread
  reform."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Troubridge was
  wellnigh driven to distraction by the terrible straits he was put
  to at Naples. The people were faced with the ravages of famine.
  Already there were scenes of unspeakable misery. His appeals to
  the Sicilian Court to <a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>send
  immediate relief was ignored. Nelson, to whom he had appealed,
  was absorbed in his attentions to Lady Hamilton, and refused to
  see the vicious indifference of the Court, who were hemmed round
  with a set of knaves and vagabonds, if that be not too moderate a
  term to use of them. Troubridge beseeches him to come to the
  rescue in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>My Lord, we are dying off fast for want. I learn that Sir
    William Hamilton says Prince Luzzi refused corn, some time ago,
    and Sir William does not think it worth while making another
    application. If that be the case, I wish he commanded this
    distressing scene, instead of me. Puglia had an immense
    harvest: near thirty sail left Messina, before I did, to load
    corn. Will they let us have any? If not, a short time will
    decide the business. The German interest prevails. I wish I was
    at your Lordship's elbow for an hour. All, all, will be thrown
    on you: I will parry the blow as much as in my power; I foresee
    much mischief brewing. God bless your Lordship! I am miserable,
    I cannot assist your operations more. Many happy returns of the
    day to you (it was the first of the New Year). I never spent so
    miserable a one. I am not very tender-hearted, but really the
    distress here would even move a Neapolitan.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Shortly after he writes, again pouring out fresh
  woes:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>I have this day saved thirty thousand people from
    starvation; but with this day my ability ceases. As the
    Government are bent on starving us, I see no alternative but to
    leave these poor people to perish, without our being witness of
    their distress. I curse the day I ever served the Neapolitan
    Government. We have characters, my Lord, to lose; these people
    have none. Do not suffer their infamous conduct to fall on us.
    Our country is just, but severe. Such is the fever of my brain
    this minute, that I assure you, on my honour, if the Palermo
    traitors were here, I would shoot them first, and then myself.
    Girgenti <a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>is full of corn;
    the money is ready to pay for it; we do not ask it as a gift.
    Oh! could you see the horrid distress I daily experience,
    something would be done. Some engine is at work against us at
    Naples, and I believe I hit on the proper person. If you
    complain, he will be immediately promoted, agreeably to the
    Neapolitan custom. All I write to is known at the Queen's. For
    my own part, I look upon the Neapolitans as the worst of
    intriguing enemies; every hour shows me their infamy and
    duplicity. I pray your Lordship be cautious; your honest open
    manner of acting will be made a handle of. When I see you and
    tell you of their infamous tricks, you will be as much
    surprised as I am. The whole will fall on you.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nelson must have known the position set forth in this feverish
  communication from a man whose judgment and affection he had no
  reason to suspect. It is a deplorable example of infatuation that
  every one who knew the Court and the rascals that surrounded it
  was aware of its shameless tricks except Nelson himself. They
  protested that they had withdrawn the restrictions on the
  exportation of corn so far as they could, and he swallowed their
  lies with the simplicity of a child. He must have been the victim
  of mesmeric influence not to see through their vile knavery in
  pleading poverty when they were asked to carry out an act of
  common humanity. All very well for him to groan over what he had
  to endure, and to complain that the burden of it had broken his
  spirit! Troubridge diagnosed the malady when he implored Nelson
  to relinquish the infatuation which was leading him into trouble.
  Why, instead of spending his time with Lady Hamilton and fawning
  over the King and Queen, did he leave the right thing to be done
  by Captain Ball (who took the bull by the horns)? All very well
  <a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>for him to pour out his
  wrath to the Duke of Clarence, that his "constant thought was
  down, down with the damned French villains"! and that his "blood
  boiled at the name of a Frenchman"! But except that we were at
  war with the French, were they in any degree such "damned
  villains" as the Neapolitans and the whole crew of Court knaves,
  with whom he was so blindly enamoured, who were, in reality,
  ready to sell their own country and his to the French whenever
  they saw it was to their material advantage to do so?</p>

  <p>Captain Ball did not waste time in the use of adjectives about
  the French and the daily "anxieties" that bore so heavily on
  himself and others, "breaking his heart." He gave peremptory
  orders to his first lieutenant to proceed off Messina and seize
  the ships that were lying there loaded with corn, and bring them
  to Malta. He defied the abominable Court of Sicily and their
  edicts prohibiting exportation, and his instructions were carried
  out. He awaited the consequences to himself with a manly
  consciousness that humanity must take precedence of orders
  dictated by a sentimental fear lest the feelings of a set of
  cowardly despots should be hurt. This single act of real courage
  and decision saved the lives of thousands of starving people, and
  prevented the siege from being removed. The Court of Naples dared
  not utter a word of condemnation against Captain Ball, but the
  Governor of Malta became the object of their nervous enmity,
  which they dare not put into practice.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>Lord Minto, many years
  after the events of which I am writing, said of Nelson, for whom
  he had an affectionate regard, that "he was in many points a
  really great man, but in others he was a baby." No one who has
  studied his career will ever doubt his greatness, but his peevish
  childishness, even when he was responsible for the carrying out
  of great deeds that did not come so quickly as his eager spirit
  craved, ofttimes tried the patience of those who set high value
  on his matchless talents and his otherwise lovable disposition.
  He was never known to take credit to himself that was due to
  others, but, like most great men, he took for granted that all
  those above or below him in rank and station should be
  subordinate to his whims and actions. He could only accommodate
  himself to being subordinate to his King, the King and Queen of
  Naples, and to the exhilarating influence of Lady Hamilton.
  Almost immediately after the seizure of the grain-laden ships,
  Nelson sailed for Malta, and had the good fortune to sight a
  French squadron, the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i>, three
  frigates, and a corvette; after an exciting and hard chase, he
  came up to them, knocked their masts over the side, and captured
  the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> and a frigate.</p>

  <h3>X</h3>

  <p>Nelson hit on a simple though ingenious plan that was
  frequently adopted in subsequent years by captains in the
  merchant service when racing, <a name="Page_156" id=
  "Page_156"></a>which always created excitement amongst the crew;
  the order was given to knock the wedges out of the deck coamings,
  ease the strain off the fore and aft stays, and when it was
  judicious to do it the pinch on the main rigging was also eased
  to give the masts more play. The windjammer seamen knew when this
  order was given that they were in for a time of "cracking on,"
  and really enjoyed both the sport and the risk that it involved,
  even in the hands of skilful commanders. By this means the speed
  was always increased, and it was quite a common practice on
  tea-clippers, Australian passenger vessels, and American packets.
  The commander rarely left the quarterdeck on those occasions,
  unless his officers were really first-class men. The writer has
  often attained successful results when racing by putting
  invigorating life into his ship by these old-time methods which
  were handed down to each generation of sailors. No class of
  seamen knew more dainty tricks in manipulating sails and rigging
  than those who manned the slave-runner, the smuggler, and the
  pirate schooner. Their vessels were designed for speed, but
  ofttimes when they were in a tight place they were saved from
  being destroyed by the superb nautical dodges which they alone
  knew so well how and when to put in use so that their pursuers
  might be outwitted and outdistanced. It is more than probable
  that the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> would have got away had
  Nelson not been a past-master in all kinds of dodges to make his
  ship sail faster. He knew that some of the French ships were
  notoriously equal <a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>to the
  British in sailing qualities, but he left nothing to chance.
  Every drop of water was ordered to be pumped out of the hold; the
  wedges were removed from the masts' coaming; the stays slackened;
  butts of water were hung on them; hammocks were piped down; every
  available sail was crowded on to her; the most reliable
  quartermasters were stationed at the wheel. The <i>Foudroyant</i>
  is gaining&mdash;she draws ahead. The stump of the "heaven-born"
  Admiral's right arm is working with agitation as his ship takes
  the lead. It is now all up with the
  <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i>. She surrenders after a terrific,
  devastating duel, and Nelson avows that had he acted according to
  Lord Keith's instead of his own strategy, she would never have
  been taken. The <i>Guillaume Tell</i> had been locked up in Malta
  Harbour for some time, and the commander decided to run the
  gauntlet, his reason being, it is stated, to relieve the starving
  garrison from having to feed his ship's company, which consisted
  of from 1,000 to 1,200 men. She was intercepted, engaged, and
  ultimately taken by the <i>Foudroyant</i>, <i>Lion</i>, and
  <i>Penelope</i> after all her masts had been shot away. The
  thrilling story of this sea battle takes high rank in naval
  warfare. The French ship was fought with the fury of courage and
  genius that Nelson himself could not have failed to admire. The
  <i>Penelope</i> and <i>Lion</i> had been mauled off when the
  <i>Foudroyant</i> came on the scene and shot away her main and
  mizzen masts, when a French sailor, like Jack Crawford of
  Sunderland at the battle of Camperdown, nailed the ensign to the
  stump <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>of the mizzen mast.
  The foremast was the only mast now remaining, and it was soon
  sent flying over the side by the terrific firing from the British
  ship. She then took her colours down, ceased firing, and became
  the prize of the heroes who had fought and conquered. Nelson
  might and ought to have had the glory of taking the last of the
  Nile fleet, had he not allowed a perverse spirit to rule his
  will. He nursed and inflamed his imagination against Lord Keith
  being put over him, until that fine zeal that was so natural to
  him slackened. He writes to Hamilton that his "situation is
  irksome." "Lord Keith is commander-in-chief, and he (Nelson) has
  not been kindly treated." He tells Spencer that he has written to
  Lord Keith, asking for permission to come to England, when he
  (the First Lord) will "see a broken-hearted man," and that his
  "spirit cannot submit to it." The Admiralty may have been
  inspired to place Lord Keith in supreme command owing to Nelson's
  association with the Court party at Palermo and the growing
  scandal attached to it. But in that case they should have frankly
  told him that they feared the effect his dallying at Palermo
  might have on the service in many different ways.</p>

  <p>Troubridge and Captain Ball urged him with all the sincerity
  of devotion not to return to Sicily, but to remain at Malta, and
  sign the capitulation which was near at hand; but they could not
  alter his resolve to leave the station, which Troubridge said was
  due to the passion of infatuation and not to illness, which he
  had ascribed <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>as the reason.
  Nelson tried the patience of the First Lord (who was his friend)
  so sorely that he wrote him a private letter which was couched in
  gentle though, in parts, cutting reproaches. He obviously
  believed that the plea of ill-health was groundless, or at all
  events not sufficiently serious to justify him giving up. He very
  fairly states that he is quite convinced that he will be more
  likely to recover his health in England than by an inactive stay
  at the Court of Sicily, however pleasing the gratitude shown him
  for the services he has rendered may be, and that no gratitude
  from that Court can be too great in view of the service he had
  bestowed upon it. Lord Minto, who was Ambassador at Vienna, says
  he has letters from Nelson and Lady Hamilton which do not make it
  clear whether he will go home or not. He hopes he will not for
  his own sake, for he wants him to take Malta first; and
  continues, "He does not seem conscious of the sort of discredit
  he has fallen into, or the cause of it, for he still writes, not
  wisely, about Lady Hamilton and all that," and then generously
  states, "But it is hard to condemn and use ill a hero, as he is
  in his own element, for being foolish about a woman who has art
  enough to make fools of many wiser than an Admiral."</p>

  <p>It is hardly possible to doubt that Nelson felt keenly
  mortified at losing the opportunity of personally taking the
  <i>Guillaume Tell</i>; but whether he did or not, he managed to
  subdue all appearance of envy and paid a high, sportsmanlike
  tribute to those who had earned the honour <a name="Page_160" id=
  "Page_160"></a>He could not help flavouring it, however, with
  some words of Nelsonian self-approbation. He said, "He gloried in
  them, for they were his children, they served in his school, and
  all of them, including himself, caught their professional zeal
  and fire from the great and good Earl St. Vincent." Then he goes
  on to say that it is a great happiness to have the Nile fleet all
  taken under his orders and regulations. He slyly claimed the
  glory of training and inspiring, though he had deprived himself
  of added fame by nourishing a morose feeling of jealousy against
  Lord Keith, who had been sent out after a few months' leave to
  take up his position as commander-in-chief. Owing to his absence,
  Nelson had acted in that capacity, and he could not bear the
  thought of being superseded by his old chief. In fact, Nelson
  could not tolerate being placed in a secondary position by any
  one. As I have already stated, he put Keith's authority at
  defiance and took responsibilities upon himself, boasting that
  had they failed he would have been "shot or broke."</p>

  <p>After the capture of the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i> he
  struck, and wrote to Keith that his health would not permit of
  his remaining at his post, that without "rest he was done for,"
  and that he could "no more stay fourteen days longer on the
  station than fourteen years." At the same time, Captain Ball
  wrote to Lady Hamilton that "he had dined with him, and that he
  was in good health," that he did not think a short stay would do
  his health harm, and that "he would not urge it, <a name=
  "Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>were it not that he and Troubridge
  wished him to have the honour of the French ships and the French
  garrison surrender to him." Nelson's vision and good judgment at
  this time must have been totally at fault, and his general
  attitude emphasizes the splendid forbearance of his amiable
  commander-in-chief and distinguished subordinates who were the
  very cream of the Navy. I wonder what would have happened to any
  of the other brilliant commanders in the Royal Navy if any of
  them had, like Nelson, refused to obey the orders of the
  commander-in-chief and left his post off Malta, which was being
  closely besieged and the garrison daily expected to capitulate!
  Supposing Nelson had been the commander-in-chief and his second
  in command had acted as he did towards Lord Keith, there
  <i>would</i> have been wigs on the green! The insubordinate
  officer would have been promptly court-martialled and hung at the
  yardarm like the Neapolitan Admiral, Francesco Caracciolo, or
  treated like the Hon. Admiral John Byng, who was tried for
  neglect of duty in an engagement off Minorca in 1756, and
  condemned for committing an error of judgment and shot aboard the
  <i>Monarch</i> at Spithead in 1757. Nelson was a stern
  disciplinarian, who could never brook being under discipline
  himself. Nor was he ever a day without a grievance of one kind or
  another. It must have been a happy deliverance to Keith when he
  heard the last of him in the Mediterranean, for his mental
  capacity at this particular stage of his history was quite
  defective. No doubt Lady Hamilton and the <a name="Page_162" id=
  "Page_162"></a>Queen jabbered into his ears the injustice of the
  wrongs imposed upon him.</p>

  <p>After the battle of Marengo the whole of Northern Italy was
  given up to the French by convention signed by General Milas. The
  British Commander-in-Chief proceeded to Leghorn with the
  fugitives, to be bored, as he fretfully declared, "by Nelson
  craving permission to take the Queen to Palermo, and the prince
  and princesses to all parts of the world." The Queen was
  panic-stricken at the French successes, and besought him to allow
  her to sail in the <i>Foudroyant</i>; but Keith could not be
  prevailed upon to release any of his ships for such a purpose,
  notwithstanding Nelson's supplications and her flow of tears. He
  told Nelson that the royal lady should get off to Vienna as
  quickly as she could and abandon the idea of Palermo,
  supplementing his refusal to employ the <i>Foudroyant</i> in any
  such way. He would only allow a frigate to escort her own
  frigates to Trieste. Lady Minto wrote to her sister from Florence
  that Keith told the Queen that "Lady Hamilton had had command of
  the fleet long enough," and then she adds, "The Queen is very ill
  with a sort of convulsive fit, and Nelson is staying to nurse
  her, and does not intend going home until he has escorted her
  back to Palermo. His zeal for the public service," she continues,
  "seems entirely lost in his love and vanity, and they all sit and
  flatter each other all day long."</p>

  <p>Nelson, steady in his attachment to the Queen declared that he
  would see her through and then continue his journey home with the
  Hamiltons. <a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>They all left
  Leghorn together, arrived at Florence safely, were taken from
  Ancona to Trieste on two Russian frigates, and landed at Trieste.
  The Queen of Sicily accompanied them to Vienna, and Nelson and
  the Hamiltons continued their triumphant journey through Germany
  to Hamburg. His association with the Court of Naples was now at
  an end, and his real friends, believing that it had corrupted and
  sapped his better nature, were glad of it. His mind at this time
  was filled with delusions about his future. He repeatedly
  declared that he would never serve again, and from a mixture of
  motives he acquired happiness in the belief that he would avenge
  his keenly-felt wrongs by achieving oblivion. The idea that fate
  held in store for him a higher and a sterner destiny never
  occurred to him, and he little realized that he would soon be
  removed from a sphere where his presence would be no longer
  needed. He was, in fact, combating the very destiny he had so
  often sought in which he would achieve immortal glory.</p>

  <h3>XI</h3>

  <p>The benighted policy of keeping in power a mawkish Sicilian
  Court, saturated with the incurable vices of cowardice,
  falsehood, dishonesty, and treachery, failed; and the Government
  of the day was saddled with the crime of squandering human life,
  wealth, and energy without receiving any commensurate return. If
  it was in the national <a name="Page_164" id=
  "Page_164"></a>interest to involve the country in war with
  France, it could have been carried on with greater credit and
  effect by not undertaking the hopeless task of bolstering up a
  Court and a people that were openly described by our own people
  who were sent to fight for them as "odious damned cowards and
  villains." We had no <i>real</i> grounds of quarrel with France
  nor with her rulers. The Revolution was their affair, and was no
  concern of ours, except in so far as it might harmfully reflect
  on us, and of this there was no likelihood if we left them alone.
  The plea of taking the balance of power under our benevolent care
  was a sickly exhibition of statesmanship, and the assumption of
  electing ourselves guardians of the rights of small nations mere
  cant. It was, in fact, the canker of jealousy and hatred on the
  part of the reactionary forces against a man, a principle, and a
  people.</p>

  <p>Had those who governed this country then held aloof from the
  imbroglio created by the French Revolution, observed a watchful,
  conciliatory spirit of neutrality towards the French Government,
  and allowed the Continental Powers to adjust their own
  differences, the conditions of human existence and the hurtful
  administration of autocratic governments would have been
  reconstituted, and the world would have been the better for it;
  instead of which we helped to impose on Europe twenty years of
  slaughter and devastation. Our dismal, plutocratic rulers, with
  solemn enthusiasm, plunged England with all her power and
  influence on the side of Prussia <a name="Page_165" id=
  "Page_165"></a>and her continental allies, and, in conjunction
  with the Holy Alliance, pledged themselves never to lay down arms
  until France was mutilated and the master-mind which ruled her
  beaten and dethroned. Their task was long, costly, and gruesome.
  What a ghastly legacy those aggressively righteous champions of
  international rights have bequeathed to the world! But for their
  folly and frenzy we should not be engaged in a European war
  to-day. Poor Napoleon! He foreshadowed and used his gigantic
  genius to prevent it; now the recoil has come. There are always
  more flies caught by treacle than by vinegar, a policy quite as
  efficacious in preventing international quarrels as it is in the
  smaller affairs of our existence, provided the law which governs
  the fitness of things is well defined.</p>

  <p>Had we approached Napoleon in a friendly spirit and on equal
  terms, without haughty condescension, he would have reciprocated
  our cordiality and put proper value on our friendship. By wisdom
  and tact the duration of Napoleon's wars would have been vastly
  shortened, and both nations would have been saved from the errors
  that were committed. We did not do this, and we are now reaping
  the consequence. It is hardly to be expected that if hostility be
  shown towards an individual or a nation either will mildly submit
  to it. Who can estimate the passionate resentment of an emotional
  people at Nelson's constant declamatory outbursts against the
  French national character, and the effect it had throughout
  France?</p>

  <p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>An affront to a nation,
  even though it is made by a person in a subordinate position, may
  bring about far-reaching trouble. Reverse the position of the
  traducer of a prominent man or his nation, and it will be easy to
  arrive at a correct conclusion as to the temper that would be
  aroused, say, in this country. We know that during a war passions
  are let loose and charges made by the combatants against each
  other which are usually exaggerated, but one thing is certain,
  that our soldiers and sailors have always had the well-deserved
  reputation of being the cleanest fighters in the world. There
  have never been finer examples of this than during the present
  war. But in justice to ourselves and to the French during the
  Napoleonic wars, I think it was grossly impolitic to engender
  vindictiveness by unjustifiable acrimony. Up to the time that
  Nelson left the Mediterranean for England, except for the
  brilliant successes of the Nile and the equally brilliant capture
  of the balance of the French Mediterranean fleet, and
  subsequently the capitulation of Malta on the 5th September,
  1800, our share in the war was an exhausting and fruitless
  failure.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for this clearly lies at the door of the
  Government who planned it, and in no way attaches to Nelson and
  his coadjutors, whose naval and also shore exploits could not be
  excelled. First, it was a blink-eyed policy that plunged us into
  the war at all; and secondly, it was the height of human folly to
  waste our resources in the erroneous belief that the highly
  <a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>trained military men of
  France could be permanently subjugated in the Mediterranean by
  the cowardly, treacherous villains of which the Roman States
  armies and Governments were composed. History is not altogether
  faithful to the truth in its honeyed records of the ministerial
  pashas who tranquilly increased the national debt, inflicted
  unspeakable horrors on the population, and smirched our dignity
  by entering into a costly bond of brotherhood with an inveterate
  swarm of hired blood-sucking weasels. Such, forsooth! was the
  mental condition of the wooden souls who managed the nation's
  affairs, that they allowed Nelson to add another blot to our
  national history escutcheon by taking Ferdinand Bourbon's throne
  under his protection. It is true that Ferdinand "did not wish
  that his benefactor's name should alone descend with honour to
  posterity," or that he should "appear ungrateful." So the Admiral
  was handsomely rewarded by being presented with the Dukedom of
  Bronte and a diamond-hilted sword which had been given to the
  King by his father when he became Sicilian King. It would be
  nonsense even to suspect Nelson of accepting either gifts or
  titles as a bribe to sacrifice any interest that was British.</p>

  <p>Nelson's devotion to the Court did not express itself by
  seeking material recompense for the services bestowed on their
  Sicilian Majesties. There were various reasons for his elaborate
  and silly attentions. First, his range of instructions were wide
  in a naval sense; second, his personal attachment to the King and
  his Consort (especially <a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>his
  Consort), for reasons unnecessary to refer to again, became a
  growing fascination and a ridiculous craze. His fanatical
  expressions of dislike to the French are merely a Nelsonian way
  of conveying to the world that the existence of so dangerous a
  race should be permissive under strictly regulated conditions. He
  had a solemn belief in his own superiority and that of his
  fellow-countrymen. All the rest were to him mere human scrap, and
  his collection of epithets for them was large and varied. His
  Mogul air in the presence of aliens was traditionally seamanlike.
  If they failed to shudder under his stern look and gleaming eyes,
  it affected him with displeasure and contempt. The Neapolitans
  were fulsomely accommodating, though Nelson, except from the
  Court party and a few nobles, does not appear to have attached
  much value to their servile tokens of appreciation. It cannot be
  said that either Nelson, his Government, or his country were in
  any way rewarded by the sacrifices made ostensibly in the
  interests of human rights. Under Ferdinand Bourbon, the
  Neapolitan States and Sicily had no settled government. He was a
  contemptible poltroon, whose throne was supported for years by
  British money, men, and ships, and even with our strong support;
  he was alternately fleeing to Sicily and returning again under
  the formidable protection of British frigates, and, like all
  perfidious cowards, his short intervals of government were
  distinguished by a despotism that soon made it necessary for him
  to fly from the feelings of vengeance he had called out.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>Not even the power of
  Great Britain could prevent the kingdom of Naples from passing
  from one vicissitude into another. The French took possession of
  it in January 1799, and established what they called the
  Parthenopean Republic. Nelson helped to retake it in June of the
  same year, and put the itinerant King on the throne. The
  Neapolitans occupied Rome on the 30th September, 1799. In October
  1805 a treaty of neutrality between France and Naples was carried
  into effect. Ferdinand fled to Sicily again on the 23rd January
  of the next year, when the master-mind came to close quarters and
  put an end, as I have previously stated, to Ferdinand's kingship
  and tyrannical rule by placing his brother Joseph on the throne;
  two years later Joseph became King of Spain, and his
  brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, succeeded him as ruler of Naples.
  The Neapolitans were never better governed than during the reign
  of these two kings. Many wise laws were made and enforced by a
  just and rigid discipline. Incompetent, weak despotism had
  disappeared, and any attempt at licence was promptly subdued. The
  people were put through a course of transforming education, and
  gradually became law-abiding citizens. Even then, methods of
  carrying on commerce took a marked change for the better, and
  predatory habits were relaxed into comparative honesty, not, it
  may be supposed, from virtue, but from fear of the inevitable,
  harsh consequences. The public, in a general way, quickly
  distinguish between a strong, capable ruler and a weak,
  incompetent one; and <a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>no
  matter how indulgent the latter may be, they prefer the strong
  wholesome-minded man to the mediocrity.</p>

  <p>Ferdinand had none of the qualities that are essential to a
  man occupying a position of authority. When the French came to
  take over the government of Naples, he flew, as usual, to Sicily,
  and under the continuous protection of British men-of-war was
  with great difficulty kept reigning there until the end of war,
  when he was again put on the throne of Naples in 1815, and
  forthwith commenced again his rule of incompetency and despotism,
  reversing the beneficent rule of his two able predecessors. The
  old reprobate died on the 4th January, 1825, having reigned off
  and on for sixty-five years, largely owing to the indulgent and
  costly support of the British Government.</p>

  <p>Caroline died on the 7th September, 1814, and to her abiding
  credit she condemned the action of the Court of Vienna for
  severing the bond of union between the Emperor Napoleon and her
  granddaughter, Marie Louise. She declared vehemently that it was
  the duty of the latter to break the prohibition by assuming
  disguise and tie her bed-sheets together and lower herself out of
  the window, and make her way quickly, in face of all obstacles,
  to where her husband was. Marie Louise was not a lady of
  unyielding morals, and at that particular time her Hapsburg,
  licentious mind was not centred on the misfortunes of her
  husband, but on Neipperg, who was employed to seduce her.
  Caroline told Baron Claude <a name="Page_171" id=
  "Page_171"></a>Fran&ccedil;ois de Meneval, Napoleon's private
  secretary, that she had reason at one time to dislike the
  Emperor, but now that adversity had come to him, she forgot the
  past.</p>

  <p>Had this same spirit of rightness and wisdom been adopted by
  Marie Louise's father and his allies, as was so nobly advocated
  by the sister of Marie Antoinette, there would have been a clean
  sheet in history about them, though it is obvious in many
  quarters that the historians have extended all the arts of
  ambiguity and delusion to make them appear flawless benefactors.
  Therefore one has to take all the circumstances handed down from
  many varied sources, reliable and unreliable, and after mature
  thought form conclusions as one's judgment may direct as to the
  merits and demerits of every phase that is recorded. Hence
  exhaustive research and long-reasoned views lead me definitely to
  the conclusion that there is not much that we can put to the
  credit of either their wisdom or humanity. My plain opinion is
  that they acted ferociously, and although always in the name of
  the Son of God, that can never absolve them from the dark deeds
  that stand to their names. Nor is it altogether improbable that
  all the nations that were concerned in the dreadful assassination
  are now paying the natural penalty of their guilt. Natural laws
  have a curious roundabout way of paying back old scores, though
  the tragic retribution has to be borne more often than not by the
  innocent descendants of those who have, in the name of the Deity,
  violated them.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>The Duke of Thunder was
  proud of the Sicilian meaning of his title, and so were his
  sailors, who loved the thrilling effect of anything that conveyed
  the idea of being associated with a formidable power that
  devastated every other force that stood in its way. For the most
  part, Nelson's sailors had great faith in his naval genius. He
  had led them many times to victory, and they did not forget the
  glory that attached to themselves. He planned the strategy, but
  it was they that fought and won the battles. The Duke of Thunder
  was a fine title to fight under. A name has frequently done more
  damage to a foe than glittering bayonets. But Nelson in no degree
  had the thunder element in him, so far as we are able to judge by
  the descriptions given to us of him. He was a dashing,
  courageous, scientific genius, gifted with natural instincts,
  disciplinary wisdom, deplorable sentimentality, and an
  artificial, revengeful spirit of hatred that probably became real
  under the arbitrary circumstances of war, but, I should say, was
  rarely prominent. His roaming attacks on the French were probably
  used more for effect, and had, we hope, only a superficial
  meaning. But be that as it may, it detracts from the dignity of
  an officer occupying, as he did, a distinguished position to use
  language and phrases such as are common in the forecastle or on
  the quarterdeck of a sailing merchantman in the early days before
  the introduction of steamers. Here are a few quite amusing
  outbursts which do not produce the impression of coming from a
  person known <a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>to fame as the
  Duke of Thunder:&mdash;On the 1st October, 1801, the
  preliminaries of peace with France were signed. When Nelson heard
  of it he thanked God, and went on to say, "We lay down our arms,
  and are ready to take them up again if the French are insolent."
  He declares there is no one in the world more desirous of peace
  than he is, but that he would "burst sooner than let any damned
  Frenchman know it." But it was too much for his anti-French
  sentiments when he heard that their Ambassador's carriage had
  been dragged by the London mob. He wrote to his medical man, and
  asked if he could cure madness, for he had gone mad to learn
  "that our damned scoundrels dragged a Frenchman's carriage." And
  he hoped nevermore to be dragged by such a degenerate crowd;
  which was exhibiting in a characteristic way his high opinion of
  himself. "Would our ancestors have done it?" he asks, and then
  continues: "The villains would have drawn Buonaparte if he had
  been able to get to London to cut the king's head off." The
  writer has a definite opinion that Bonaparte would have had a
  boisterous reception, and that it might have cemented a
  friendship that would have been a blessing to the tired world,
  and especially to the two warring nations.</p>

  <p>The ruler of the French nation, in spite of Nelson's views,
  would have made a better ally than enemy. But it often happens
  that nations, as well as individuals, lose their psychological
  opportunity. And we will risk a belief that if Nelson and
  Bonaparte met they would have <a name="Page_174" id=
  "Page_174"></a>found an affinity between them that would have
  made the two men friends. Southey says that the title "Duke of
  Thunder" is essentially applicable to Nelson, but the writer has
  failed to find anything to warrant such an opinion.</p>

  <p>Nelson's professional pride was for ever being needlessly hurt
  by Admiralty tactlessness. He had good reason on many occasions
  to take offence at their clumsiness. One of numerous grievances
  was Sir Sydney Smith being, to all appearances, put over him. He
  wrote to Lord St. Vincent, and reminded him that he was a man,
  and that it was impossible for him to serve in the Mediterranean
  under a junior officer. St. Vincent prevailed on him not to
  resign, but Sir Sydney Smith wished to carry out a policy towards
  the French in Egypt which Nelson hotly disapproved, and he
  commands him on no account to permit a single Frenchman to leave
  the country. He considered it would be madness to permit a band
  of thieves to return to Europe. "To Egypt," he says, "they went
  of their own accord, and they shall remain there while he
  commanded the squadron. Never will he consent to the return of
  one ship or Frenchman. I wish them to perish in Egypt, and give
  an awful lesson to the world of the justice of the Almighty." It
  will be observed how characteristically sailorly he is in his
  leanings on Divine monopoly in punishing the "bloody Corsican"
  for his wickedness in waging war against Britain. His profound
  belief was that the Almighty presided over our destinies then,
  just as the German Kaiser claims that He is presiding over
  <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>his national affairs now;
  and, as I have pointed out before, each of the belligerents calls
  upon Him in beseeching reverence as a Divine compatriot, to give
  this Almighty power to aid in demolishing their common foe, who
  has broken every law of God and man. This form of blasphemy is as
  rampant now as it ever was. It is not a hungry belief in God that
  gives the initial impulse for human slaughter. It is a craving
  lust for the invention of all that is devilish in expeditiously
  disposing of human life.</p>

  <p>The international democracies who are devoting so much
  attention to political ascendancy should distribute their power
  in a way that would make it impossible for weak Governments,
  composed of mediocrities and bellicose rulers of nations, to make
  war whenever their impertinent ambitions are impressed with the
  sanguinary rage of conflict.</p>

  <p>All wars mutilate civilization, and put back by many
  generations any advance that may have been made in the interval
  between one butchery and another. The working people of all
  nations could and should combine to stop the manufacture of every
  implement of warfare, and make it a treasonable offence for any
  ruler or Government again to advocate war as a means of settling
  disputes. This law must of necessity be binding upon all the
  Powers, big and little. What a mockery this gospel of brotherhood
  has been in all ages! Is it an ideal ambition to bring it about?
  Of course it is, but we cannot catch the spirit of Christ and
  preach the gospel of pity, and commit hideous murder at one and
  the same <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>time! hence the
  impudence of expecting a Divine benediction on warfare.</p>

  <p>All sorts of public and private honours and testimonials were
  conferred upon Nelson during his stay at Hamburg on his way home
  after the mortifications caused by the elusive French fleet,
  Calabrian brigands, and the alluring attractions of the Court of
  Naples and Sicily. One hundred grenadiers, each six feet high,
  waited at table when he was being banqueted. The owner of a
  Magdeburg hotel where he stayed made money by setting up a ladder
  outside Nelson's sitting-room and charging a fee for mounting it
  and peeping at the hero inside the room. An aged wine merchant at
  Hamburg offered him through Lady Hamilton six dozen bottles of
  Rhenish wine of the vintage of 1625. It had been in his own
  possession for fifty years, and he hoped that some of it would be
  allowed to flow with the blood of the immortal hero, as it would
  then make the giver happy. Nelson shook hands with the old man,
  and consented to receive six bottles, provided he would dine with
  him next day. A dozen were sent, and Nelson put aside six, saying
  that it was his hope to win half a dozen more victories, and that
  one bottle would be drunk after each.</p>

  <p>Another aged man, whose ideals were of a different and higher
  order, came along. He was a German pastor who, at eighty years of
  age or thereabouts, had travelled forty miles with the object of
  getting Nelson to write his immortal, name in his Bible. The
  venerable Lutheran prelate, with a grateful heart, asked to be
  allowed <a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>to record his
  blessing and admiration for the gallant British Admiral by
  stating to him, amongst other modestly selected phrases, that "he
  was the Saviour of the Christian world." The pastor's fervent
  testimony of his work and his mission touched Nelson on a tender
  spot. In his rough-and-ready way, he believed in the efficacy of
  prayer, and he knew when the old man, bowed down by age, parted
  from him that he would be steadfast in his petitions to the Giver
  of all mercies that he should be held in His holy keeping, body
  and soul. The story is an example of fine healthy devotion, free
  from sickly cant, though the logic of successfully squandering
  rich lives or even bravely sacrificing your own (as every
  commander risks doing) is a mysterious reason for the person who
  is successful in casting away human lives&mdash;even though they
  be those of an enemy&mdash;having the title of "the Saviour of
  the world" conferred upon him!</p>

  <p>The writer's idea of how to establish and advance the
  Christian faith is to keep out of war, and the best method of
  doing this is for the electorate to choose men to govern who are
  highly gifted with diplomatic genius. Nearly all wars are brought
  about through incompetent negotiators, and the wastage of life
  and property in carrying on a war is certainly to be attributed
  to men who are at the head of affairs being mere politicians,
  without any faculty whatever for carrying out great undertakings.
  They are simply mischievous shadows, and merely excel as
  intriguers in putting good men out of office and themselves in.
  It is <a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>the selection of men
  for the posts they are eminently suited to fill that counts in
  any department of life, but it is more manifestly important in
  affairs of Government. For instance, nothing but disaster can
  follow if a man is made Chancellor of the Exchequer who has no
  instinct for national finance, and the same thing applies to a
  Foreign Secretary who has no knowledge of or natural instinct for
  international diplomacy. At the same time, an adroit commercial
  expert may be utterly useless in dealing with matters of State
  that are affected by trade. The two positions are wide apart, and
  are a business in themselves. The writer's view is that to fill
  any department of State satisfactorily the head should have both
  political and commercial training, combined with wholesome
  instinct. I don't say that trade is altogether affected by the
  kind of Government that is in power, but bad trade and bad
  government combined make a terrific burden for any nation to
  carry.</p>

  <p>Service men, in the main, measure and think always from a
  military or naval point of view. Some of them have quite a genius
  for organizing in matters concerning their different professions.
  Take the late Lord Kitchener. In Army matters he was unequalled
  as an organizer but abominably traduced. Then there is Lord
  Fisher, who easily heads everybody connected with the Navy, as a
  great Admiral who can never be deprived of the merit of being the
  creator of our modern fleet. He combines with a matchless genius
  for control a fine organizing <a name="Page_179" id=
  "Page_179"></a>brain. The politician, with his amateurish antics,
  deprived the British Empire of the services of an outstanding
  figure that would have saved us many lives and many ships,
  without taking into account the vast quantity of merchandise and
  foodstuffs that have perished. It is not by creating confusion
  that the best interest of the nation is served, either in
  peace-time or during war. Those robust rhetoricians who massacre
  level-headed government and substitute a system of make-shift
  experiments during a great national crisis do a wicked public
  disservice. I have no time to deal with these superior persons in
  detail, but I cannot keep my thoughts from the terrible
  bitterness and anguish their haphazard experiments may have
  caused. The destroying force will eat into the very entrails of
  our national life if some powerful resolute personality does not
  arise to put an end to the hopeless extemporizing and contempt
  for sober, solid, orderly administration. The truth is that, if a
  government or anything else is wrongly conceived, natural laws
  will never help it to right itself, and it ends in catastrophe.
  Such governments are inflicted on us from time to time as a
  chastisement, it is said, for our national sins, and the process
  of disintegration is deadly in its effects. The only consoling
  feature of it is that history is repeating itself with strange
  accuracy, as may be verified by a glance into the manuscripts of
  Mr. Fortescue at Dropmore. Herein you will find many striking
  resemblances between the constitution of the Government then and
  the tribulation we are passing through at the present <a name=
  "Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>time. One important event of that
  period has been avoided up to the present; none has demanded a
  settlement of his differences by means of a duelling contest, as
  did Castlereagh and Canning.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
  "FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
  "fnanchor">[14]</a> They had a coalition of all the talents then
  as they presume to have now, though there has been no real
  evidence of it, either in or out of Parliament.</p>

  <h3>XII</h3>

  <p>Poor Nelson had a terrible time with one and another of them,
  as they had with him, if history may be relied on. His periodical
  defiances and his contempt for his superiors is quite edifying.
  He laid down the law like a bishop when his moods were in full
  play. The great naval, commercial, and military figure to which
  Nelson comes nearest is Drake, and the nearest to Nelson in
  versatility is Lord Fisher, who must have had an engaging
  <a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>time with those who wished
  to assume control of the Navy over his level head. I question
  whether any man holding a high position in the British Navy, at
  any time, could combine naval, military, and administrative
  genius, together with sound common sense, as Nelson did. We have
  devoted so much attention to the study of his naval
  accomplishments that many of his other practical gifts have been
  overlooked. It is common belief, in civilian circles at any rate,
  and there is good ground for it, that both the naval and military
  men do not realize how much their existence depends on a
  well-handled and judiciously treated mercantile marine. I have
  too much regard for every phase of seafaring life to criticize it
  unfairly, but, except on very rare occasions, I have found naval
  and military men so profoundly absorbed in their own professions
  that they do not trouble to regard anything else as being
  essential.</p>

  <p>The present war will have revealed many things that were not
  thought of in other days. One of Nelson's outstanding anxieties
  was lest any harm should befall our commerce, and he protected it
  and our shipping with fine vigilance and with scant support from
  the then Government, which would not supply him with ships; this
  at times drove him to expressions of despair. Privateering was
  more rampant then than it is now, and the belligerents had great
  difficulty in enforcing neutrals to observe neutrality. Indeed,
  the circumstances were such that it became impossible to prevent
  leakage. The British Admiral was continually protesting to the
  neutrals against the <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>system
  of smuggling and privateering, but it was hardly consistent,
  seeing that we were obliged to make breaches of neutrality in
  order to get our supplies. Small privateers, consisting sometimes
  of mere longboats, infested every swatch and corner they could
  get into on the Spanish shores, the Ionian Islands, the Barbary
  coast, the Balearic Islands, and Sicily. We indicted France for
  enforcing subsidies from Spain, compelling the Neapolitans to
  provide for her soldiers occupying Neapolitan territory. We, on
  the other hand, were obliged to make use of neutral ports for
  supplies required for the Gulf of Lyons fleet. It was a curious
  position, and both France and England were parties to the
  anomaly, and each accused the other of the impiety of it. The
  British Admiral and his officers never lost an opportunity of
  destroying the marauders when caught within neutral limits, and
  Nelson never flinched from supporting his officers in the matter.
  "The protection," he writes, "given to the enemies' privateers
  and rowboats is extremely destructive of our commerce," and then
  he goes on to give reasons why these vermin should be shot or
  captured.</p>

  <p>He was driven frantic by the demands made for convoys by
  captains and merchants, and his appeals to the Admiralty for more
  cruisers were unheeded. He expresses himself strongly averse from
  allowing even fast sailing vessels to make a passage unprotected.
  Perhaps no human mind that has been given grave responsibilities
  to safeguard was ever lacerated as was Nelson's in seeing
  <a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>that our commercial interest
  did not suffer, and that on the seas he guarded a free and safe
  passage should be assured to our shipping carrying food and other
  merchandise to the mother-country. The responsibility of carrying
  out even this special work in a satisfactory way was an amazing
  task, and no evidence is on record that he left anything to
  chance. Results are an eloquent answer to any doubts on that
  subject. In addition to policing the seas, he had the anxiety of
  watching the tricky manoeuvres of the French fleet, and planning
  for their interception and defeat should they weaken in their
  elusive methods. Of course, they were playing their own game, and
  had a right to, and it was for their opponents, whom Nelson so
  well represented, to outwit and trap them into fighting; but as
  for having any grounds for complaint, it was not only silly, but
  inopportune, to give expression to having a grievance against the
  French admirals because they cutely slipped out of his deadly
  grasp from time to time and made him weary of life! His
  grievances were easier to establish against the Board of
  Admiralty, who were alternately paying him compliments or
  insulting him. Instructions were given that could not be obeyed
  without involving the country in certain loss and complication.
  Officers, his junior in rank, were given appointments that had
  the appearance of placing them independent of his authority.
  Seniors of inferior capacity were given control over him which,
  but for his whimsical magnanimity, might have cost us the loss of
  the fleet, their crews, and our <a name="Page_184" id=
  "Page_184"></a>high honour and superb fighting reputation. Take
  for example Sir Hyde Parker's command of the Baltic fleet, or Sir
  John Orde's clumsy appointment to a squadron in the
  Mediterranean. Nothing could be so harassing to the nerves of a
  man sure of his own superiority as to be burdened, not only with
  Orde's arrogance, but his mediocrity. He was obliged to resort to
  subterfuge in order to get his dispatches sent home, and here
  again the action of the Admiralty compelled him to break naval
  discipline by ordering a nephew of Lord St. Vincent, a clever
  young captain of a frigate, to whom he was devoted, to take the
  dispatches to Lisbon. He told the young captain that Sir John
  Orde took his frigates from him, and sent them away in a
  direction contrary to his wishes. "I cannot get my dispatches
  even sent home," he said; adding, "You must try to avoid his
  ships." Nelson had not signed his orders, because Sir John Orde
  was his superior officer, but should it come to a court-martial,
  Hardy could swear to his handwriting, and he gave him the
  assurance that he would not be broken. "Take your orders, and
  goodbye," said he, "and remember, Parker, if you cannot weather
  that fellow, I shall think you have not a drop of your uncle's
  blood in your veins." Other Nelsonian instructions were given,
  and the gallant captain carried them out with a skill worthy of
  his ingenious, defiant chief and of his distinguished uncle.</p>

  <p>It was not only a slap in the face to Sir John Orde, but to
  those whose patronage had placed in a senior position a man who
  was not qualified <a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>to stand
  on the same quarterdeck with Nelson. He smarted under the
  treatment, but unhappily could not keep his chagrin under cover.
  He was always pouring his soul out to some one or other. His
  health is always falling to pieces after each affront, and for
  this reason he asks to be relieved. Here is an example of his
  moods. "I am much obliged to your Lordships' compliance with my
  requests," he says, "which is absolutely necessary from the
  present state of my health," and almost immediately after he
  tells a friend he "will never quit his post when the French fleet
  are at sea as a commander-in-chief once did." "I would sooner die
  at my post than have such a stigma upon my memory." This is a
  nasty dig at Lord St. Vincent, presumably for having a hand in
  the appointment of Sir John Orde. Then he writes to Elliot that
  nothing has kept him at his post but the fear of the French fleet
  escaping and getting to Naples or Sicily. "Nothing but gratitude
  for the good sovereigns would have induced him to stay a moment
  after Sir John Orde's extraordinary command, for his general
  conduct towards them is not such as he had a right to expect." I
  have heard that snobbishness prevails in the service now only in
  a less triumphant degree to what it did in Nelson's time. If that
  be the case, it ought to be wrestled with until every vestige of
  the ugly thing is strangled. The letters of Nelson to personal
  friends, to the Admiralty, and in his reported conversations, are
  all full of resentment at the viciousness of it, though he
  obviously struggles <a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>to curb
  the vehemence of his feelings. No one felt the dagger of the
  reticent stabber more quickly and sensitively than he. Invisible
  though the libeller might be, Nelson knew he was there. He could
  not hear the voice, but he felt the sinister action.</p>

  <p>Making full allowance for what might be put down to
  imagination, there is still an abundance of material to justify
  the belief that the first naval authority of his time was the
  target of snobs, and that, but for his strong personality and the
  fact that he was always ready to fight them in the open, he would
  have been superseded, and a gallant duffer might have taken his
  place, to the detriment of our imperial interests. It is a
  dangerous experiment to put a man into high office if he has not
  the instinct of judging the calibre of other men. This applies to
  every department of life nowadays. Take the Army, the Navy,
  departments of State, commercial or banking offices,
  manufacturing firms, and the making of political appointments.
  The latter is more carelessly dealt with than any other
  department of life. The public are not sufficiently vigilant in
  distinguishing between a mere entertaining rhetorician and a
  wholesome-minded, natural-born statesman. What terrible
  calamities have come to the State through putting men into
  responsible positions they have neither training, wit, nor wisdom
  to fill efficiently! Providence has been most indulgent and
  forbearing when we have got ourselves into a mess by
  wrong-headedness. She generally comes to our aid with an
  undis<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>covered man or a few
  men with the necessary gifts required for getting us out of the
  difficulty in which the Yellow Press gang and their accomplices
  may have involved the country. We know something of how the
  knowledge of these anomalies in public life chafed the eager
  spirit of Nelson, but we can never know the extent of the
  suffering it caused except during the Neapolitan and Sicilian
  days. This lonely soul lived the life of a recluse for months at
  a time. The monotony of the weird song of the sea winds, the
  nerve-tearing, lazy creak of the wooden timbers, the sinuous
  crawling, rolling, or plunging over the most wondrous of God's
  works, invariably produces a sepulchral impression even on the
  most phlegmatic mind, but to the mystically constituted brain of
  Nelson, under all the varied thoughts that came into his brain
  during the days and nights of watching and searching for those
  people he termed "the pests of the human race," it must have been
  one long heartache. No wonder that he lets fly at the Admiralty
  in some of his most passionate love-messages to the seductive
  Emma. His dreary life, without any exciting incident except the
  carrying away of sails or spars, and the irritation of not being
  able to get what he regarded as life or death requests carried
  into effect owing to the slothfulness or incompetent indifference
  of the Admiralty was continual agony to him. He writes in one of
  his dispatches to the Admiralty: "Were I to die this moment,
  <i>want of frigates</i> would be found stamped on my heart. No
  words of mine," he continues, "can express what I <a name=
  "Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>have suffered and am suffering for
  want of them."</p>

  <p>No person could write such an unconsciously comic lament to a
  department supposed to be administered with proficiency unless he
  were borne down by a deep sense of its appalling incompetency. It
  is quite likely that the recipients of the burning phrases
  regarded them in the light of a joke, but they were very real to
  the wearied soul of the man who wrote them. I do not find any
  instances of conscious humour in any of Nelson's letters or
  utterances. It is really their lack of humour that is humorous.
  He always appears to be in sombre earnest about affairs that
  matter, and whimsically affected by those that don't. The
  following lines, which are not my own, may be regarded as
  something akin to Nelson's conception of himself. If he had come
  across them, I think he would have said to himself, "Ah! yes,
  these verses describe my mission and me."</p>

  <p>Nelson never attempted to carry out a mere reckless and
  palpably useless feat for the purpose of show. His well-balanced
  genius of caution and accurate judgment was the guiding instinct
  <a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>in his terrific thrusts
  which mauled the enemy out of action at the Nile, St. Vincent,
  Copenhagen, and Trafalgar, and enthralled the world with new
  conceptions of naval warfare. He met with bitter disappointments
  in his search for the illusive French fleet, which wore him, as
  he says, to a skeleton, but never once was he shaken in his
  vigorous belief that he would catch and annihilate them in the
  end. They cleverly crept out of Toulon, with the intention, it is
  said, of going to Egypt. Villeneuve was no fool at evasive
  tactics. His plan was practically unerring, and threw Nelson
  completely off the scent and kept him scouring the seas in search
  of the bird that had flown weeks before. Once the scent is lost,
  it takes a long time to pick it up. Villeneuve no doubt argued
  that it was not his purpose to give the British Admiral an
  opportunity of fighting just then. He had other fish to fry, and
  if he wished to get away clear from Toulon and evade Nelson's
  ships, he must first of all delude him by sending a few ships out
  to mislead the enemy's watchdogs or drive them off; if that
  succeeded (which it did not), he would then wait for a strong
  fair wind that would assure him of a speed that would outdistance
  and take him out of sight of the British squadron, and make sure
  that no clue to his destination was left. The wind was strong
  NNW.; the French fleet were carrying a heavy press of canvas and
  steering SSW. The British ships that were following concluded
  that they were out for important mischief, and returned to convey
  the news to Nelson, who quickly got <a name="Page_190" id=
  "Page_190"></a>under weigh and followed them. Meanwhile,
  Villeneuve's squadron, after getting from under the shelter of
  the land into the open sea, lost some of their spars and sails,
  and one vessel, it is recorded, was dismasted, which means, in
  seafaring interpretation, that all her masts were carried away;
  as she succeeded, however, in getting into Ajaccio, she can only
  have lost her royal topgallant, and possibly a topmast or two. If
  her lower masts had been carried away, she could not have got
  into refuge without assistance, and the rest of the fleet
  apparently had enough to do in looking after themselves, as they
  lost spars and sails too, and became somewhat scattered, but all
  appear to have got safely into Toulon again to refit and repair
  the damage done by the heavy gale they encountered.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Nelson, in dismay at losing touch with them,
  searched every nook and cranny in the Tyrrhenian Sea, and making
  sure that none of them were in hiding and that the sea was clear,
  he proceeded to act on his fixed opinion that their objective
  must be Egypt. So to Egypt he went, and the bitter disappointment
  at not finding them stunned his imagination, so sure had he been
  that his well-considered judgment was a thing to which he might
  pin his faith, and that his lust for conflict with the "pests of
  the human race" could not escape being realized in the vicinity
  of his great victory at the battle of the Nile. His grievance
  against Villeneuve for cheating him out of what he believed would
  result in the annihilation of the French Power for mischief
  <a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>on the seas brought forth
  expressions of deadly contempt for such astute, sneaking habits!
  But the Emperor was as much dissatisfied with the performances of
  his admirals as Nelson was, though in a different way. Napoleon,
  on the authority of the French historian, M. Thiers, was
  imperially displeased. He asks "what is to be done with admirals
  who allow their spirits to sink <i>into their boots</i> (italics
  are the author's) and fly for refuge as soon as they receive
  damage. All the captains ought to have had sealed orders to meet
  at the Canary Islands. The damages should have been repaired
  <i>en route</i>. A few topmasts carried away and other casualties
  in a gale of wind are everyday occurrences. The great evil of our
  Navy is that the men who command it are unused to all the risks
  of command." This indictment is to a large extent deserved, and
  had his fleet been out in the Atlantic or outside the limits of
  the vigilance of Nelson's ships, the putting back to Toulon or
  anywhere to refit the topmasts, sails, or rigging would have been
  highly reprehensible. But in any case, I question whether the
  British would have shown the white feather or lack of resource
  under any circumstances. On a man-of-war they were supposed to
  have refits of everything, and men, properly qualified, in large
  numbers to carry out any prodigious feat. On the other hand, the
  British have always excelled in their nautical ability to guard
  against deficiency in outfit, which was not overtested unless
  there were sufficient cause to demand such a risk. This applies
  especially to the sailing <a name="Page_192" id=
  "Page_192"></a>war vessels in Nelson's time. I think there can be
  no question that the French vessels were both badly officered and
  manned with incapable sailors and that the damage which led them
  back to Toulon was caused by bad judgment in seamanship. What
  they called a severe gale would have been regarded by an
  Australian clipper or Western Ocean packet-ship in the writer's
  early days as a hard whole-sail breeze, perhaps with the kites
  taken in. It was rare that these dashing commanders ever carried
  away a spar, and it was not because they did not carry on, but
  because they knew every trick of the vessel, the wind, and the
  sea. It was a common saying in those days when vessels were being
  overpowered with canvas, "The old lady was talking to us now,"
  i.e. the vessel was asking to have some of the burden of sail
  taken off her. I have known topmasts to be carried away, but it
  generally occurred through some flaw in a bolt or unseen defect
  in the rigging. So much depends on the security of little things.
  But when a catastrophe of this kind occurred on board a British
  merchantman or war vessel the men had both the courage, skill,
  training, and, above all, the matchless instinct to clear away
  the wreck and carry out the refitting in amazingly short time.
  That was because we were then, and are now under new conditions,
  an essentially seafaring race. And it was this superiority that
  gave Nelson such great advantages over the French commanders and
  their officers and seamen, though it must be admitted they were
  fast drilled by the force of circumstances <a name="Page_193" id=
  "Page_193"></a>into foes that were not to be looked upon too
  lightly.</p>

  <p>The elusive tactics of the French admirals then were in a
  lesser degree similar to those practised by the Germans now, if
  it be proper to speak or think of the two services at the same
  time without libelling them. The French were always clean
  fighters, however much they may have been despised by Nelson.
  They were never guilty of cowardly revenge. They would not then,
  or now, send hospital ships to the bottom with their crews and
  their human cargoes of wounded soldiers and nurses. Nor would
  they indiscriminately sink merchant vessels loaded with civilian
  passengers composed of men, women, and children, and leave them
  to drown, as is the inhuman practice of the German submarine
  crews of to-day.</p>

  <p>The French in other days were our bitterest enemies, and we
  were theirs. We charged each other with abominations only
  different from what we and our Allies the French are saying about
  Germany to-day, who was then our ally. We regarded Germany in the
  light of a down-trodden nation who was being crushed and
  mutilated under the relentless heel of the "Corsican Usurper."
  "Such is the rancorous hatred of the French towards us," says
  Collingwood in January 1798, "that I do not think they would make
  peace on any terms, until they have tried this experiment (i.e.
  the invasion of England) on our country; and never was a country
  assailed by so formidable a force"; and he goes on to say, "Men
  of property <a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>must come
  forward both with purse and sword, for the contest must decide
  whether they shall have anything, even a country which they can
  call their own." This is precisely what we are saying about
  Germany with greater reason every day at the present time
  (1918).</p>

  <p>It has been the common practice for German submarine
  commanders to sink at sight British, neutral cargo, and passenger
  vessels, and hospital ships loaded with wounded troops and
  nurses. They have put themselves outside the pale of civilization
  since they forced the whole world into conflict against them.
  Nothing has been too hideous for them to do. They have blown poor
  defenceless fishermen to pieces, and bombarded defenceless
  villages and towns, killing and maiming the inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Nelson's ardent soul must have been wearied with the
  perversity of the "dead foul winds" (as he described his bitter
  fate to Ball) that prevented him from piercing the Straits of
  Gibraltar against the continuous easterly current that runs from
  the Atlantic and spreads far into the Mediterranean with
  malicious fluctuations of velocity. Many a gallant sailing-ship
  commander has been driven to despair in other days by the
  friendly levanter failing them just as they were wellnigh through
  the Gut or had reached the foot of the majestic Rock, when the
  west wind would assert its power over its feebler adversary, and
  unless he was in a position to fetch an anchorage behind the Rock
  or in the bay, their fate was sealed for days, and sometimes
  weeks, in hard beating to <a name="Page_195" id=
  "Page_195"></a>prevent as little ground being lost as possible.
  But ofttimes they were drifted as far back as Cape de Gata in
  spite of daring feats of seamanship in pressing their vessels
  with canvas until every spar, sail, and rope was overstrained. A
  traditional story of sailors of that period was that only a fast
  clipper schooner engaged in the fruit trade and a line-of-battle
  ship which fired her lee guns on every tack was ever known to
  beat through this channel, which mystified the sailors' ideas of
  God. They could not understand how He could have committed such
  an error in planning the universe which so tried the spirits of
  His loyal believers!</p>

  <p>We know how catholic Nelson was in his religious views; and
  his feats of expressive vocabulary, which was the envy of his
  class at the time, became their heritage after he had
  accomplished his splendid results and passed into the shadows.
  Such things as the strength of the adverse sea winds, his
  experience of the capriciousness of the official mind&mdash;a
  capriciousness which might be reflected in the public imagination
  were he not to be wholly successful in getting hold of the French
  fleet, and the indignity of having a man like Sir John Orde put
  over him, all filled his sensitive nature with resentment against
  the ordinances of God and man. His complaints were always
  accompanied with a devotional air and an avowal of supreme
  indifference to what he regarded as the indecent treatment he
  received at the hands of the amateurish bureaucrats at the
  Admiralty. At times they were out of humour <a name="Page_196"
  id="Page_196"></a>with the great chieftain, and perhaps at no
  time did they make him feel their dissatisfaction more than when
  adverse winds, a crazy fleet, and deadly current were eating deep
  into his eager soul at a time when the genius of seamanship was
  unavailing in the effort to get through into the Atlantic in
  pursuit of the French fleet, which his instinct told him was
  speeding towards the West Indies.</p>

  <p>Sir John Orde, who was an aversion to him (as well he might
  be), had seen the French fleet off Cadiz, and failed to procure
  him the information as to their course. Nelson believed, and
  properly believed, that an alert mind would have found a way of
  spying out the enemy's intentions, but Sir John's resource did
  not extend to anything beyond the fear of being attacked and
  overpowered. He obviously was devoid of any of the arts of the
  wily pirate or smuggler. A month after the French had passed
  through the Gut, Nelson got his chance. A change of wind came
  within five hours after a southerly slant brought his ships to
  anchor in Gibraltar bay for water and provisions. He immediately
  gave the signal to heave the anchors up, and proceeded with a
  fair wind which lasted only forty-eight hours. He anchored his
  fleet to the east of Cape St. Vincent, and took on board supplies
  from the transports. He received from different sources
  conflicting accounts as to the objective of the French, but the
  predominating opinion was that they had gone to the West Indies.
  Nelson was in a state of bewilderment, but decided to follow his
  own head, and pinned <a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>his
  faith on the instinct that told him to follow westward "to be
  burnt in effigy if he failed, or Westminster Abbey if he
  succeeded." The adventure was daring, both in point of
  destination and the unequal strength of the relative fleets.
  Nelson had ten ships of the line and three frigates, against
  Villeneuve's eighteen and two new line-of-battle ships.</p>

  <p>But the British Admiral's genius and the superiority of his
  commanders, officers, and men, should they come to battle, would
  more than match Villeneuve's superiority in ships. Nelson, always
  sure of his own powers, could also depend upon the loyalty of men
  of every rank under him. He knew that the terrible spirit which
  shattered and scattered Spanish Philip's armada was an
  inheritance that had grown deep into every fibre of the
  generations of seamen that followed Hawkins and Drake's
  invincibles. When Nelson delivered himself of death-or-glory
  heroics, he did so with the consciousness that <i>he</i> was the
  spirit that enthused masses of other spirits to carry out his
  dominating will.</p>

  <p>On the 14th May, 1805, anchors were picked up and the fleet
  left Lagos Bay under full sail for the West Indies. The
  trade-winds were soon picked up, and every stitch of canvas that
  would catch a breath of wind was spread. The speed ranged from
  six to nine knots, according to the strength of the wind, the
  Admiral taking any available opportunity of conveying to the
  commanders the plan of attack and action should they fall in with
  the Frenchmen. The task of <a name="Page_198" id=
  "Page_198"></a>keeping his own ships together was not easy, as
  some were faster than others, and many had foul bottoms. There
  was much manipulation of yards and sails in order to keep the
  line in order, and Nelson even went out of his way to have a note
  of encouragement and kindness sent aboard the <i>Superb</i>
  (seventy-four guns) for Commander Keats, whose ship had been
  continuously in commission since 1801, and was in bad condition.
  Her sailing qualities were vexatious. Keats implored that he
  should not be disconnected from the main fleet now that the
  hoped-for battle was so near at hand, and being a great favourite
  of Nelson's, he was given permission constantly to carry a press
  of canvas; so the gallant captain carried his studding sails
  while running before the trade-winds, but notwithstanding this
  effort, the lazy, dilapidated <i>Superb</i> could not keep pace
  with the others, even though he was granted the privilege of not
  stopping when the others did. His urgency not to be dropped out
  on this occasion caused him the hard luck of not being at the
  battle of Trafalgar.</p>

  <p>The British fleet arrived at Barbadoes after a twenty-four
  days' passage from Lagos Bay. The French took thirty-four from
  Cadiz to Martinique, so that Nelson had a gain of ten days on
  them, and although his zeal yearned for better results, he had
  performed a feat that was not to be despised, and of which he and
  his comrades in quest of battle were deservedly proud. The French
  had been three weeks in the West Indies, but had done no further
  mischief than to take the Diamond <a name="Page_199" id=
  "Page_199"></a>Rock, a small British possession situated off the
  south end of Martinique. The whereabouts of the elusive enemy was
  uncertain. General Brereton, who commanded the troops at Santa
  Lucia gave information that they had passed on the 28th May,
  steering south. The admirals decided that they had proceeded to
  Tobago and Trinidad. Nelson was doubtful, but was obliged to pay
  some regard to intelligence coming from such a quarter. Accurate
  information received on the 9th June, 1805, confirmed the
  Admiral's doubts as to their objective, for they had passed
  Dominica on the 6th. Brereton had unintentionally misled him.
  Nelson was almost inarticulate with rage, and avowed that by this
  slovenly act the General had prevented him from giving battle
  north of Dominica on the 6th. "What a race I have run after these
  fellows!" he exclaimed, and then, as was his custom, leaning on
  the Power that governs all things, he declares, "but God is just,
  and I may be repaid for all my moments of anxiety." His belief in
  the advent of Divine vengeance on those who doubted or threatened
  the awful supremacy of British dominion on land or sea was
  stimulating to him. Like the Domremy maiden, who saved her king
  and country, he had "visions and heard voices."</p>

  <p>Whatever the mission of the French fleet may have been, there
  was certainly no apparent lust for aggrandizement. We may be
  certain that Napoleon's orders were to carry out vigorous
  bombardments on British possessions, and instead of doing so,
  Villeneuve seems to have been dis<a name="Page_200" id=
  "Page_200"></a>tractedly and aimlessly sailing about, not knowing
  what to do or whither to go. Apparently without any definite
  object, he arrived off Antigua on the 9th June, and had the good
  fortune, whether he sought for it or not, of capturing fourteen
  British merchant vessels; but he would appear to have been quite
  phlegmatic about making the haul. He was more concerned about the
  news the crews were able to give him of Nelson's arrival at
  Barbadoes; not that he was constrained to give him the
  opportunity of measuring strength with his now twenty-six of the
  line, but as a guide to the best means of making his escape; this
  may have been a strategical move of wearing down; or he may have
  been carrying out a concerted plan for leaving Nelson in
  bewilderment and proceeding with all speed to some British
  European point where resistance would be less and success
  assured, since there was no outstanding naval figure, bar
  Collingwood, who could stand up against so powerful a combination
  of ships of the line. It is questionable whether Villeneuve ever
  took this man of great hidden power and foresight into account.
  It was Nelson, his chief, who put terror into the fleet. In any
  case, whatever his plans may have been, the intelligence he
  gleaned from the seized merchant seamen caused him to make
  arrangements to sail from Antigua the next day for Europe. The
  present writer's opinion is that he may have had secret orders
  from Napoleon to make an attack on Ireland, as the Emperor never
  faltered in his view that this was the most pregnable spot in
  <a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>which to hazard an invasion
  and strike a crushing blow at the main artery. He little knew the
  real loyalty of the great mass of Irishmen to their own and to
  the mother-land, and only realized later that his way to England
  was not through Ireland.</p>

  <p>The exit of the French was hard fate for Nelson, who had fired
  his enthusiasm with the hope of a great conflict and a sure
  victory. It was a creeping nightmare to him which was only
  relieved by his resolute opinion that his fame and the terror of
  his name had caused Villeneuve to fly from inevitable
  destruction. The idea of strategy did not enter into his
  calculations. A further consolation to him was that his arrival
  had saved the islands and two hundred ships loaded with sugar
  from being captured, so that the gain was all on his side. So far
  as the West Indies were concerned, the French expedition ended
  not only in a dead loss, but was a humiliating fiasco, unless, as
  I have stated before, it was a preconceived decoy for some other
  purpose. But whether it were strategy or decoy, it taxes one's
  intelligence to conceive why the French fleet did not proceed to
  bombard the British possessions on arrival, then steal into safe
  obscurity and make their way back to European waters. The evasion
  of Nelson's scouts in any case was a matter of adroit cunning.
  Had a man of Nelson's nimble wits and audacious courage commanded
  the enemy's fleet, the islands would have been attacked and left
  in a dilapidated condition. Nelson's opinion was that the Spanish
  portion of the expedition <a name="Page_202" id=
  "Page_202"></a>had gone to Havana, and that the French would make
  for Cadiz or Toulon, the latter he thought most likely, with the
  ultimate object of Egypt. And with this vision floating in his
  mind, he determined to make for the Straits. On the 13th June,
  1805, he sailed from Antigua, and was almost merry at the thought
  of getting close at their heels, and toppling them into ruin
  before they had got into the Mediterranean. He regarded them in
  the light of miserable naval amateurs that could be whacked, even
  with the odds against him. Five days after sailing, one of his
  scout ships brought the news given by a vessel they spoke that
  she had sighted them steering north on the 15th, and as the
  colours of each dying day faded away and brought no French fleet
  in view or intelligence of them, he grew restive and filled with
  apprehension. He had no delusions about the accuracy of his
  perceptions, or the soundness of his judgment, nor the virtue of
  his prudence. Without a disturbing thought he pursued his course
  towards the Mediterranean, and unless intelligence came to him
  that would justify a diversion, no wild fancies would be
  permitted to take possession of him. On the 18th July he sighted
  Cape Spartel, and any sailor will say that no grass had been
  allowed to grow under the bottoms of the ships that made so quick
  a passage. But Nelson was "sorrowful" that no results had
  accrued. Like a strong man who has opinions and carries them
  through to the bitter end, he did not "blame himself." He blew
  off some of the pent-up bitterness of an aching heart by writing
  <a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>to a friend, "But for
  General Brereton's damned information, I would have been living
  or dead, and the greatest man England ever saw, and now I am
  nothing and perhaps would incur censure for misfortunes which may
  happen and have. Oh! General Brereton! General Brereton!"</p>

  <p>This explosion was indicative of bitter disappointment. It is
  these outbursts of devotion to a great burning ideal that give an
  impulse to the world. His anxiety when he made his landfall and
  was informed by scouts sent to meet him that the allied squadrons
  had not been heard of was intense. It was not until then that his
  vigorous mind was smitten with the possibility of the French
  having cheated him by going to Jamaica. Orde had been superseded
  by Collingwood, and was stationed off Cadiz, the purpose of which
  was to watch the entrance to the Mediterranean. Nelson wrote and
  sent him the following letter:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MY DEAR COLLINGWOOD,&mdash;I am, as you may suppose,
    miserable at not falling in with the enemy's fleet; and I am
    almost increased in sorrow in not finding them here. The name
    of General Brereton will not soon be forgot. I must now hope
    that the enemy have not tricked me, and gone to Jamaica; but if
    the account, of which I send you a copy, is correct, it is more
    than probable that they are either gone to the northward, or,
    if bound to the Mediterranean, not yet arrived.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The vivid symptoms of disquietude in this communication to his
  old friend are distinctly pathetic. In parts he is comically
  peevish and decidedly restrained. He mixes his fierce wrath
  <a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>against the hapless General
  Brereton with the generalizing of essentials, and transparently
  holds back the crushing thoughts of misadventure for which he may
  be held responsible by the misanthropic, scurrilous,
  self-assertive experts. His impassive periods were always
  associated with whimsical sensitiveness of being censured if his
  adventures should miscarry. No one knew better than he that a man
  in his position could only be popular if he continued to succeed.
  He had many critics, but always regarded them as inferior to
  himself, and his record justified him. What he secretly quaked at
  and openly defied was a general outburst of human capriciousness.
  There are veiled indications of this in his letter to
  Collingwood, who replied in well-reasoned terms, interwoven with
  that charm of tender sympathy that was so natural to him.</p>

  <p>He says: "I have always had the idea that Ireland was the
  object the French had in view," and that he still believes that
  to be their destination; and then he proceeds to develop his
  reasons, which are a combination of practical, human, and
  technical inferences. His strongest point is one that Nelson did
  not or could not know, though it may be argued that he ought to
  have foreseen; even then it is one expert's judgment against
  another's. Collingwood affirms that the Rochefort squadron, which
  sailed when Villeneuve did in January, returned to Europe on the
  26th May. Collingwood maintains that the West Indian trip was to
  weaken the British force on the European side, and states that
  the return of Rochefort's <a name="Page_205" id=
  "Page_205"></a>squadron confirmed him in this. He is too generous
  to his mortified comrade to detract in any degree from the view
  that, having escaped from the West Indies, they would naturally
  make for Cadiz or the Mediterranean. Here is one of the many wise
  sayings of Napoleon: "In business the worst thing of all is an
  undecided mind"; and this may be applied to any phase of human
  affairs. Nelson can never be accused of indecision. His chase to
  the West Indies was a masterpiece of prescience which saved the
  British possessions, and, but for the clumsy intelligence he
  received, the French would have been a hammered wreck and the
  projected ruse to combine it with the Rochefort squadron off
  Ireland blown sky-high.</p>

  <p>The present generation of critics can only judge by the
  records handed down to them, and after exhaustive study we are
  forced to the opinion that Nelson was right in following
  Villeneuve to the West Indies, nor was he wrong in calculating
  that they were impulsively making their way back to the
  Mediterranean. Consistent with his habit of never claiming the
  privilege of changing his mind, he followed his settled opinion
  and defended his convictions with vehement confidence. He had not
  overlooked Ireland, but his decision came down on the side of
  Cadiz or Toulon, and there it had to rest, and in rather
  ridiculous support of his contention he imputes faulty navigation
  as the cause of taking them out of their course, and finding
  themselves united to the Rochefort squadron off Cape Finisterre.
  The bad-reckoning idea cannot be sustained. The French were no
  match <a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>for the British under
  Nelson's piercing genius as a naval strategist, or in the flashes
  of dazzling enthusiasm with which he led those under his command
  to fight, but it must also be admitted, and has been over and
  over again, that Villeneuve was a skilled seaman who was not
  likely to allow any amateur navigators in his service, and we
  shall see that in the plan of defence this great French Admiral
  showed that he was fertile in naval skill when the time came for
  him to fight for existence against the greatest naval prodigy in
  the world.</p>

  <p>Whatever the reason was that caused Villeneuve not to make for
  the Mediterranean, it certainly cannot be ascribed to lubberly
  navigation, and Nelson should never have tried to sustain his
  perfectly sound belief by seeking refuge in that untenable
  direction. God bless him all the same.</p>

  <p>On his arrival at Gibraltar on the 20th July, 1805, he set
  foot on shore for the first time for two years less ten days.
  This in itself was a great feat of hard endurance for a man who
  had to carry so heavy a burden of continuous physical suffering
  and terrible anxiety. Maddened and depressed often, stumbling
  often, falling often, but despairing never, sorrow and sadness
  briefly encompassed him when fate ordained disappointments. But
  his heart was big with hope that he would accomplish complete
  victory before the sentence of death came, which he never ceased
  to forebode. He was a human force, not a phenomenon. On the 22nd
  July, Sir Robert Calder and Villeneuve fought a drawn or
  indecisive battle. <a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>Only two
  Spanish ships of the line were taken. The French Admiral put into
  Vigo on the 28th, and managed to slip out, and arrived at Ferrol
  without being intercepted. Nelson provisioned his ships for four
  months, and sailed from Tetuan on the 23rd. On the 25th he passed
  through the Straits with the intention of going to Ferrol,
  Ireland, or Ushant, whichever his information and judgment told
  him was the best course to pursue. He experienced strong
  northerly winds along the Portuguese coast, which prevented him
  from joining the Channel Fleet off Ushant until August 16th, and
  as no news had been received of the French being in the Bay of
  Biscay or off the Irish coast, he was ordered by Cornwallis to
  Portsmouth, and anchored at Spithead on the 18th August. His
  reception from every quarter was most cordial, as well it might
  be! But the thought of how much greater it would have been if he
  had not been misguided and thereby deprived of coming to grips
  with the foe that was still at large and outwitting every device
  of bringing them to close quarters, had eaten like a canker into
  his troubled mind. In his letters to friends (Davison and others)
  his postscripts were for ever being embellished with reference to
  it and the darting of an incidental "damn" to General Brereton,
  who, it is contended, was himself deceived. But Nelson, generous
  as, he always was to people who were encompassed by misfortune,
  never would allow that Brereton had any right to allow himself to
  be misled. One wonders how the immortal General Brereton worked
  it out. In any case, <a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>the
  great Admiral has given him a place in history by his side.</p>

  <p>Nelson first heard of Sir Robert Calder's scrap from the
  Ushant squadron, and was strong in sympathy and defence against
  the unworthy public attacks made on the Admiral for not
  succeeding as he would. In writing to Fremantle about Calder, he
  says, amongst other things: "I should have fought the enemy, so
  did my friend Calder; I only wish to stand upon my own merits,
  and not by comparison, one way or the other upon the conduct of a
  brother officer," etc. This rebuke to a public who were treating
  his brother officer ungenerously may be summarized thus: "I want
  none of your praises at the expense of this gallant officer, who
  is serving his country surrounded with complex dangers that you
  are ignorant of, and therefore it is indecent of you to judge by
  comparing him with me or any one else. I want none of your
  praises at his expense."</p>

  <p>This is only one of the noble traits in Nelson's character,
  and is the secret why he unconsciously endeared himself to
  everybody. His comical vanity and apparent egotism is
  overshadowed by human touches such as this worthy intervention on
  behalf of Sir Robert Calder, who he had reason to know was not
  professionally well disposed to him. But his defence of Calder
  did not close with Fremantle, for in a letter to his brother soon
  after he got home he says, "We must now talk of Sir Robert
  Calder. I might not have done so much with my small force. If I
  had fallen in with them, you might probably have been a <a name=
  "Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>lord before I wished; for I know
  they meant to make a dead set at the <i>Victory</i>." These lines
  alone show how reverently the writer adhered to the brotherly tie
  of the profession. He seems to say, "Let us have no more talk of
  puerilities. I am the stronger. I have recently been frustrated
  myself. I know this business better than Calder's traducers do,
  and therefore conceive it my duty to defend him. He also has
  rendered great services to his country."</p>

  <p>When it was known that he had arrived in England, he was
  overwhelmed with generous tokens of affection and gratitude from
  all classes. Thousands crowded into Portsmouth to see him land,
  and the cheering was long and lusty. In London the mob, drunk
  with excitement, struggled to get sight of him, many crushing
  their way so that they might shake him by the hand or even touch
  him. Lord Minto said he met him in Piccadilly, took him by the
  arm, and was mobbed also. He goes on to say: "It is really quite
  affecting to see the wonder, admiration, and love for him from
  gentle and simple the moment he is seen," and concludes by
  stating that it is beyond anything represented in a play or in a
  poem of fame.</p>

  <p>Commercial men everywhere passed resolutions of gratitude for
  the protection he had secured in their different interests. The
  West India merchants sent a deputation to express their
  never-to-be-forgotten thanks, and would have loaded him with
  material tokens of their goodwill had it been proper to do so. He
  lost no time in <a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>getting to
  Merton, which was the thought and happiness of his soul. He was
  invited here, there, and everywhere, and always replied that he
  could not accept, as all his family were with him. Lord Minto,
  who was a devoted friend, visited him on the 15th August, and
  says that he "found him in the act of sitting down to dinner with
  his brother the Dean, his wife, and their children, and the
  children of a sister. Lady Hamilton was at the head of the table,
  and her mother, Mrs. Cadogan, at the bottom. His welcome was
  hearty. Nelson looked well and was full of spirits. Lady
  Hamilton," he continues, "had improved, and had added to the
  house and place extremely well, without his knowing she was doing
  it. She is a clever being, after all the passion is as hot as
  ever."</p>

  <p>These glad moments of keen rapture, which filled Nelson with a
  sort of mystic joy, were soon to be cut short. Swiftly the sweet
  days were passing away, and the sombre parting from "dear Merton
  and loving hearts for evermore" was drawing near. In his
  day-dreams he saw more fame, more professional gladness, more
  triumph. He saw, too, as he pensively walked in his garden, the
  grave nearly ready to receive him and the day of his glory and
  brightness coming. These were his abiding premonitions, which
  were jerked out to his close friends, and even during his last
  sojourn at Merton, to those he loved so well. Even at this
  distance of time we cannot think with composure of this
  many-sided man declaring sadly that death had no terrors for him,
  <a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>and that he was ready to
  face the last great problem in the conflict which was to break
  the power at sea of the great conqueror on land. He had not been
  long in the plenitude of domestic bliss before Captain Blackwood
  called one morning at five o'clock with dispatches sent by
  Collingwood for the Admiralty. Nelson was already dressed, and in
  his quick penetrating way told him that "he was certain he
  brought news of the combined enemy's fleet," and, without waiting
  for an answer, exclaimed, "I think I shall have to beat them,"
  and subsequently added, "Depend upon it, Blackwood, I shall yet
  give M. Villeneuve a drubbing." The latter had slipped out of
  Ferrol and elusively made his way to Cadiz without having been
  seen by the British. Nelson's services were again requested by
  the Government, and eagerly given, though he declared that he was
  in need of more rest and that he had done enough. But these were
  mere transient observations, probably to impress those with whom
  he talked or to whom he wrote with the importance of his position
  with the Cabinet, who now regarded him as indispensable, which
  was in reality quite true, though he was none the less proud of
  the high confidence they had in him and the popular approval
  their selection had with the public. The phrase "Let the man
  trudge who has lost his budget" was mere bluff. He wanted to go
  all the time, and would have felt himself grievously insulted had
  the Government regarded even his health unequal to so gigantic a
  task or suggested that a better man could be found.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>Nelson, always hungering
  for approbation, slyly hinted that it would be a risky thing for
  the Government's existence had they not placed full control of
  the fleet in his hands, so popular a hold had he on all classes
  of naval men and the entire public imagination. Nelson was often
  exasperated by the dull ignorance of the Government as to how
  naval policy should be conducted, and by their combined
  irresolution and impatience at critical periods, when success
  depended upon his having a free hand to act as circumstances
  arose. Of course, he took a free hand and never failed to
  succeed. But he frequently complained that he laid himself open
  to be shot or degraded by doing so, and it is only one man in a
  century that is possessed of sufficient audacity to ignore the
  authority over him and with supreme skill to carry out his own
  plans. In support of the views that were bound to be held by a
  man of Nelson's calibre as to the qualities of some of his
  superiors in the Government who wished to impose upon him a
  definite line of action, we quote a letter written to Captain
  Keats, which has appeared in almost every life of Nelson that has
  been published. It is pregnant with subtle contemptuous remarks
  which may be applied to the naval administration of the present
  time (March 1918). It is not only a danger, but a crime, in the
  process of any war, but especially during the present, to gamble
  with the safety of the nation by neglecting to have at the head
  of a great department a man who has not only a genius for
  administrative initiative in this particular sphere but an
  unerring <a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>instinct to guide
  and grapple with its everyday perplexities. It is colossal
  aptitude, not mechanicalness, that is needed.</p>

  <p>But here is the matchless sailor's opinion of the situation in
  this respect in his day: "The Secretary of State (Lord
  Castlereagh), which is a man who has only sat one day in his
  office, and, of course, knows but little of what is passed, and
  indeed the Prime Minister, Pitt, were all full of the enemy's
  fleet, and as I am now set up for a conjurer, and God knows they
  will very soon find out I am far from being one, I was asked my
  opinion, against my inclination, for if I make one wrong guess
  the charm will be broken; but this I ventured without any fear,
  that if Calder got close alongside their twenty-seven or
  twenty-eight sail, that by the time the enemy had beaten our
  fleet soundly, they would do us no harm this year."</p>

  <p>Though Nelson did not and could not say all that was in his
  mind, we can read between the lines that he had no use for the
  theories of ministers, and would obviously have liked to have
  said in brutal English, "Here I am, gentlemen, do not encumber me
  with your departmental jargon of palpable nothings. You continue
  to trust in Providence; give me your untrammelled instructions as
  to what you wish me to do, and leave the rest to me." Here is
  another letter from Lord Radstock: "No official news have been
  received from Lord Nelson since July 27th. He then hinted that he
  might go to Ireland; nevertheless, we have no tidings of him on
  that coast. <a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>I confess I
  begin to be fearful that he has worried his mind up to that
  pitch, that he cannot bear the idea of showing himself again to
  the world until he shall have struck some blow, and that it is
  this hope that is now making him run about, half frantic, in
  quest of adventure. That such unparalleled perseverance and true
  valour should thus evaporate in air is truly melancholy."</p>

  <p>What balderdash to write about a man ablaze with reasoning
  energy and genius of the highest order! The noble Lord is
  disillusioned on his arrival in Portsmouth, and writes again in
  another a strain: "He (Nelson) was received in town almost as a
  conqueror, and was followed round by the people with huzzas. So
  much for a great and good name most nobly and deservedly
  acquired"! The previous letter indicates the mind of a fireside
  colossus, and shows how dangerously a big man's reputation may be
  at the mercy of a little one or a coterie of them. One can only
  describe them as portentous human snipes, whose aggressive
  mediocrity spreads like an attack of infectious fever, until the
  awful will of Heaven, for the safety of humanity, lays hands on
  their power for mischief. The popularity of a public servant is
  always in danger of a tragical end if he lives long enough. One
  slip of inevitable misfortune seals his doom when the pendulum
  swings against him. And it is generally brought by a rhetorical
  smiling Judas who can sway a capricious public. The more
  distinguished a popular man may be, the greater is the danger
  that the fame and reputation for which he strove may be swiftly
  laid low.</p>

  <p>The gallant and strenuous patriot whose fame will pass on to
  distant ages is now summoned to fulfil his destiny. He owns that
  he needs one more rest, but his "duty was to go forth." He
  "expected to lay his weary bones quiet for the winter," but he is
  "proud of the call," and all gallant hearts were proud to own him
  as their chieftain. He bargains for one of the <i>Victory's</i>
  anchors to be at the bows before he arrives at Portsmouth. All
  his belongings are sent off on the 5th October. Lord Barham, an
  aged man of eighty-two years, asks him with pride to select his
  own officers. "Choose yourself, my Lord. The same spirit actuates
  the whole profession; you cannot choose wrong." He told the
  Cabinet what was wanted in the "annihilation of the enemy," and
  that "only numbers could annihilate"&mdash;presumably ships and
  men. The conversations he had with the authorities and the spoken
  words and letters sent to his friends are ablaze with inspiring,
  sharp-cut sentences. But those who had intimate knowledge of his
  tender side felt he was ill at ease, and not free from heartache
  at the prospect of parting. I think, in connection with
  <i>this</i>, Lady Hamilton's version of what passed between them
  when he was walking the "<a name="Page_216" id=
  "Page_216"></a>quarterdeck" in his garden may be true in
  substance, as he was still madly in love with her, and she knew
  how to wheedle him into a conversation and to use words that
  might serve a useful purpose if need be. Nor were her scruples so
  delicate as to prevent suitable additions being made to suit any
  emergency that might occur.</p>

  <p>Her account is that she saw he was looking downcast, and she
  told him so. He smiled, and then said, "No, I am as happy as
  possible"; he was surrounded by his family, his health was better
  since he had "been on shore, and he would not give sixpence to
  call the King his uncle." She replied that she did not believe
  him, that she knew he was longing to get at the combined fleets,
  that he considered them as his property, that he would be
  miserable if any man but himself did the business, and that he
  ought to have them as the price and reward of his two years' long
  watching and his hard chase. "Nelson," said she, "however we may
  lament your absence, offer your services; they will be accepted,
  and you will gain a quiet heart by it; you will have a glorious
  victory, and then you may return here and be happy." He looked at
  her with tears in his eyes, and said, "Brave Emma! Good Emma! If
  there were more Emmas, there would be more Nelsons."</p>

  <p>It puts a heavy strain upon our credulity to believe that such
  words were ever used by Nelson, even though we know that he was
  so hopelessly enamoured of this untamed creature. That he
  <a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>needed to be coaxed into
  offering his services or that he ever demurred at accepting the
  distinguished honours the Government had conferred upon him may
  be regarded as one of Emma's efforts at triumphant
  self-glorification and easy dramatic fibbing. She was ever
  striving to thrust her patriotic ardour forward in some vulgar
  form or other, and this occasion gave her a chance that could not
  be resisted. The day before Nelson's departure for Portsmouth the
  scalding tears flowed from her eyes continuously, she could
  neither eat nor drink, and her lapses into swooning at the table
  were terrible. These performances do not bear out the tale of
  Nelson's spontaneous and gushing outburst in the garden at Merton
  of her bravery and goodness in urging him to "go forth." It is
  possible that her resolution and fortitude could not stand the
  responsibility of pressing him to undertake a task that might be
  fatal to himself and foredoomed to failure. In that case she does
  not bear herself like a heroine, and strengthens the suspicion,
  as we have said, that the story of pleading with Nelson to offer
  his services is an impudent fabrication. Minto says that the
  tears and swooning is a strange picture, and assures him as
  before that nothing can be more pure and ardent than this flame;
  and <i>she</i> might have added that they had in reality
  exchanged souls.</p>

  <p>Napoleon, in conversing on one occasion with his brother
  Lucien about one of his love affairs, said "that Madame
  Walewska's soul was as beautiful as her face." In nearly all his
  letters <a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>to Lady Hamilton,
  Nelson plunged into expressions of love abandonment only
  different from those sent by Napoleon to Josephine when he was
  commander-in-chief of the army of Italy. Neither of these
  extraordinary men could do anything by halves, and we are not
  left in doubt as to the seventh heaven of happiness it would have
  been to the less flowery-worded sailor had he been given the
  least encouragement to pour out his adoration of Emma's goodness
  and beauty. He would have excelled Napoleon's picture of Madame
  Walewska. Amidst the many cares that surrounded these last active
  days, when the dockyards were humming with the work of getting
  his ships refitted so that they might be put quickly into
  commission, he grudged every moment of forced separation from her
  while he was in consultation with the Government and attending to
  his own private preparations, which were sedulously attended to.
  Nothing of moment seems to have been left to chance. Not even the
  coffin that Captain Hallowell had given him was overlooked, for
  he called to give instructions to the people who had it in safe
  keeping, and gave them instructions to have the history of it
  engraved on the lid, as he might want it on his return, which is
  further evidence that he was permanently impressed with the fate
  that awaited him.</p>

  <p>The story of this strange incident of the coffin is this:
  After the battle of the Nile a portion of the <i>Orient's</i>
  mainmast was drifting about, and was picked up by order of
  Captain Hallowell of the <i>Swiftsure</i>, who had it made into a
  coffin. <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>It was handsomely
  finished, and sent to Admiral Nelson with the following
  letter:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have taken the liberty of presenting you a
    coffin made from the mainmast of <i>Orient</i>, that when you
    have finished your military career in this world, you may be
    buried in one of your trophies. But that that period may be far
    distant is the earnest wish of your sincere friend, Benjamin
    Hallowell.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nelson received the weird gift in good spirits, and had it
  placed in his cabin. It was hardly a pleasant piece of furniture
  for his visitors to be confronted with, so he was prevailed upon
  to have it put below until it was required. A few more raging
  battles, and a few more years of momentous anxieties, and the
  prodigious hero was to become its occupant. It seems to have been
  landed and put in charge of a firm of upholsterers.</p>

  <p>Before leaving his home he went to the bedside where his child
  Horatia lay sleeping, and offered up a heart-stirring prayer that
  those who loved him should be a guardian spirit to her, and that
  the God he believed in should have her in His holy keeping. On
  the 13th September, 1805, he writes in his private
  diary:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>At half-past ten, drove from dear, dear Merton, where I left
    all which I hold dear in this world, to go to serve my King and
    country. May the great God whom I adore enable me to fulfil the
    expectations of my country; and if it is His good pleasure that
    I should return, my thanks will never cease being offered up to
    the throne of His mercy. If it is good Providence to cut short
    my days upon earth, I bow with the greatest submission, relying
    that He will protect those so dear to me that I may leave
    behind. His will be done. Amen, Amen.</p>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>No more simple, fervent,
  and touching appeal and resignation to the will of Him Who
  governs all things has been seen in the English language. It is
  quite unorthodox in its construction, and impresses us with the
  idea that he is already realizing the bitterness of death, and
  that he is in the presence of a great Mystery, speaking to his
  own parting soul. The desire to live is there, but he does not
  ignore the almost unutterable submission of "Thy will be
  done."</p>

  <h3>XIII</h3>

  <p>Nelson joined the <i>Victory</i> at Portsmouth on the morning
  of the 14th September, and met with a great public ovation. He
  tells Captain Hardy, as he was being rowed to the <i>Victory</i>,
  that he had "their huzzas when he landed" (after his prolonged
  period in commission), "but now," he proudly remarked, "I have
  their hearts." His send-off was magnificent. The contagious flow
  of tears, the shouting of blessings, and the fervent petitions
  that the God of battles should give him the victory over the
  enemies of human suffering and liberty were symptoms of
  admiration and gratitude which went hot into his blood as he sat
  in his barge, the object of reverence. And with a calm air of
  conscious power he acknowledged the honour that was showered upon
  him by baring his head and bowing gracefully his thanks. It was
  manifestly his day of paradise, and with the plaudits still
  ringing in his ears the <a name="Page_221" id=
  "Page_221"></a><i>Victory's</i> anchor was weighed on the
  following day, and he sailed from St. Helen's Roads to the great
  conflict and victory for which he panted, and to the doom that
  awaited him.</p>

  <p>He experienced foul winds until he passed Cape Finisterre, and
  on the 28th September he joined the fleet of twenty-nine of the
  line. The 29th September was the anniversary of his forty-seventh
  year. He says: "The reception I met with on joining the fleet
  caused the sweetest sensation of my life. The officers who came
  on board to welcome my return forgot my rank as
  commander-in-chief in the enthusiasm with which they greeted me.
  As soon as these emotions were past, I laid before them the plan
  I had previously arranged for attacking the enemy; and it was not
  only my pleasure to find it generally approved, but clearly
  perceived and understood." In a further communication he explains
  to them the "Nelson touch," and all agree that it must succeed,
  and that he is surrounded with friends. Then he adds: "Some may
  be Judas's, but the majority are certainly pleased at the
  prospect of my commanding them."</p>

  <p>These are joyous days for him, which are marked by the absence
  of any recorded misgivings. His mind is full of making
  preparations in every detail to cope with the advent of
  Villeneuve from Cadiz and for the plan of attack, of which a long
  memorandum was circulated to the fleet. He had planned the form
  of attack at Trafalgar during his stay at home, and some time
  before leaving Merton he confided it to Lord Sidmouth. He
  <a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>told him "that Rodney broke
  the enemy's line in one place, and that <i>he</i> would break it
  in two." One of the Nelson "touches" was to "close with a
  Frenchman, and to out-manoeuvre a Russian," and this method of
  terrific onslaught was to be one of the devices that he had in
  store for the French at Trafalgar, and which ended fatally for
  himself. But it gave the enemy a staggering blow, from which they
  never recovered so long as the action lasted. In the General
  Orders he says: "Captains are to look to their particular line as
  a rallying point, but in case signals cannot be seen or clearly
  understood, <i>no captain can do wrong if he places his ship
  alongside that of an enemy</i>."</p>

  <p>The feeling against Sir Robert Calder for not having beaten or
  forced another battle on the allied fleets in July did not abate.
  The public were out for impeachment, and the Government did
  nothing to discourage it; and when Nelson was on the point of
  leaving England the First Lord instructed him to convey to Calder
  the Government's condemnation of his evident negligence or
  incapacity. They gave him permission to ask for the inquiry, but
  should he not do so, it would be ordered. Nelson wrote to Barham
  that he had delivered the message to Sir Robert, and that it
  would doubtless give his Lordship pleasure to learn that an
  inquiry was just what the Vice-Admiral was anxious to have, and
  that he had already sent a letter by the <i>Nautilus</i> to say
  so, but that he (Nelson) had detained it. Nelson, in his goodness
  of heart, urged Sir Robert <a name="Page_223" id=
  "Page_223"></a>to remain until after the action, the result of
  which would inevitably change the feeling of the Government and
  the public in his favour, and he could then, without any fear,
  demand an inquiry. Sir Robert was so crushed with the charge
  hanging over him, that he insisted on being allowed to proceed to
  England at once, and Nelson, to ease the humiliation and
  suffering he was passing through, sent him off in his ninety-gun
  ship, instead of a frigate. The inquiry was held in due course,
  and judgment given against him. The finding is, in our opinion,
  based more on prejudice than on any fault he committed, and as to
  "committing an error of judgment," it is always difficult to know
  what is an error of judgment in circumstances such as he was
  confronted with. In any case, it is evident that the Government
  were terrified of the effect that public opinion would have on
  themselves if they failed to take steps to appease it. We think
  the Government would have been serving their country better by
  keeping this unfortunate officer in active service when its fleet
  was on the verge of a life-or-death struggle for naval supremacy
  than by dispensing with his services, which they had thought fit
  to retain from July to October. Nelson's attitude was the more
  patriotic and noble, and under such circumstances the verdict,
  however mild, was bound to be given against the man whose heart
  they had broken because they were afraid of public opinion.
  Nelson was a better judge than they. Discreet reprimand, combined
  with a few kindly words of encouragement, was the proper course
  at such <a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>a time, when every
  man and ship was so essential.</p>

  <p>On a previous occasion, when a "seventy-four" had stranded,
  the officer whose skill and efforts had refloated her was told by
  Nelson that he had spoken favourably of him to the Admiralty. The
  officer showed in suitable terms his gratitude, but added that he
  did not regard what he had done as meriting any notice or praise.
  The Admiral pointed out that a battle might easily be lost by the
  absence of a line-of-battle ship. When Nelson conveyed the
  ill-considered and stupid instructions of the Government to Sir
  Robert Calder to return home to be court-martialled, and the
  latter replied that his letter "to do so cut him to the soul and
  that his heart was broken," Nelson was so overcome with sympathy
  for Calder that he sacrificed his own opinions already expressed,
  and also took the risk of bringing upon himself the displeasure
  of the Comptroller of the Navy by giving the unfortunate man
  permission to proceed home in a vessel that would have been so
  valuable an asset to his fleet. This worthy act, had he lived and
  the battle of Trafalgar been drawn or lost, might have laid him
  open to impeachment. Nelson's fine courage and sense of
  proportion when he thought an injustice or undue severity was
  being imposed was never allowed to be trifled with by any
  official, no matter how high or subordinate his position might
  be, and his contempt for men whom he knew were miserable
  cocksparrow amateurs was openly avowed.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>Whatever the
  consequences, he would have sooner lost a victory than have
  gained one by lending himself to an act that was to injure or
  break his brother in arms. Calder left the fleet a few days
  before the action, and when it began Nelson remarked to Hardy,
  "What would poor Sir Robert Calder give to be with us now!" Even
  on the eve of a great encounter the stress of preparation did not
  dim his sympathy for the afflicted man, who, on more than one
  occasion, had allowed envy to rule his conduct towards him. After
  the battle of St. Vincent, for instance, Calder, in conversation
  with Jervis, criticized Nelson's action in departing from the
  plan of attack laid down by the Admiral. Jervis admitted it to be
  a breach, and added "if ever Calder did the same thing under
  similar circumstances, he would forgive him."</p>

  <p>Nelson knew Calder was envious of his growing fame, but this
  did not prevent him from acting as though he had always been a
  loyal friend. On the morning of the 19th October, 1805, the
  signal was passed from ship to ship acting as lookouts to the
  main fleet that the combined fleet were putting to sea, and it
  was soon discovered that their force consisted of eighteen French
  line-of-battle ships, seven large frigates, and two brigs. The
  Spanish numbered fifteen sail of the line. The British had
  twenty-seven sail of the line and four frigates, so that Nelson
  was outnumbered by five of the line, three frigates, and two
  brigs. The whole of the allied fleet did not get clear of the
  port until the 20th. The commander-in-chief <a name="Page_226"
  id="Page_226"></a>was Villeneuve, and his obvious intention was
  to get the Straits open and, by a cunning evasion of the British
  fleet, make a dash through. His elusive tactics had hitherto been
  skilfully performed, but the British Admiral, always on the
  alert, anticipated that an effort would again be made to cheat
  him of the yearning hope of his heart, and had mentally arranged
  how every contingency should be coped with to prevent escape and
  to get to grips with the enemy. "I will give them such a shaking
  as they never before experienced," and at least he was prepared
  to lay down his life in the attempt.</p>

  <p>It is pretty certain that, after all his ships had got into
  the open sea, Villeneuve's intention was to see how the land lay
  as to the British strength, and his manoeuvring indicated that
  instructions had been given to hoodwink the British and slip
  through the Straits of Gibraltar; but seeing that the entrance
  was cut off for the moment, he headed westward, possibly to
  mislead, but always with the intention of getting into the
  Mediterranean. When this information was signalled by Blackwood,
  instructions were sent back to him that the Admiral relied on the
  enemy being kept in sight. Here is a letter to Lady Hamilton,
  dated the 19th October, 1805:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>CADIZ, BEARING E.SE. 50 MILES.</p>

    <p>MY DEAREST BELOVED EMMA: THE DEAR FRIEND OF MY
    BOSOM,&mdash;The signal has been made that the enemy's combined
    fleet are coming out of port. We have very little wind, so that
    I have no hopes of seeing them before to-morrow. May the God of
    battles crown my endeavours with success; at all <a name=
    "Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>events, I will take care that my
    name shall ever be most dear to you and Horatia, both of whom I
    love as much as my own life. And as my last writing before the
    battle will be to you, so I hope in God that I shall live to
    finish my letter after the battle. May Heaven bless you, prays
    your</p>
  </div>

  <p>This was found unsigned on his desk. These are the last lines
  he wrote to the woman he called his "wife in the sight of God."
  There is none of the robust assurance of blazing deeds that he
  has in store for the enemy which characterize some of his earlier
  letters to Emma, nor is there any craving for continued existence
  or for extinction. But who can read this melancholy farewell
  without being impressed with the feeling that there is a subdued
  restraint to avoid uttering his thoughts on inevitable fate and
  eternal sleep, lest it gives anxiety and disheartens the woman he
  loved so well?</p>

  <p>On the same day he wrote an affectionate letter to his
  daughter, which is clearly intended as a supplementary outpouring
  of a full heart to the mother whom he knew would have to read it.
  The tone and wording is what a father might have written to a
  girl of fifteen instead of five. There is a complete absence of
  those dainty, playful touches that would delight a child of her
  age. In reality, it rather points to the idea that it was
  intended not only as a further farewell to mother and child, but
  as an historical epistle and a legacy to Horatia which she would
  read in other days in connection with the great battle in which
  he was to be engaged only a few hours after he had written
  it.<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MY DEAREST ANGEL,&mdash;I was made happy by the pleasure of
    receiving your letter of September the 19th, and I rejoice to
    hear you are so very good a girl, and love my dear Lady
    Hamilton, who most dearly loves you. Give her a kiss for me.
    The combined fleets of the enemy are now reported to be coming
    out of Cadiz; and therefore I answer your letter, my dearest
    Horatia, to mark to you that you are ever uppermost in my
    thoughts. I shall be sure of your prayers for my safety,
    conquest, and speedy return to dear Merton and our dearest good
    Lady Hamilton.</p>

    <p>Receive, my dearest Horatia, the affectionate blessing of
    your Father,</p>

    <p>NELSON AND BRONTE.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The importunities of Horatia's mother were continuously being
  forced upon Nelson in one way or another, but he seems to have
  stood firm, in an apologetic way, to the instructions laid down
  by himself, that no women were to go to sea aboard his ship; for,
  having been a party to the embargo, it would have been impossible
  for him to make her an exception. He anticipates, as her other
  lovers had done, that she can be very angry, like Horatia, when
  she cannot have her own way, but he soothingly says that he knows
  his own dear Emma, if she applies her reason, will see that he is
  right. He playfully adds an addendum that "Horatia is like her
  mother, she will have her own way, or kick up the devil of a
  dust." He reminds Emma that she is a "sharer of his glory," which
  settles the question of her being allowed to sail with him, and
  from encountering the heavy gales and liquid hills that are
  experienced off Toulon week after week. He warns the lady that it
  would kill her and himself to witness it. Emma was too devoted to
  all the <a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>pleasures ashore to
  risk losing her life in any such uncomfortable fashion at sea, so
  the project was abandoned, if it was ever seriously
  contemplated.</p>

  <p>This astute actress knew where to touch Nelson's weak spot,
  and that it would send him into a frenzy of love to think of her
  yearning to be beside him. She would know that the rules of the
  Service prohibited, except under special circumstances, even the
  highest in rank from having their wives sail with them, and that
  the rule would apply more rigidly to herself, who was not
  Nelson's wife. She knew, in fact, that her request would flatter
  him, and that she would be compensated by receiving a whirlwind
  of devotion in reply. After the Gulf of Lyons days, no further
  request appears to have been made of that kind.</p>

  <p>The combined fleets had been dodging each other on the 20th,
  light westerly winds and calms prevailing. At daylight on the
  21st the belligerent fleets were within twelve miles of each
  other. Nelson was on deck early, and at 7.40 a.m. made the signal
  "To form the order of sailing," and "To prepare for battle." Then
  the signal was made to "Bear up," the <i>Victory</i> and <i>Royal
  Sovereign</i> leading the way in two lines; Nelson took the
  weather line with his ships, and the other division followed, but
  the wind being light, many had barely steerage way. Fourteen
  vessels followed Collingwood, who was to attack the enemy's rear,
  while Nelson slashed into the van and centre. Villeneuve, seeing
  by the British formation that his number was up and that he would
  have to give battle, manoeuvred to keep <a name="Page_230" id=
  "Page_230"></a>Cadiz open, which was about twenty miles NE. of
  him, but the wind, being light, made it as difficult for the
  French Commander-in-Chief to carry out the disposition as it was
  for the quick-witted British Commander to prevent it. Hence the
  development was a lazy process, and prevented, as varying
  circumstances always do, any rigid plan being adhered to. Had
  there been a fresh breeze before the battle commenced, the
  chances are that the French would have secured a position that
  would have enabled more of the crippled ships to get into Cadiz,
  but even this is doubtful, as only a fluke of wind could have
  saved them from the strategy of the British Commander-in-Chief
  before the fighting began. Between eleven and twelve o'clock on
  the 21st October every humanly possible, detailed arrangement had
  been completed. Each captain knew that, so far as it was
  possible, he was to follow where his admiral and vice-admiral
  led. The spirits of all those who manned the fleet were high of
  hope, and the inspiring spirit said he could do no more.</p>

  <p>Nelson then went to his cabin and on his knees wrote a prayer
  that throbbed and will continue to throb through the universe. It
  exhales the spirit of bravery, and triumphant assurance of the
  eternal justice of the cause for which he is about to sacrifice
  himself, for a sombre document it is; but the soul that is in it
  is imperishable, and who can peruse it without vividly picturing
  the writer kneeling before the Omnipotent, pleading for his
  country's cause, and offering himself piously as a willing
  sacrifice!<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>May the great God, whom I worship, grant to my country, and
    for the benefit of Europe in general, a great and glorious
    victory, and may no misconduct in any one tarnish it; and may
    humanity, after victory, be the predominant feature in the
    British fleet. For myself individually, I commit my life to Him
    that made me; and may His blessing alight on my endeavours for
    serving my country faithfully. To Him I resign myself and the
    just cause which is entrusted to me to defend. Amen, Amen,
    Amen.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Then, as though apprehension of the inevitable passing was
  growing, the thought of the woman who is the mother of his child,
  and for whom he had an unquenchable love, blinds him to all sense
  of propriety. It puts a severe strain on our imagination to
  realize how a man could composedly write such a request on the
  verge of the greatest naval conflict in history. It is dated
  "21st of October, 1805, in sight of the combined fleets of France
  and Spain, distant ten miles":&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Whereas the eminent services of Emma Hamilton, widow of the
    Right Honourable Sir William Hamilton, have been of the very
    greatest service to my King and country to my knowledge,
    without ever receiving any reward from either our King and
    country; First, that she obtained the King of Spain's letter,
    in 1796, to his brother, the King of Naples, acquainting him of
    his intention to declare war against England, from which letter
    the Ministry sent our orders to the then Sir John Jervis, to
    strike a stroke, if opportunity offered, against either the
    arsenals of Spain or her fleets. That neither of these was done
    is not the fault of Lady Hamilton; the opportunity might have
    been offered. Secondly: The British fleet under my command
    could never have returned the second time to Egypt, had not
    Lady Hamilton's influence with the Queen of Naples caused
    letters to be wrote to the Governor of Syracuse, that he was to
    encourage the fleets being supplied with everything, should
    they put into any port in Sicily. We put into Syracuse,
    received every supply; went to Egypt, and destroyed the French
    fleet. Could I have <a name="Page_232" id=
    "Page_232"></a>rewarded these services, I would not now call
    upon my country; but as that has not been in my power, I leave
    Emma, Lady Hamilton, therefore a legacy to my King and country,
    that they will give her an ample provision to maintain her rank
    in life. I also leave to the beneficence of my country my
    adopted daughter, Horatia Nelson Thompson; and I desire she
    will use in future the name of Nelson only. These are the only
    favours I ask of my King and country at this moment when I am
    going to fight their battle. May God bless my King and country,
    and all those I hold dear! My relations, it is needless to
    mention, they will, of course, be amply provided for.</p>

  <p>It is of little importance whether this codicil was written at
  the same time as the prayer or a couple of hours before; that
  neither adds to nor detracts from the object of it. No definite
  opinion of the time is given. Blackwood and Hardy, as witnesses,
  would know. In any case it is an extraordinary document, and
  indicates unusual mental control of which few human beings are
  possessed. His mind must have been saturated with thoughts of the
  woman when the great battle was within a few minutes of
  commencing. Early in the morning, when he was walking the poop
  and cabin fixings and odds and ends were being removed, he gave
  stern instructions to "take care of his guardian angel," meaning
  her portrait, which he regarded in the light of a mascot to him.
  He also wore a miniature of her next his heart. Unless Captain
  Hardy and Captain Blackwood and others to whom he confided his
  love potions <a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>were different
  from the hearty, unconventional seamen of the writer's early
  sea-life, a banquet of interesting epithets could have been left
  to us which might have shocked the severely decorous portion of a
  public who assume a monopoly of inherent grace but do not
  understand the delightful simple dialect of the old-time
  sailor-men.</p>

  <p>There can be small doubt that Nelson's comrades had many a
  joke in private about his weird and to them unnecessarily
  troublesome love wailings, which would be all the more irksome
  when they and he had serious business in hand. Poor Sir Thomas
  Troubridge appears to have been the only one to have dealt
  frankly with him about carrying his infatuation to such
  lengths&mdash;especially at a time when the public service was in
  need of his undivided attention&mdash;and Nelson never had a
  kindly feeling towards him afterwards. This gallant officer and
  loyal friend was in command of the <i>Blenheim</i> (seventy-four
  guns) when she and the <i>Java</i> (twenty-three guns) foundered
  with all hands near the island of Rodriguez, in the East Indies,
  on the 1st February, 1807. Nelson harboured a childish bitterness
  against Admiral Troubridge because of his plain speaking, and
  especially after the latter was appointed a Lord of the
  Admiralty. He always believed the "hidden hand" to be that of his
  former friend, to whom he delighted at one time to give the term
  "Nonpareil." In a letter to a friend he says: "I have a sharp
  eye, and almost think I can see it. No, poor fellow," he
  continues, "I hope I do him injustice; he surely <a name=
  "Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>cannot forget my kindness to him,"
  He boasts of how he spoke to St. Vincent, the former "Nonpareil."
  In another eloquent passage he complains that Troubridge refuses
  to endorse his recommendations of officers for promotion, that he
  has been so rebuffed that his spirits are broken and the great
  Troubridge has cowed him (this, of course, in derision), and if
  he asked for anything more he would not get it. He would never
  forget it. No wonder he was not well. The Admiralty are "beasts"
  for not allowing him to come to London, which would only deprive
  him of a few days' comfort and happiness, and they have his
  hearty prayers. He continues in the same ludicrous strain, "I
  have a letter from Troubridge urging me to wear flannel shirts,
  as though he cared for me. He hopes that I shall go and have
  walks ashore, as the weather is now fine." "I suppose he is
  laughing at me, but never mind." He suffers from sea-sickness and
  toothache, and "none of them care a damn about my sufferings,"
  and so on. These misdirected outbursts of feverish antipathy to
  poor Troubridge were frequent, and always inconceivably comical
  as well as distressingly peevish. But behind it all there was a
  consciousness of unequalled power which every one who knew him
  recognized, and they therefore patiently bore with his
  weaknesses, trying as they sometimes were.</p>

  <p>Lord St. Vincent believed, and stated to Nelson, that the only
  other man who possessed the same power of infusing into others
  the same spirit as his own was Troubridge, and no doubt this
  <a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>innocent praise of a noble
  and gallant sailor rankled in Nelson's mind, and was the
  beginning of the jealousy that grew into hate. He could not brook
  any one being put on an equality with himself, and he clung
  tenaciously, though generously, to this idea of authority and
  superiority when he requested in his last dying gasp that he
  should not be superseded.</p>

  <p>After signing what is called the codicil to his will, Captains
  Hardy and Blackwood joined him on the poop to receive his
  instructions. He was calmly absorbed with the enemy's plan of
  defence and his own of attack. He asked Blackwood what he would
  consider a victory, and the latter replied, "Considering the
  disposition of both fleets, he thought fourteen captures would be
  a fine result." Nelson said he would not be satisfied with less
  than twenty, and that nothing short of annihilation was his
  object. Soon afterwards he gave orders to Mr. Pasco to make the
  memorable signal that</p>

  <p>ENGLAND EXPECTS EVERY MAN TO DO HIS DUTY,</p>

  <p>which sent a thrill of fiery enthusiasm throughout the whole
  fleet. Then the signal for "Close action" went up, and the
  cheering was renewed, which created a remarkable effect.
  Collingwood, whose attention was wholly on a Spanish three-decker
  that he had selected to engage, is reported to have been
  irritated, and spontaneously expressed the wish that "Nelson
  would cease signalling, as they all knew what to do."</p>

  </div>

  <p><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>At noon the French ship,
  the <i>Fougeux</i>, fired the first shot of the battle. The
  belligerent admirals saluted in the good old pious style, like
  professional boxers shaking hands before the attempt to knock
  each other out, and in a few more minutes were engaged in deadly
  conflict, hurling death at each other. Nelson, in his courageous
  melancholy way, confident of his own powers and trusting
  reverently in the continuance of the lavish bounty of God,
  resigned his fate to Him who had given him the opportunity of
  doing his duty. The conspicuous splendour of the decorations
  which he wore on the breast of his admiral's frocker was
  apprehensively looked upon by his comrades, who loved him with
  touching loyalty. They muttered their disappointment to each
  other, but shrank from hurting his feelings by warning him of the
  danger of the sharpshooters, to whom he would be a target,
  remembering how he had sharply replied to some anxious soul who
  on a previous occasion had cautioned him with regard to his
  prominent appearance, "that in honour he had gained his orders,
  and in honour he would die with them."</p>

  <p>The battle quickly developed into a carnage. The
  <i>Bucentaure</i> had found her range soon after twelve o'clock,
  when some of the shots went over the <i>Victory</i>. Blackwood
  was at this time ordered to rejoin his ship. He shook hands with
  his chief, and in some brief parting words expressed the "hope
  that he would soon return to the <i>Victory</i> to find him well
  and in possession of twenty prizes"; and Nelson is reported to
  have calmly <a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>answered, "God
  bless you, Blackwood, I shall never speak to you again." His
  habit was to refer to death with eager frankness, and as though
  he were in love with it, without in the least showing any lack of
  alertness or detraction from the hazardous objects he had set
  himself to fulfil. His faith in the powerful aid of the
  Omnipotent was as unvarying in his sphere of warfare as was
  Cromwell's when he had the stern realities of human unruliness to
  steady and chastise. Nelson, like the latter, had in his peculiar
  way a deep-rooted awe and fear of God, which must have made him
  oblivious to all other fear. The magnificent fellow never showed
  greater mastery of the science of strategy, nor did he ever scan
  with greater vigilance the manner of carrying out the creation of
  his genius. Collingwood, who was first in the thick of the fight,
  set his heart throbbing with pride and admiration when he
  observed the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> dash through the lines of the
  enemy, spreading devastation and death with unerring judgment.
  "See," said Nelson to Captain Blackwood, "how that noble fellow,
  Collingwood, takes his ship into action!" Then he paused for a
  moment, and continued, "How I envy him!" And as though the
  spirits of the two men were in communion with each other,
  Collingwood, knowing that the Commander-in-Chief's eager eye was
  fixed upon him in fond admiration, called out to the flag-captain
  near him, "Rotherham, what would Nelson give to be here?"</p>

  <p>One of those fine human touches of brotherhood <a name=
  "Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>which Nelson knew so well how to
  handle with his faultless tact had occurred the day before.
  Collingwood and some officers paid a visit to the <i>Victory</i>
  for the purpose of receiving any instructions he might have to
  give. Nelson asked Collingwood where his captain was, and when he
  replied that they were not on friendly terms, Nelson sharply
  answered, "Not on good terms," and forthwith gave orders for a
  boat to be sent for Rotherham; and when he came aboard he took
  him to Collingwood and said, "Look! there is the enemy, shake
  hands," and they renewed their friendship by gratefully carrying
  out his wishes. But for this, perhaps we should have been cheated
  of knowing the charming anecdote, which denotes the veneration
  the two old friends had for each other.</p>

  <p>There is no need to make any apology for this digression, for
  it is to record one more of the many acts of wisdom and
  tenderness that were so natural to this man of massive
  understanding. The incalculable results that he was destined to
  accomplish may well be allowed to obscure any human weakness that
  sadly beset him.</p>

  <p>Nelson, with blithe courage, sailed right into the centre of
  the French fleet, which in disorder surrounded their
  Commander-in-Chief's ship, his intention being to capture her and
  take Villeneuve prisoner. Never a gun was fired from the
  <i>Victory,</i> although many of her spars, sails, and her
  rigging had suffered severely, until she had rounded as close as
  it was possible under the stern of the <i>Bucentaure</i> and got
  into position. Then a terrific <a name="Page_239" id=
  "Page_239"></a>broadside was let fly from her double-shotted
  guns, which raked the <i>Bucentaure</i> fore and aft, and the
  booming of cannon continued until her masts and hull were a
  complete wreck. Many guns were dismounted and four hundred men
  killed. The <i>Victory</i> then swung off and left the doomed
  <i>Bucentaure</i> to be captured by the <i>Conqueror</i>, and
  Villeneuve was taken prisoner. After clearing the
  <i>Bucentaure</i>, the <i>Victory</i> fouled the
  <i>Redoubtable</i>, and proceeded to demolish her hull with the
  starboard guns, and with her port guns she battered the
  <i>Santissima Trinidad</i>, until she was a mass of wreckage, and
  the <i>Africa</i> and <i>Neptune</i> forced her to surrender.
  Meanwhile, the <i>Victory</i> kept hammering with her starboard
  guns at the <i>Redoubtable</i> until her lower deck cannon were
  put out of action. Then she used her upper deck small guns and
  muskets from aloft. Nelson was too humane a man to use this
  method of warfare from the lower tops, and too practical, lest
  the ropes and sails should be damaged. The writer is of opinion
  that he was wrong in this view, as was clearly shown by the
  deadly execution the French musketeers did from aloft before
  their masts were shot away by the British big artillery. It can
  never be wrong to outmatch an enemy in the methods they employ,
  no matter what form they take. Although the victory was all on
  the British side at Trafalgar, it would have been greater and
  with less loss of life on our side had musketeers been employed
  in the same way as the French and Spanish employed them. The men
  on the upper deck of the <i>Victory</i> were shot <a name=
  "Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>down by these snipers without having
  an equal chance of retaliating. The <i>Redoubtable's</i>
  mizzen-top was full of sharpshooters when the two ships fell
  alongside of each other, but only two were left there when Nelson
  was shot and dropped on his left side on the deck a foot or two
  from Captain Hardy. The Frenchman who shot him was killed himself
  by a shot fired from the <i>Victory's</i> deck, which knocked his
  head to pieces. His comrade was also shot dead while trying to
  escape down the rigging, and fell on the <i>Redoubtable's</i>
  poop. The other sharpshooters had been previously killed by the
  musketry from the <i>Victory's</i> deck.</p>

  <p>Nelson told Hardy, when he expressed the hope that he was not
  seriously hurt, that "they had done for him at last, and that he
  felt his backbone was broken." He was hit on the left shoulder;
  the ball had pierced his left lung. The snipers from the tops of
  the other enemy ships killed a large number of the
  <i>Victory's</i> officers and men who were on deck. The French
  made an attempt to board, but were thrown back in confusion and
  with tremendous loss. The instinct of domination and the
  unconquerable combativeness of our race is always more fiercely
  courageous when pressed to a point which causes others to take to
  their heels or surrender.</p>

  <p>It was not an exaggeration on the part of the French and
  Spanish to declare that the British sailors and soldiers were not
  ordinary men but devils, when the real tussle for mastery began,
  and when they were even believed to be beaten. The French and
  Spanish conclusions <a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>were
  right then, and the ruthless Germans, stained with unspeakable
  crimes, should know they are right now, for they have had many
  chances in recent days of realizing the power of the recuperating
  spirit they are up against, just at a time when they have become
  imbued with the idea that they have beaten our forces on land and
  destroyed our ships and murdered their crews at sea. The Kaiser
  and his advisers, military and naval, have made the German people
  pay dearly for the experiment of stopping our supplies by sea,
  for the loss of life by the sinking of their own submarines must
  have been enormous. But only those to whom they belong will ever
  know that they have not returned, and that they must have been
  sent to the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>We can only judge by written records and authoritative
  paintings or prints of the period what the naval battles of the
  beginning of the last century were like. But it is only those who
  have studied minutely the naval battles of St. Vincent, the Nile,
  Copenhagen, and Trafalgar who can depict the awful character and
  thrilling nature of these ocean conflicts.</p>

  <p>While the author was serving as an apprentice aboard a sailing
  vessel during the Prussian-Danish war in 1864 a dense fog came
  on, and continued the whole of one night. When it cleared up the
  next forenoon we found that the vessel had been sailed right into
  the centre of the Danish fleet, which had defeated the Prussians
  and Austrians off Heligoland. There were other merchantmen there,
  and the cheering as we passed each of the <a name="Page_242" id=
  "Page_242"></a>Danish warships was hearty and long, while they
  gracefully acknowledged by saluting with their flags. I am quite
  sure there were few British seamen who would not have gladly
  volunteered to serve in the Danish navy against the Prussians, so
  universal was their bitter dislike to the Hun bullies who had set
  themselves to steal by force the possessions to which they had
  not an atom of right. The sight of these fine frigates and
  line-of-battle ships manoeuvring to come to grips with their
  cowardly antagonists who were assailing their national rights has
  been revivified during a long course of study of Nelson's naval
  warfare, and makes the awful vision of Trafalgar appear as it
  really was, and makes me wish that I were gifted with the art of
  words so that I might describe it in all its gruesome wreckage
  and magnitude, as the recollection of the majestic sight of the
  Danish ships before they even went into action makes it appear to
  me.</p>

  <p>My mind's eye pictures one after another of the French and
  Spanish ships surrendering, the hurricane of cheers that followed
  their defeat, and the pathetic anxiety of the dying chieftain for
  the safety of Captain Hardy, who was now in charge of the
  flagship acting as commander-in-chief. Hardy is long in coming;
  he fears that he may be killed, and calls out, "Will no one bring
  Hardy to me?" At last the gallant captain sees an opportunity of
  leaving the deck, for the <i>Victory</i> is shielded by two ships
  from the enemy's gunfire. "Well, Hardy," says Nelson to him, "how
  goes the battle?" "Very well, my Lord," says Hardy; "<a name=
  "Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>fourteen or fifteen of the enemy's
  ships are in our possession." "That is well," said Nelson, "but I
  bargained for twenty"; and then followed the memorable order,
  "Anchor, Hardy, anchor." "If I live," he says, "we will anchor";
  and in answer to Hardy's supposition that Collingwood should take
  charge, he impulsively resents the suggestion and expresses the
  hope that this will not happen while he lives, and urges again on
  Hardy that the fleet may be anchored, and asks him to make the
  signal. He hopes that none of our ships have struck, and his
  devoted friend reassures him that none have and never will. He
  commissions Hardy to give "dear Lady Hamilton his hair and other
  belongings," and asks that his "body shall not be thrown
  overboard." Hardy is then asked in childlike simplicity to kiss
  him, and the rough, fearless captain with deep emotion kneels and
  reverently kisses Nelson on the cheek. He then thanks God that he
  has done his duty, and makes the solemn thoughts that are
  troubling his last moments manifest in words by informing Doctor
  Scott, with a vital sailorly turn of speech, that "he had
  <i>not</i> been a <i>great</i> sinner," and then bids him
  remember that he leaves Lady Hamilton and his daughter Horatia as
  a legacy to his country, and that Horatia is never to be
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>Even at this distance of time one cannot help regretting that
  nature's power did not sustain him to see the total debacle of
  the enemy fleets. He knew that he had triumphed, and that his
  task had ended fatally to himself, but his sufferings <a name=
  "Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>did not prevent his spirit sallying
  to and fro, making him feel the joy of living and wish that he
  might linger but a little longer. He was struck down at a
  critical stage of the battle, though there was never any doubt as
  to how it would end, thanks to the adroit skill and bravery of
  Collingwood and those who served under him. It is a happy thought
  to know that our hero, even when the shadows were closing round
  him, had the pleasure of hearing from the lips of the faithful
  Hardy that fifteen of the enemy ships had struck and not one of
  ours had lowered a flag. But how much more gladsome would the
  passing have been had he lived to know that the battle had ended
  with the capture of nine French vessels and ten Spanish, nineteen
  in all. He died at 4.30 p.m. on the 21st October, 1805, just when
  the battle was flickering to an end. Villeneuve had given himself
  up, and was a prisoner on board the <i>Mars</i>. Dumanoir had
  bolted with four of the line, after committing a decidedly
  cowardly act by firing into the captured Spanish ships, the
  object being to put them out of the possession of the British.
  They could not succeed in this without killing large numbers of
  their allies, and this was all they were successful in doing. It
  was a cruel, clumsy crime, which the Spanish rightly resented but
  never succeeded in avenging.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Spanish Admiral Gravina, who had lost an arm,
  took command of the dilapidated combined fleets, and fled into
  Cadiz with five French and five Spanish ships, and by 5 p.m. the
  thundering of the guns had ceased, and the <a name="Page_245" id=
  "Page_245"></a>sea all round was a scene of death, dismasted
  ships, and awful wreckage. The Rear-Admiral Dumanoir was sailing
  gaily towards the refuge of Rochefort or Ferrol when he came into
  view of, and ultimately had to fight on the 4th November, a
  squadron under Sir Richard Strachan. Dumanoir and his men are
  said to have fought with great fierceness, but his ships were
  beaten, captured, and taken in a battered condition, and
  subsequently sent to England, so that now twenty-three out of the
  thirty-three that came out of Cadiz with all the swagger of
  confidence and superiority to match themselves against Nelson and
  his fiery coadjutors were tragically accounted for.</p>

  <p>Collingwood was now the commander-in-chief of the British

    <p>ADMIRALTY OFFICE, <i>6th November, 1805.</i></p>

    <p>Despatches, of which the following are copies, were received
    at the Admiralty this day, at one o'clock a.m. from
    Vice-Admiral Collingwood, Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's
    ships and vessels off Cadiz.</p>

    <p>"EURYALUS", OFF CAPE TRAFALGAR, <i>October 22, 1805.</i></p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The ever-to-be-lamented death of Vice-Admiral
    Lord Viscount Nelson, who, in the late conflict with the enemy,
    fell in the hour of victory, leaves me the duty of informing my
    lords commissioners of the Admiralty, that on the 19th instant,
    it was communicated to the Commander-in-Chief, from the ships
    watching the motions of the enemy in Cadiz, that the combined
    fleet had put to sea. As they sailed with light winds westerly,
    his Lordship concluded their destination was the Mediterranean,
    and immediately made all sail for <a name="Page_246" id=
    "Page_246"></a>the Straits' entrance, with the British
    squadron, consisting of twenty-seven ships, three of them
    sixty-fours, where his Lordship was informed, by Captain
    Blackwood (whose vigilance in watching and giving notice of the
    enemy's movements has been highly meritorious), that they had
    not yet passed the Straits.</p>

    <p>On Monday, the 21st instant, at daylight, when Cape
    Trafalgar bore E. by S. about seven leagues, the enemy was
    discovered six or seven miles to the eastward, the wind about
    west, and very light; the Commander-in-Chief immediately made
    the signal for the fleet to bear up in two columns, as they are
    formed in the order of sailing; a mode of attack his Lordship
    had previously directed, to avoid the delay and inconvenience
    in forming a line of battle in the usual manner. The enemy's
    line consisted of thirty-three ships (of which eighteen were
    French and fifteen Spanish, commanded in chief by Admiral
    Villeneuve, the Spaniards under the direction of Gravina), bore
    with their heads to the northwards and formed their line of
    battle with great closeness and correctness. But as the mode of
    attack was unusual, so the structure of their line was new; it
    formed a crescent convexing to leeward; so that in leading down
    to their centre I had both their van and rear abaft the beam
    before the fire opened; every alternate ship was about a
    cable's length to windward of her second ahead and astern,
    forming a kind of double line, and appeared, when on their
    beam, to leave a very little interval between them, and this
    without crowding their ships. Admiral Villeneuve was in the
    <i>Bucentaure</i> in the centre, and the <i>Prince of
    Asturias</i> bore Gravina's flag in the rear, but the French
    and Spanish ships were mixed without any apparent regard to
    order of national squadron.</p>

    <p>As the mode of our attack had been previously determined
    upon, and communicated to the flag officers and captains, few
    signals were necessary, and none were made except to direct
    close order as the lines bore down. The Commander-in-Chief in
    the <i>Victory</i> led the weather column, and the <i>Royal
    Sovereign</i>, which bore my flag, the lee. The action began at
    twelve o'clock by the leading ships of the column breaking
    through the enemy's line; the Commander-in-Chief about the
    tenth ship from the van; the second-in-command about the
    twelfth from the rear, leaving the van of the enemy unoccupied;
    the succeeding ships breaking through in all parts, <a name=
    "Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>astern of their leaders, and
    engaging the enemy at the muzzles of their guns. The conflict
    was severe; the enemy's ships were fought with a gallantry
    highly honourable to their officers; but the attack on them was
    irresistible, and it pleased the Almighty Disposer of all
    events to grant his Majesty's arms a complete and glorious
    victory. About three p.m., many of the enemy's ships having
    struck their colours, their line gave way; Admiral Gravina,
    with ten ships joining their frigates to leewards, stood
    towards Cadiz. The five headmost ships of their van tacked, and
    standing to the southward, to windward of the British line,
    were engaged, and the sternmost of them taken; the others went
    off, leaving to his Majesty's squadron nineteen ships of the
    line (of which two are first-rates, the <i>Santissima
    Trinidad</i>, and the <i>Santa Anna</i>), with three flag
    officers, viz. Admiral Villeneuve, the Commander-in-Chief; Don
    Ignacio Maria D'Alava, Vice-Admiral; and the Spanish
    Rear-Admiral Don Baltazar Hidalgo Cisneros.</p>

    <p>After such a victory it may appear unnecessary to enter into
    encomiums on the particular parts taken by the several
    commanders; the conclusion says more than I have language to
    express; the spirit which animated all was the same; when all
    exert themselves zealously in their country's service, all
    deserve that their high merits should stand recorded; and never
    was high merit more conspicuous than in the battle I have
    described.</p>

    <p>The <i>Achille</i>, a French seventy-four, after having
    surrendered, by some mismanagement of the Frenchmen, took fire
    and blew up; two hundred of her men were saved by the tenders.
    A circumstance occurred during the action, which so strongly
    marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging
    the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure
    I have in making known to their Lordships: the
    <i>T&eacute;m&eacute;raire</i> was boarded, by accident or
    design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the
    other; the contest was vigorous; but in the end the combined
    ensigns were torn from the poop, and the British hoisted in
    their places.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id=
    "FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class=
    "fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

    <p>Such a battle could not be fought without sustaining a great
    loss of men. I have not only to lament in common<a name=
    "Page_248" id="Page_248"></a> with the British Navy and the
    British nation in the fall of the Commander-in-Chief, the loss
    of a hero whose name will be immortal, and his memory ever dear
    to his country; but my heart is rent with the most poignant
    grief for the death of a friend, to whom, by many years of
    intimacy, and a perfect knowledge of the virtues of his mind,
    which inspired ideas superior to the common race of men, I was
    bound by the strongest ties of affection; a grief to which even
    the glorious occasion in which he fell does not bring the
    consolation which perhaps it ought. His Lordship received a
    musket ball in his left breast, about the middle of the action,
    and sent an officer to me immediately, with his last farewell,
    and soon after expired. I have also to lament the loss of those
    excellent officers, Captain Duff of the <i>Mars</i>, and Cooke
    of the <i>Bellerophon</i>; I have yet heard of none others.</p>

    <p>I fear the numbers that have fallen will be found very great
    when the returns come to me; but it having blown a gale of wind
    ever since the action, I have not yet had it in my power to
    collect any reports from the ships. The <i>Royal Sovereign</i>
    having lost her masts, except the tottering foremast, I called
    the <i>Euryalus</i> to me, while the action continued, which
    ship, lying within hail, made my signals, a service which
    Captain Blackwood performed with very great attention. After
    the action I shifted my flag to her, so that I might the more
    easily communicate my orders to, and collect the ships, and
    towed the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> out to seaward. The whole
    fleet were now in a very perilous situation; many dismasted;
    all shattered; in thirteen fathom water off the shoals of
    Trafalgar; and when I made the signal to anchor, few of the
    ships had an anchor to let go, their cables being shot. But the
    same good Providence which aided us through such a day
    preserved us in the night, by the wind shifting a few points,
    and drifting the ships off the land, except four of the
    captured dismasted ships, which are now at anchor off
    Trafalgar, and I hope will ride safe until these gales are
    over.</p>

    <p>Having thus detailed the proceedings of the fleet on this
    occasion, I beg to congratulate their Lordships on a victory,
    which I hope will add a ray to the glory of his Majesty's
    crown, and be attended with public benefit to our country.</p>

  <p>Against the desire of his dead comrade, Collingwood carried
  into practice his own sound and masterful judgment not to anchor
  either his conquests or any of his own vessels on a lee ironbound
  shore. Even had his ground tackle been sound and intact, which it
  was not, and the holding ground good instead of bad, he acted in
  a seamanlike manner by holding steadfastly to the sound sailor
  tradition always to keep the gate open for drift, to avoid being
  caught, and never to anchor on a lee shore; and if perchance you
  get trapped, as hundreds have been, get out of it quickly, if you
  can, before a gale comes on. But in no case is it good seamanship
  to anchor. There is always a better chance of saving both the
  ship and lives by driving ashore in the square effort to beat off
  rather than by anchoring. The cables, more often than not, part,
  and if they do, the <a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>ship is
  doomed, and so may lives be. Hundreds of sailing vessels were
  saved in other days by the skill of their commanders in carrying
  out a plan, long since forgotten, called clubhauling off a lee
  shore. Few sailors living to-day will know the phrase, or how to
  apply it to advantage. It was a simple method, requiring ability,
  of helping the vessel to tack when the wind and sea made it
  impossible in the ordinary way. A large kedge with a warp bent on
  was let go on either the port or starboard quarter at an
  opportune moment to make sure the vessel would cant the right
  way, and then the warp was cut with an axe. In the writer's
  opinion, it would have been just as unwise to anchor at Trafalgar
  after the battle, in view of the weather and all circumstances,
  as it would be to anchor on the Yorkshire or any part of the
  North-East Coast when an easterly gale is blowing. But apart from
  the folly of it, there were none of the ships that had ground
  tackle left that was fit to hold a cat.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, Nelson's mind was distracted and suffering
  when he gave Hardy the order to anchor. The shadows were hovering
  too thickly round him at the time for him to concentrate any
  sound judgment. Some writers have condemned Collingwood for not
  carrying out the dying request of his Commander-in-Chief. It
  was a good thing that the command of the fleet fell into the
  hands of a man who had knowledge and a mind unimpaired to carry
  out his fixed opinions. When Hardy conveyed Nelson's message, he
  replied, "That is the very last thing <a name="Page_252" id=
  "Page_252"></a>that I would have thought of doing," and he was
  right. Had Nelson come out of the battle unscathed, he would
  assuredly have acted as Collingwood did, and as any well-trained
  and soundly-balanced sailor would have done. Besides, he always
  made a point of consulting "Coll," as he called him, on great
  essential matters. If it had been summer-time and calm, or the
  wind off the land, and the glass indicating a continuance of fine
  weather, and provided the vessels' cables had been sound, it
  might have paid to risk a change of wind and weather in order to
  refit with greater expedition and save the prizes, but certainly
  not in the month of October in that locality, where the changes
  are sudden and severe. Collingwood acted like a sound hardheaded
  man of affairs in salving all he could and destroying those he
  could not without risk of greater disaster.</p>

  <p>Collingwood's account of his difficulties after the battle was
  won is contained in the following letter to his
  father-in-law:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"QUEEN,"</p>

    <p><i>2nd November, 1805.</i></p>

    <p>MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I wrote to my dear Sarah a few lines when
    I sent my first dispatches to the Admiralty, which account I
    hope will satisfy the good people of England, for there never
    was, since England had a fleet, such a combat. In three hours
    the combined fleet were annihilated, upon their own shores, at
    the entrance of their port, amongst their own rocks. It has
    been a very difficult thing to collect an account of our
    success, but by the best I have twenty-three sail of the line
    surrendered to us, out of which three, in the furious gale we
    had afterward, being driven to the entrance of the harbour of
    Cadiz, received assistance and got in; these were the <i>Santa
    Anna</i>, the <i>Algeziras</i>, and <i>Neptune</i> (the last
    since sunk and <a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>lost); the
    <i>Santa Anna's</i> side was battered in. The three we have
    sent to Gibraltar are the <i>San Ildefonso</i>, <i>San Juan
    Nepomuceno</i>, and <i>Swiftsure</i>; seventeen others we have
    burnt, sunk, and run on shore, but the <i>Bahama</i> I have yet
    hope of saving; she is gone to Gibraltar. Those ships which
    effected their escape into Cadiz are quite wrecks; some have
    lost their masts since they got in, and they have not a spar or
    a store to refit them. We took four admirals&mdash;Villeneuve
    the commander-in-chief, Vice-Admiral D'Alava, Rear-Admiral
    Cisneros, Spanish, and Magon, the French admiral, who was
    killed&mdash;besides a great number of brigadiers (commanders).
    D'Alava, wounded, was driven into Cadiz in the <i>Santa
    Anna</i>; Gravina, who was not taken, has lost his arm
    (amputated I have heard, but not from him); of men, their loss
    is many thousands, for I reckon in the captured ships we took
    twenty thousand prisoners (including the troops). This was a
    victory to be proud of; but in the loss of my excellent friend,
    Lord Nelson, and a number of brave men, we paid dear for it;
    when my dear friend received his wound, he immediately sent an
    officer to me to tell me of it, and give his love to me. Though
    the officer was directed to say the wound was not dangerous, I
    read in his countenance what I had to fear; and before the
    action was over Captain Hardy came to inform me of his death. I
    cannot tell you how deeply I was affected, for my friendship
    for him was unlike anything that I have left in the Navy, a
    brotherhood of more than thirty years; in this affair he did
    nothing without my counsel; we made our line of battle
    together, and concerted the mode of attack, which was put into
    execution in the most admirable style. I shall grow very tired
    of the sea soon; my health has suffered so much from the
    anxious state I have been in, and the fatigue I have undergone,
    that I shall be unfit for service. The severe gales which
    immediately followed the day of victory ruined our prospect of
    prizes; our own infirm ships could scarce keep off the shore;
    the prizes were left to their fate, and as they were driven
    very near the port, I ordered them to be destroyed by burning
    and sinking, that there might be no risk of their falling again
    into the hands of the enemy. There has been a great destruction
    of them, indeed I hardly know what, but not less than seventeen
    or eighteen, the total ruin of the combined fleet. To alleviate
    the miseries of the wounded, as much as in my power, I sent a
    flag to the Marquis Solano, <a name="Page_254" id=
    "Page_254"></a>to offer him his wounded. Nothing can exceed the
    gratitude expressed by him, for this act of humanity; all this
    part of Spain is in an uproar of praise and thankfulness to the
    English. Solano sent me a present of a cask of wine, and we
    have a free intercourse with the shore. Judge of the footing we
    are on, when I tell you he offered me his hospitals, and
    pledged the Spanish honour for the care and cure of our wounded
    men. Our officers and men, who were wrecked in some of the
    prize ships, were received like divinities; all the country was
    on the beach to receive them; the priests and women
    distributing wine, and bread and fruit among them; the soldiers
    turned out of their barracks to make lodging for them, whilst
    their allies, the French, were left to shift for themselves,
    with a guard over them to prevent their doing mischief. After
    the battle I shifted my flag to the <i>Euryalus</i> frigate,
    that I might the better distribute my orders; and when the
    ships were destroyed and the squadron in safety, I came here,
    my own ship being totally disabled; she lost her last mast in
    the gale. All the northern boys, and Graydon, are alive;
    Kennicott has a dangerous wound in his shoulder; Thompson is
    wounded in the arm, and just at the conclusion of the action
    his leg was broken by a splinter; little Charles is unhurt, but
    we have lost a good many youngsters. For myself, I am in so
    forlorn a state, my servants killed, my luggage, what is left,
    is on board the <i>Sovereign</i>, and Clavell<a name=
    "FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> wounded. I have
    appointed Sir Peter Parker's<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id=
    "FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class=
    "fnanchor">[17]</a> grandson, and Captain Thomas, my old
    lieutenant, post captains; Clavell, and the first lieutenant of
    the <i>Victory</i>, made commanders; but I hope the Admiralty
    will do more for them, for in the history of our Navy there is
    no instance of a victory so complete and so great. The ships
    that escaped into Cadiz are wrecks; and they have neither
    stores nor inclination to refit them. I shall now go, as soon
    as I get a sufficient squadron equipped, and see what I can do
    with the Carthagenians; if I can get at them, the naval war
    will be finished in this country. Prize-money I shall get
    little or none for this <a name="Page_255" id=
    "Page_255"></a>business, for though the loss of the enemy may
    be estimated at near four millions, it is most of it gone to
    the bottom. Don Argemoso, who was formerly captain of the
    <i>Isedro</i>, commanded the <i>Monarca</i>, one of our
    captures; he sent to inform me he was in the <i>Leviathan</i>,
    and I immediately ordered, for our old acquaintance sake, his
    liberty on parole. All the Spaniards speak of us in terms of
    adoration; and Villeneuve, whom I had in the frigate,
    acknowledges that they cannot contend with us at sea. I do not
    know what will be thought of it in England, but the effect here
    is highly advantageous to the British name. Kind remembrances
    to all my friends; I dare say your neighbour, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;
    will be delighted with the history of the battle; if he had
    been in it, it would have animated him more than all his
    daughter's chemistry; it would have new strung his nerves, and
    made him young again. God bless you, my dear sir, may you be
    ever happy; it is very long since I heard from home.</p>

    <p>I am, ever, your most truly affectionate,</p>

    <p>CUTHBERT COLLINGWOOD.</p>

    <p>I have ordered all the boys to be discharged into this ship;
    another such fight will season them pretty well. Brown is in
    perfect health. We had forty-seven killed, ninety-four
    wounded.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Great efforts were made to get all the people out of the
  disabled vessels before they drifted ashore. It is really
  splendid to read the official account of the deeds of bravery of
  our fine fellows risking their own lives to save the lives of
  those they had defeated. Seven days after the battle, the
  <i>Victory</i> arrived at Gibraltar, and although her masts had
  been shot away and her hull badly damaged, she was refitted and
  sailed for England on the 4th November, the same day that the
  straggling Dumanoir and his ships fell into the hands of Sir
  Richard Strachan in the Bay of Biscay.</p>

  <h3><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>XIV</h3>

  <p>On the <i>Victory's</i> arrival at Spithead with Nelson's
  remains aboard, preserved in spirits, the body was taken out and
  put in a leaden coffin filled with brandy and other strong
  preservatives. On the arrival of the <i>Victory</i> at the
  entrance of the Thames, the body was removed, dressed in the
  Admiral's uniform, and put into the coffin made out of the
  mainmast of <i>L'Orient</i> and presented to Nelson some years
  before by Captain Hallowell. It was then put into a third case,
  and on the 9th January, 1806, after lying in state for three
  days, the remains were buried in St. Paul's.</p>

  <p>The imposing demonstrations of sorrow could not be excelled.
  Parliament voted a monument in St. Paul's Cathedral, and others
  were erected in all the principal towns in England and Scotland.
  There were neither material honours nor eulogies great enough to
  express the gratitude that was felt throughout the United Kingdom
  for the late Admiral's achievements. His widow, whom he had not
  seen for years, and from whom he was definitely parted, was
  granted &pound;2,000 per annum for life. His brother was made an
  Earl, with a perpetual income of &pound;6,000 a year, and
  &pound;15,000 of national money was voted to each of the sisters,
  while &pound;100,000 was given for an estate to be attached to
  the title. The human legacy left by Nelson of Emma Hamilton and
  their daughter Horatia were not mentioned, though he seems to
  have implored Heaven and earth in their behalf. Obviously, the
  Government felt that they dare <a name="Page_257" id=
  "Page_257"></a>not be generous to everybody, even though it were
  Nelson's dying injunction. Collingwood, who had as much to do
  with the triumph of Trafalgar as Nelson himself, without making
  any ado about it, was treated pretty much like a provincial
  mayor. The mayor, of course, may and often does adopt a luxurious
  Roman style of living in order that his local deeds may not
  escape observation, but such self-advertisement was entirely
  foreign to Collingwood's character. It was fitting that every
  reasonable honour should have been paid to the memory of a great
  Englishman, whose deeds, in co-operation with others, have never
  been surpassed. But to make grants and give honours of so
  generous a character to Nelson's relatives, and especially to his
  wife, who had been a torment to him, and to measure out
  Collingwood's equally great accomplishments with so mean a hand,
  is an astonishing example of parsimony which, for the sake of our
  national honour, it is to be hoped rarely occurs. Even the
  haughty, plethoric nobles of a fourth-rate town council (if it be
  not a libel to mention them in connection with so discreditable
  an affair) would have judged the manifest fitness of things
  better than to make any distinction between Admiral Collingwood
  and his lifelong friend Nelson.</p>

  <p>Surely this famous and eminently worthy public servant was as
  deserving of an Earldom as was Nelson's brother, and his wife and
  daughters of a more generous allowance than that of his dead
  chief's widow and sisters!&mdash;this distinguished <a name=
  "Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>man, who helped to plan the order of
  battle at Trafalgar and was the first to take his ship into
  action in a way that inflamed the pride and admiration of the
  Commander-in-Chief, and made him spontaneously exclaim, "See,
  Blackwood, how that noble fellow Collingwood takes his ship into
  battle! How I envy him!"</p>

  <p>No one knew as well as Nelson that his comrade, next to
  himself, was to play the leading part in not only assuring a
  victory, but in completely annihilating the French and Spanish
  fleets. Yet the British Government of that day only counted the
  services he had rendered to the nation worthy of a peerage, plus
  the same pension as Nelson's widow; i.e. he was to have a pension
  of &pound;2,000 a year, and after his death Lady Collingwood was
  to have the munificent sum of &pound;1,000 per annum and each of
  his two daughters &pound;500 a year. He never drew his pension,
  as they kept him in the service he had made so great until he was
  a physical wreck. He died on his way home aboard the <i>Ville de
  Paris</i> on the 7th March, 1810, and was laid to rest in St.
  Paul's Cathedral alongside of his distinguished friend Lord
  Nelson.</p>

  <p>I have already drawn attention to Nelson's blind prejudice to
  and hatred of the French. Collingwood was tainted with the same
  onesided views, but tempered them with more conventional
  language. In his letters to Lady Collingwood he expresses delight
  at receiving a letter written to him in French by his daughter,
  and exhorts the mother to see that she converses when she can in
  that language, and to remember that she is <a name="Page_259" id=
  "Page_259"></a>never to admire anything French but the language.
  On another occasion he enjoins his daughter Sarah to write every
  day a translation of English into French, so that the language
  may soon become familiar to her; and then, as though he regarded
  these instructions as unpatriotic, he qualifies them by reminding
  her "that it is the only thing French that she needs to acquire,
  because there is little else in connection with that country
  which he would wish her to love or imitate." A kinsman of his,
  after the battle of Trafalgar, wrote to inform him that his
  family were descended from, and allied to, many great families,
  Talebois amongst the rest. He brushed the intended compliment
  aside, and in his quaint manner remarked that "he had never
  troubled to search out his genealogy but all he could say was,
  that if he got hold of the French fleet, he would either be a
  Viscount or nothing." This is one of the very rare symptoms of
  vaunting that he ever gave way to; and though his dislike of the
  French was as inherent as Nelson's, he never allowed his
  chivalrous nature to be overruled by passion. In a letter to Lord
  Radstock in 1806 he closes it by paying a high tribute to the
  unfortunate French Admiral Villeneuve by stating "that he was a
  well-bred man, and a good officer, who had nothing of the
  offensive vapourings and boastings in his manner which were,
  perhaps, too commonly attributed to the Frenchmen."</p>

  <p>Collingwood was a man of high ideals with a deeply religious
  fervour, never sinning and then repenting as Nelson was
  habitually doing. Physical <a name="Page_260" id=
  "Page_260"></a>punishment of his men was abhorrent to him, and
  although he enforced stern discipline on his crew, they
  worshipped him. "I cannot understand," he said, "the religion of
  an officer who can pray all one day and flog his men all the
  next." His method was to create a feeling of honour amongst his
  men, and he did this with unfailing success, without adopting the
  harsh law of the land made by English aristocrats.</p>

  <p>In a letter to his wife, dated September, 1806, Collingwood
  informs her that the Queen of Naples expected to be put on the
  throne of Naples again and had intimated the desire of showing
  her gratitude to himself by creating him a Sicilian Duke and
  giving him an estate. "If a Dukedom is offered to me," he tells
  her, "I shall return my thanks for the honour they wish to confer
  upon me, and show my estimate of it by telling them that I am the
  servant of my sovereign alone, and can receive no rewards from a
  foreign prince." Napoleon denounced Marie Caroline, Queen of
  Naples, as "a wicked shameless woman, who had violated all that
  men held most sacred." She had ceased to reign, and by her crimes
  she had fulfilled her destiny. Collingwood, who knew her public
  and private character to be notoriously untrustworthy and loose,
  looked upon the proposed honour from such a person as an affront,
  and refused to accept it if offered. Nelson, on the other hand,
  who had a passion for window-dressing and flattery, accepted with
  a flowing heart both a Dukedom and an estate from their Sicilian
  Majesties. His close intimacy <a name="Page_261" id=
  "Page_261"></a>with the Royal Family, and especially with the
  Queen, was a perpetual anxiety to his loyal and devoted
  friends.</p>

  <p>There were no two men in the Service who had such an
  affectionate regard for each other as Nelson and the amiable
  Northumbrian Admiral, and certainly none equalled them in their
  profession or in their devotion to their King and country. Each
  was different from the other in temperament and character, but
  both were alike in superb heroism&mdash;the one, egotistically
  untamed, revelling at intervals in lightning flashes of eternal
  vengeance on the French fleet when the good fortune of meeting
  them should come; and the other, with calm reticence elaborating
  his plans and waiting patiently for his chance to take part in
  the challenge that was to decide the dominion of the sea. Each,
  in fact, rivalled in being a spirit to the other. Nelson
  believed, and frequently said, that he "wished to appear as a
  godsend"; while Collingwood, in more humble and piercing phrase,
  remarked that "while it is England, let me keep my place in the
  forefront of the battle." The sound of the names of these two
  remarkable men is like an echo from other far-off days. Both
  believed that God was on their side.</p>

  <p>Neither of them knew the character or purpose of the exalted
  man on whom their Government was making war. Like simple-minded,
  brave sailors as they were, knowing nothing of the mysteries of
  political jealousies and intrigue, and believing that the men
  constituting the Govern<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>ment
  must be of high mental and administrative ability, they assumed
  that they were carrying out a flawless patriotic duty, never
  doubting the wisdom of it; and it was well for England that they
  did not. Men always fight better when they know and believe their
  cause is just.</p>

  <p>Collingwood, like most of his class, gave little thought to
  money matters. He had "no ambition," he says, "to possess
  riches," but he had to being recognized in a proper way. He
  wished the succession of his title to be conferred on his
  daughters, as he had no son. This was a modest and very natural
  desire, considering what the nation owed to him, but it was not
  granted, and the shame of it can never be redeemed. In one of his
  letters to Mr. Blackett he says to him, "I was exceedingly
  displeased at some of the language held in the House of Commons
  on the settlement of the pension upon my daughters; it was not of
  my asking, and if I had a favour to ask, money would be the last
  thing I would beg from an impoverished country. I am not a Jew,
  whose god is gold; nor a Swiss, whose services are to be counted
  against so much money. I have motives for my conduct which I
  would not give in exchange for a hundred pensions."</p>

  <p>These lines speak eloquently of the high order of this
  illustrious man. He despises money, but claims it as his right to
  have proper recognition of his services, which the Government
  should have given him generously and with both hands. In so many
  words he says, "Keep your money, I am not to be bought, but
  confer on me if you <a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>will
  some suitable token that will convince me that you do really, in
  the name of the nation, appreciate what I have done for it."
  Services such as he had rendered could never have been adequately
  rewarded by either money or honours, no matter how high in
  degree. In the affairs of money these two great Admirals were
  pretty similar, except that Collingwood knew better how to spend
  it than Nelson. Both were generous, though the former had method
  and money sense, while the latter does not appear to have had
  either. He was accustomed to say "that the want of fortune was a
  crime which he could never get over." Both in temperament and
  education Collingwood was superior to Nelson. The former knew
  that he had done and was capable of doing great deeds, but he
  would never condescend to seek for an honour reward; while
  Nelson, who also knew when he had distinguished himself in the
  national interest, expected to be rewarded, and on occasions when
  it was too tardily withheld, he became peevish, whimpered a good
  deal about his illtreatment, and on more than one occasion showed
  unbecoming rage at being neglected.</p>

  <p>After Copenhagen, the wigs were fairly on the green because he
  was created a Viscount instead of an Earl. He talked a good deal
  about the Tower, a Dukedom, or Westminster Abbey, and had ways of
  demanding attention for which Collingwood had neither the
  aptitude nor the inclination, though his naval qualities were
  quite equal to Nelson's. But with all their faults and virtues,
  there was never any petty jealousy be<a name="Page_264" id=
  "Page_264"></a>tween the two heroes, who lie at rest side by side
  in the tombs at St. Paul's. Faithful to their naval orthodoxy
  that it was incumbent for every Christian sailor-man to wash
  clean his conscience when he was passing from time into eternity,
  Nelson on the 21st October, 1805, and Collingwood five years
  later, avowed to those who had the honour of closing their eyes
  for evermore that they "had not been great sinners," and then
  slipped into eternal sleep; each of them leaving behind a name
  that will live and descend into distant ages.</p>

  <p>We left Villeneuve, the unfortunate but distinctly brave
  French Commander-in-Chief of the allied fleet at Trafalgar,
  aboard the <i>Mars</i>. He was subsequently sent a prisoner to
  England, and after a short stay, he was allowed to go to France,
  and broke his journey at Rennes on his way to Paris. The poor
  broken-hearted fellow was found dead in his room, having
  committed suicide. There is not the remotest foundation for the
  unworthy report that was spread that he was put to death by
  Napoleon's orders. The Emperor was much too big a man, occupied
  with human projects too vast, to waste a moment's thought or to
  stain his name over an unfortunate admiral who had brought his
  fleet to grief by acting against his instructions. It is only
  little men who write, not that which is founded on fact but that
  which they imagine will appeal to the popular taste of the
  moment; and so it was with the French Emperor; a lot of
  scandalmongers were always at work hawking hither and thither
  their poisonous fabrications. A great many <a name="Page_265" id=
  "Page_265"></a>people get their living by appealing to the lowest
  passions. Napoleon, when in captivity, referred incidentally to
  the misfortunes of Villeneuve, and made the following statement
  to Dr. O'Meara:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"Villeneuve," said he, "when taken prisoner and brought to
    England, was so much grieved at his defeat, that he studied
    anatomy on purpose to destroy himself. For this purpose he
    bought some anatomical plates of the heart, and compared them
    with his own body, in order to ascertain the exact situation of
    that organ. On his arrival in France I ordered that he should
    remain at Rennes, and not proceed to Paris. Villeneuve, afraid
    of being tried by a court-martial for disobedience of orders,
    and consequently losing the fleet, for I had ordered him <i>not
    to sail or to engage the English</i>, determined to destroy
    himself, and accordingly took his plates of the heart, and
    compared them with his breast. Exactly in the centre of the
    plate he made a mark with a large pin, then fixed the pin as
    near as he could judge in the same spot in his own breast,
    shoved it in to the head, penetrated his heart and expired.
    When the room was opened he was found dead; the pin in his
    breast, and a mark in the plate corresponding with the wound in
    his breast. He need not have done it," continued he, "as he was
    a brave man, though possessed of no talent."<a name=
    "FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>I have given this communication in full as it appears in
  O'Meara's book, because the scribes would have it that Villeneuve
  was destroyed by the Emperor's orders. There was not at the time,
  nor has there ever appeared since, anything to justify such a
  calumny on a man who challenged the world to make the charge and
  prove that he had ever committed a crime during the whole of his
  public career. No one has taken up the challenge except in
  sweeping generalities of slander, which are easily made but less
  easy to substantiate. <a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>If the
  Emperor had really wished to take Villeneuve's life, it would
  have been more satisfactory to have him condemned to death by a
  court-martial composed of his countrymen than to have the already
  ruined man secretly destroyed for mere private revenge. The
  common sense of the affair compels one to repudiate the idea of
  the Emperor's complicity in so stupid a crime. It is more likely
  that Napoleon wished to save him from the consequences of a
  court-martial, so ordered him to remain at Rennes. He rarely
  punished offenders according to their offences. After the first
  flush of anger was over, they were generally let down easily, and
  for the most part became traitors afterwards.</p>

  <p>We need not waste time or space in dilating on what would have
  happened to Nelson had he put at defiance the authority that
  controlled him and the irreparable disaster that would have
  followed. Villeneuve has been belauded for his gallantry in the
  fight at Trafalgar; indeed, we learn, from sources that may be
  relied upon, that his bravery, dispositions in battle, and art of
  enthusing his followers could not be surpassed. His signals to
  the fleet were almost identical with Nelson's. Here is one:
  "Celui qui ne serait pas dans le feu ne serait pas &agrave; son
  poste"; the literal translation of which is: "He who would not be
  in the fire would not be at his post"; or, "The man who would
  hold his post must stand fire," which is quite an inspiring
  signal. But I wonder what the eulogists of Villeneuve would have
  written of him had he been the victor instead of the defeated. It
  is generous to give praise <a name="Page_267" id=
  "Page_267"></a>to the unfortunate Admiral for whom Nelson had
  such an aversion and who was constantly threatened by him with
  vigorous chastisement when he caught him; but generosity was not
  the motive&mdash;it was only part of the loose-lipped, unclean
  policy of decrying Napoleon. It is horrible, ungrateful, and foul
  brutishness of the Corsican tyrant to court-martial so amiable
  and brave a man as Villeneuve because he proceeded out of Cadiz
  against orders and suffered a crushing defeat! It is quite
  permissible for a French admiral to put authority at defiance if
  doing so complies with the sentiments of anti-Napoleon writers,
  who were either ill-informed, purblind critics or eaten up with
  insincerity or moral malaria! But it is the maintenance of
  discipline to have men like Sir John Byng court-martialled and
  shot after being tried, it is said, by a not entirely impartial
  court, on the supposition that he had neglected his duty in an
  engagement with the French off Minorca on the 20th May, 1756, and
  committed an error of judgment. A rather remarkable method of
  enforcing discipline, to shoot an admiral for an error of
  judgment!</p>

  <p>Take another case of high-ordered, solemn devotion to
  discipline: Sir Robert Calder, who had gained an important
  victory over the French at Finisterre, was court-martialled,
  condemned and ruined, ostensibly because he did not achieve a
  greater victory. The decisions of both cases were crimes, not
  desire for the maintenance of discipline. It was, and ever will
  be, a stain on the name of justice. I need not carry this
  further, <a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>except to say that
  according to the solemn logic of some writers, it was murder for
  Napoleon or some of his ministers to have the Duc d'Enghien shot
  for having conspired with others for the overthrow of the
  established French Government, but it is the saintly enforcement
  of discipline to have a British admiral shot and another ruined
  for no other reason than an error of judgment on the one hand and
  an insufficient victory on the other. Sir Robert Calder's heart
  was broken by cruelty. Villeneuve lost his fleet and killed
  himself, not that he had anything to fear from the decision of
  the court-martial&mdash;so it is said on the authority of an
  English writer of note. Certainly he had nothing to fear from the
  Emperor, who has indicated that he had no intention of dealing
  severely with him. It was fitting that he should be reprimanded,
  and no doubt he would have been, after which, as was his custom,
  the Emperor would have conferred some kindly favour upon him.
  Serene authors have entangled themselves a good deal over this
  matter in their efforts to take up the impossible position of
  making the Emperor and not Villeneuve responsible for the
  disaster at Trafalgar to the Spanish and French fleet. Of course,
  Napoleon was badly chagrined, and so would the King of England
  have been, if it were thinkable that such a calamity could
  possibly have befallen any British fleet. The head of the French
  nation would have been less than human had he not felt the full
  force of the terrific blow to his country, and especially to
  himself.</p>

      ABOUKIR.</p>

      <p>At the battle of Aboukir Bay the British losses were
      reported to be 896 killed and wounded. Only one captain fell.
      5,225 of the French perished, and 3,105, including wounded,
      were sent on shore.</p>

      <p>When the battle was over, Nelson gave instructions that
      thanksgiving aboard every ship should be offered to Almighty
      God for giving His Majesty's forces the victory. It is the
      author's opinion that but for a good deal of slashing genius
      and not a little of the devil on the part of Nelson and his
      men the French would not have fared so badly.</p>

      everything. The whole art is really to live all the
      <i>days</i> of our life. Admire the Creator and all His

      attachment and Southey says there is no reason to believe
      that it was more than platonic. But these views are certainly

      body was first seen floating by a Neapolitan fisherman, who
      reported the matter, but his story was ridiculed. Finally, in
      order to verify the statement, the principal actors in the
      shameful tragedy went for a sail in Naples Bay and soon met
      the body borne along by the swift current as though to meet
      them. The incident created a profound impression at the

      girl of twenty-two, who is known to fame and immortality,
      purchased a dagger, and called on Marat, who was the most
      infamous arch-butcher of the Reign of Terror. He was in his
      bath at the time, but this did not prevent her from making
      her way to him. He wrote down the names of the conspirators
      she told him of having seen in Normandy, and he told her he
      would swiftly have them guillotined. The assurance had
      scarcely left his lips when in an instant she thrust the
      instrument of death through his heart. She repudiated the
      stigma of being thought a murderess, and believed that her
      act would be the means of saving thousands of lives. She was
      dragged through the streets, taken to the executioner, and
      asked for the loan of his shears and cut off a lock of her
      hair. When asked if she found the journey long, she replied
      with perfect composure, "Oh no, I am not afraid of being too
      late." Subsequently one of the Girondin deputies said of her,
      "She has killed us, but she has taught all how to die."</p>

      TROUBRIDGE'S BLUFF LETTER TO LORD NELSON.</p>

      <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"Pardon me, my Lord, it is my sincere esteem for you
        that makes me mention it. I know you have no pleasure in
        sitting up all night at cards; why then sacrifice your
        health, comfort, purse, ease, everything, to the customs of
        a country where your stay cannot be long? I would not, my
        Lord, reside in this country for all Sicily. I trust the
        war will soon be over, and deliver us from a nest of
        everything that is infamous, and that we may enjoy the
        smiles of our countrywomen.</p>

        <p>"Your Lordship is a stranger to half that happens, or
        the talk it occasions; if you knew what your friends feel
        for you, I am sure you would cut all the nocturnal parties.
        Gambling of the people at Palermo is publicly talked of
        everywhere. I beseech your Lordship leave off. I wish my
        pen could tell you my feelings, I am sure you would oblige
        me.</p>

        <p>"I trust your Lordship will pardon me; it is the sincere
        esteem I have for you that makes me risk your
        displeasure."</p>

      Castlereagh and Canning fought a duel. Canning was wounded by
      a bullet in the leg, and it prevented Castlereagh from being
      an unpopular figure. Indeed, he became for a time, in limited
      circles, popular. Percival was assassinated. Lord Liverpool
      was Prime Minister for fifteen years, and departed this life
      insane. Canning was brilliant, witty, and eloquent, and his
      outlook was large. It was said that he was spoiled by Pitt,
      and was consumed by vanity, and was broken by Tory
      calumniation. Political, commercial, or social intrigue
      success is always followed by the most deadly reaction on
      those who practise or encourage it, and I trust that a
      merciful Providence will shield from the tragedies and
      maladies that came to some members of this former coalition
      those of the present, which apparently excels every other in
      its colossal efforts at doing harm. The best brains are
      needed now, not romancers.</p>

  <h3>I<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></h3>

  <p>Napoleon, when at the height of his fame, was looked upon by
  the European Powers as a man whose lust of conquest was a
  terrible menace to all constituted authority. The oligarchies
  thought themselves bound to combine against him in order to
  reseat the Bourbons on the throne of France and restore law and
  order to that distracted country. What a travesty of the actual
  facts!</p>

  <p>The people of France had risen against the tyranny and
  oppression of the French kings and nobles, and out of the welter
  of the Revolution Napoleon rose to power and, by his magnetic
  personality, welded the chaotic elements into unity, framed laws
  which are still in operation, and led his country to wonderful
  heights of glory.</p>

  <p>Well may the crowned heads of Europe have feared this man,
  whose genius put all their mediocre and unenlightened
  achievements in the shade. Had <a name="Page_276" id=
  "Page_276"></a>they been blessed with the same vision as he, they
  would not have opposed but co-operated with him, by introducing
  into their own constitutions saner laws such as some of those in
  the Code Napoleon. But instead of this, they began a campaign of
  Press vilification, and Napoleon's every act was held up as the
  deed of a monster of iniquity. Plots, open and secret, to
  dethrone him were continually in progress, only to be frustrated
  by the genius of the man of the people.</p>

  <p>As an instance of this, and of the one-sided view taken by all
  ranks and classes of Napoleon's opponents, let us contrast two
  cases which are in some respects parallel. The many plots to
  assassinate the First Consul&mdash;especially the one that very
  nearly succeeded when he was on his way to the opera&mdash;and
  the knowledge that an organized band of conspirators were in
  red-hot activity and, headed by the Duc d'Enghien, Cadoudal,
  Moreau, and Pichegru, were determined to kill the head of the
  State, overthrow the Government, and re-establish the Bourbon
  dynasty, caused the Duc to be arrested, tried by his
  fellow-countrymen, and found guilty of the charges brought
  against him, and, by the blundering of Savary, afterwards Duke of
  Rovigo, and the persistence of Murat, the death penalty was
  carried out and he was shot. Had he been permitted to live
  another twenty-four hours, Napoleon would unquestionably have
  pardoned him, though he never doubted the justice of the
  sentence. Much political capital has been made in this country
  against Napoleon for even sanctioning his arrest and in not
  preventing the <a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>capital
  sentence of the court from being carried out.<a name=
  "FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p>Unquestionably Napoleon regretted the execution, and would
  have granted a free pardon had some one not blundered or been too
  zealous in what they conceived to be his and the country's best
  interests. Almost every writer on this subject is strong in his
  condemnation of the execution and of Napoleon for not taking
  surer steps to prevent it. But in judging him in regard to this
  matter, it is only fair to take into account that he was the
  ruler of a great empire. Whether he became so by force or not,
  does not matter; he saved the Revolution, and had already brought
  some form of order out of bloody chaos.</p>

  <p>He had already become the popular head of the French nation,
  and it devolved upon him to take the most minute precautions
  against the disturbing effects of the secret and avowed
  conspirators who directed their operations against his life and
  the overthrow of his government from London. The precautions
  taken were drastic, skilfully organized, and far-reaching, and
  his agents kept him advised of the danger that continually beset
  him. Even though he had no thought of <a name="Page_278" id=
  "Page_278"></a>reprieving the Duc, and deliberately allowed him
  to be shot, the act of self-preservation, extreme though it may
  appear, can hardly be termed, under the circumstances,
  unwarranted. It was a period of wild, uncontrollable passion, and
  the survivors of the old aristocracy hated the man of genius who
  had risen to power from the ranks of the people to take the place
  of the Bourbons. This was the canker that stimulated their
  enmity.</p>

  <p>Had the Duc d'Enghien kept himself aloof from conspirators,
  and been willing to recognize the facts he would never have been
  molested. He took the risk of co-operating with desperate men,
  and paid the penalty by being shot on the 24th March, 1804, at
  6.0 a.m., at Vincennes. Had the ruler of any state in Europe
  carried out a death-sentence for the same reason and under the
  same circumstances, it would have been regarded as well-merited
  punishment, and the Press would have preached the gospel of
  warning to evil doers. But with Napoleon it was different. He was
  an interloper who had nothing in common with the galaxy of
  monarchs who ruled Europe at that time. Subsequently they licked
  his boots, not for love, but through fear. The shooting of the
  Duc was a fine opportunity for his enemies. They sedulously
  nursed the Press, published books and pamphlets in every
  language, and employed the most poisoned pen that could be bought
  to portray the future ruler of kings in terms of obloquy. The
  performance of the scribes who direct the pen, which is said to
  be mightier than the sword, is enough to kill any one with a real
  sense of humour. <a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>Some of the
  literary productions which were to send the greatest of living
  men off the face of the earth are quite grotesque in their
  feminine, shrill advocacy of force towards the "eater of pigs";
  the "Anti-Christ"; and the murderer of a kindly-disposed
  gentleman who was on an innocent visit to the frontier of France
  for the purpose of negotiating a few private matters that had no
  political significance; what if he were one of the leaders of a
  band of fine, desperate fellows who had combined, and sworn to
  rid France of the Usurper, even at the risk of death! This being
  their aim and heroic determination, they had no ground of
  complaint if the iron hand which ruled the country took measures
  to prevent them from carrying out their beneficent intentions. Of
  course, I give the sense and not the actual words of the gallant
  writers of that time who, with a glare in their lion eye (judging
  from the style of their vapourings), thought that Napoleon could
  never survive so vigorous a stream of invective! What loose
  fabrications have been scattered over the earth about this
  regrettable incident, and what abominable cant has been sent
  forth extolling the virtues of men like the unfortunate Duc, who
  put the law at defiance by secretly carrying out a purpose that
  he knew was pregnant with danger to himself!</p>

  <p>Let us contrast, if we can, the Duc d'Enghien's reckless
  gamble, the consequences of which have been used so consistently
  to blacken the fame of the Emperor Napoleon, with Nelson's
  connection with the hanging of the rebel prince Carraciolli; of
  the latter little has been said, though the shooting <a name=
  "Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>of the Duc seems to have been more
  justifiable than the hanging of the prince, who was an old man.
  Both were tried and condemned to death by men who, it is said,
  were prejudiced against them. Nelson could have saved the aged
  Admiral had his heart been free from revenge and his mind free
  from the influence of Emma Hamilton. The guilt of the Admiral's
  death must eternally lie at his door. The outrage can never be
  effaced, and must for all time be associated with the mean
  executioners who, to begin with, had naught but vengeance in
  their minds. Nelson was an Englishman entrusted with England's
  high sense of honour and love of compassion, and in its name he
  stained its reputation for fair dealing. On entering the Bay of
  Naples, a flag of truce was flying at the mast-head of the
  <i>Seahorse</i> and at the castles of Nuovo and Uovo. The treaty
  had been ratified by Captain Foote, a high-minded
  officer.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Nelson did not
  approve of the truce, nor did Lady Hamilton, who was aboard the
  <i>Foudroyant</i>. One can almost see this brazen figure standing
  on the quarterdeck of this British ship of war calling out to
  Nelson, "Haul down the flag of truce, Bronte. There must be no
  truce with rebels." It almost takes one's breath away to think
  that <a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>a man in Nelson's
  position should have allowed private feelings to enter into and
  influence his professional duty. Every now and again we get
  glimpses of this blatant paramour of his being allowed to assert
  herself in matters which involved the honour of Great Britain. We
  are anxious to believe that Nelson put some limit to this lady's
  interference in matters of high naval policy, but he seems to
  have been such a fool with women that almost anything ridiculous
  can be believed of him where they were concerned. Both of them
  figure badly in the Uovo and Nuovo and Carraciolli affair. The
  garrison there was so vigorously bombarded that it was driven to
  capitulate, but only on condition that the safety of the garrison
  would be guaranteed. Captain Foote at once agreed to this, and to
  see that it was duly carried out. One of the reasons that led
  Captain Foote so readily to agree to the conditions submitted to
  him was the extreme strength of the forts, which could have
  pounded the city to pieces. The other was the desire to spare
  human life. What need was there for Nelson to take umbrage at and
  violate the treaty made by Foote in the British name? Foote had
  made a good bargain by getting possession of the forts, and a
  better and nobler one in making it part of his policy to save
  human life. We wonder whether Nelson's anger did not arise from
  his being deprived of some of the glory himself. He was
  desperately fond of it! In any case, he let down England's name
  badly over the whole transaction.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>Fox made a speech on it
  in the House of Commons which was, and will ever continue to be,
  an awful indictment. There is nothing in the French Revolution,
  or in the whole of Napoleon's career, that can be compared with
  it for ferocity. Great efforts were made to fix the
  responsibility for breach of faith on Captain Foote, but they
  failed, since there was not a vestige of foundation on which a
  case could be made against him, as the documents conclusively
  proved. He demanded a court-martial, but his friends prevailed
  upon him to let his case rest on the conclusive facts which were
  produced and made public and which have never been questioned.
  There cannot be found a more astonishing revelation of perfidy or
  inhuman violence in the archives of Europe than that related by
  Mr. Fox. Here is an extract from his amazing speech:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>When the right honourable gentleman speaks of the last
    campaign, he does not mention the horrors by which some of
    these successes were accompanied; Naples, for instance, has
    been, among others (what is called) delivered; and yet, if I am
    rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders
    so ferocious, and cruelties so abhorrent, that the heart
    shudders at the recital. It has been said, that not only were
    the miserable victims of the rage and brutality of the fanatics
    savagely murdered, but that in many instances their
    <i>flesh</i> was <i>devoured</i> by the cannibals, who are the
    advocates, if the rumours which are circulated be true. I will
    mention a fact to give Ministers the opportunity, if it be
    false, to wipe away the stain that must otherwise affix on the
    British name. It is said that a party of the Republican
    inhabitants at Naples took shelter in the fortress of Castle
    del Uovo. They were besieged by a detachment from the royal
    army, to whom they refused to surrender, but demanded that a
    British officer should be brought forward, and to him <a name=
    "Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>they capitulated. They made terms
    with him under the sanction of the British name. <i>It was
    agreed that their persons and property should be safe, and that
    they should be conveyed to Toulon.</i> They were accordingly
    put on board a vessel, but before they sailed, their property
    was confiscated, numbers of them taken out, <i>thrown into
    dungeons</i>, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding
    the British guarantee, <i>absolutely executed</i>.<a name=
    "FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
  </div>

  <p>This appalling narrative, which was never refuted, is really
  too horrible to ponder over. It puts in the shade any
  responsibility Napoleon had for the death of the Duc d'Enghien.
  It is needless to enlarge on the silly and altogether baseless
  attacks that were not only allowed to be made, but, we have good
  grounds for stating, were manufactured by members of the
  Government and their agents, and circulated for the purpose of
  distracting the public mind from their own iniquities, and
  inflaming bitter passions and prejudices by accusing Napoleon of
  deeds of blood for which he was in no greater degree responsible
  than were they. The nations were all out for blood at that period
  (just as they are now), and each claimed a monopoly of all the
  virtues. "Down, down, with the French is my constant prayer,"
  shouts our greatest hero, and by way of addendum, he announces in
  Christ-like accents that he hates a Frenchman as he hates the
  devil. "Down, down, with the British is our constant prayer"
  shout back the French, who are at present our Allies against
  another nation who were our Allies against them at that time,
  showing that Fraternity is decidedly a possible <a name=
  "Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>consummation, though it fluctuates
  from one to another with amazing eccentricity.</p>

  <p>In the name of this fraternal spirit, we see the great
  Napoleon surrounded by a hotbed of assassins demanding his life
  in the name of the Founder of our faith. He was the ruler, as I
  have said, of a vast Empire, sworn to protect its laws, its
  dignity, and its citizen rights by defending himself and his
  country against either treachery, plotters against his life, or
  open enemies, no matter from what quarter they came. The Duc
  d'Enghien violated the law, and was therefore as liable to suffer
  the consequences as any peasant or middle-class person would have
  been. But this did not meet with the approval of the
  international oligarchy, so they set up a screaming factory and
  blared this murderous deed into the minds of all the Western
  world. These fervent professors of the Christian faith were in no
  way particular as to the form or authenticity of their
  declamatory ebullitions.</p>

  <p>But what of Nelson? He was a subject of his King, employed by
  the King's Government under certain plenary powers to fight the
  country's battles, defend its right, uphold its dignity, guard
  its honour, and commit no violence. That is, in plain English, he
  was to play the game. But he assumed an authority that no
  Government of England would have dared to have given him by
  revoking the word of honour of a distinguished officer who had
  pledged England's word that the lives of the beleaguered men
  would be spared. I think the writer of the gospel of "Let
  brotherly <a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>love continue,"
  and the rhetoricians who claim that Britons have no competitors
  in the science of moral rectitude, will have a hard task to
  square the unworthy declamations against Napoleon's
  responsibility in the Duc d'Enghien affair with their silence on
  Nelson's in breaking the truce already referred to, and the awful
  consequences set forth in Mr. Fox's speech, which is reminiscent
  of the powerful disciplinary methods of that manly martinet Ivan
  the Terrible, who was responsible for the massacre of men by the
  thousand, flaying of prisoners alive, collecting pyramids of
  skulls, slaughtering of innocent men, and the free use of other
  ingenious forms of refined scientific torture which tires the
  spirit to relate. It is hard to forgive Nelson for having
  smirched his own and England's name with atrocities so terrible.
  But more humiliating still to British honour is the fact that his
  part in the breaking of the treaty was dictated to him from the
  quarter deck of the <i>Foudroyant</i> by a woman whom my
  vocabulary is unable to describe in fitting terms. I shall
  emphasize this masculine female's orders to Nelson by quoting
  them again. Were it not for the comic impertinence of the order,
  I think it would almost make me feel the bitterness of death.
  Nelson seems to have been the victim of her dominating spirit,
  though the evidence in support of him swallowing the whole dose
  of medicine is quite feeble. That he swallowed too much of it
  will always detract from his fame. "Haul down the flag of truce,
  Bronte. No truce with rebels." Nelson lost a great opportunity of
  adding romance to his naval glory by neglecting <a name=
  "Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>his imperative duty in not putting
  Sir William Hamilton's wife in irons or having her thrown into
  the sea. A story of this kind would have sounded better, and its
  effect would have electrified the world in subsequent days, and
  have given scope to the talents of actors and authors who are
  eager for dramatic copy.</p>

  <p>I think Cardinal Ruffo would have been a supporter of imposing
  some form of disciplinary restraint on Emma Hamilton. He did
  strongly insist on the treaty being honourably adhered to, but
  his view was overruled, and he retired in consequence in bitter
  indignation.</p>

  <p>So much for the vaunted fairness and impartiality of our
  treatment of Napoleon!</p>

  <p>It is only when we come to study the life of this man that we
  realize how he towered above all his contemporaries in thought,
  word, and deed. Napoleon's authentic doings and sayings are
  wonderful in their vast comprehensiveness and sparkling vision,
  combined with flawless wisdom. When we speak or think of him, it
  is generally of his military genius and achievements and of what
  we term his "gigantic ambition"; and in this latter conclusion
  the platitudinarians, with an air of originality, languidly
  affirm that this was the cause of his ruin, the grandeur of which
  we do not understand. But never a word is said or thought of our
  own terrible tragedies, nor of the victories we were compelled to
  buy in order to secure his downfall. His great gifts as a
  lawgiver and statesman are little known or spoken of. Nelson's
  views of him were of a rigid, stereotyped character. He <a name=
  "Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>only varied in his wild manner of
  describing him as a loathsome despot, whose sole aim was to make
  war everywhere and to invade England and annihilate her
  people.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>In the light of what is happening now in the world-war
  1914-1917, and the world-wide views expressed about the German
  Kaiser, it may be interesting to write Pitt's opinion of
  Napoleon, though they are scarcely to be mentioned in the same
  breath. The former, who is the creator of the world-tragedy, is a
  mere shadow in comparison to the great genius of whom Muller, the
  Swiss historian, says: "Quite impartially and truly, as before
  God, I must say that the variety of his knowledge, the acuteness
  of his observations, the solidity of his understanding (not
  dazzling wit), his grand and comprehensive views, filled me with
  astonishment, and his manner of speaking to me with love for him.
  By his genius and his disinterested goodness, he has also
  conquered me." But I give another authority, Wieland, the German
  author, who was disillusioned when he had the honour of a
  conversation with Napoleon on the field of Jena. Amongst the many
  topics they spoke of was the restoration of public worship in
  France by Napoleon. In his reply to the German writer as to why
  religion was not more philosophical and in harmony with the
  spirit of the times, Napoleon replied, "My dear Wieland, religion
  is <a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>not meant for
  philosophers! They have no faith either in me or my priests. As
  to those who do believe, it would be difficult to give them, or
  leave them too much of the marvellous. If I had to frame a
  religion for philosophers, it would be just the reverse of that
  of the credulous part of mankind." Wieland's testimony of
  Napoleon is quite as appreciative as that of Muller, and coming
  from him to the great conqueror of his native land makes it an
  invaluable piece of impartial history which reverses the loose
  and vindictive libels that were insidiously circulated by a gang
  of paid scoundrels in order to prejudice public opinion against
  him. Wieland, among other eulogies of him, says: "I have never
  beheld any one more calm, more simple, more mild or less
  ostentatious in appearance; nothing about him indicated the
  feeling of power in a great monarch." He conversed with him for
  an hour and a half, "to the great surprise of the whole
  assembly."</p>

  <p>Here we have a brief but very high testimony from two men of
  literary distinction, who had formed their impressions by
  personal contact. The present writer's belief is that had members
  of the British Government been guided by reason and sound
  judgment instead of blind, wicked prejudice; had they accepted
  overtures made to them from time to time by the head of the
  French nation during his rule, we should not have been engaged
  during the last five years in a world-war watering the earth with
  the blood of our race with reckless extravagance. The great
  soldier-statesman foretold what would happen. What irony that we
  <a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>should be in deadly conflict
  with the Power which, as an ally, helped to destroy him and is
  now engaged in frantic efforts to destroy us! Had Pitt and those
  who acted with him been endowed with human wisdom, he would not
  have written the following lines, but would have held out the
  olive-branch of peace and goodwill to men on earth:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>I see (says Pitt in a scrap of MS. found amongst his papers)
    various and opposite qualities&mdash;all the great and all the
    little passions unfavourable to public tranquillity united in
    the breast of one man, and of that man, unhappily, whose
    personal caprice can scarce fluctuate for an hour without
    affecting the destiny of Europe. I see the inward workings of
    fear struggling with pride in an ardent, enterprising, and
    tumultuous mind. I see all the captious jealousy of conscious
    usurpation, dreaded, detested, and obeyed, the giddiness and
    intoxication of splendid but unmerited success, the arrogance,
    the presumption, the selfwill of unlimited and idolized power,
    and more dreadful than all in the plenitude of authority, the
    restless and incessant activity of guilt, but unsated
    ambition.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This scrap of mere phrases indicates a mind that was far
  beneath the calibre of that of a real statesman. It was a
  terrible fate for Great Britain to have at the head of the
  Government a man whose public life was a perpetual danger to the
  state. Had Pitt been the genius his eloquence led his
  contemporaries to believe he was, he would have availed himself
  of the opportunities the Great Figure, who was making the world
  rock with his genius, afforded the British Government from time
  to time of making peace on equitable terms. But Pitt's vision of
  the large things that constituted human existence was feeble and
  narrowed down to the nightmare of the "tumultuous mind" <a name=
  "Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>whose sole aim was the conquest of
  the Continent of Europe and the invasion of these Islands. The
  "usurper" must be subdued by the force of arms, the squandering
  of British wealth, and the sanguinary sacrifice of human lives.
  That was the only diplomacy his mental organism could evolve. He
  used his power of expression, which was great, to such good
  purpose that his theories reflected on his supporters. Had Pitt
  been talented in matters of international diplomacy, as he was in
  the other affairs of Government, he would have seized the
  opportunity of making the Peace of Amiens universal and durable.
  It is futile to contend that Napoleon was irreconcilable. His
  great ambition was to form a concrete friendship with our
  Government, which he foresaw could be fashioned into a
  continental arrangement, intricate and entangled as all the
  elements were at the time. Napoleon never ceased to deplore the
  impossibility of coming to any reciprocal terms with England so
  long as Pitt's influence was in the ascendant, and he and a large
  public in France and in this country profoundly believed that Fox
  had not only the desire but the following, and all the diplomatic
  qualities to bring it about. Any close, impartial student of
  history, free from the popular prejudices which assailed
  Napoleon's origin and advent to power, cannot but concede the
  great possibilities of this view.</p>

  <p>It was only statesmen like Fox who had unconfused perception,
  and inveighed against the stupidity of ministers acclaimed by an
  ignorant public as demigods. Napoleon's starting-points <a name=
  "Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>were to "Surmount great obstacles
  and attain great ends. There must be prudence, wisdom, and
  dexterity." "We should," he said, "do everything by reason and
  calculation, estimating the trouble, the sacrifice, and the
  pleasure entailed in gaining a certain end, in the same way as we
  work out any sum in arithmetic by addition and subtraction. But
  reason and logic should be the guiding principle in all we do.
  That which is bad in politics, even though in strict accordance
  with law, is inexcusable unless absolutely necessary, and
  whatever goes beyond that is criminal." These were briefly the
  general principles on which he shaped his ends, and they are
  pretty safe guides. His mentality, as I have said, was so
  complete that it covered every subtle and charming form of
  thought and knowledge, even to the smallest affairs of life. No
  theologians knew more than he or could converse so clearly on the
  many different religions; and he was as well versed in the
  intricacies of finance and civil law as he was in the knowledge
  of art, literature, and statecraft.</p>

  <p>His memory was prodigious, and a common saying of his was that
  "A head without a memory was like a fort without a garrison." He
  never used a word that was not full of meaning. The unparalleled
  amount of literature that surrounds his name teems with concise,
  vivid sentences on every conceivable subject, and the more they
  are read and studied, the more wonderful appears their wisdom. On
  the eve of a great battle, his exhortations to his soldiers were
  like magic, burning hot into their souls, making them
  irresistible. The <a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>popular
  idea in the country in his time, when passion ran rampant, and
  indeed, in a hazy way, affects some people's minds now, was that
  he and his family were mere perfidious Corsicans without mental
  endowments or character, and unworthy of the stations in life in
  which his genius had placed them. His sisters have been
  caricatured as having the manners of the kitchen, and loose
  morals, and his brothers as mediocrities. A great deal of the
  same stuff is now written about other people who have occupied
  and do occupy high stations in life.</p>

  <p>Here is Napoleon's own version of each of his brothers and
  sisters and of his mother. It was given in course of conversation
  to Las Cases at St. Helena. "The Emperor," he says, "speaks of
  his people; of the slight assistance he has received at their
  hands, and of the trouble they had been to him; he goes on to say
  that for the rest, we should always, as a last resort, endeavour
  to form a judgment by analogy. What family, in similar
  circumstances, would have done better? And, after all, does not
  mine furnish, on the whole, a record which does me honour? Joseph
  would be an ornament to society wherever he might happen to
  reside; Lucien, an ornament to any political assembly; Jerome,
  had he come to years of discretion, would have made an excellent
  ruler; I had great hopes of him. Louis would have been popular,
  and a remarkable man anywhere. My sister Elisa had a man's
  intellect, a brave heart, and she would have met adversity
  philosophically. Caroline is a very clever and capable <a name=
  "Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>woman. Pauline, perhaps the most
  beautiful woman of her day, has been, and will be until the end,
  the most charming creature living. As for my mother, she is
  worthy of every respect. What family as numerous could make a
  finer impression?"</p>

  <p>If unprejudiced history counts for anything, this testimony is
  true, and it is doubtful whether any of the ruling families of
  France who preceded them, or even those of other countries, who
  took part in bringing about their downfall (taking them as a
  whole), could tabulate a better record of worthiness. Certainly
  no previous ruler of France ever made the efforts that the head
  of the Bonaparte family did to fashion his brothers and sisters
  into filling the positions he had made for them in a way that
  became princes and princesses.</p>

  <p>The fact is, the political mind was whirling and permeated
  with the idea of his ambition only, and the human aversion to the
  introduction of new and improved conditions of life. The ruling
  classes were seized with alarm lest the spirit of the French
  Revolution would become popular in this country, and that not
  only their possessions might be confiscated, but that their lives
  would be in peril if the doctrines he stood for were to take hold
  of the public imagination. They were afraid, as they are now, of
  the despotism of democracy, and so they kept the conflict raging
  for over twenty years. Then came the fall of the greatest genius
  and most generous warrior-statesman who has ever figured in the
  world's history; he had staggered creation with his formidable
  power, and <a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>the instruments
  of his downfall flattered themselves that the day of Divine
  vengeance had arrived.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>Only a few short months had elapsed when the indomitable hero,
  well informed of the Allies' squabbling deliberations, at the
  seat of Conference over the division of their conquest, and their
  vindictive intentions towards himself, startled them by the news
  of his landing and uninterrupted march on Paris, and was
  everywhere acclaimed by the cheers of the Army and the civilian
  population. Louis XVIII, whom the conquerors had set on the
  throne, flew in panic when he heard that the man of destiny was
  swiftly nearing his palace to take his place again as the idol
  and chief of a great people. Meanwhile, the Allies had somewhat
  recovered from their apoplectic dismay, and one and all solemnly
  resolved to "make war against Napoleon Bonaparte," the disturber
  of the peace, though he was the welcomed Emperor of the French.
  It was they who were the disturbers of the peace, and especially
  Great Britain, who headed the Coalition which was to drench again
  the Continent with human blood. Napoleon offered to negotiate,
  and never was there a more humane opportunity given to the
  nations to settle their affairs in a way that would have assured
  a lasting peace, but here again the ruling classes, with their
  usual impudent assumption of power to use the populations for the
  purpose of killing each other <a name="Page_295" id=
  "Page_295"></a>and creating unspeakable suffering in all the
  hideous phases of warfare, refused to negotiate, and at their
  bidding soldiers were plunged into the last Napoleonic conflict
  though many other conflicts have followed in consequence. Nothing
  so deadly has ever happened. The French were defeated and their
  Emperor sent to St. Helena with the beneficent Sir Hudson Lowe as
  his jailer.</p>

  <p>What a cynical mockery of a man this creature of Wellington,
  Castlereagh, and Lord Bathurst was! He carried out their behests,
  and after the ugly deed of vindictiveness, rage and frenzy had
  wrought the tragic end, they shielded their wicked act by
  throwing the guilt on him, and he was hustled off to a distant
  colony to govern again lest his uneasy spirit should put them in
  the dock of public opinion. He pleaded with them to employ the
  law officers of the Crown to bring an action against Doctor Barry
  O'Meara, whose "Voice from St. Helena" teemed with as dark a
  story as was ever put in print, in which he and his coadjutors
  figured as the base contracting parties. And the more he urged
  that the book was a libel against himself, the more O'Meara
  demanded that the action against him should be brought, and for
  very substantial reasons it never was. The Duke of Wellington
  said of Sir Hudson, "He was a stupid man. A bad choice and
  totally unfit to take charge of Bonaparte." And the great French
  Chieftain has left on record his contemptuous opinion of the
  Duke, as I have already said. "Un homme de peu d'esprit sans
  g&eacute;n&eacute;rosit&eacute;, et sans grandeur d'&acirc;me."
  (He was a poor-spirited man without <a name="Page_296" id=
  "Page_296"></a>generosity, and without greatness of soul.) "Un
  homme born&eacute;." (A man of limited capacity.) His opinion of
  Nelson was different, although our Admiral had hammered the
  French sea power out of existence and helped largely to shatter
  any hope Napoleon may have had of bringing the struggle on land
  to a successful conclusion.</p>

  <p>But these tragic happenings did not bring repose to the
  nations. Pitt died in 1806, so he missed seeing the fulfilment of
  his great though mistaken ambition. Who can doubt, as I have
  said, that the lack of diplomatic genius in preventing the
  spreading of the Napoleonic wars has been the means of creating
  other wars, and especially the greatest of all, in which the
  whole world is now engaged!</p>

  <p>That Napoleon himself was averse to a conflict which would
  involve all Europe and bring desolation in its train is shown by
  the following letter, written by his own hand, to George III. How
  different might the world have been to-day had the letter been
  received in the same spirit in which it was conceived.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>SIR AND BROTHER,&mdash;Called to the throne of France by
    Providence, and the suffrages of the Senate, the people, and
    the Army, my first sentiment is a wish for peace. France and
    England abuse their prosperity. They may contend for ages, but
    do their Governments well fulfil the most sacred of their
    duties, and will not so much bloodshed uselessly, and without a
    view to any end, condemn them in their own consciences? I
    consider it no disgrace to adopt the first step. I have, I
    hope, sufficiently proved to the world that I fear none of the
    chances of war, which presents nothing I have need to fear;
    peace is the wish of my heart, but war has never been
    inconsistent with my glory. I conjure your Majesty not to
    <a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>deny yourself the
    happiness of giving peace to the world, or leave that sweet
    satisfaction to your children; for certainly there never was a
    more fortunate opportunity nor a moment more favourable than
    the present, to silence all the passions and listen only to the
    sentiments of humanity and reason. This moment once lost, what
    bounds can be ascribed to a war which all my efforts will not
    be able to terminate. Your Majesty has gained more in ten
    years, both in territory and riches, than the whole extent of
    Europe. Your nation is at the highest point of prosperity, what
    can it hope from war? To form a coalition with some Powers on
    the Continent? The Continent will remain tranquil; a coalition
    can only increase the preponderance and continental greatness
    of France. To renew intestine troubles? The times are no longer
    the same. To destroy our finances? Finances founded on a
    flourishing agriculture can never be destroyed. To wrest from
    France her colonies? The colonies are to France only a
    secondary object; and does not your Majesty already possess
    more than you know how to preserve? If your Majesty would but
    reflect, you must perceive that the war is without an object;
    or any presumable result to yourself. Alas! What a melancholy
    prospect; to fight merely for the sake of fighting. The world
    is sufficiently wide for our two nations to live in, and reason
    sufficiently powerful to discover the means of reconciling
    everything, when a wish for reconciliation exists on both
    sides. I have, however, fulfilled a sacred duty, and one which
    is precious to my heart.</p>

    <p>I trust your Majesty will believe the sincerity of my
    sentiments, and my wish to give you every proof of the same,
    etc.</p>

    <p>(<i>Signed</i>) NAPOLEON.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This letter indicates the mind and heart of a great statesman.
  The thinking people, and therefore the most reliable patriots,
  would receive a similar appeal to-day from the Kaiser in a
  different spirit than did the King and the Government of George
  III.</p>

  <p>We believe that the war with Germany was forced upon us, and
  that Mr. Asquith's Government, and especially Sir Edward Grey
  (his Foreign <a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>Secretary) used
  every honourable means to avoid it, but the cause and origin of
  it sprang out of the defects of managing and settling the wars
  that raged at the beginning of the last century, and Pitt, aided
  by those colleagues of his who were swayed by his magnetic
  influence, are responsible to a large degree in laying the
  foundation of the present menace to European concord. Napoleon's
  plan of unification would have kept Prussian militarism in check.
  He looked, and saw into the future, while Pitt and his supporters
  had no vision at all. They played the Prussian game by combining
  to bring about the fall of the monarch who should have been
  regarded as this country's natural ally, and by undoing the many
  admirable safeguards which were designed to prevent Prussia from
  forcing other German States under her dominion. Napoleon
  predicted that which would happen, and has happened. He always
  kept in mind the cunning and unscrupulous tricks of Frederick and
  knew that if <i>his</i> power were destroyed, that would be
  Prussia's opportunity to renew the methods of the Hohenzollern
  scoundrel, the hero of Thomas Carlyle, and the intermittent
  friend of Voltaire, who made unprovoked war on Marie Theresa with
  that splendid Prussian disregard for treaty obligations, and who
  then, with amazing insolence, after the seven years' butchery was
  over, sat down at Sans Souci in the companionship of his numerous
  dogs to write his memoirs in which he states that "Ambition,
  interest, the desire of making people talk about him carried the
  day, and he decided for war;" <a name="Page_299" id=
  "Page_299"></a>he might have added to the majestic Hohenzollern
  creed, incurable treachery, falsehood, hypocrisy, and
  cowardice!</p>

  <p>But the law of retribution comes to nations as well as to
  individuals, and after the disappearance of Frederick, Prussian
  ascendancy came to an end and sank to the lowest depths of
  hopelessness before the terrible power of Napoleon; after his
  fall, the old majestic arrogance natural to their race began to
  revive. It took many years for the military caste to carry their
  objectives to maturity, and had we stood sensibly and loyally by
  our French neighbours, the tragedy that gapes at us now could
  never have come to pass. Possibly the Franco-German war would
  never have occurred had our foreign policy been skilfully handled
  and our attitude wisely apprehensive of Germany's ultimate
  unification and her aggressive aims. The generations that are to
  come will assuredly be made to see the calamities wrought by the
  administrators of that period, whose faculties consisted in
  hoarding up prejudices, creating enmities, and making wars that
  drained the blood and treasure of our land. We do not find a
  single instance of Pitt or Castlereagh expressing an idea worthy
  of statesmanship. What did either of these men ever do to uplift
  the higher phases of humanity by grappling with the problem that
  had been brought into being by the French Revolution?</p>

  <p>When we think of responsible ministers having no other vision
  or plan of coming to an understanding with the French nation
  except by their <a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>screams,
  groans, and odour of blood, it makes one shudder, and we wish to
  forget that the people allowed them to carry out their hideous
  methods of settling disputes. A galaxy of brilliant writers has
  sung their praises in profusion, but while the present writer
  admires the literary charm of the penmen's efforts, he does not
  find their conclusions so agreeable or so easy to understand.
  There was never a time, in our opinion, even during the most
  embarrassing and darkest phases of the Napoleonic struggle, in
  which our differences with France were insoluble. Napoleon, as I
  have said, never ceased to avow his willingness to make vital
  sacrifices in order that peace between the two peoples should be
  consummated. The stereotyped cant of maintaining the "Balance of
  Power" is no excuse for plunging a nation into gruesome, cruel,
  and horrible wars. It is when our liberties are threatened that
  circumstances may arise when it would be a crime not to defend
  them. But where and when were any of our interests threatened by
  Napoleon until we became the aggressors by interfering with the
  policy of what he called his "Continental system"? Even before
  Napoleon became Consul, First Consul, and subsequently Emperor of
  the French, it was deemed high policy on the part of our
  statesmen to take sides against the French Directorate in
  disputes that were caused and had arisen on the Continent out of
  the Revolution, and once involved in the entanglement which it is
  hard to believe concerned us in any degree, the nation was
  committed to a long and devastating debauch of crime which men
  who under<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>stood the real art
  of statesmanship would have avoided.</p>

  <p>Many of the famous statesmen who have lived since their time
  would have acted differently. Fox, with a free hand, would have
  saved us, and but for the senseless attitude of the
  Pitt-Castlereagh party, the Grey, Romilly, Horner, Burdett and
  Tierny combination would have prevented the last of Napoleon's
  campaigns between his return from Elba and his defeat at
  Waterloo, which proved to be the bloodiest of all the Emperor's
  wars.</p>

  <p>Amongst a certain section of the community the belief is that
  they who can steer the State along peaceful lines are
  mediocrities, and they who involve us in war are geniuses and
  earn the distinction of fame and Westminster Abbey, though it may
  be that they are totally void of all the essentials that are
  required to keep on good terms, not only with other Powers, but
  with our own masses. Take, first of all, the unostentatious old
  Scotsman, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who was regarded in the
  light of a mediocrity by the bellicose-minded people. Had he
  lived and been in power at the time of Pitt and Castlereagh, his
  finely constituted, shrewd brain and quiet determined personality
  would have guided the State in a way that would have brought it
  credit and kept it out of the shambles. Another personality who
  is possessed of attributes that have been scantily recognized is
  that of Lord Rosebery who, during his Foreign Secretaryship under
  Mr. Gladstone, and when he became Premier himself, saved this
  country more <a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>than once from
  war with Germany, leaving out of account the many other services
  rendered to his country. It is a tragedy to allow such merits to
  be wasted because of some slight difference of opinion in matters
  that do not count compared with the advantage of having at the
  head of affairs a man with an unerring tactful brain who can deal
  with international complexities with complete ease and
  assurance.</p>

  <p>Although Mr. Gladstone must always be associated with those
  who were responsible for the guilt of dragging this country, and
  perhaps France, into the Crimean war in defence of a State and a
  people whom he declared in other days should be turned out of
  Europe "bag and baggage" because of her unwholesome Government
  and hideous crimes to her subject races, <i>he</i> had the
  courage and the honesty to declare in later life that the part he
  took in allowing himself to acquiesce in a policy he did not
  approve, would always be a bitter thought to him. Had he been at
  the head of the Government then, and had he lived at the time of
  the continental upheaval that followed the French Revolution, all
  the evidences of his humane spirit and prodigious capacity lead
  us to the belief that there were no circumstances affecting our
  vital national interests that would have led him to take up arms
  against France. Nor do we think that a statesman of Lord
  Salisbury's stamp would have failed to find a way out. Disraeli
  was a different type. He lived in a picturesque world, and
  thirsted for sensation. The enormity of war was meaningless to
  him. He was not a <a name="Page_303" id=
  "Page_303"></a>constitutional statesman, but merely a politician
  who liked to arouse emotions. Mr. Asquith, whose head is free
  from the wafting of feathers, would, with strong and loyal
  backers, have applied his inimitable powers of persuasion and
  tact in accomplishing his ends without a rupture; and Lord Morley
  would as soon have thought of dancing a hornpipe on his mother's
  tomb as have yielded to the clamour for war by any number of the
  people or any number of his colleagues, no matter how numerous or
  how powerful they might be; even though his opinion of the French
  Emperor were strongly adverse, he would have angled for peace or
  resigned. I would rather place the guidance of the country
  through intricate courses in this man's hands than in that of a
  man mentally constituted as was Pitt. The present Viscount Grey
  would have taken the line his namesake took in 1815 by strongly
  advocating a peaceful solution.</p>

  <p>Take another man of our own time, the Right Hon. Arthur
  Balfour. He would have parleyed and schemed until the time had
  passed for any useful object to be gained by our joining in the
  war, always provided that the Jingo spirit were not too
  irrepressible for him to overpower and bewilder with his engaging
  philosophy. If George III had been blessed with these types of
  statesmen to advise him instead of the Castlereaghs, he might not
  have lost his reason. Napoleon would never have gone to Egypt,
  and our shores would never have been threatened with invasion.
  Nor would British and neutral trade have been paralysed in such a
  way as to bring in its wake ruin, riots, <a name="Page_304" id=
  "Page_304"></a>bankruptcies, and every form of devastation in
  1811. And as a natural corollary, we were plunged into a war with
  America which lasted from 1812 to 1814, and which left, as it
  well might, long years of bitter and vindictive memories in the
  minds of a people who were of our race and kindred. Our people as
  a whole (but especially the poorer classes) were treated in a
  manner akin to barbarism, while their rulers invoked them to bear
  like patriots the suffering they had bestowed upon them.</p>

  <p>But the canker had eaten so deeply into their souls that it
  culminated in fierce riots breaking out in Lancashire and London
  which spread to other parts and were only suppressed by measures
  that are familiar to the arrogant despots who, by their clumsy
  acts, are the immediate cause of revolt. Pitt and Castlereagh
  were the High Commissioners of the military spirit which the
  Whigs detested, and when the former died in 1806 the latter
  became the natural leader.</p>

  <p>Pitt was buried peaceably enough in the Abbey, but when his
  successor's tragic end came in 1822, the populace avenged
  themselves of the wrongs for which they believed he was
  responsible by throwing stones at the coffin as it was being
  solemnly borne to its last resting place beside William Pitt.
  Both men made war on Napoleon because they believed him to be the
  implacable disturber of peace and a danger to their country.
  Pitt, as we have seen, left among his MS. his opinion of the
  great soldier, and here is the latter's opinion of Pitt,
  expressed to his ministers on the eve of his leaving Paris for
  his last campaign against his relentless foes.<a name="Page_305"
  id="Page_305"></a></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"I do not know," he said (to his ministers in speaking to
    them of the new constitution he had granted), "how in my
    absence you will manage to lead the Chambers. Monsieur

    controlled by gaining over some old jobbers, or flattering some

    carry one far. In England, such means are not altogether
    neglected; but there are greater and nobler ones. Remember Mr.
    Pitt, and look at Lord Castlereagh! With a sign from his
    eyebrows, Mr. Pitt could control the House of Commons, and so
    can Lord Castlereagh now! Ah! if I had such instruments, I
    should not be afraid of the Chambers. But have I anything to
    resemble these?"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id=

  </div>

  <p>This piece of pathetic history is given to us by the French
  historian, M. Thiers, the lifelong enemy of his Imperial master,
  Napoleon III. We are faced now with the Power that we helped to
  build up against ourselves at the expense of the wreck of the
  First French Empire.</p>

  <p>The political situation then and now bears no comparison. We
  made war on the French without any real justification, and
  stained our high sense of justice by driving them to frenzy. We
  bought soldiers and sailors to fight them from impecunious German
  and Hanoverian princes. We subsidized Russia, Prussia, Austria,
  Portugal, Spain, and that foul cesspool, Naples, at the expense
  of the starvation of the poorest classes in our own country. The
  bellicose portion of the population, composed mainly of the upper
  and middle classes, shrieked their deluded terrors of extinction
  into the minds of the people and believed that if we did not make
  common cause with the downtrodden sanctified <a name="Page_306"
  id="Page_306"></a>allies who were fighting a man-eating ogre who
  was overrunning their respective countries, putting every one to
  the sword, we should become the objects of his fierce attention,
  be invaded and ground down to slavery for ever and ever. Our
  statesmen, hypocritically full of the gospel of pity, could not
  speak of our ally of other days without weeping, while at the
  same time pouring further subsidies into their greedy traitorous
  laps, in order that they might secure their co-ordination.</p>

  <p>It is futile for historian apologists to attempt to vindicate
  men who obviously were afflicted with moral cupidity, begotten of
  intellectual paralysis. It is merely an unwholesome subterfuge to
  state that they were free from enmity against the French nation,
  and that their quarrel was with the head of it. There would be
  just as much common sense in contending that the French
  Government had no hostile feeling against the British people, and
  that their quarrel was only against George III. Devices such as
  these, under any circumstances, are not only unworthy, but
  childish, and their sole object is to throw dust in the eyes of
  those they flippantly call the common people. As a matter of
  fact, it was not only the Emperor Napoleon whom they made it
  their policy to charge with being a public danger to the world,
  but the principles of the Revolution which he sprang from
  obscurity to save, which was slyly kept at the back of their
  heads.</p>

  <p>But the Republic, which was the outcome of the Revolution, was
  an approved ordinance of the people, and in addition to Napoleon
  being their <a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>duly elected
  representative, he was regarded by them as the incarnation of the
  Republic. The difference between him and the other monarchs of
  Europe was, that while they inherited their position, his
  election was democratically ratified by millions of votes. These
  votes were given by the people with whom a foreign Government
  declared it was at peace while at the same time it was at war
  with their Chief, whom they had from time to time duly elected.
  This is a method of warfare which represents no high form of
  thought or action, and to the everlasting credit of the French
  people be it said, they not only resented it, but stood loyally
  by their Emperor and their country until they were overpowered by
  the insidious poison of treason and intrigue from within and
  without.</p>

  <p>What a howl there would have been if the German Kaiser had
  sent out a proclamation that he was not at war with the British
  nation, but with their King and Government! Suppose he had
  committed the same act of arrogance towards the President of the
  United States, the revulsion of feeling would be irrepressible in
  every part of the world.</p>

  <p>We recognize at the same time that Napoleon's position was
  made insecure by an important element of his own countrymen,
  composed of the Bourbons and their supporters, who never ceased
  to intrigue for their return. Besides, there was a strong
  Republican element who never forgave him for allowing himself to
  become Emperor. But the most serious defection was that of some
  of his most important Generals, amongst whom were <a name=
  "Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>Marmont and Bertheur. The former
  subsequently became the military tutor of his son, the King of
  Rome, who died at Schonbrunn on the 22nd July, 1832, eleven years
  after his father's death at St. Helena.</p>

  <p>A notable fact is that there were very few of his common
  soldiers and common people who did not stand by him to the last,
  and who would not have continued the struggle under his trusted
  and revered generalship, had he elected to fight on. He implored
  the Provisional Government to give their sanction to this, and
  had they done so, he has stated that he could have kept the
  Allies at bay and would have ultimately made them sue for peace.
  Most authorities declare that this would have been impossible,
  but his genius as a tactician was so prodigious and unrivalled,
  his art of enthusing his soldiers so vastly superior to that of
  any general that could be brought against him, his knowledge of
  the country on which he might select to give battle so matchless
  that one has substantial grounds for believing that his assertion
  was more than a mere flash of imagination, and that even with the
  shattered, loyal portion of his army, he might have succeeded in
  changing defeat into a victory which would have changed the whole
  political position of Europe. He frequently reverted to his last
  campaign and his last battle at Waterloo, when he was in
  captivity at St. Helena, and declared he should never have lost
  it, as his plan of battle at every point was never better
  devised, and that by all the arts of war he ought to have
  defeated the Allies; then <a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>he
  would lapse into sadness and soliloquize, "It must have been
  fate."</p>

  <p>In the effort to crush a cause and a nation which had been
  brought out of the depths of anarchy and raised to the zenith of
  power by the advent of a great spirit, the British Government of
  that period made their country parties to the slaughter of
  thousands of our fellow-creatures, which, in the light of
  subsequent events, has left a stain upon our diplomacy that can
  never be effaced, no matter what form of excuse may be set forth
  to justify it. Never, in the whole history of blurred diplomatic
  vision, has there evolved so great a calamity to the higher
  development of civilization.</p>

  <p>By taking so prominent a part in preventing Napoleon from
  fulfilling the eternal purpose for which all nature foreshadowed
  he was intended, we made it possible for Germany to develop
  systematically a diabolical policy of treason which has involved
  the world in war, drenching it with human blood. The Allies
  pursued Napoleon to his downfall. Their attitude during the whole
  course of his rule was senselessly vindictive. They gloated over
  his misfortune when he became their victim, and they consummated
  their vengeance by making him a martyr. The exile of St. Helena
  acted differently. When he conquered, instead of viciously
  overrunning the enemy's country and spreading misery and
  devastation, he made what he wished to be lasting peace, and
  allowed the sovereigns to retain their thrones. How often did he
  carry out this act of generosity towards Prussia and Austria,
  <a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>and who can deny that he did
  not act benevolently towards Alexander of Russia, when at
  Austerlitz and Tilsit, he formed what he regarded as lasting
  personal friendship with the Czar! It is all moonshine to say
  that he broke the friendship. The power of Russia, Prussia, and
  Austria were hopelessly wrecked more than once, and on each
  occasion they intrigued him into war again, and then threw
  themselves at his feet, grovelling supplicants for mercy, which
  he never withheld.</p>

  <p>Well might he exclaim to Caulaincourt, his ambassador in 1814,
  when the congress was sitting at Chatillon: "These people will
  not treat; the position is reversed; they have forgotten my
  conduct to them at Tilsit. Then I could have crushed them; my
  clemency was simple folly."</p>

  <p>The nations who treated him with such unreasonable severity
  would do well to reflect over the unfathomable folly of the past,
  and try to realize, at the present stage of their critical
  existence, that it may be possible that human life is reaping the
  agonies of a terrible retribution for a crime an important public
  in every civilized country believed, and still continues to
  believe, to have been committed. It is a natural law of life that
  no mysterious physical force ever dies, but only changes its form
  and direction. Individuals and vast communities may dare to mock
  at the great mystery that we do not understand. But it is a
  perilous experiment to defy its visitations. What incalculable
  results may arise through taking the wrong attitude towards the
  great laws that govern our being!</p>

  <p><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>The autocratic rulers at
  the beginning of the last century were never right in their views
  as to how the vastly greater image than their own should be
  treated. They measured Napoleon and his loftier qualities by
  their own tumultuous limitations, which prevented them from
  seeing how wide the gulf was between him and the ordinary man. He
  was a magical personality, and they failed to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>Heinrich Heine, the great German writer, who was pro-Napoleon,
  has told a vivid story of how he visited the East India Docks,
  while he was in London, and there saw a large sailing vessel with
  a great number of coloured people on board, Mohammedans for the
  most part. He wished to speak to them but did not know their
  language. He was particularly anxious to show them some courtesy
  if even, as he says, in a single word, so he reverently called
  out the name "Mohammed." In an instant the countenance of these
  strange people beamed with pleasure, and with characteristic
  Eastern devotion bowed themselves and shouted back to him
  "Bonaparte."</p>

  <p>I have no thought, in writing of Napoleon, to draw a
  comparison between him and the ex-Kaiser and his guilty
  coadjutors in crime, who forced a peaceful world into unspeakable
  war. They have been guilty of the foulest of murders, which will
  outmatch in ferocity every phase of human barbarity. There can be
  no pardon or pity for them. They must pay the penalty of their
  crimes, as other criminals have to do. The following letter,
  addressed by William II to his late colleague <a name="Page_312"
  id="Page_312"></a>in guilt, the Emperor Joseph of Austria, is
  enough in itself to set the whole world into a blaze of
  vengeance:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"My soul is torn," says this canting outcast, "but
    everything must be put to fire and sword, men, women, children,
    and old men must be slaughtered, and not a tree or house be
    left standing. With these methods of terrorism, which are alone
    capable of affecting a people so degenerate as the French, the
    war will be over in two months, whereas if I admit humanitarian
    considerations, it will last years. In spite of my repugnance,
    I have, therefore, been obliged to choose the former
    system."</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is hard to believe that a document of this kind could be
  written by any one that was not far gone in lunacy, but in any
  case, I repeat it is to be hoped that St. Helena will not be
  desecrated by sending him to that hallowed abode.</p>

  <p>It is never a difficult performance to become involved in war,
  and it is always a tax on human genius to find a decent way out
  of it; whether it be honourable or dishonourable does not matter
  to those who believe in conflict as a solution of international
  disputes. History can safely be challenged to prove that anything
  but wild wrath and ruin is the unfailing outcome of war to all
  the belligerents, whether few or many. More often than not, it is
  brought about by the exulting chatter of a few irrepressible and
  also irresponsible individuals who have military or political
  ambitions to look after, and no other faculty of reason or
  vocabulary than the gibberish "that war will clear the air." They
  ostentatiously claim a monopoly of patriotism; and convey their
  <a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>views on war matters with a
  blustering levity which is a marvel to the astonished soul. Their
  attitude towards human existence is that you cannot be a patriot
  or create a great nation unless you are bellicose and
  warlike.</p>

  <p>This was the deplorable condition of mind that involved us in
  the wars subsequent to the French Revolution. But the
  diplomatists (if it be proper to call them such) and the
  oligarchy were responsible for the ruptures at that period, and
  certainly not the general public. In fact, it is doubtful whether
  the <i>general public</i> are ever in favour of breaking the
  peace. A minority may be, but they are the noisy and unreflecting
  section. There is a wide difference between the Napoleonic wars
  and that which was waged against the civilized world by the
  German Kaiser and his military myrmidons, who have acted
  throughout like wild beasts. There never has been perpetrated so
  atrocious a crime as the deliberately planned military outrage on
  the peace of the world.</p>

  <p>The brief comparison between Kaiser William and Napoleon
  Bonaparte is that the one, like Frederick, the hero of Thomas
  Carlyle, is a shameless traitor to every act of human decency,
  and the other, in spite of what biassed writers have thought it
  their duty to say of him, was an unparalleled warrior-statesman,
  and his motives and actions were all on the side of God's
  humanity and good government. From the time he was found and made
  the head of the French nation, he was always obliged to be on the
  defensive, and, <a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>as he
  stated, never once declared war. The continental Great Powers
  always made war on <i>him</i>, but not without his thrashing them
  soundly until they pleaded in their humility to be allowed to
  lick his boots. You may search English State papers in any musty
  hole you like, and you will find no authoritative record that
  comes within miles of justifying the opinions or the charges that
  have been stated or written against him. Let us not commit the
  sacrilege, if he is ever made prisoner and is not shot for the
  murders and cruelties he and his subjects have committed on
  British men and women at sea and on land, of deporting the Kaiser
  to St. Helena to desecrate the ground made sacred for all time
  because of the great Emperor who was an exile there. Force of
  circumstances made Louis Philippe declare the truth to the
  world's new generations (doubtless to save his own precious skin)
  that "he was not only an emperor, but a king from the very day
  that the French nation called upon him to be their ruler." The
  kingly Louis would have given worlds not to have been compelled
  to say this truth of him, but his crown was at stake.</p>

  <p>The Senate voted with enthusiasm that he should be First
  Consul for ten years, and he replied to the vote of confidence
  that "Fortune had smiled upon the Republic; but Fortune was
  inconstant; how many men," said he, "upon whom she has heaped her
  favours have lived too long by some years, and that the interest
  of his glory and happiness seemed to have marked the period of
  his public life, at the moment when the peace <a name="Page_315"
  id="Page_315"></a>of the world is proclaimed." Then with one of
  those spasmodic impulses that compel attention, he darts an arrow
  right on the spot; "If," he says, "you think I owe the nation a
  new sacrifice, I will make it; that is, if the <i>wishes of the
  people</i> correspond with the command authorized by their
  suffrages." Always the suffrages, you observe, and never the
  miserable, slandering, backbiting dodges of the treasonists.</p>

  <p>The mind of this remarkable man was a palatial storehouse of
  wise, impressive inspirations. Here is one of countless instances
  where a prejudiced adversary bears testimony to his power and
  wisdom. A few Republican officers sought and were granted an
  audience, and the following is a frank admission of their own
  impotence and Napoleon's greatness: "I do not know," their
  spokesman says, "from whence or from whom he derives it, but
  there is a charm about that man indescribable and irresistible. I
  am no admirer of his." Such persons always preface any statement
  they are about to make by asserting their own superiority in this
  way, and the officers, who, with others, had many imaginary
  grievances against Napoleon, determined to empty their
  overburdened souls to him. This gallant person emphasizes the
  fact that he dislikes "the power to which he (Napoleon) had
  risen," yet he cannot help confessing (evidently with reluctance)
  that there is something in him which seems to speak that he is
  born to command. "We went into his apartment to expostulate
  warmly with him, and not to depart until our complaints were
  removed. But by his manner of receiving <a name="Page_316" id=
  "Page_316"></a>us we were disarmed in a moment, and could not
  utter one word of what we were going to say. He talked to us with
  an eloquence peculiarly his own, and explained with clearness and
  precision the importance of pursuing the line of conduct he had
  adopted, never contradicting us in direct terms, but controverted
  our opinions so astutely that we had not a single word to offer
  in reply, and retired convinced that he was in the right and that
  we were manifestly in the wrong." It is a common delusion with
  little men to believe that they are big with wisdom and
  knowledge, even after they have been ravelled to shreds by a man
  of real ability. The French Republican officers were
  condescendingly candid in giving the First Consul a high
  character, and he, in turn, made these self-assertive gentlemen
  feel abashed in his presence, and sent them about their business
  without having made any unnatural effort to prove that they had
  had an interview with a majestic personality, who had made
  articulation impossible to them. I might give thousands of
  testimonies, showing the great power this superman had over other
  minds, from the highest monarchical potentate to the humblest of
  his subjects. The former were big with a combination of fear and
  envy. They would deign to grovel at his feet, slaver compliments,
  and deluge him with adulation (if he would have allowed them),
  and then proceed to stab him from behind in the most cowardly
  fashion. There are always swarms of human insects whose habits of
  life range between the humble supplicant and the stinging,
  poisonous wasps.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>It would have been better
  for the whole civilized world had there been more wisely clever
  men, such as Charles James Fox, in public life in this and other
  countries during Napoleon's time. He was the one great Englishman
  who towered above any of the ministers who were contemporary with
  him in this country, and certainly no public man had a finer
  instinct than he as to the policy Great Britain should observe
  towards a nation that was being dragged out of the cesspool of
  corruption and violence into a democratic grandeur of government
  that was the envy of Continental as well as British antiquarians.
  Fox saw clearly the manifest benefit to both countries if they
  could be made to understand and not to envy each other. In 1802,
  Fox was received in Paris like a highly popular monarch. The
  whole city went wild with the joy of having him as the guest of
  France. He was the great attraction at the theatres next to the
  First Consul, whom Fox declared "was a most decided character,
  that would hold to his purpose with more constancy and through a
  longer interval than is imagined; his views are not directed to
  this, i.e. the United Kingdom, but to the Continent only." "I
  never saw," he says, "so little indirectness in any statesman as
  in the First Consul." Had Fox been supported by sufficient strong
  men to counteract the baneful influence of the weeds who were a
  constant peril to the country over whose destinies George III and
  they ruled, we should have been saved the ghastly errors that
  were committed in the name of the British people. The King's
  dislike to Fox <a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>was openly
  avowed. He used to talk incessantly of going back to Hanover
  whenever he was thwarted in his disastrous policy of giving the
  country a stab, or when the inevitable brought Fox into office.
  Everything that emanated from the great statesman was viewed with
  aversion and as being unjust and indecent by the royal
  Lilliputian, while Fox's estimate of the King could not be
  uttered on a lower plane. He says, in speaking of His Majesty,
  "It is intolerable to think that it should be in the power of
  <i>one</i> blockhead to do so much mischief"&mdash;meaning, I
  presume, amongst many other blunders, the mess he was persisting
  in making over American affairs.</p>

  <p>Had there been capable statesmen during that crisis, the
  Continent of Europe and the vast dominions of Great Britain would
  not have been at war this day with the pernicious Power that we,
  more than any other nation, as has been previously stated, helped
  to create and foster.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>Fox was the only genius in our political life at that time,
  while Pitt was a mere shadow in comparison, though it is fair to
  state that the former always believed that he and Pitt would have
  made a workable combination. As to the rest, they were pretty
  much on the level of the Lilliputians with whom the late
  traveller, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, had such intimate and troublesome
  relations. The book <a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>by the
  Dean of St. Patrick's, "Gulliver's Travels," is a perfect
  caricature of the political dwarfs of his time, and vividly
  represents the men who misruled this country in George III's
  reign. But the Dean's laughable history of the pompous antics of
  the Lilliputians is a picture which describes the constitution of
  our present administration who are managing the critical affairs
  of the nation so ill that disaster is inevitable in many forms,
  seen and unseen. The administrative machine is clogged with
  experimental human odds and ends who have neither wit, knowledge,
  nor wisdom to fill the post allotted to them, and the appalling
  thought is that the nation as a whole is being blustered by the
  intriguers who are forcing every national interest into certain
  destruction. Truly the Lilliputians are a plague on all human
  interests, <i>real</i> patriotism, and capacity: always
  mischievous, always incapable, just the same now as when, in the
  eighteenth century, their type forced a peaceful and neutral
  Power into war because they refused to yield their fleet to them;
  always seeing things that do not exist, and foreboding perils
  that would never have come but for their dwarfish interference.
  They discovered in their flights of frenzy and fancy that
  Napoleon intended to take possession by force of the Danish
  fleet, when, as a matter of fact, he had never shown any
  indication, by word or thought, of committing an act so unjust
  and hostile to his own interests. A strong point in his policy
  was to keep Denmark on terms of friendly neutrality. Moreover, he
  was not, as many writers have said <a name="Page_320" id=
  "Page_320"></a>(in loyalty to fashion), an unscrupulous breaker
  of treaties. It was an unworthy act of the British Government to
  send Mr. Jackson as their representative to bully the Danes into
  giving up their fleet to the British, on the plea that they had
  learned by reports through various channels what Napoleon's
  intentions were. Count Bernsdorf, to whom Jackson insolently
  conveyed the nightmare of his Government, very properly raged
  back at him that "the Danish Government had no such information,
  and that he was adducing false reports and mere surmises quite
  unworthy of credit to fill the measure of British injustice in
  forcing Denmark into a ruinous war. It was folly to suppose that
  Napoleon could gain anything by throwing Norway and Denmark into
  an alliance with England and Sweden." Then he adds, with a
  dignified sense of wrong, "that the Regent knew how to defend his
  neutrality." "It might be possible," retorts Mr. Jackson, "though
  appearances are against that supposition, that the Danish
  Government <i>did not wish</i> to lend itself to hostile views;
  still, it could not resist France." Then Bernsdorf, who has right
  on his side, said in accents of crushing anger, "So! because you
  think Napoleon has the intention of wounding us in the tenderest
  part, you would struggle with him for priority and be the first
  to do the deed?" "Yes," responds the distinguished representative
  of the upholders of the rights of nations, "Great Britain would
  insist upon a pledge of amity." "What pledge," demands the Count.
  "The pledge of uniting the Danish forces to those of Great
  Britain," is the reply.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>It will be seen that
  nothing short of vassalism will satisfy the policy laid down by
  the stupid emancipationists of downtrodden nations, as
  represented by the impressive effrontery of the noble Jackson.
  What a terrible piece of wooden-headed history was the effort to
  force Denmark to break her neutrality or make war on her! They
  seized Zealand, and because the Prince Regent refused to agree to
  their perfidy, they kept possession of it. The Prince sent
  written instructions to burn all the ships and stores, but the
  messenger was captured and the faithful person to whom the
  delivery of the document was entrusted swallowed it (i.e.
  swallowed the instructions). Copenhagen had been bombarded and
  practically reduced to destruction by Nelson, who had settled
  with the Danes on favourable British terms, one of the conditions
  being that they were to leave with their booty in six weeks. The
  Regent subsequently declared war and outwitted the British
  designs (so it is said) on Zealand.</p>

  <p>Castlereagh sought the aid of Lord Cathcart to find a dodge by
  which his Government could inveigle the Danes to commit a breach
  of the Convention, but the latter stood firm by the conditions,
  and the commanders, being disgusted with the whole affair,
  declined to aid their Chiefs in the Government in any act of
  double dealing. But they had the Emperor Alexander of Russia to
  deal with. He offered to act as intermediary between Great
  Britain and France in order to bring about an honourable peace.
  The British Government refused, and it is stated on incon<a name=
  "Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>trovertible authority that Alexander
  was furious, and upbraided the British with having used troops,
  which should have been sent to Russia's aid, to crush Denmark.
  The outrage of attacking a small State which was at peace and
  with which she had no quarrel was powerfully denounced by
  Alexander. He accused the British Government "of a monstrous
  violation of straight dealing, by ruining Denmark in the Baltic,
  which it knew was closed to foreign hostilities under a Russian
  guarantee."</p>

  <p>This caused Alexander to break off relations with Great
  Britain and annul all treaties he had with her. Canning feebly
  replied to the Russian Emperor's taunts, and, amongst other
  things, accused him of throwing over the King of the Huns. No
  wonder that Russia and some of the other Powers resented the
  perfidious conduct of British statesmen, employing British
  military and naval forces to overthrow and destroy not only a
  friendly Power, but one of the smallest and most strictly neutral
  States in Europe! Alexander jibed at them for using their
  resources for this unjust purpose, instead of sending them to
  help him when he was being so desperately driven to defeat by
  Napoleon. What a loutish trick it was to imagine that any real
  political or practical benefit could be derived from it! The
  seizure of the Danish fleet was a low-down act, for which those
  who were responsible should have been pilloried. The reasons
  given could not be sustained at the time, and still remain
  entirely unsupported by fact. There is no more disgraceful
  proceeding to <a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>be found in
  the pages of history than our raid on this small and highly
  honourable, inoffensive, and brave people.</p>

  <p>This bad statesmanship was deplorable. It set the spirit of
  butchery raging. It made a new enemy for ourselves, and in an
  economic sense added hundreds of thousands to our national debt,
  without deriving a vestige of benefit from either a military or
  political point of view. It undoubtedly prolonged the war, as all
  those squint-eyed enterprises are certain to do. It made us
  unpopular and mistrusted, and had no effect in damaging
  Napoleon's activities, nor of taking a single ally from him.
  There are occasions when nations have forced upon them cruel
  stratagems and alternatives, revolting in their abominable
  unworthiness, but in the case I am discussing I have found no
  substantial justification, nor has the deed been backed up to now
  or supported by a single <i>real</i> authority. Nothing but
  condemnation still hangs round the memory of those hapless
  ministers who made the world so full of misery. I repeat, the
  greatest of all perils is to have a Government composed of men
  whose brains are full of kinks, and who do not reach beyond the
  bounds of basing their policy on the idea that some foreigner or
  other has designs on our national wealth, our trade, or our vast
  protectorates. In recent years that view has been dissipated, and
  the plan of broadening the national goodwill to men has been
  adopted and encouraged by a body of sound, unpretentious thinkers
  who have taken pains to train important gifts in the art of good
  government in all its varied <a name="Page_324" id=
  "Page_324"></a>aspects and international complexities. The whole
  public have had to pay appalling penalties in the past because an
  impulsive handful of the population is of opinion that
  self-advertising, harum-scarum politicians, in and out of office,
  are the geniuses who make and keep prosperity. This uncontrolled,
  emotional trend of thought comes in cycles and is unerringly
  followed by bitter disillusionment. It was so during the wars at
  the beginning of the last century, and it is so now. We always
  reflect after the tragedy has been consummated. Safe and astute
  administrators are always termed the "old gang" by the political
  amateurs, and the calamity is that a large public is so often
  carried away by the flighty delusions of the real cranks who
  style themselves the saviours of their country. At the present
  time we have as sure an example as ever the known world has
  witnessed of the awful disaster the resignation of the "old gang"
  has been to the whole of the Powers interested in this world-war,
  especially to our own country. We shall realize this more fully
  by and by when the naked truth presents itself. The very people
  who are conspicuously responsible for the destruction of unity
  always bellow the loudest to maintain it after they have been the
  high conspirators in breaking it, aided by their guilty
  followers. What bitter lessons this land of ours has been
  subjected to in other days! For twenty years the country was kept
  in the vortex of a raging war, with no more justification than
  giving Mr. Jackson instructions that the one imperative idea to
  keep in his mind was to take possession of the Danish fleet.
  <a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>Nothing was to stand in the
  way of this great adventure, shameless though it might be.</p>

  <p>Lord Malmesbury writes in his diary: "Capture of Danish fleet
  by surprise on account of most undoubted information received
  from the Prince Regent of Portugal of Bonaparte's intention to
  use the Portuguese and Danish fleets for invasion of England.
  First hint of the plan given by the Prince of Wales to the Duke
  of Portland. The Portuguese refused the demand, and told the
  British Government of it; the Danes accepted, kept silence, and
  afterwards denied it." The entry in Malmesbury's diary has been
  proved to be a string of pure inventions, for which he or some
  other informants are responsible. I have said no record has been
  left to show that Napoleon ever had any intention of occupying
  the ports of Holstein or of using the Danish fleet for the
  invasion of Great Britain and Ireland. Members of Parliament in
  the House of Commons and members of the House of Lords proved
  beyond question that ministers' statements, taking the dates into
  account, were entirely erroneous. Canning defended the sending of
  the expedition, which was natural, as he was one of the principal
  advocates of it. But the House would stand none of his tricks of
  evasion or repudiation. He, like some more modern ministers,
  ventured on the hazardous plan of deceiving Parliament, and, as
  was said at the time, setting fair dealing at defiance. Canning,
  like all tricksters, read extracts from documents, authentic and
  otherwise, to prove that Denmark was hostile to Britain, but when
  a demand was <a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>made for their
  inspection, he impudently refused to allow the very documents he
  had based his case of justification on to be scrutinized, and in
  consequence no other conclusion could be arrived at than that he
  was unscrupulously misleading the country. In fact, the
  Government's case was so bad it would not bear the light of God's
  day!</p>

  <p>I venture to say that Mr. Fox knew more of the character,
  political intricacies, and ambitions of the French race than any
  public man or writer of history of his own or in subsequent
  years. He always based his conclusions on a sound logical point.
  He was an accurate thinker, who refused to form his judgments on
  light, faulty and inaccurate newspaper paragraphs about what was
  going on around him. He was opposed to Pitt and his supporters'
  policy of carrying on war with France. He wanted peace, but they
  wanted the Bourbons, because the Bourbon section in France and
  the old autocracy in his own and other kingly countries were
  opposed to the new ruler the masses in France had chosen. He
  ridiculed the folly of our mental nonentities for "making such a
  fuss about acknowledging the new Emperor. May not the people give
  their own Magistrate the name they choose?" he asks. "On what
  logical grounds did we claim the right to revoke by the force of
  arms the selection by the French people of a ruler on whom they
  wished to bestow the title of Emperor?" Fox poured lavishly his
  withering contempt on those miscreants who arrogantly claimed the
  right to be consulted (for that is practically what their war
  policy amounted to) as to who the French should put <a name=
  "Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>on the throne and what his title
  should be. They had acknowledged Napoleon in the capacity of
  First Consul, but they shuddered at the consequences to the human
  race of having an Emperor sprung upon them whose glory was
  putting kingship into obscurity. Besides, an Emperor who combined
  humble origin with democratic genius and ambition created by the
  Revolution was a challenge to the legitimacy of the Divine Right
  of Kings and a reversal of the order of ages. George III raged at
  Pitt for including Fox in his Ministry when he was asked to form
  a Government. "Does Mr. Pitt," said he, "not know that Mr. Fox
  was of all persons most offensive to him?" "Had not Fox always
  cheered the popular Government of France, and had he not always
  advocated peace with bloodstained rebels? And be it remembered
  the indecorous language he had frequently used against his
  sovereign, and consider his influence over the Prince of Wales.
  Bring whom you like, Mr. Pitt, but Fox never."</p>

  <p>George III, King by the Grace of God, relented somewhat in his
  dislike of Fox before the latter died, and his wayward son, the
  Prince of Wales, said "that his father was well pleased with Mr.
  Fox in all their dealings after he came into office." It is an
  amazing form of intelligence that commits a nation to join in a
  war against another for having brought about a revolution and for
  creating their first soldier-statesman an "Emperor," and ranks
  him and his compatriots as "bloodstained rebels." To class
  Napoleon as a bloodstained rebel and to put him on a level
  <a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>with the Robespierres and
  the Dantons is an historic outrage of the truth. He had nothing
  whatever to do with bringing about the Revolution, though his
  services saved it, and out of the terrible tumult and wreck
  superhumanly re-created France and made her the envy of the
  modern world. The great defender of the Rights of Kings and of
  the colossal European fabric was appealed to by the man whom
  George III associated with the "bloodstained rebels" to come to
  some common understanding so that the shedding of blood might
  cease, but that robust advocate of peace (!) contemptuously
  ignored his appeals to negotiate. In 1805 he was raised to the
  Imperial dignity, and one of his first acts was to write with his
  own hand that famous letter which I have previously quoted,
  pleading, with majestic dignity, for the King of England, in the
  name of humanity, to co-operate with him in a way that will bring
  about friendly relations between the two Governments and the
  spilling of blood to an end. The King "by the Grace of God" and
  his horde of bloodsucking, incompetent ministers insulted the
  French nation and the great captain who ruled over its destinies
  by sending through Lord Mulgrave an insolent, hypocritical reply
  to the French ministers.</p>

  <p>The rage of war continued for another decade. If George III
  yearned for peace as he and his ministers pretended, why did the
  King not write a courteous autograph letter back to Napoleon,
  even though he regarded him as an inferior and a mere military
  adventurer? The nation had to <a name="Page_329" id=
  "Page_329"></a>pay a heavy toll in blood and money in order that
  the assumptions and dignity of this insensate monarch might be
  maintained, whose abhorrence of "bloodstained rebels" did not
  prevent him and his equally insensate advisers from plunging the
  American colonists into a bloody rebellion, which ended so
  gloriously for them and so disastrously for the motherland. They
  had asked for reforms that were palpably reasonable and
  necessary, and received insulting replies to their courteous
  demands, which compelled them to take up arms against the King of
  England, with a vow that they would not sheathe the sword until
  they had won complete independence from the arrogant autocracy
  that had driven them to war.</p>

  <p>They were led by the noble genius of George Washington and Dr.
  Franklin, who were in turn strongly supported by and united to
  colleagues of high constructive and administrative talents. Their
  task was long and fierce, but the gallant, elusive Washington led
  them through the tremendous struggle to victory, which culminated
  in founding the greatest and best constituted of all republics,
  whose sons are fighting side by side with the descendants of
  those who were forced into fighting their own race, through the
  maladministration of the King and his guilty Government, at the
  head of which was the genial but ultra-reactionary Lord North,
  who was a special favourite of George because he was
  accommodating; and indeed, all the King's friends were
  reactionary and dangerous to the real interests of the State when
  in power. The King's terrific responsibility for <a name=
  "Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>the great calamities that befell the
  country during his reign can only be absolved by the knowledge
  that he was subject to fits of prolonged lunacy; in fact, it may
  be said that even in his saner periods his acts were frequently
  those of an idiot. Though he cannot be accused of lacking in
  integrity, he disliked men who were possessed of that virtue,
  coupled with enlightened views, having anything to do with the
  government of the State. In short, he was totally unsuited to
  govern at any time, but especially when the atmosphere was
  charged with violent human convulsions. He loved lick-spittles,
  because they did his will for value received in various sordid
  forms, and, as I have said, he loathed the incorruptible and
  brilliant Charles James Fox, because he refused to support his
  fatal policies and that of the cocksparrow members of his
  Government, who from time to time threatened the very foundations
  of our national existence.</p>

  <p>The more George persisted, the louder became Fox's protests.
  Posterity can never accurately estimate how much it owes to
  statesmen who acted with Fox, but the influences the King had
  behind him were too formidable for Fox to grapple with. He would
  have saved us from the fratricidal war with America, and from the
  unpardonable wickedness of involving the country in the wars with
  France, who was fighting out her own prodigious destiny on the
  Continent, which was no concern of ours, except that the sane
  policy of the King and his Government should have been to
  encourage the democratizing of the Continental States. It was no
  love of liberty, <a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>or for the
  people, or for reforms of any kind, that led George III and his
  satellites to wage war against the man of the French Revolution.
  It was the fear of placing more power in the hands of the people
  and allowing less to remain in his own. But the main fear of the
  King and his autocratic subjects was lest Napoleon would become
  so powerful that he would destroy the whole monarchy of Europe!
  It was the view of small-minded men. Even Napoleon had his
  limitations, even if this had been his object. But there was no
  symptom, except that of panic, to justify the assertion that he
  ever intended to include war on the United Kingdom in his policy.
  There never was a truer statement made by the Emperor than "C'est
  avec des hochets qu'on m&egrave;ne les hommes"; which is, "Men
  are led by trifles." Hence we went to war with him, and the
  result of it is that the race that he mistrusted most and saw the
  necessity of keeping severely within limits has risen up against
  civilization and created a world-war into which we and our Allies
  have been obliged to enter in self-defence. That is the
  inevitable penalty we are having to pay for the action we took in
  helping the Germans to destroy France. I know it is asserted it
  was not France but Napoleon whose power they aimed at breaking,
  but the one could not be broken without the other.</p>

  <h3>EXPLANATORY NOTE</h3>

  <p>These quaint old doggerel songs are taken from an admirable
  selection of sailor songs published by John Ashton. The names of
  the writers are not given, but their strong nautical flavour and
  queer composition indicate their origin. No landsman can ever
  imitate the sailor when the power of song or composition is on
  him. He puts his own funny sentiment and descriptive faculty into
  his work, which is exclusively his own.</p>

  <p>Many of the songs in Mr. Ashton's book I have heard sung with
  great fervour in my early days, by a generation of men ahead of
  my own, who must have long since passed away. Sometimes the
  audiences in the forecastle or on deck were appreciative of the
  efforts of the singer, but if they were not, they always had a
  boot or some other handy implement ready to throw at him. The
  reception given to some of my own singing efforts in boyhood on
  these merry occasions was mixed. Sometimes I forgot both words
  and tune, and had, therefore, to pass good-humouredly through the
  orthodox process of disapproval that was regarded as part of the
  entertainment.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>Any song or recital
  concerning Nelson, Collingwood, or the later sea hero, Charley
  Napier, was eminently popular, and to break down in the rendering
  of any one of these was an offence to their exalted memories.
  "The Sailor's Grave," which I regret is not included in Mr.
  Ashton's collection, was in great demand when the sailors were in
  a solemn mood. Both the words and the tune were ridiculously
  weird, and when it came to the details of the hero's illness, his
  looks after death, the sewing up in his hammock, and the tying of
  two round shots at his feet for sinking purposes, the artist
  always sang with his hands linked in front of him and his eyes
  cast heavenward gazing fixedly at a spot on the ceiling. Then
  came the burial verse:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span>A splash and a plunge, and his task was
      o'er,<br /></span> <span>And the billows rolled as they
      rolled before,<br /></span> <span>And many a wild prayer
      followed the brave,<br /></span> <span>As he sunk beneath a
      sailor's grave.<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This verse always drew tears from the sentimentalists in the
  audience, and if the singer had pleased by his efforts the song
  ended in a roar of tumultuous applause.</p>

  <p>I have thought it appropriate to add to these doggerel rhymes
  "The Battle of Copenhagen," "The Death of Nelson," and "The
  <i>Arethusa</i>." These are sea songs, not sailor's songs, and
  are of distinctly greater merit, but as two of them deal with
  Nelson, and as all three have always been most popular, they may
  not be out of place here.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
