				<h3>THE DONG WITH A LUMINOUS NOSE.</h3>
				<p>
				<span class="largecap">W</span>hen awful darkness and silence reign<br />
				Over the great Gromboolian plain,<br />
				<span class="i2">Through the long, long wintry nights;</span>
				When the angry breakers roar<br />
				As they beat on the rocky shore;<br />
				<span class="i2">When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</span>
				Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore,&#8212;
				</p>
				<p>
				Then, through the vast and gloomy dark<br />
				There moves what seems a fiery spark,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i2">A lonely spark with silvery rays</span>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page342" id="page342" title="342"></a>
				<span class="i4">Piercing the coal-black night,&#8212;</span>
				<span class="i4">A Meteor strange and bright:</span>
				<span class="i2">Hither and thither the vision strays,</span>
				<span class="i4">A single lurid light.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Slowly it wanders, pauses, creeps,&#8212;<br />
				Anon it sparkles, flashes, and leaps;<br />
				And ever as onward it gleaming goes<br />
				A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.<br />
				And those who watch at that midnight hour<br />
				From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,<br />
				Cry, as the wild light passes along,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i4">"The Dong! the Dong!</span>
				<span class="i2">The wandering Dong through the forest goes!</span>
				<span class="i4">The Dong! the Dong!</span>
				<span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!"</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="i4">Long years ago</span>
				<span class="i2">The Dong was happy and gay,</span>
				Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl<br />
				<span class="i2">Who came to those shores one day.</span>
				For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did,&#8212;<br />
				Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd<br />
				<span class="i4">Where the Oblong Oysters grow,</span>
				<span class="i2">And the rocks are smooth and gray.</span>
				And all the woods and the valleys rang<br />
				With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang,&#8212;<br />
				<i><span class="i6">"Far and few, far and few,</span>
				<span class="i6">Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</span>
				<span class="i6">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</span>
				<span class="i6">And they went to sea in a sieve."</span></i>
				</p>
				<p>
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page343" id="page343" title="343"></a>
				Happily, happily passed those days!<br />
				<span class="i8">While the cheerful Jumblies staid;</span>
				<span class="i4">They danced in circlets all night long,</span>
				<span class="i4">To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,</span>
				<span class="i8">In moonlight, shine, or shade.</span>
				For day and night he was always there<br />
				By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,<br />
				With her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;<br />
				Till the morning came of that hateful day<br />
				When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,<br />
				And the Dong was left on the cruel shore<br />
				Gazing, gazing for evermore,&#8212;<br />
				Ever keeping his weary eyes on<br />
				That pea-green sail on the far horizon,&#8212;<br />
				Singing the Jumbly Chorus still<br />
				As he sate all day on the grassy hill,&#8212;<br />
				<i><span class="i10">"Far and few, far and few,</span>
				<span class="i10">Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</span>
				<span class="i10">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</span>
				<span class="i10">And they went to sea in a sieve."</span></i>
				</p>
				<p>
				But when the sun was low in the West,<br />
				<span class="i4">The Dong arose and said,&#8212;</span>
				&#8212;"What little sense I once possessed<br />
				<span class="i4">Has quite gone out of my head!"</span>
				And since that day he wanders still<br />
				By lake and forest, marsh and hill,<br />
				Singing, "O somewhere, in valley or plain,<br />
				Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!<br />
				For ever I'll seek by lake and shore<br />
				Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!"
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page344" id="page344" title="344"></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="i2">Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,</span>
				<span class="i2">Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks;</span>
				<span class="i2">And because by night he could not see,</span>
				<span class="i2">He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</span>
				<span class="i4">On the flowery plain that grows.</span>
				<span class="i4">And he wove him a wondrous Nose,&#8212;</span>
				<span class="i2">A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!</span>
				Of vast proportions and painted red,<br />
				And tied with cords to the back of his head.<br />
				<span class="i2">&#8212;In a hollow rounded space it ended</span>
				<span class="i2">With a luminous Lamp within suspended,</span>
				<span class="i4">All fenced about</span>
				<span class="i4">With a bandage stout</span>
				<span class="i4">To prevent the wind from blowing it out;</span>
				<span class="i2">And with holes all round to send the light</span>
				<span class="i2">In gleaming rays on the dismal night</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				And now each night, and all night long,<br />
				Over those plains still roams the Dong;<br />
				And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe<br />
				You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,<br />
				While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,<br />
				To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;<br />
				Lonely and wild, all night he goes,&#8212;<br />
				The Dong with a luminous Nose!<br />
				And all who watch at the midnight hour,<br />
				From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,<br />
				Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,<br />
				Moving along through the dreary night,&#8212;<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page345" id="page345" title="345"></a>
				<span class="i2">"This is the hour when forth he goes,</span>
				<span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!</span>
				<span class="i2">Yonder, over the plain he goes,&#8212;</span>
				<span class="i4">He goes!</span>
				<span class="i4">He goes,&#8212;</span>
				<span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!"</span>

				<h3>
				THE TWO OLD BACHELORS.
				</h3>
				<p>
				<span class="largecap">T</span>wo old Bachelors were living in one house;<br />
				One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.<br />
				Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse,&#8212;<br />
				"This happens just in time! For we've nothing in the house,<br />
				Save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey,<br />
				And what to do for dinner&#8212;since we haven't any money?<br />
				And what can we expect if we haven't any dinner,<br />
				But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?"
				</p>
				<p>
				Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin,&#8212;<br />
				"We might cook this little Mouse, if we only had some Stuffin'!<br />
				If we had but Sage and Onion we could do extremely well;<br />
				But how to get that Stuffin' it is difficult to tell!"
				</p>
				<p>
				Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town<br />
				And asked for Sage and Onion as they wandered up and down;<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page347" id="page347" title="347"></a>
				They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found<br />
				In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.
				</p>
				<p>
				But some one said, "A hill there is, a little to the north,<br />
				And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;<br />
				And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage,&#8212;<br />
				An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.<br />
				Climb up, and seize him by the toes,&#8212;all studious as he sits,&#8212;<br />
				And pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits!<br />
				Then mix him with your Onion (cut up likewise into Scraps),&#8212;<br />
				When your Stuffin' will be ready, and very good&#8212;perhaps."
				</p>
				<p>
				Those two old Bachelors without loss of time<br />
				The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;<br />
				And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,<br />
				They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book.
				</p>
				<p>
				"You earnest Sage!" aloud they cried, "your book you've read enough in!<br />
				We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin'!"
				</p>
				<p>
				But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,<br />
				At those two Bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took;<br />
				And over Crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,&#8212;<br />
				At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town;<br />
				And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want of Stuffin'),<br />
				The Mouse had fled&#8212;and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin.
				</p>
				<p>
				They left their home in silence by the once convivial door;<br />
				And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more.

				<h3>
				THE PELICAN CHORUS.
				</h3>
				<img src="images/408.gif" alt="The Pelican Chorus" />
				<p>
				<span class="largecap">K</span>ing and Queen of the Pelicans we;<br />
				No other Birds so grand we see!<br />
				None but we have feet like fins!<br />
				With lovely leathery throats and chins!<br />
				<span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i2">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i2">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican Jill!</span>
				<span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				We live on the Nile. The Nile we love.<br />
				By night we sleep on the cliffs above;<br />
				By day we fish, and at eve we stand<br />
				On long bare islands of yellow sand.<br />
				And when the sun sinks slowly down,<br />
				And the great rock walls grow dark and brown,<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page350" id="page350" title="350"></a>
				Where the purple river rolls fast and dim<br />
				And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim,<br />
				Wing to wing we dance around,<br />
				Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,<br />
				Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought;<br />
				And this is the song we nightly snort,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Last year came out our Daughter Dell,<br />
				And all the Birds received her well.<br />
				To do her honor a feast we made<br />
				For every bird that can swim or wade,&#8212;<br />
				Herons and Gulls, and Cormorants black,<br />
				Cranes, and Flamingoes with scarlet back,<br />
				Plovers and Storks, and Geese in clouds,<br />
				Swans and Dilberry Ducks in crowds:<br />
				Thousands of Birds in wondrous flight!<br />
				They ate and drank and danced all night,<br />
				And echoing back from the rocks you heard<br />
				Multitude-echoes from Bird and Bird,&#8212;<br />
				<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Yes, they came; and among the rest<br />
				The King of the Cranes all grandly dressed.<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page351" id="page351" title="351"></a>
				Such a lovely tail! Its feathers float<br />
				Between the ends of his blue dress-coat;<br />
				With pea-green trowsers all so neat,<br />
				And a delicate frill to hide his feet<br />
				(For though no one speaks of it, every one knows<br />
				He has got no webs between his toes).<br />
				</p>
				<p>
				As soon as he saw our Daughter Dell,<br />
				In violent love that Crane King fell,&#8212;<br />
				On seeing her waddling form so fair,<br />
				With a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.<br />
				And before the end of the next long day<br />
				Our Dell had given her heart away;<br />
				For the King of the Cranes had won that heart<br />
				With a Crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.<br />
				She vowed to marry the King of the Cranes,<br />
				Leaving the Nile for stranger plains;<br />
				And away they flew in a gathering crowd<br />
				Of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.<br />
				<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
				<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
				<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				And far away in the twilight sky<br />
				We heard them singing a lessening cry,&#8212;<br />
				Farther and farther, till out of sight,<br />
				And we stood alone in the silent night!<br />
				Often since, in the nights of June,<br />
				We sit on the sand and watch the moon,&#8212;<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page352" id="page352" title="352"></a>
				She has gone to the great Gromboolian Plain,<br />
				And we probably never shall meet again!<br />
				Oft, in the long still nights of June,<br />
				We sit on the rocks and watch the moon,&#8212;<br />
				She dwells by the streams of the Chankly Bore.<br />

				<span class="largecap">T</span>here lived an old man in the Kingdom of Tess,<br />
				Who invented a purely original dress;<br />
				And when it was perfectly made and complete,<br />
				He opened the door and walked into the street.
				</p>
				<p>
				By way of a hat he'd a loaf of Brown Bread,<br />
				In the middle of which he inserted his head;<br />
				His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,<br />
				The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;<br />
				His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins, so were his Shoes;<br />
				His Stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;<br />
				His Waistcoat and Trowsers were made of Pork Chops;<br />
				His Buttons were Jujubes and Chocolate Drops;<br />
				His Coat was all Pancakes, with Jam for a border,<br />
				And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;<br />
				And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,<br />
				A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.
				</p>
				<p>
				He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,<br />
				Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;<br />
				And from every long street and dark lane in the town<br />
				Beasts, Birdies, and Boys in a tumult rushed down.<br />
				Two Cows and a Calf ate his Cabbage-leaf Cloak;<br />
				Four Apes seized his Girdle, which vanished like smoke;<br />
				<a class="pagenumber" name="page364" id="page364" title="364"></a>
				Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,<br />
				And the tails were devour'd by an ancient He Goat;<br />
				An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore <i>up</i> his<br />
				Pork Waistcoat and Trowsers to give to their Puppies;<br />
				And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,<br />
				Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.<br />
				He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,<br />
				For scores of fat Pigs came again and again:<br />
				They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;<br />
				They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;<br />
				And now from the housetops with screechings descend<br />
				Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end:<br />
				They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,<br />
				When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;<br />
				They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,<br />
				And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;<br />
				They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall,&#8212;<br />
				Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.
				</p>
				<p>
				And he said to himself, as he bolted the door,<br />
				"I will not wear a similar dress any more,<br />
				Any more, any more, any more, never more!"

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
