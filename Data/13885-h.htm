<a name='INTRODUCTION'></a>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>One Sunday evening in the winter of 1890 Eugene Field and the
writer were walking in Lake View, Chicago, on their way to visit
the library of a common friend, when the subject of publishing a
book for Field came up for discussion.</p>

<p>The Little Book of Western Verse and The Little Book of
Profitable Tales had been privately printed the year before at
Chicago, and Field had been frequently reminded that the writer was
ready and willing to stand sponsor for any new volume he, Field,
might desire to bring out.</p>

<p>"The only thing I have on hand that might make a book," said
Field, "are some few paraphrases of the Odes of Horace which my
brother, 'Rose,' and I have been fooling over, and which, truth to
tell, are certainly freely rendered. There are not enough of them,
but we'll do some more, and I'll add a brief Life of Horace as a
preface or introduction."</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Field never carried out his intention
with respect to this last, for he had given much thought and study
to the great Roman satirist, and what Eugene Field could have said
upon the subject must have been of interest. It is my belief that
as he thought upon the matter it grew too great for him to handle
within the space he had at first determined, and that tucked away
within the recesses of his literary intentions was the
determination, nullified by his early death, to write, <i>con
amore</i>, a life of Quintus Horatius Flaccus.</p>

<p>This determination to write separately an extended account of
Horace greatly reduced the bulk of the material intended for the
Sabine Echoes, and it was with respect to this that Field
apologetically and, as was his wont, humorously wrote:</p>

<p>"The volume may be rather thin <i>in corpore</i>, but think how
hefty it will be intellectually."</p>

<p>When it came to the discussion of how many copies should be
printed it was suggested that the edition be an exceedingly limited
one, in order to cause as much scrambling and heartburning as
possible among our bibliophilic brethren. And never shall I forget
the seriousness of the man's face, nor the roars of laughter that
followed, when he suggested that fifty copies only should be made,
and that we should reserve one each and burn the other
forty-eight!</p>

<p>It was a biting cold night and we had been loitering by the way,
stopping to debate each point as it arose&mdash;but now we plunged
on with excess of motion to keep ourselves warm, breaking out with
occasional peals of laughter as we thought of our plan to make the
publication what the booksellers call "excessively rare."</p>

<p>Field, elsewhere, has said he did not know why the original
intention as to the destruction of the forty-eight copies was not
carried out, but the answer is not far away. As the time for
publication approached it was found impossible that such and such a
friend should be forgotten in the matter of a copy, and so it went
on until it was deemed prudent to add fifty to the number
originally intended to be issued, and that decision, in the light
of what followed, proved to be an eminently wise one. More than
once some to me unknown friend of Field would write a pleasant lie
as a reason to gain possession of the book, and up in a corner of
the letter would be found an endorsement of the request after this
fashion:</p>

<center>
<table summary="poem">
<tr>
<td><span style='margin-left: 3em;'>What's writ below</span><br>
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>I'd have you know</span><br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Nor falsehood nor romance
is;</span><br>
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>It's solemn truth,</span><br>
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So grant the youth</span><br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The boon he seeks, dear
Francis.</span><br>
<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>EUGENE FIELD.</span><br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to add that, however flimsy the
pretext upon which the request for a copy was made, it never failed
of its object if it brought with it Field's endorsement. Among many
pleasant utterances on this subject Field has said that but for the
writer the Horatian verses would not have been given to the
world&mdash;and this has been taken to mean more than was intended,
and much unearned praise has been bestowed. But, in allusion to the
original issue of the Odes, Field added, "in this charming guise,"
which places quite another construction upon the matter.</p>

<p>It may be that the enthusiasm displayed not only pleased Field,
and incited him and his brother Roswell to perform that which,
otherwise, might have been indefinitely deferred, but there is no
question but that they intended to publish the Horatian odes at
some time or another. Field was greatly delighted with the
reception of this work, and I once heard him say it would outlive
all his other books. He came naturally by his love of the classics.
His father was a splendid scholar who obliged his sons to
correspond with him in Latin. Field's favorite ode was the
Bandusian Spring, the paraphrasing of which in the styles of the
various writers of different periods gave him genuine joy and is
perhaps the choice bit of the collection. The Echoes from the
Sabine Farm was the most ambitious work Field had attempted up to
the time of its issue. He was not at all sure that the public for
whom he wrote, what following he then felt was his own, would
accept his efforts in this direction with any sort of acclaim.
Unquestionably, Field, at all times, believed in himself and in his
power ultimately to make a name, as every man must who achieves
success, but he was as far from believing that the public would
accept him as an interpreter of Horatian odes as was Edward
Fitzgerald with respect to Omar Khayy&aacute;m. In short, he looked
upon his work in the original publication of Echoes from the Sabine
Farm as a labor of love&mdash;an effort from which some reputation
might come, but certainly no monetary remuneration. It was because
he so regarded it that he permitted the work to be first issued
under the bolstering influence of a patron. It was, so he thought,
an excellent opportunity to show his friends and acquaintances that
his Pegasus was capable of soaring to classic heights, and he
little dreamed that the paraphrasing of the Odes of Horace over
which "Rose and I have been fooling" would be required for a
<i>popular</i> edition. With the announcement of the Scribner
edition of The Sabine Echoes came also the intelligence of Field's
death.</p>

<p>I have found people who were somewhat puzzled as to the exact
intentions of the Fields with respect to these translations and
paraphrases. However, there can be no chance for mistake even to
the veriest embryonic reader of Horace, if he will but remember
that, while some of these transcriptions are indeed very faithful
reproductions or adaptations of the original, others again are to
be accepted as the very riot of burlesque verse-making.</p>

<p>The last stanza in the epilogue of this book reads:</p>

<tr>
<td>Come, dear old friend, and with us twain<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To calm Digentian groves
repair;</span><br>
The turtle coos his sweet refrain<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And posies are a-blooming
there;</span><br>
And there the romping Sabine girls<br>
Bind myrtle in their lustrous curls.<br>
I know a certain ilex-tree<br>

clear.</span><br>
Its voices summon you and me;<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Come, let us haste to share its
cheer!</span><br>
Methinks the rapturous song it sings<br>
Should woo our thoughts from mortal things.<br>
But, good old friend, I charge thee well,<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Watch thou my brother all the
while,</span><br>
Lest some fair Lydia cast her spell<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Round him unschooled in female
guile.</span><br>
Those damsels have no charms for me;<br>
Guard thou that brother,&mdash;I'll guard thee!<br>
And, lo, sweet friend! behold this cup,<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Round which the garlands
intertwine;</span><br>
With Massic it is foaming up,<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And we would drink to thee and
thine.</span><br>
And of the draught thou shalt partake,<br>
Who lov'st us for our father's sake.<br>
Hark you! from yonder Sabine farm<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Echo the songs of long
ago,</span><br>
With power to soothe and grace to charm<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>What ills humanity may
know;</span><br>
With that sweet music in the air,<br>
'T is Love and Summer everywhere.<br>
So, though no grief consumes our lot<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>(Since all our lives have been
discreet),</span><br>
Come, in this consecrated spot,<br>
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Let's see if pagan cheer be
sweet.</span><br>
Now, then, the songs; but, first, more wine.<br>
The gods be with you, friends of mine!<br>

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
