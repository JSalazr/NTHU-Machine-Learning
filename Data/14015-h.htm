objected against MATTHEW HOPKINS, in his way of finding out <i>Witches</i>.</p></blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<hr class="short"><br />

<h2>Querie 1.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>That he must needs be the greatest Witch, Sorcerer, and Wizzard
himselfe, else hee could not doe it.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>If <i>Satan's</i> kingdome be divided against
it selfe, how shall it stand?</p>


<hr />
<h2>Querie 2.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>If he never went so farre as is before
mentioned, yet for certaine he met with the
Devill, and cheated him of his Booke, wherein
were written all the Witches names in</i> England, <i>and if he looks on any
Witch, he can tell by her countenance what she is; so by this, his helpe
is from the Devill.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>If he had been too hard for the devill and got his
book, it had been to his great commendation, and no disgrace
at all: and for judgement in <i>Phisiognomie</i>, he hath no more
then any man else whatsoever.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 3.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>From whence then proceeded this his skill? was it from
his profound learning, or from much reading of learned Authors concerning
that subject?</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>From neither of both, but from experience, which
though it be meanly esteemed of, yet the surest and safest way to
judge by.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 4.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>I pray where was this experience gained? and why
gained by him and not by others?</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>The Discoverer never travelled far for it, but in <i>March</i>
1644 he had some seven or eight of that horrible sect of Witches
living in the Towne where he lived, a Towne in Essex called
<i>Maningtree</i>, with divers other adjacent Witches of other towns,
who every six weeks in the night (being alwayes on the Friday
night) had their meeting close by his house and had their severall
solemne sacrifices there offered to the <i>Devill</i>, one of which this
discoverer heard speaking to her <i>Imps</i> one night, and bid them
goe to another Witch, who was thereupon apprehended, and searched,
by women who had for many yeares knowne the Devills
marks, and found to have three teats about her, which honest
women have not: so upon command from the <i>Justice</i> they were
to keep her from sleep two or three nights, expecting in that time
to see her <i>familiars</i>, which the fourth night she called in by their
severall names, and told them what shapes, a quarter of an houre
before they came in, there being ten of us in the roome, the first
she called was</p>

<p>1. <i>Holt</i>, who came in like a white kitling.</p>

<p>2. <i>Jarmara</i>, who came in like a fat Spaniel without any legs at
all, she said she kept him fat, for she clapt her hand on her belly
and said he suckt good blood from her body.</p>

<p>3. <i>Vinegar Tom</i>, who was like a long-legg'd Greyhound, with
an head like an Oxe, with a long taile and broad eyes, who when
this discoverer spoke to, and bade him goe to the place provided
for him and his Angels, immediately transformed himselfe into
the shape of a child of foure yeeres old without a head, and gave
halfe a dozen turnes about the house, and vanished at the doore.</p>

<p>4. <i>Sack and Sugar</i>, like a black Rabbet.</p>

<p>5. <i>Newes</i>, like a Polcat. All these vanished away in a little
time. Immediately after this Witch confessed severall other
Witches, from whom she had her <i>Imps</i>, and named to divers women
where their marks were, the number of their <i>Marks</i>, and
<i>Imps</i>, and <i>Imps</i> names, as <i>Elemanzer</i>, <i>Pyewacket</i>, <i>Peckin the Crown</i>,
<i>Grizzel</i>, <i>Greedigut</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> which no mortall could invent; and upon
their searches the same Markes were found, the same number, and
in the same place, and the like confessions from them of the same
Imps, (though they knew not that we were told before) and so
peached one another thereabouts that joyned together in the like
damnable practise that in our Hundred in <i>Essex</i>, 29. were condemned
at once, 4. brought 25. Miles to be hanged, where this
Discoverer lives, for sending the Devill like a Beare to kill him in
his garden, so by seeing diverse of the mens Papps, and trying
wayes with hundreds of them, he gained this experience, and for
ought he knowes any man else may find them as well as he and
his company, if they had the same skill and experience.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 5.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Many poore People are condemned for having a Pap, or
Teat about them, whereas many People (especially antient People) are,
and have been a long time troubled with naturall wretts on severall
parts of their bodies and other naturall excressencies, as Hemerodes,
Piles, Childbearing, &amp;c. and these shall be judged only by one man alone
and a woman, and so accused or acquitted.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>The parties so judging can justifie their skill to any,
and shew good reasons why such markes are not meerly naturall,
neither that they can happen by any such naturall cause as is before
expressed, and for further answer for their private judgements
alone, it is most false and untrue, for never was any man
tryed by search of his body, but commonly a dozen of the ablest
men in the parish or else where, were present, and most commonly
as many ancient skilfull matrons and midwives present
when the women are tryed, which marks not only he, and his
company attest to be very suspitious, but all beholders, the skilfulest
of them, doe not approve of them, but likewise assent that
such tokens cannot in their judgements proceed from any the above
mentioned Causes.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 6.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>It is a thing impossible for any or woman to judge
rightly on such marks, they are so neare to naturall excressencies
and they that finde them, durst not presently give Oath they were
drawne by evil spirits, till they have used unlawfull courses of torture
to make them say any thing for ease and quiet, as who would not do?
but I would know the reasons he speakes of, how, and whereby to discover
the one from the other, and so be satisfied in that.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>The reasons in breefe are three, which for the present
he judgeth to differ from naturall marks which are: </p>

<p>1. He judgeth
by the unusualnes of the place where he findeth the teats in or on
their bodies being farre distant from any usuall place, from
whence such naturall markes proceed, as if a witch plead the
markes found are Emerods, if I finde them on the bottome of the
back-bone, shall I assent with him, knowing they are not neere
that veine, and so others by child-bearing, when it may be they
are in the contrary part?</p>

<p>2. They are most commonly insensible, and feele neither pin,
needle, aule, &amp;c. thrust through them.</p>

<p>3. The often variations and mutations of these marks into severall
formes, confirmes the matter; as if a Witch hear a month
or two before that the <i>Witch-finder</i> (as they call him) is comming
they will, and have put out their Imps to others to suckle
them, even to their owne young and tender children; these upon
search are found to have dry skinnes and filmes only, and be close
to the flesh, keepe her 24. houres with a diligent eye, that none
of her Spirits come in any visible shape to suck her; the women
have seen the next day after her Teats extended out to their former
filling length, full of corruption ready to burst, and leaving
her alone then one quarter of an houre, and let the women go up
againe and shee will have them drawn by her Imps close againe:
<i>Probatum est.</i> Now for answer to their tortures in its due place.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 7.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>How can it possibly be that the Devill bring a spirit, and
wants no nutriment or sustentation, should desire to suck any blood?
and indeed as he is a spirit he cannot draw any such excressences, having
neither flesh nor bone, nor can be felt, &amp;c.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Ans.</i></h3> <p>He seekes not their bloud, as if he could not subsist without
that nourishment, but he often repairs to them, and gets it,
the more to aggravate the Witches damnation, and to put her in
mind of her <i>Covenant</i>; and as he is a Spirit and Prince of the ayre,
he appeares to them in any shape whatsoever, which shape is occasioned
by him through joyning of condensed thickned aire together,
and many times doth assume shapes of many creatures;
but to create any thing he cannot do it, it is only proper to God:
But in this case of drawing out of these Teats, he doth really enter
into the body, reall, corporeall, substantiall creature, and forceth
that Creature (he working in it) to his desired ends, and useth
the organs of that body to speake withall to make his compact
up with the Witches, be the creature Cat, Rat, Mouse,
&amp;c.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 8.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>When these Paps are fully discovered, yet that will not
serve sufficiently to convict them, but they must be tortured and kept
from sleep two or three nights, to distract them, and make them say any
thing; which is a way to tame a wilde Colt, or Hawke, &amp;c.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Ans.</i></h3> <p>In the infancy of this discovery it was not only thought
fitting, but enjoyned in <i>Essex</i> and <i>Suffolke</i> by the Magistrates,
with this intention only, because they being kept awake would be
more the active to cal their imps in open view the sooner to their
helpe, which oftentimes have so happened; and never or seldome
did any Witch ever complaine in the time of their keeping for
want of rest, but after they had beat their heads together in the
Goale; and after this use was not allowed of by the judges and
other Magistrates, it was never since used, which is a yeare and a
halfe since, neither were any kept from sleep by any order or direction
since; but peradventure their own stubborne wills did not
let them sleep, though tendered and offered to them.</p>



<hr />
<h2>Quer. 9.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Beside that unreasonable watching, they were extraordinarily
walked, till their feet were blistered, and so forced through that
cruelty to confesse, &amp;c.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Ans.</i></h3> <p>It was in the same beginning of this discovery, and the
meaning of walking of them at the highest extent of cruelty, was
only they to walke about themselves the night they were watched,
only to keepe them waking: and the reason was this, when they
did lye or sit in a chaire, if they did offer to couch downe, then
the watchers were only to desire them to sit up and walke about,
for indeed when they be suffered so to couch, immediately comes
their Familiars into the room and scareth the watchers, and heartneth
on the Witch, though contrary to the true meaning of the
same instructions, diverse have been by rusticall People, (they hearing
them confess to be Witches) mis-used, spoiled, and abused,
diverse whereof have suffered for the same, but could never be
proved against this Discoverer to have a hand in it, or consent to
it; and hath likewise been un-used by him and others, ever since
the time they were kept from sleepe.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Quer. 10.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>But there hath been an abominable, inhumane, and unmercifull
tryall of these poore creatures, by tying them, and heaving
them into the water; a tryall not allowable by Law or conscience, and
I would faine know the reasons for that.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Ans.</i></h3> <p>It is not denyed but many were so served as had Papps,
and floated, others that had none were tryed with them and sunk,
but marke the reasons.</p>

<p>For first the Divels policie is great, in perswading many to
come of their own accord to be tryed, perswading them their
marks are so close they shall not be found out, so as diverse have
come 10. or 12. Miles to be searched of their own accord, and
hanged for their labour, (as one <i>Meggs</i> a Baker did, who lived
within 7. Miles of <i>Norwich</i>, and was hanged at <i>Norwich</i> Assizes
for witchcraft) then when they find that the Devil tells them false
they reflect on him, and he (as 40. have confessed) adviseth them
to be sworne, and tels them they shall sinke and be cleared that
way, then when they be tryed that way and floate, they see the
Devill deceives them againe, and have so laid open his treacheries.</p>

<p>2. It was never brought in against any of them at their tryals as
any evidence.</p>

<p>3. King <i>James</i> in his <i>Demonology</i> saith, it is a certaine rule, for
(saith he) Witches deny their baptisme when they Covenant
with the Devill, water being the sole element thereof, and therefore
saith he, when they be heaved into the water, the water refuseth
to receive them into her bosome, (they being such Miscreants
to deny their baptisme) and suffers them to float, as the Froath
on the Sea, which the water will not recieve, but casts it up and
downe till it comes to the earthy element the shore, and there
leaves it to consume. </p>

<p>4. Observe these generation of Witches, if they be at any time
abused by being called Whore, Theefe, &amp;c, by any where they
live, they are the readiest to cry and wring their hands, and shed
tears in abundance &amp; run with full and right sorrowfull acclamations
to some Justice of the Peace, and with many teares make
their complaints: but now behold their stupidity; nature or the
elements reflection from them, when they are accused for this horrible
and damnable sin of Witchcraft, they never alter or change
their countenances nor let one Teare fall. This by the way,
swimming (by able Divines whom I reverence) is condemned for
no way, and therefore of late hath, and for ever shall be left.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 11.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Oh! but if this torturing Witch-catcher can by all or
any of these meanes wring out a word or two of confession from any of
these stupified, ignorant, unitelligible, poore silly creatures, (though
none heare it but himselfe) he will adde and put her in feare to confesse
telling her, else she shall be hanged; but if she doe, he will set her
at liberty, and so put a word into her mouth, and make such a silly
creature confesse she knowes not what.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>He is of a better conscience, and for your better understanding
of him, he doth thus uncase himselfe to all, add declares
what confessions (though made by a Witch against her selfe) he
allowes not of, and doth altogether account of no validity, or
worthy of credence to be given to it, and ever did so account it,
and ever likewise shall.</p>

<p>1. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch to be of any
validity, when it is drawn from her by any torture or violence
whatsoever; although after watching, walking, or swimming, diverse
have suffered, yet peradventure Magistrates with much care
and diligence did solely and fully examine them after sleepe, and
consideration sufficient.</p>

<p>2. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch, which is
drawn from her by flattery, viz. <i>if you will confess you shall go home,
you shall not go to the Goale, nor be hanged, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>3. He utterly denyes that confession of a Witch, when she confesseth
any improbability, impossibility, as <i>flying in the ayre, riding
on a broom, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>4. He utterly denyes a confession of a Witch, when it is interrogated
to her, and words put into her mouth, to be of any force
or effect: as to say to a silly (yet Witch wicked enough) <i>you have
foure Imps have you not</i>? She answers affirmatively, Yes: <i>did
they not suck you</i>? Yes, saith she: <i>Are not their names so, and so</i>?
Yes, saith shee; <i>Did not you send such an Impe to kill my child</i>? Yes
saith she, this being all her confession after this manner, it is by
him accompted nothing, and he earnestly doth desire that all Magistrates
and Jurors would a little more then ever they did examine
witnesses about the interrogated confessions.</p>


<hr />
<h2>Quer. 12.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>If all those confessions be denyed, I wonder what he
will make confession, for sure it is, all these wayes have been used and
took for good confessions, and many have suffered for them, and I know
not what, he will then make confession.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>Yes, in brief he will declare what confession of a Witch
is of validity and force in his judgement, to hang a Witch: when
a Witch is first found with teats, then sequestred from her house,
which is onely to keep her old associates from her, and so by
good counsell brought into a sad condition, by understanding of
the horribleness of her sin, and the judgements threatned against
her; and knowing the Devils malice and subtile circumventions,
is brought to remorse and sorrow for complying with Satan so
long, and disobeying Gods sacred Commands, doth then desire
to unfold her mind with much bitterness, and then without any of
the before-mentioned hard usages or questions put to her, doth of
her owne accord declare what was the occasion of the Devils appearing
to her, whether ignorance, pride, anger, malice, &amp;c. was
predominant over her, she doth then declare what speech they
had, what likeness he was in, what voice be had, what familiars
he sent her, what number of spirits, what names they had, what
shape they were in, what imployment she set them about to severall
persons in severall places, (unknowne to the hearers) all
which mischiefes being proved to be done, at the same time she
confessed to the same parties for the same cause, and all effected,
is testimony enough again her for all her denyall.</p>



<hr />
<h2>Quest. 13.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>How can any possibly beleeve that the Devill and the
Witch joyning together, should have such power, as the Witches confesse
to kill such such a man, child, horse, cow, the like; if we beleeve
they can doe what they will, then we derogate from Gods power,
who for certaine limits the Devill and the Witch; and I cannot beleeve
they have any power at all.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Answ.</i></h3> <p>God suffers the Devill many times to doe much hurt,
and the devill doth play many times the deluder and impostor
with these Witches, in perswading them that they are the cause
of such and such a murder wrought by him with their consents,
when and indeed neither he nor they had any hand in it, as thus:
We must needs argue, he is of a long standing, above 6000. yeers,
then he must needs be the best Scholar in all knowledges of arts
and tongues, &amp; so have the best skill in <i>Physicke</i>, judgment in <i>Physiognomie</i>,
and knowledge of what disease is reigning or predominant
in this or that mans body, (and so for cattell too) by reason
of his long experience. This subtile tempter knowing such a man
lyable to some sudden disease, (as by experience I have found)
as <i>Plurisie</i>, <i>Imposthume</i>, &amp;c. he resorts to divers Witches; if they
know the man, and seek to make a difference between the Witches
and the party, it may be by telling them he hath threatned to
have them very shortly searched, and so hanged for Witches, then
they all consult with <i>Satan</i> to save themselves, and <i>Satan</i> stands
ready prepared, with a <i>What will you have me doe for you, my deare
and nearest children, covenanted and compacted with me in my hellish
league, and sealed with your blood, my delicate firebrand-darlings</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Divells speech to the  Witches.</i></div>

<p>Oh thou (say they) that at the first didst promise to save us thy
servants from any of out deadly enemies discovery, and didst promise
to avenge and flay all those, we pleased, that did offend us;
Murther that wretch suddenly who threatens the down-fall of
your loyall subjects. He then promiseth to effect it. Next newes
is heard the partie is dead, he comes to the witch, and gets a world
of reverence, credence and respect for his power and activeness,
when and indeed the disease kills the party, not the Witch, nor the
Devill, (onely the Devill knew that such a disease was predominant)
and the witch aggravates her damnation by her familiarity
and consent to the Devill, and so comes likewise in compass of
the Lawes. This is Satans usuall impostring and deluding, but
not his constant course of proceeding, for he and the witch
doe mischiefe too much. But I would that Magistrates and Jurats
would a little examine witnesses when they heare witches
confess such and such a murder, whether the party had not long
time before, or at the time when the witch grew suspected, some
disease or other predominant, which might cause that issue or
effect of death.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Quer. 14.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>All that the witch-finder doth is to fleece the country
of their money, and therefore rides and goes to townes to have imployment,
and promiseth them faire promises, and it may be doth nothing
for it, and possesseth many men that they have so many wizzards
and so many witches in their towne, and so hartens them on to entertaine
him.</i></p></blockquote>
<br />

<h3><i>Ans.</i></h3> <p>You doe him a great deale of wrong in every of these
particulars. For, first,</p>

<p>1. He never went to any towne or place, but they rode, writ,
or sent often for him, and were (for ought he knew) glad of
him.</p>

<p>2. He is a man that doth disclaime that ever he detected a
witch, or said, Thou art a witch; only after her tryall by search,
and their owne confessions, he as others may judge.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, judge how he fleeceth the Country, and inriches
himselfe, by considering the vast summe he takes of every towne,
he demands but 20.s. a town, &amp; doth sometimes ride 20. miles for
that, &amp; hath no more for all his charges thither and back again (&amp;
it may be stayes a weeke there) and finde there 3. or 4. witches, or
if it be but one, cheap enough, and this is the great summe he takes
to maintaine his Companie with 3. horses.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
