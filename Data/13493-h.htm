    <h2>INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER</h2>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The true economy of housekeeping is simply the art of
    gathering up all the fragments, so that nothing be lost. I mean
    fragments of <i>time</i>, as well as <i>materials</i>. Nothing
    should be thrown away so long as it is possible to make any use
    of it, however trifling that use may be; and whatever be the
    size of a family, every member should be employed either in
    earning or saving money.</p>

    <p>'Time is money.' For this reason, cheap as stockings are, it
    is good economy to knit them. Cotton and woollen yarn are both
    cheap; hose that are knit wear twice as long as woven ones; and
    they can be done at odd minutes of time, which would not be
    otherwise employed. Where there are children, or aged people,
    it is sufficient to recommend knitting, that it is an
    <i>employment</i>.</p>

    <p>In this point of view, patchwork is good economy. It is
    indeed a foolish waste of time to tear cloth into bits for the
    sake of arranging it anew in fantastic figures; but a large
    family may be kept out of idleness, and a few shillings saved,
    by thus using scraps of gowns, curtains, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>In the country, where grain is raised, it is a good plan to
    teach children to prepare and braid straw for their own
    bonnets, and their brothers' hats.</p>

    <p>Where turkeys and geese are kept, handsome feather fans may
    as well be made by the younger members of a family, as to be
    bought. The sooner children are taught to turn their faculties
    to some account, the better for them and for their parents.</p>

    <p>In this country, we are apt to let children romp away their
    existence, till they get to be thirteen or fourteen. This is
    not well. It is not well for the purses and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>{4}</span> patience of parents; and it has a
       still worse effect on the morals and habits of the children.
       <i>Begin early</i> is the great maxim for everything in
       education. A child of six years old can be made useful; and
       should be taught to consider every day lost in which some
       little thing has not been done to assist others.</p>

    <p>Children can very early be taught to take all the care of
    their own clothes.</p>

    <p>They can knit garters, suspenders, and stockings; they can
    make patchwork and braid straw; they can make mats for the
    table, and mats for the floor; they can weed the garden, and
    pick cranberries from the meadow, to be carried to market.</p>

    <p>Provided brothers and sisters go together, and are not
    allowed to go with bad children, it is a great deal better for
    the boys and girls on a farm to be picking blackberries at six
    cents a quart, than to be wearing out their clothes in useless
    play. They enjoy themselves just as well; and they are earning
    something to buy clothes, at the same time they are tearing
    them.</p>

    <p>It is wise to keep an exact account of all you
    expend&mdash;even of a paper of pins. This answers two
    purposes; it makes you more careful in spending money, and it
    enables your husband to judge precisely whether his family live
    within his income. No false pride, or foolish ambition to
    appear as well as others, should ever induce a person to live
    one cent beyond the income of which he is certain. If you have
    two dollars a day, let nothing but sickness induce you to spend
    more than nine shillings; if you have one dollar a day, do not
    spend but seventy-five cents; if you have half a dollar a day,
    be satisfied to spend forty cents.</p>

    <p>To associate with influential and genteel people with an
    appearance of equality, unquestionably has its advantages;
    particularly where there is a family of sons and daughters just
    coming upon the theatre of life; but, like all other external
    advantages, these have their proper price, and may be bought
    too dearly. They who never reserve a cent of their income, with
    which to meet any <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>{5}</span> unforeseen calamity, 'pay too dear
       for the whistle,' whatever temporary benefits they may
       derive from society. Self-denial, in proportion to the
       narrowness of your income, will eventually be the happiest
       and most respectable course for you and yours. If you are
       prosperous, perseverance and industry will not fail to place
       you in such a situation as your ambition covets; and if you
       are not prosperous, it will be well for your children that
       they have not been educated to higher hopes than they will
       ever realize.</p>

    <p>If you are about to furnish a house, do not spend all your
    money, be it much or little. Do not let the beauty of this
    thing, and the cheapness of that, tempt you to buy unnecessary
    articles. Doctor Franklin's maxim was a wise one, 'Nothing is
    cheap that we do not want.' Buy merely enough to get along with
    at first. It is only by experience that you can tell what will
    be the wants of your family. If you spend all your money, you
    will find you have purchased many things you do not want, and
    have no means left to get many things which you do want. If you
    have enough, and more than enough, to get everything suitable
    to your situation, do not think you must spend it all, merely
    because you happen to have it. Begin humbly. As riches
    increase, it is easy and pleasant to increase in hospitality
    and splendour; but it is always painful and inconvenient to
    decrease. After all, these things are viewed in their proper
    light by the truly judicious and respectable. Neatness,
    tastefulness, and good sense, may be shown in the management of
    a small household, and the arrangement of a little furniture,
    as well as upon a larger scale; and these qualities are always
    praised, and always treated with respect and attention. The
    consideration which many purchase by living beyond their
    income, and of course living upon others, is not worth the
    trouble it costs. The glare there is about this false and
    wicked parade is deceptive; it does not in fact procure a man
    valuable friends, or extensive influence. More than that, it is
    wrong&mdash;morally wrong, so far as the individual is
    concerned; and injurious beyond calculation to the interests
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>{6}</span> of our country. To what are the
       increasing beggary and discouraged exertions of the present
       period owing? A multitude of causes have no doubt tended to
       increase the evil; but the root of the whole matter is the
       extravagance of all classes of people. We never shall be
       prosperous till we make pride and vanity yield to the
       dictates of honesty and prudence! We never shall be free
       from embarrassment until we cease to be ashamed of industry
       and economy. Let women do their share towards
       reformation&mdash;Let their fathers and husbands see them
       happy without finery; and if their husbands and fathers have
       (as is often the case) a foolish pride in seeing them
       decorated, let them gently and gradually check this feeling,
       by showing that they have better and surer means of
       commanding respect&mdash;Let them prove, by the exertion of
       ingenuity and economy, that neatness, good taste, and
       gentility, are attainable without great expense.</p>

    <p>The writer has no apology to offer for this cheap little
    book of economical hints, except her deep conviction that such
    a book is needed. In this case, renown is out of the question,
    and ridicule is a matter of indifference.</p>

    <p>The information conveyed is of a common kind; but it is such
    as the majority of young housekeepers do not possess, and such
    as they cannot obtain from cookery books. Books of this kind
    have usually been written for the wealthy: I have written for
    the poor. I have said nothing about <i>rich</i> cooking; those
    who can afford to be epicures will find the best of information
    in the 'Seventy-five Receipts.' I have attempted to teach how
    money can be <i>saved</i>, not how it can be <i>enjoyed</i>. If
    any persons think some of the maxims too rigidly economical,
    let them inquire how the largest fortunes among us have been
    made. They will find thousands and millions have been
    accumulated by a scrupulous attention to sums 'infinitely more
    minute than sixty cents.'</p>

    <p>In early childhood, you lay the foundation of poverty or
    riches, in the habits you give your children. Teach them to
    save everything,&mdash;not for their <i>own</i> use, for that
    would make them selfish&mdash;but for <i>some</i> use. Teach
    them <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>{7}</span> to <i>share</i> everything with
       their playmates; but never allow them to <i>destroy</i>
       anything.</p>

    <p>I once visited a family where the most exact economy was
    observed; yet nothing was mean or uncomfortable. It is the
    character of true economy to be as comfortable and genteel with
    a little, as others can be with much. In this family, when the
    father brought home a package, the older children would, of
    their own accord, put away the paper and twine neatly, instead
    of throwing them in the fire, or tearing them to pieces. If the
    little ones wanted a piece of twine to play scratch-cradle, or
    spin a top, there it was, in readiness; and when they threw it
    upon the floor, the older children had no need to be told to
    put it again in its place.</p>

    <p>The other day, I heard a mechanic say, 'I have a wife and
    two little children; we live in a very small house; but, to
    save my life, I cannot spend less than twelve hundred a year.'
    Another replied, 'You are not economical; I spend but eight
    hundred.' I thought to myself,&mdash;'Neither of you pick up
    your twine and paper.' A third one, who was present, was
    silent; but after they were gone, he said, 'I keep house, and
    comfortably too, with a wife and children, for six hundred a
    year; but I suppose they would have thought me mean, if I had
    told them so.' I did not think him mean; it merely occurred to
    me that his wife and children were in the habit of picking up
    paper and twine.</p>

    <p>Economy is generally despised as a low virtue, tending to
    make people ungenerous and selfish. This is true of avarice;
    but it is not so of economy. The man who is economical, is
    laying up for himself the permanent power of being useful and
    generous. He who thoughtlessly gives away ten dollars, when he
    owes a hundred more than he can pay, deserves no
    praise,&mdash;he obeys a sudden impulse, more like instinct
    than reason: it would be real charity to check this feeling;
    because the good he does maybe doubtful, while the injury he
    does his family and creditors is certain. True economy is a
    careful treasurer in the service of benevolence; and where they
    are united respectability, prosperity and peace will
    follow.</p>

    <h2>ODD SCRAPS FOR THE ECONOMICAL.</h2>

    <p>If you would avoid waste in your family, attend to the
    following rules, and do not despise them because they appear so
    unimportant: 'many a little makes a mickle.'</p>

    <p>Look frequently to the pails, to see that nothing is thrown
    to the pigs which should have been in the grease-pot.</p>

    <p>Look to the grease-pot, and see that nothing is there which
    might have served to nourish your own family, or a poorer
    one.</p>

    <p>See that the beef and pork are always <i>under</i> brine;
    and that the brine is sweet and clean.</p>

    <p>Count towels, sheets, spoons, &amp;c. occasionally; that
    those who use them may not become careless.</p>

    <p>See that the vegetables are neither sprouting nor decaying:
    if they are so, remove them to a drier place, and spread
    them.</p>

    <p>Examine preserves, to see that they are not contracting
    mould; and your pickles, to see that they are not growing soft
    and tasteless.</p>

    <p>As far as it is possible, have bits of bread eaten up before
    they become hard. Spread those that are not eaten, and let them
    dry, to be pounded for puddings, or soaked for brewis. Brewis
    is made of crusts and dry pieces of bread, soaked a good while
    in hot milk, mashed up, and salted, and buttered like toast.
    Above all, do not let crusts accumulate in such quantities that
    they cannot be used. With proper care, there is no need of
    losing a particle of bread, even in the hottest weather.</p>

    <p>Attend to all the mending in the house, once a week, if
    possible. Never put out sewing. If it be impossible to do it in
    your own family, hire some one into the house, and work with
    them.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"
       id="page9"></a>{9}</span>

    <p>Make your own bread and cake. Some people think it is just
    as cheap to buy of the baker and confectioner; but it is not
    half as cheap. True, it is more convenient; and therefore the
    rich are justifiable in employing them; but those who are under
    the necessity of being economical, should make convenience a
    secondary object. In the first place, confectioners make their
    cake richer than people of moderate income can afford to make
    it; in the next place, your domestic, or yourself, may just as
    well employ your own time, as to pay them for theirs.</p>

    <p>When ivory-handled knives turn yellow, rub them with nice
    sand paper, or emery; it will take off the spots, and restore
    their whiteness.</p>

    <p>When a carpet is faded, I have been told that it may be
    restored, in a great measure, (provided there be no grease in
    it,) by being dipped into strong salt and water. I never tried
    this; but I know that silk pocket handkerchiefs, and deep blue
    factory cotton will not fade, if dipped in salt and water while
    new.</p>

    <p>An ox's gall will set any color,&mdash;silk, cotton, or
    woollen. I have seen the colors of calico, which faded at one
    washing, fixed by it. Where one lives near a slaughterhouse, it
    is worth while to buy cheap, fading goods, and set them in this
    way. The gall can be bought for a few cents. Get out all the
    liquid, and cork it up in a large phial. One large spoonful of
    this in a gallon of warm water is sufficient. This is likewise
    excellent for taking out spots from bombazine, bombazet,
    &amp;c. After being washed in this, they look about as well as
    when new. It must be thoroughly stirred into the water, and not
    put upon the cloth. It is used without soap. After being washed
    in this, cloth which you want to <i>clean</i> should be washed
    in warm suds, without using soap.</p>

    <p>Tortoise shell and horn combs last much longer for having
    oil rubbed into them once in a while.</p>

    <p>Indian meal and rye meal are in danger of fermenting in
    summer; particularly Indian. They should be kept in a cool
    place, and stirred open to the air, once in a while. A large
    stone, put in the middle of a barrel of meal, is a good thing
    to keep it cool.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>{10}</span>

    <p>The covering of oil-flasks, sewed together with strong
    thread, and lined and bound neatly, makes useful tablemats.</p>

    <p>A warming-pan full of coals, or a shovel of coals, held over
    varnished furniture, will take out white spots. Care should be
    taken not to hold the coals near enough to scorch; and the
    place should be rubbed with flannel while warm.</p>

    <p>Spots in furniture may usually be cleansed by rubbing them
    quick and hard, with a flannel wet with the same thing which
    took out the color; if rum, wet the cloth with rum, &amp;c. The
    very best restorative for defaced varnished furniture, is
    rotten-stone pulverized, and rubbed on with linseed oil.</p>

    <p>Sal-volatile, or hartshorn, will restore colors taken out by
    acid. It may be dropped upon any garment without doing
    harm.</p>

    <p>Spirits of turpentine is good to take grease-spots out of
    woollen clothes; to take spots of paint, &amp;c., from mahogany
    furniture; and to cleanse white kid gloves. Cockroaches, and
    all vermin, have an aversion to spirits of turpentine.</p>

    <p>An ounce of quicksilver, beat up with the white of two eggs,
    and put on with a feather, is the cleanest and surest bed-bug
    poison. What is left should be thrown away: it is dangerous to
    have it about the house. If the vermin are in your walls, fill
    up the cracks with <i>verdigris</i>-green
    paint.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>Lamps will have a less disagreeable smell if you dip your
    wick-yarn in strong hot vinegar, and dry it.</p>

    <p>Those who make candles will find it a great improvement to
    steep the wicks in lime-water and saltpetre, and dry them. The
    flame is clearer, and the tallow will not '<i>run</i>.'</p>

    <p>Britannia Ware should be first rubbed gently with a woollen
    cloth and sweet oil; then washed in warm suds, and rubbed with
    soft leather and whiting. Thus treated, it will retain its
    beauty to the last.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>{11}</span>

    <p>Eggs will keep almost any length of time in lime-water
    properly prepared. One pint of coarse salt, and one pint of
    unslacked lime, to a pailful of water. If there be too much
    lime, it will eat the shells from the eggs; and if there be a
    single egg cracked, it will spoil the whole. They should be
    covered with lime-water, and kept in a cold place. The yolk
    becomes slightly red; but I have seen eggs, thus kept,
    perfectly sweet and fresh at the end of three years. The
    cheapest time to lay down eggs, is early in spring, and the
    middle and last of September. It is bad economy to buy eggs by
    the dozen, as you want them.</p>

    <p>New iron should be very gradually heated at first. After it
    has become inured to the heat, it is not as likely to
    crack.</p>

    <p>It is a good plan to put new earthen ware into cold water,
    and let it heat gradually, until it boils,&mdash;then cool
    again. Brown earthen ware, in particular, may be toughened in
    this way. A handful of rye, or wheat, bran, thrown in while it
    is boiling, will preserve the glazing, so that it will not be
    destroyed by acid or salt.</p>

    <p>Clean a brass kettle, before using it for cooking, with salt
    and vinegar.</p>

    <p>Skim-milk and water, with a bit of glue in it, heated
    scalding hot, is excellent to restore old, rusty, black Italian
    crape. If clapped and pulled dry, like nice muslin, it will
    look as well, or better, than when new.</p>

    <p>Wash-leather gloves should be washed in clean suds, scarcely
    warm.</p>

    <p>The oftener carpets are shaken, the longer they wear; the
    dirt that collects under them, grinds out the threads.</p>

    <p>Do not have carpets swept any oftener than is absolutely
    necessary. After dinner, sweep the crumbs into a dusting-pan
    with your hearth-brush; and if you have been sewing, pick up
    the shreds by hand. A carpet can be kept very neat in this way;
    and a broom wears it very much.</p>

    <p>Buy your woollen yarn in quantities from some one in the
    country, whom you can trust. The thread-stores make profits
    upon it, of course.</p>

    <p>It is not well to clean brass andirons, handles, &amp;c.
    with vinegar. It makes them very clean at first; but they soon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>{12}</span> spot and tarnish. Rotten-stone
       and oil are proper materials for cleaning brasses. If wiped
       every morning with flannel and New England rum, they will
       not need to be cleaned half as often.</p>

    <p>If you happen to live in a house which has marble
    fire-places, never wash them with suds; this destroys the
    polish, in time. They should be dusted; the spots taken off
    with a nice oiled cloth, and then rubbed dry with a soft
    rag.</p>

    <p>Feathers should be very thoroughly dried before they are
    used. For this reason they should not be packed away in bags,
    when they are first plucked. They should be laid lightly in a
    basket, or something of that kind, and stirred up often. The
    garret is the best place to dry them; because they will there
    be kept free from dirt and moisture; and will be in no danger
    of being blown away. It is well to put the parcels, which you
    may have from time to time, into the oven, after you have
    removed your bread, and let them stand a day.</p>

    <p>If feather-beds smell badly, or become heavy, from want of
    proper preservation of the feathers, or from old age, empty
    them, and wash the feathers thoroughly in a tub of suds; spread
    them in your garret to dry, and they will be as light and as
    good as new.</p>

    <p>New England rum, constantly used to wash the hair, keeps it
    very clean, and free from disease, and promotes its growth a
    great deal more than Macassar oil. Brandy is very strengthening
    to the roots of the hair; but it has a hot, drying tendency,
    which N.E. rum has not.</p>

    <p>If you wish to preserve fine teeth, always clean them
    thoroughly after you have eaten your last meal at night.</p>

    <p>Rags should never be thrown away because they are dirty.
    Mop-rags, lamp-rags, &amp;c. should be washed, dried, and put
    in the rag-bag. There is no need of expending soap upon them:
    boil them out in dirty suds, after you have done washing.</p>

    <p>Linen rags should be carefully saved; for they are extremely
    useful in sickness. If they have become dirty and worn by
    cleaning silver, &amp;c., wash them, and scrape them into
    lint.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>{13}</span>

    <p>After old coats, pantaloons, &amp;c. have been cut up for
    boys, and are no longer capable of being converted into
    garments, cut them into strips, and employ the leisure moments
    of children, or domestics, in sewing and braiding them for
    door-mats.</p>

    <p>If you are troubled to get soft water for washing, fill a
    tub or barrel half full of ashes, and fill it up with water, so
    that you may have lye whenever you want it. A gallon of strong
    lye put into a great kettle of hard water will make it as soft
    as rain water. Some people use pearlash, or potash; but this
    costs something, and is very apt to injure the texture of the
    cloth.</p>

    <p>If you have a strip of land, do not throw away suds. Both
    ashes and suds are good manure for bushes and young plants.</p>

    <p>When a white Navarino bonnet becomes soiled, rip it in
    pieces, and wash it with a sponge and soft water. While it is
    yet damp, wash it two or three times with a clean sponge dipped
    into a strong saffron tea, nicely strained. Repeat this till
    the bonnet is as dark a straw color as you wish. Press it on
    the wrong side with a warm iron, and it will look like a new
    Leghorn.</p>

    <p>About the last of May, or the first of June, the little
    millers, which lay moth-eggs begin to appear. Therefore brush
    all your woollens, and pack them away in a dark place covered
    with linen. Pepper, red-cedar chips, tobacco,&mdash;indeed,
    almost any strong spicy smell,&mdash;is good to keep moths out
    of your chests and drawers. But nothing is so good as camphor.
    Sprinkle your woollens with camphorated spirit, and scatter
    pieces of camphor-gum among them, and you will never be
    troubled with moths. Some people buy camphor-wood trunks, for
    this purpose; but they are very expensive, and the gum answers
    just as well.</p>

    <p>The first young leaves of the common currant-bush, gathered
    as soon as they put out, and dried on tin, can hardly be
    distinguished from green tea.</p>

    <p>Cream of tartar, rubbed upon soiled white kid gloves,
    cleanses them very
    much.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>{14}</span>

    <p>Bottles that have been used for rose-water, should be used
    for nothing else; if scalded ever so much, they will kill the
    spirit of what is put in them.</p>

    <p>If you have a greater quantity of cheeses in the house than
    is likely to be soon used, cover them carefully with paper,
    fastened on with flour paste, so as to exclude the air. In this
    way they may be kept free from insects for years. They should
    be kept in a dry, cool place.</p>

    <p>Pulverized alum possesses the property of purifying water. A
    large spoonful stirred into a hogshead of water will so purify
    it, that in a few hours the dirt will all sink to the bottom,
    and it will be as fresh and clear as spring water. Four gallons
    may be purified by a tea-spoonful.</p>

    <p>Save vials and bottles. Apothecaries and grocers will give
    something for them. If the bottles are of good thick glass,
    they will always be useful for bottling cider or beer; but if
    they are thin French glass, like claret bottles, they will not
    answer.</p>

    <p>Woollens should be washed in very hot suds, and not rinsed.
    Lukewarm water shrinks them.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, silk, or anything that has silk in it,
    should be washed in water almost cold. Hot water turns it
    yellow. It may be washed in suds made of nice white soap; but
    no soap should be put upon it. Likewise avoid the use of hot
    irons in smoothing silk. Either rub the articles dry with a
    soft cloth, or put them between two towels, and press them with
    weights.</p>

    <p>Do not let knives be dropped into hot dish-water. It is a
    good plan to have a large tin pot to wash them in, just high
    enough to wash the blades, <i>without wetting</i> the handles.
    Keep your castors covered with blotting-paper and green
    flannel. Keep your salt-spoons out of the salt, and clean them
    often.</p>

    <p>Do not wrap knives and forks in woollens. Wrap them in good,
    strong paper. Steel is injured by lying in woollens.</p>

    <p>If it be practicable, get a friend in the country to procure
    you a quantity of lard, butter, and eggs, at the time they are
    cheapest, to be put down for winter use. You
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>{15}</span> will be likely to get them
       cheaper and better than in the city market; but by all means
       put down your winter's stock. Lard requires no other care
       than to be kept in a dry, cool place. Butter is sweetest in
       September and June; because food is then plenty, and not
       rendered bitter by frost. Pack your butter in a clean,
       scalded firkin, cover it with strong brine, and spread a
       cloth all over the top, and it will keep good until the Jews
       get into Grand Isle. If you happen to have a bit of
       salt-petre, dissolve it with the brine. Dairy-women say that
       butter comes more easily, and has a peculiar hardness and
       sweetness, if the cream is scalded and strained before it is
       used. The cream should stand down cellar over night, after
       being scalded, that it may get perfectly cold.</p>

    <p>Suet and lard keep better in tin than in earthen.</p>

    <p>Suet keeps good all the year round, if chopped and packed
    down in a stone jar, covered with molasses.</p>

    <p>Pick suet free from veins and skin, melt it in water before
    a moderate fire, let it cool till it forms into a hard cake,
    then wipe it dry, and put it in clean paper in linen bags.</p>

    <p>Preserve the backs of old letters to write upon. If you have
    children who are learning to write, buy coarse white paper by
    the quantity, and keep it locked up, ready to be made into
    writing books. It does not cost half as much as it does to buy
    them at the stationer's.</p>

    <p>Do not let coffee and tea stand in tin. Scald your wooden
    ware often; and keep your tin ware dry.</p>

    <p>When mattresses get hard and bunchy, rip them, take the hair
    out, pull it thoroughly by hand, let it lie a day or two to
    air, wash the tick, lay it in as light and even as possible,
    and catch it down, as before. Thus prepared, they will be as
    good as new.</p>

    <p>It is poor economy to buy vinegar by the gallon, Buy a
    barrel, or half a barrel, of really strong vinegar, when you
    begin house-keeping. As you use it, fill the barrel with old
    cider, sour beer, or wine-settlings, &amp;c., left in pitchers,
    decanters or tumblers; weak tea is likewise said to be good:
    nothing is hurtful, which has a tolerable portion of spirit, or
    acidity. Care must be taken not to add these things in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>{16}</span> too large quantities, or too
       often: if the vinegar once gets weak, it is difficult to
       restore it. If possible, it is well to keep such slops as I
       have mentioned in a different keg, and draw them off once in
       three or four weeks, in such a quantity as you think the
       vinegar will bear. If by any carelessness you do weaken it,
       a few white beans dropped in, or white paper dipped in
       molasses, is said to be useful. If beer grows sour, it may
       be used to advantage for pancakes and fritters. If very sour
       indeed, put a pint of molasses and water to it, and, two or
       three days after, put a half pint of vinegar; and in ten
       days it will be first rate vinegar.</p>

    <p>Barley straw is the best for beds; dry corn husks, slit into
    shreds, are far better than straw.</p>

    <p>Straw beds are much better for being boxed at the sides; in
    the same manner upholsterers prepare ticks for feathers. Brass
    andirons should be cleaned, done up in papers, and put in a dry
    place, during the summer season.</p>

    <p>If you have a large family, it is well to keep white rags
    separate from colored ones, and cotton separate from woollen;
    they bring a higher price. Paper brings a cent a pound, and if
    you have plenty of room, it is well to save it. 'A penny saved
    is a penny got.'</p>

    <p>Always have plenty of dish-water, and have it hot. There is
    no need of asking the character of a domestic, if you have ever
    seen her wash dishes in a little greasy water. When molasses is
    used in cooking, it is a prodigious improvement to boil and
    skim it before you use it. It takes out the unpleasant raw
    taste, and makes it almost as good as sugar. Where molasses is
    used much for cooking, it is well to prepare one or two gallons
    in this way at a time.</p>

    <p>In winter, always set the handle of your pump as high as
    possible, before you go to bed. Except in very rigid weather,
    this keeps the handle from freezing. When there is reason to
    apprehend extreme cold, do not forget to throw a rug or
    horse-blanket over your pump; a frozen pump is a comfortless
    preparation for a winter's breakfast. Never allow ashes to be
    taken up in wood, or put into wood. Always have your tinder-box
    and lantern ready <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>{17}</span> for use, in case of sudden
       alarm. Have important papers all together, where you can lay
       your hand on them at once, in case of fire.</p>

    <p>Keep an old blanket and sheet on purpose for ironing, and on
    no account suffer any other to be used. Have plenty of holders
    always made, that your towels may not be burned out in such
    service.</p>

    <p>Keep a coarse broom for the cellar stairs, wood-shed, yard,
    &amp;c. No good housekeeper allows her carpet broom to be used
    for such things.</p>

    <p>There should always be a heavy stone on the top of your
    pork, to keep it down. This stone is an excellent place to keep
    a bit of fresh meat in the summer, when you are afraid of its
    spoiling.</p>

    <p>Have all the good bits of vegetables and meat collected
    after dinner, and minced before they are set away; that they
    may be in readiness to make a little savoury mince meat for
    supper or breakfast. Take the skins off your potatoes before
    they grow cold.</p>

    <p>Vials, which have been used for medicine, should be put into
    cold ashes and water, boiled, and suffered to cool before they
    are rinsed.</p>

    <p>If you live in the city, where it is always easy to procure
    provisions, be careful and not buy too much for your daily
    wants, while the weather is warm.</p>

    <p>Never leave out your clothes-line over night; and see that
    your clothes-pins are all gathered into a basket.</p>

    <p>Have plenty of crash towels in the kitchen; never let your
    white napkins be used there.</p>

    <p>Soap your dirtiest clothes, and soak them in soft water over
    night.</p>

    <p>Use hard soap to wash your clothes, and soft to wash your
    floors. Soft soap is so slippery, that it wastes a good deal in
    washing clothes.</p>

    <p>Instead of covering up your glasses and pictures with
    muslin, cover the frames only with cheap, yellow cambric,
    neatly put on, and as near the color of the gilt as you can
    procure it. This looks better; leaves the glasses open for use,
    and the pictures for ornament; and is an effectual
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>{18}</span> barrier to dust as well as
       flies. It can easily be re-colored with saffron tea, when it
       is faded.</p>

    <p>Have a bottle full of brandy, with as large a mouth as any
    bottle you have, into which cut your lemon and orange peel when
    they are fresh and sweet. This brandy gives a delicious flavor
    to all sorts of pies, puddings, and cakes. Lemon is the
    pleasantest spice of the two; therefore they should be kept in
    separate bottles. It is a good plan to preserve rose-leaves in
    brandy. The flavor is pleasanter than rose-water; and there are
    few people who have the utensils for distilling. Peach leaves
    steeped in brandy make excellent spice for custards and
    puddings.</p>

    <p>It is easy to have a supply of horse-radish all winter. Have
    a quantity grated, while the root is in perfection, put it in
    bottles, fill it with strong vinegar, and keep it corked
    tight.</p>

    <p>It is thought to be a preventive to the unhealthy influence
    of cucumbers to cut the slices very thin, and drop each one
    into cold water as you cut it. A few minutes in the water takes
    out a large portion of the slimy matter, so injurious to
    health. They should be eaten with high seasoning.</p>

    <p>Where sweet oil is much used, it is more economical to buy
    it by the bottle than by the flask. A bottle holds more than
    twice as much as a flask, and it is never double the price.</p>

    <p>If you wish to have free-stone hearths dark, wash them with
    soap, and wipe them with a wet cloth; some people rub in
    lamp-oil, once in a while, and wash the hearth faithfully
    afterwards. This does very well in a large, dirty family; for
    the hearth looks very clean, and is not liable to show grease
    spots. But if you wish to preserve the beauty of a freestone
    hearth, buy a quantity of free-stone powder of the
    stone-cutter, and rub on a portion of it wet, after you have
    washed your hearth in hot water. When it is dry, brush it off,
    and it will look like new stone. Bricks can be kept clean with
    redding stirred up in water, and put on with a brush.
    Pulverized clay mixed with redding, makes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>{19}</span> a pretty rose color. Some think
       it is less likely to come off, if mixed with skim milk
       instead of water. But black lead is far handsomer than
       anything else for this purpose. It looks very well mixed
       with water, like redding; but it gives it a glossy
       appearance to boil the lead in soft soap, with a little
       water to keep it from burning. It should be put on with a
       brush, in the same manner as redding; it looks nice for a
       long time, when done in this way.</p>

    <p>Keep a bag for odd pieces of tape and strings; they will
    come in use. Keep a bag or box for old buttons, so that you may
    know where to go when you want one.</p>

    <p>Run the heels of stockings faithfully; and mend thin places,
    as well as holes. 'A stitch in time saves nine.'</p>

    <p>Poke-root, boiled in water and mixed with a good quantity of
    molasses, set about the kitchen, the pantry, &amp;c. in large
    deep plates, will kill cockroaches in great numbers, and
    finally rid the house of them. The Indians say that poke-root
    boiled into a soft poultice is the cure for the bite of a
    snake. I have heard of a fine horse saved by it.</p>

    <p>A little salt sprinkled in starch while it is boiling, tends
    to prevent it from sticking; it is likewise good to stir it
    with a clean spermaceti candle.</p>

    <p>A few potatoes sliced, and boiling water poured over them,
    makes an excellent preparation for cleansing and stiffening old
    rusty black silk.</p>

    <p>Green tea is excellent to restore rusty silk. It should be
    boiled in iron, nearly a cup full to three quarts. The silk
    should not be wrung, and should be ironed damp.</p>

    <p>Lime pulverized, sifted through coarse muslin, and stirred
    up tolerably thick in white of eggs, makes a strong cement for
    glass and china. Plaster of Paris is still better; particularly
    for mending broken images of the same material. It should be
    stirred up by the spoonful, as it is
    wanted.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>A bit of isinglass dissolved in gin, or boiled in spirits of
    wine, is said to make strong cement for broken glass, china,
    and sea-shells.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"

    <p>The lemon syrup, usually sold at fifty cents a bottle, may
    be made much cheaper. Those who use a great quantity of it will
    find it worth their while to make it. Take about a pound of
    Havana sugar; boil it in water down to a quart; drop in the
    white of an egg, to clarify it; strain it; add one quarter of
    an oz. of tartaric acid, or citric acid; if you do not find it
    sour enough, after it has stood two or three days and shaken
    freely, add more of the acid. A few drops of the oil of lemon
    improves it.</p>

    <p>If you wish to clarify sugar and water, you are about to
    boil, it is well to stir in the white of one egg, while cold;
    if put in after it boils, the egg is apt to get hardened before
    it can do any good.</p>

    <p>Those who are fond of soda powders will do well to inquire
    at the apothecaries for the suitable acid and alkali, and buy
    them by the ounce, or the pound, according to the size of their
    families. Experience soon teaches the right proportions; and,
    sweetened with a little sugar or lemon syrup, it is quite as
    good as what one gives five times as much for, done up in
    papers. The case is the same with Rochelle powders.</p>

    <p>When the stopper of a glass decanter becomes too tight, a
    cloth wet with hot water and applied to the neck, will cause
    the glass to expand, so that the stopper may be easily
    removed.</p>

    <p>Glass vessels in a cylindrical form, may be cut in two, by
    tying around them a worsted thread, thoroughly wet with spirits
    of turpentine, and then setting fire to the thread. Court
    plaster is made of thin silk first dipped in dissolved
    isinglass and dried, then dipped several times in the white of
    egg and dried.</p>

    <p>When plain tortoise-shell combs are defaced, the polish may
    be renewed by rubbing them with pulverized rotten-stone and
    oil. The rotten-stone should be sifted through muslin. It looks
    better to be rubbed on by the hand. The jewellers afterwards
    polish them by rubbing them with dry <i>rouge powder</i>; but
    sifted magnesia does just as well&mdash;and if the ladies had
    rouge, perhaps they would, <i>by mistake</i>, put it upon their
    cheeks, instead of their combs; and thereby spoil their
    complexions. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>{21}</span> The best way to cleanse gold is,
       to wash it in warm suds made of delicate soap, with ten or
       fifteen drops of <i>sal-volatile</i> in it. This makes
       jewels very brilliant.</p>

    <p>Straw carpets should be washed in salt and water, and wiped
    with a dry, coarse towel. They have a strong tendency to turn
    yellow; and the salt prevents it. Moisture makes them decay
    soon; therefore they should be kept thoroughly dry.</p>

    <p>Rye paste is more adhesive than any other paste; because
    that grain is very glutinous. It is much improved by adding a
    little pounded alum, while it is boiling. This makes it almost
    as strong as glue.</p>

    <p>Red ants are among the worst plagues that can infest a
    house. A lady who had long been troubled with them, assured me
    she destroyed them in a few days, after the following manner.
    She placed a dish of cracked shagbarks (of which they are more
    fond than of anything else) in the closet. They soon gathered
    upon it in troops. She then put some corrosive sublimate in a
    cup; ordered the dish to be carried carefully to the fire, and
    all its contents brushed in; while she swept the few that
    dropped upon the shelf into the cup, and, with a feather, wet
    all the cracks from whence they came, with corrosive sublimate.
    When this had been repeated four or five times, the house was
    effectually cleared. Too much care cannot be taken of corrosive
    sublimate, especially when children are about. Many dreadful
    accidents have happened in consequence of carelessness. Bottles
    which have contained it should be broken, and buried; and cups
    should be boiled out in ashes and water. If kept in the house,
    it should be hung up high, out of reach, with POISON written
    upon it in large letters.</p>

    <p>The neatest way to separate wax from honey-comb is to tie
    the comb up in a linen or woollen bag; place it in a kettle of
    cold water, and hang it over the fire. As the water heats, the
    wax melts, and rises to the surface, while all the impurities
    remain in the bag. It is well to put a few pebbles in the bag,
    to keep it from floating.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>{22}</span> Honey may be separated from the
       comb, by placing it in the hot sun, or before the fire, with
       two or three colanders or sieves, each finer than the other,
       under it.</p>

    <h2>SOAP.</h2>

    <p>In the city, I believe, it is better to exchange ashes and
    grease for soap; but in the country, I am certain, it is good
    economy to make one's own soap. If you burn wood, you can make
    your own lye; but the ashes of coal is not worth much. Bore
    small holes in the bottom of a barrel, place four bricks
    around, and fill the barrel with ashes. Wet the ashes well, but
    not enough to drop; let it soak thus three or four days; then
    pour a gallon of water in every hour or two, for a day or more,
    and let it drop into a pail or tub beneath. Keep it dripping
    till the color of the lye shows the strength is exhausted. If
    your lye is not strong enough, you must fill your barrel with
    fresh ashes, and let the lye run through it. Some people take a
    barrel without any bottom, and lay sticks and straw across to
    prevent the ashes from falling through. To make a barrel of
    soap, it will require about five or six bushels of ashes, with
    at least four quarts of unslacked stone lime; if slacked,
    doable the quantity.</p>

    <p>When you have drawn off a part of the lye, put the lime
    (whether slack or not) into two or three pails of boiling
    water, and add it to the ashes, and let it drain through.</p>

    <p>It is the practice of some people, in making soap, to put
    the lime near the bottom of the ashes when they first set it
    tip; but the lime becomes like mortar, and the lye does not run
    through, so as to get the strength of it, which is very
    important in making soap, as it contracts the nitrous salts
    which collect in ashes, and prevents the soap from
    <i>coming</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>{23}</span> (as the saying is.) Old ashes
       are very apt to be impregnated with it.</p>

    <p>Three pounds of grease should be put into a pailful of lye.
    The great difficulty in making soap '<i>come</i>' originates in
    want of judgment about the strength of the lye. One rule may be
    safely trusted&mdash;If your lye will bear up an egg, or a
    potato, so that you can see a piece of the surface as big as
    ninepence, it is just strong enough. If it sink below the top
    of the lye, it is too weak, and will never make soap; if it is
    buoyed up half way, the lye is too strong; and that is just as
    bad. A bit of quick-lime, thrown in while the lye and grease
    are boiling together, is of service. When the soap becomes
    thick and ropy, carry it down cellar in pails and empty it into
    a barrel.</p>

    <p>Cold soap is less trouble, because it does not need to boil;
    the sun does the work of fire. The lye must be prepared and
    tried in the usual way. The grease must be tried out, and
    strained from the scraps. Two pounds of grease (instead of
    three) must be used to a pailful; unless the weather is very
    sultry, the lye should be hot when put to the grease. It should
    stand in the sun, and be stirred every day. If it does not
    begin to look like soap in the course of five or six days, add
    a little hot lye to it; if this does not help it, try whether
    it be grease that it wants. Perhaps you will think cold soap
    wasteful, because the grease must be strained; but if the
    scraps are boiled thoroughly in strong lye, the grease will all
    float upon the surface, and nothing be lost.</p>

    <h2>SIMPLE REMEDIES.</h2>

    <p>Cotton wool, wet with sweet oil and paregoric, relieves the
    ear-ache very soon.</p>

    <p>A good quantity of old cheese is the best thing to eat, when
    distressed by eating too much fruit, or oppressed with any kind
    of food. Physicians have given it in cases of extreme
    danger.</p>

    <p>Honey and milk is very good for worms; so is strong salt
    water; likewise powdered sage and molasses taken freely.</p>

    <p>For a sudden attack of quincy or croup, bathe the neck with
    bear's grease, and pour it down the throat. A linen rag soaked
    in sweet oil, butter, or lard, and sprinkled with yellow Scotch
    snuff, is said to have performed wonderful cures in cases of
    croup: it should be placed where the distress is greatest.
    Goose-grease, or any kind of oily grease, is as good as bear's
    oil.</p>

    <p>Equal parts of camphor, spirits of wine, and hartshorn, well
    mixed, and rubbed upon the throat, is said to be good for the
    croup.</p>

    <p>Cotton wool and oil are the best things for a burn. A
    poultice of wheat bran, or rye bran, and vinegar, very soon
    takes down the inflammation occasioned by a sprain. Brown
    paper, wet, is healing to a bruise. Dipped in molasses, it is
    said to take down inflammation.</p>

    <p>In case of any scratch, or wound, from which the lockjaw is
    apprehended, bathe the injured part freely with lye or
    pearl-ash and water.</p>

    <p>A rind of pork bound upon a wound occasioned by a needle,
    pin, or nail, prevents the lock-jaw. It should be always
    applied. Spirits of turpentine is good to prevent the lock-jaw.
    Strong soft-soap, mixed with pulverized chalk, about as thick
    as batter, put, in a thin cloth or bag, upon the wound, is said
    to be a preventive to this dangerous disorder. The chalk should
    be kept moist, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>{25}</span> till the wound begins to
       discharge itself; when the patient will find relief.</p>

    <p>If you happen to cut yourself slightly while cooking, bind
    on some fine salt: molasses is likewise good.</p>

    <p>Flour boiled thoroughly in milk, so as to make quite a thick
    porridge, is good in cases of dysentery. A tablespoonful of
    W.I. rum, a table-spoonful of sugar-baker's molasses, and the
    same quantity of sweet oil, well simmered together, is likewise
    good for this disorder; the oil softens the harshness of the
    other ingredients.</p>

    <p>Black or green tea, steeped in boiling milk, seasoned with
    nutmeg, and best of loaf sugar, is excellent for the dysentery.
    Cork burnt to charcoal, about as big as a hazel-nut, macerated,
    and put in a tea-spoonful of brandy, with a little loaf sugar
    and nutmeg, is very efficacious in cases of dysentery and
    cholera-morbus. If nutmeg be wanting, peppermint-water may be
    used. Flannel wet with brandy, powdered with Cayenne pepper,
    and laid upon the bowels, affords great relief in cases of
    extreme distress.</p>

    <p>Dissolve as much table-salt in keen vinegar, as will ferment
    and work clear. When the foam is discharged, cork it up in a
    bottle, and put it away for use. A large spoonful of this, in a
    gill of boiling water, is very efficacious in cases of
    dysentery and colic.<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

    <p>Whortleberries, commonly called huckleberries, dried, are a
    useful medicine for children. Made into tea, and sweetened with
    molasses, they are very beneficial, when the system is in a
    restricted state, and the digestive powers out of order.</p>

    <p>Blackberries are extremely useful in cases of dysentery. To
    eat the berries is very healthy; tea made of the roots and
    leaves is beneficial; and a syrup made of the berries is still
    better. Blackberries have sometimes effected a cure when
    physicians despaired.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>{26}</span>

    <p>Loaf sugar and brandy relieves a sore throat; when very bad,
    it is good to inhale the steam of scalding hot vinegar through
    the tube of a tunnel. This should be tried carefully at first,
    lest the throat be scalded. For children, it should be allowed
    to cool a little.</p>

    <p>A stocking bound on warm from the foot, at night, is good
    for the sore throat.</p>

    <p>An ointment made from the common ground-worms, which boys
    dig to bait fishes, rubbed on with the hand, is said to be
    excellent, when the sinews are drawn up by any disease or
    accident.</p>

    <p>A gentleman in Missouri advertises that he had an inveterate
    cancer upon his nose cured by a strong potash made of the lye
    of the ashes of red oak bark, boiled down to the consistence of
    molasses. The cancer was covered with this, and, about an hour
    after, covered with a plaster of tar. This must be removed in a
    few days, and, if any protuberances remain in the wound, apply
    more potash to them, and the plaster again, until they entirely
    disappear: after which heal the wound with any common soothing
    salve. I never knew this to be tried.</p>

    <p>If a wound bleeds very fast, and there is no physician at
    hand, cover it with the scrapings of sole-leather, scraped like
    coarse lint. This stops blood very soon. Always have vinegar,
    camphor, hartshorn, or something of that kind, in readiness, as
    the sudden stoppage of blood almost always makes a person
    faint.</p>

    <p>Balm-of-Gilead buds bottled up in N.E. rum, make the best
    cure in the world for fresh cuts and wounds. Every family
    should have a bottle of it. The buds should be gathered in a
    peculiar state; just when they are well swelled, ready to burst
    into leaves, and well covered with gum. They last but two or
    three days in this state.</p>

    <p>Plantain and house-leek, boiled in cream, and strained
    before it is put away to cool, makes a very cooling, soothing
    ointment. Plantain leaves laid upon a wound are cooling and
    healing.</p>

    <p>Half a spoonful of <i>citric acid</i>, (which may always be
    bought of the apothecaries,) stirred in half a tumbler of
    water, is excellent for the
    head-ache.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>{27}</span>

    <p>People in general think they must go abroad for vapor-baths;
    but a very simple one can be made at home. Place <i>strong</i>
    sticks across a tub of water, at the boiling point, and sit
    upon them, entirely enveloped in a blanket, feet and all. The
    steam from the water will be a vapor-bath. Some people put
    herbs into the water. Steam-baths are excellent for severe
    colds, and for some disorders in the bowels. They should not be
    taken without the advice of an experienced nurse, or physician.
    Great care should be taken not to renew the cold after; it
    would be doubly dangerous.</p>

    <p>Boiled potatoes are said to cleanse the hands as well as
    common soap; they prevent <i>chops</i> in the winter season,
    and keep the skin soft and healthy.</p>

    <p>Water-gruel, with three or four onions simmered in it,
    prepared with a lump of butter, pepper, and salt, eaten just
    before one goes to bed, is said to be a cure for a hoarse cold.
    A syrup made of horseradish-root and sugar is excellent for a
    cold.</p>

    <p>Very strong salt and water, when frequently applied, has
    been known to cure wens.</p>

    <p>The following poultice for the throat distemper, has been
    much approved in England:&mdash;The pulp of a roasted apple,
    mixed with an ounce of tobacco, the whole wet with spirits of
    wine, or any other high spirits, spread on a linen rag, and
    bound upon the throat at any period of the disorder.</p>

    <p>Nothing is so good to take down swellings, as a soft
    poultice of stewed white beans, put on in a thin muslin bag,
    and renewed every hour or two.</p>

    <p>The thin white skin, which comes from suet, is excellent to
    bind upon the feet for chilblains. Rubbing with Castile soap,
    and afterwards with honey, is likewise highly recommended. But,
    to cure the chilblains effectually, they must be attended to
    often, and for a long time.</p>

    <p>Always apply diluted laudanum to fresh wounds.</p>

    <p>A poultice of elder-blow tea and biscuit is good as a
    preventive to mortification. The approach of mortification is
    generally shown by the formation of blisters filled with
    <i>blood</i>; water blisters are not
    alarming.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>{28}</span>

    <p>Burnt alum held in the mouth is good for the canker.</p>

    <p>The common dark-blue violet makes a slimy tea, which is
    excellent for the canker. Leaves and blossoms are both good.
    Those who have families should take some pains to dry these
    flowers.</p>

    <p>When people have a sore mouth, from taking calomel, or any
    other cause, tea made of low-blackberry leaves is extremely
    beneficial.</p>

    <p>Tea made of slippery elm is good for the piles, and for
    humors in the blood; to be drank plentifully. Winter
    evergreen<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
       is considered good for all humors, particularly scrofula.
       Some call it rheumatism-weed; because a tea made from it is
       supposed to check that painful disorder.</p>

    <p>An ointment of lard, sulphur, and cream-of-tartar, simmered
    together, is good for the piles.</p>

    <p>Elixir proprietatis is a useful family medicine for all
    cases when the digestive powers are out of order. One ounce of
    saffron, one ounce of myrrh, and one ounce of aloes. Pulverize
    them; let the myrrh steep in half a pint of brandy, or N.E.
    rum, for four days; then add the saffron and aloes; let it
    stand in the sunshine, or in some warm place, for a fortnight;
    taking care to shake it well twice a day. At the end of the
    fortnight, fill up the bottle (a common sized one) with brandy,
    or N.E. rum, and let it stand a month. It costs six times as
    much to buy it in small quantities, as it does to make it.</p>

    <p>The constant use of malt beer, or malt in any way, is said
    to be a preservative against fevers.</p>

    <p>Black cherry-tree bark, barberry bark, mustard-seed, petty
    morrel-root, and horseradish, well steeped in cider, are
    excellent for the jaundice.</p>

    <p>Cotton wool and oil are the best things for a burn. When
    children are burned, it is difficult to make them endure the
    application of cotton wool. I have known the inflammation of a
    very bad burn extracted in one night, by the constant
    application of brandy, vinegar, and water,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>{29}</span> mixed together. This feels cool
       and pleasant, and a few drops of paregoric will soon put the
       little sufferer to sleep. The bathing should be continued
       till the pain is gone.</p>

    <p>A few drops of the oil of Cajput on cotton wool is said to
    be a great relief to the tooth-ache. It occasions a smart pain
    for a few seconds, when laid upon the defective tooth. Any
    apothecary will furnish it ready dropped on cotton wool, for a
    few cents.</p>

    <p>A poultice made of ginger or of common chickweed, that grows
    about one's door in the country, has given great relief to the
    tooth-ache, when applied frequently to the cheek.</p>

    <p>A spoonful of ashes stirred in cider is good to prevent
    sickness at the stomach. Physicians frequently order it in
    cases of cholera-morbus.</p>

    <p>When a blister occasioned by a burn breaks, it is said to be
    a good plan to put wheat flour upon the naked flesh.</p>

    <p>The buds of the elder bush, gathered in early spring, and
    simmered with new butter, or sweet lard, make a very healing
    and cooling ointment.</p>

    <p>Night sweats have been cured, when more powerful remedies
    had failed, by fasting morning and night, and drinking cold
    sage tea constantly and freely.</p>

    <p>Lard, melted and cooled five or six times in succession, by
    being poured each time into a fresh pail-full of water, then
    simmered with sliced onions, and cooled, is said, by old
    nurses, to make a salve, which is almost infallible in curing
    inflammations produced by taking cold in wounds.</p>

    <p>Vinegar curds, made by pouring vinegar into warm milk, put
    on warm, and changed pretty frequently, are likewise excellent
    to subdue inflammation.</p>

    <p>Chalk wet with hartshorn is a remedy for the sting of bees;
    so is likewise table-salt kept moist with water.</p>

    <p>Boil castor-oil with an equal quantity of milk, sweeten it
    with a little sugar, stir it well, and, when cold, give it to
    children for drink. They will never suspect it is medicine; and
    will even love the taste of it.</p>

    <p>As molasses is often given to children as a gentle physic,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>{30}</span> it will be useful to know that
       West India molasses is a gentle cathartic, while
       sugar-baker's molasses is slightly astringent.</p>

    <p>If a fellon or run-round appears to be coming on the finger,
    you can do nothing better than to soak the finger thoroughly in
    hot lye. It will be painful, but it will cure a disorder much
    more painful.</p>

    <p>Whiskey, which has had Spanish-flies in soak, is said to be
    good for ring-worms; but I never knew an instance of its being
    tried. Unless too strong, or used in great quantities, it
    cannot, at least, do any harm. Washing the hands frequently in
    warm vinegar, is good for ring-worms.</p>

    <p>When the toe nails have a tendency to turn in, so as to be
    painful, the nail should always be kept scraped <i>very
    thin</i>, and as near the flesh as possible. As soon as the
    corner of the nail can be raised up out of the flesh, it should
    be kept from again entering, by putting a tuft of fine lint
    under it.</p>

    <p>As this book may fall into the hands of those who cannot
    speedily obtain a physician, it is worth while to mention what
    is best to be done for the bite of a rattlesnake:&mdash;Cut the
    flesh out, around the bite, <i>instantly</i>; that the poison
    may not have time to circulate in the blood. If caustic is at
    hand, put it upon the raw flesh; if not, the next best thing is
    to fill the wound with salt&mdash;renewing it occasionally.
    Take a dose of sweet oil and spirits of turpentine, to defend
    the stomach. If the whole limb swell, bathe it in salt and
    vinegar freely. It is well to physic the system thoroughly,
    before returning to usual diet.</p>

    <h4>GRUEL.</h4>

    <p>Gruel is very easily made. Have a pint of water boiling in a
    skillet; stir up three or four large spoonfuls of nicely sifted
    oat-meal, rye, or Indian, in cold water. Pour it into the
    skillet while the water boils. Let it boil eight or ten
    minutes. Throw in a large handful of raisins to boil, if the
    patient is well enough to bear them. When put in a bowl, add a
    little salt, white sugar, and
    nutmeg.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>{31}</span>

    <h4>EGG GRUEL.</h4>

    <p>This is at once food and medicine. Some people have very
    great faith in its efficacy in cases of chronic dysentery. It
    is made thus: Boil a pint of new milk; beat four new-laid eggs
    to a light froth, and pour in while the milk boils; stir them
    together thoroughly, but do not let them boil; sweeten it with
    the best of loaf sugar, and grate in a whole nutmeg; add a
    little salt, if you like it. Drink half of it while it is warm,
    and the other half in two hours.</p>

    <h4>ARROW-ROOT JELLY.</h4>

    <p>Put about a pint of water in a skillet to boil; stir up a
    large spoonful of arrow-root powder in a cup of water; pour it
    into the skillet while the water is boiling; let them boil
    together three or four minutes. Season it with nutmeg and loaf
    sugar. This is very light food for an invalid. When the system
    is in a relaxed state, two tea-spoonfuls of brandy may be put
    in. Milk and loaf sugar boiled, and a spoonful of fine flour,
    well mixed with a little cold water, poured in while the milk
    is boiling, is light food in cases of similar diseases.</p>

    <h4>CALF'S FOOT JELLY.</h4>

    <p>Boil four feet in a gallon of water, till it is reduced to a
    quart. Strain it, and let it stand, till it is quite cool. Skim
    off the fat, and add to the jelly one pint of wine, half a
    pound of sugar, the whites of six eggs, and the juice of four
    large lemons; boil all these materials together eight or ten
    minutes. Then strain into the glasses, or jars, in which you
    intend to keep it. Some lay a few bits of the lemon-peel at the
    bottom, and let it be strained upon them.</p>

    <h4>TAPIOCA JELLY.</h4>

    <p>Wash it two or three times, soak it five or six hours;
    simmer it in the same water with bits of fresh lemon-peel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>{32}</span> until it becomes quite clear;
       then put in lemon juice, wine and loaf sugar.</p>

    <h4>SAGO JELLY.</h4>

    <p>The sago should be soaked in cold water an hour, and washed
    thoroughly; simmered with lemon-peel and a few cloves. Add wine
    and loaf sugar when nearly done; and let it all boil together a
    few minutes.</p>

    <h4>BEEF TEA.</h4>

    <p>Beef tea, for the sick, is made by broiling a tender steak
    nicely, seasoning it with pepper and salt, cutting it up, and
    pouring water over it, not quite boiling. Put in a little water
    at a time, and let it stand to soak the goodness out.</p>

    <h4>WINE WHEY.</h4>

    <p>Wine whey is a cooling and safe drink in fevers. Set half a
    pint of sweet milk at the fire, pour in one glass of wine, and
    let it remain perfectly still, till it curdles; when the curds
    settle, strain it, and let it cool. It should not get more than
    blood-warm. A spoonful of rennet-water hastens the operation.
    Made palatable with loaf sugar and nutmeg, if the patient can
    bear it.</p>

    <h4>APPLE WATER.</h4>

    <p>This is given as sustenance when the stomach is too weak to
    bear broth, &amp;c. It may be made thus,&mdash;Pour boiling
    water on roasted apples; let them stand three hours, then
    strain and sweeten lightly:&mdash;Or it may be made
    thus,&mdash;Peel and slice tart apples, add some sugar and
    lemon-peel; then pour some boiling water over the whole, and
    let it stand covered by the fire, more than an hour.</p>

    <h4>MILK PORRIDGE.</h4>

    <p>Boil new milk; stir flour thoroughly into some cold milk in
    a bowl, and pour it into the kettle while the milk
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>{33}</span> is boiling: let it all boil six
       or eight minutes. Some people like it thicker than others; I
       should think three large spoonfuls of flour to a quart of
       milk was about right. It should always be seasoned with
       salt; and if the patient likes, loaf sugar and nutmeg may be
       put in. In cases of fever, little salt or spice should be
       put into any nourishment; but in cases of dysentery, salt
       and nutmeg may be used freely: in such cases too, more flour
       should be put in porridge, and it should be boiled very
       thoroughly indeed.</p>

    <h4>STEWED PRUNES.</h4>

    <p>Stew them very gently in a small quantity of water, till the
    stones slip out. Physicians consider them safe nourishment in
    fevers.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>VEGETABLES.</h2>

    <p>Parsnips should be kept down cellar, covered up in sand,
    entirely excluded from the air. They are good only in the
    spring.</p>

    <p>Cabbages put into a hole in the ground will keep well during
    the winter, and be hard, fresh, and sweet, in the spring. Many
    farmers keep potatoes in the same way.</p>

    <p>Onions should be kept very dry, and never carried into the
    cellar except in severe weather, when there is danger of their
    freezing. By no means let them be in the cellar after March;
    they will sprout and spoil. Potatoes should likewise be
    carefully looked to in the spring, and the sprouts broken off.
    The cellar is the best place for them, because they are injured
    by wilting; but sprout them carefully, if you want to keep
    them. They never sprout but three times; therefore, after you
    have sprouted them three times, they will trouble you no
    more.</p>

    <p>Squashes should never be kept down cellar when it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>{34}</span> possible to prevent it. Dampness
       injures them. If intense cold makes it necessary to put them
       there, bring them up as soon as possible, and keep them in
       some dry, warm place.</p>

    <p>Cabbages need to be boiled an hour; beets an hour and a
    half. The lower part of a squash should be boiled half an hour;
    the neck pieces fifteen or twenty minutes longer. Parsnips
    should boil an hour, or an hour and a quarter, according to
    size. New potatoes should boil fifteen or twenty minutes; three
    quarters of an hour, or an hour, is not too much for large, old
    potatoes; common-sized ones, half an hour. In the spring, it is
    a good plan to cut off a slice from the seed end of potatoes
    before you cook them. The seed end is opposite to that which
    grew upon the vine; the place where the vine was broken off may
    be easily distinguished. By a provision of nature, the seed end
    becomes watery in the spring; and, unless cut off, it is apt to
    injure the potato. If you wish to have potatoes mealy, do not
    let them stop boiling for an instant; and when they are done,
    turn the water off, and let them steam for ten or twelve
    minutes over the fire. See they don't stay long enough to burn
    to the kettle. In Canada, they cut the skin all off, and put
    them in pans, to be cooked over a stove, by steam. Those who
    have eaten them, say they are mealy and white, looking like
    large snow-balls when brought upon the table.</p>

    <p>Potatoes boiled and mashed while hot, are good to use in
    making short cakes and puddings; they save flour, and less
    shortening is necessary.</p>

    <p>It is said that a bit of unslacked lime, about as big as a
    robin's egg, thrown among old, watery potatoes, while they are
    boiling, will tend to make them mealy. I never saw the
    experiment tried.</p>

    <p>Asparagus should be boiled fifteen or twenty minutes; half
    an hour, if old.</p>

    <p>Green peas should be boiled from twenty minutes to sixty,
    according to their age; string beans the same. Corn should be
    boiled from twenty minutes to forty, according to age;
    dandelions half an hour, or three quarters,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>{35}</span> according to age. Dandelions are
       very much improved by cultivation. If cut off, without
       injuring the root, they will spring up again, fresh and
       tender, till late in the season.</p>

    <p>Beet-tops should be boiled twenty minutes; and spinage three
    or four minutes. Put in no green vegetables till the water
    boils, if you would keep all their sweetness.</p>

    <p>When green peas have become old and yellow, they may be made
    tender and green by sprinkling in a pinch or two of pearlash,
    while they are boiling. Pearlash has the same effect upon all
    summer vegetables, rendered tough by being too old. If your
    well-water is very hard, it is always an advantage to use a
    little pearlash in cooking.</p>

    <p>Tomatoes should be skinned by pouring boiling water over
    them. After they are skinned, they should be stewed half an
    hour, in tin, with a little salt, a small bit of butter, and a
    spoonful of water, to keep them from burning. This is a
    delicious vegetable. It is easily cultivated, and yields a most
    abundant crop. Some people pluck them green, and pickle
    them.</p>

    <p>The best sort of catsup is made from tomatoes. The
    vegetables should be squeezed up in the hand, salt put to them,
    and set by for twenty-four hours. After being passed through a
    sieve, cloves, allspice, pepper, mace, garlic, and whole
    mustard-seed should be added. It should be boiled down one
    third, and bottled after it is cool. No liquid is necessary, as
    the tomatoes are very juicy. A good deal of salt and spice is
    necessary to keep the catsup well. It is delicious with roast
    meat; and a cupful adds much to the richness of soup and
    chowder. The garlic should be taken out before it is
    bottled.</p>

    <p>Celery should be kept in the cellar, the roots covered with
    tan, to keep them moist.</p>

    <p>Green squashes that are turning yellow, and striped
    squashes, are more uniformly sweet and mealy than any other
    kind.</p>

    <p>If the tops of lettuce be cut off when it is becoming too
    old for use, it will grow up again fresh and tender, and may
    thus be kept good through the
    summer.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"

    <p>It is a good plan to boil onions in milk and water; it
    diminishes the strong taste of that vegetable. It is an
    excellent way of serving up onions, to chop them after they are
    boiled, and put them in a stewpan, with a little milk, butter,
    salt, and pepper, and let them stew about fifteen minutes. This
    gives them a fine flavor, and they can be served up very
    hot.</p>

    <h2>HERBS.</h2>

    <p>All herbs should be carefully kept from the air. Herb tea,
    to do any good, should be made <i>very strong</i>.</p>

    <p>Herbs should be gathered while in blossom. If left till they
    have gone to seed, the strength goes into the seed. Those who
    have a little patch of ground, will do well to raise the most
    important herbs; and those who have not, will do well to get
    them in quantities from some friend in the country; for
    apothecaries make very great profit upon them.</p>

    <p>Sage is very useful both as a medicine, for the
    headache&mdash;when made into tea&mdash;and for all kinds of
    stuffing, when dried and rubbed into powder. It should be kept
    tight from the air.</p>

    <p>Summer-savory is excellent to season soup, broth, and
    sausages. As a medicine, it relieves the cholic. Pennyroyal and
    tansy are good for the same medicinal purpose.</p>

    <p>Green wormwood bruised is excellent for a fresh wound of any
    kind. In winter, when wormwood is dry, it is necessary to
    soften it in warm vinegar, or spirit, before it is bruised, and
    applied to the wound.</p>

    <p>Hyssop tea is good for sudden colds, and disorders on the
    lungs. It is necessary to be very careful about exposure after
    taking it; it is peculiarly opening to the pores.</p>

    <p>Tea made of colt's-foot and flax-seed, sweetened with honey,
    is a cure for inveterate coughs. Consumptions have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>{37}</span> been prevented by it. It should
       be drank when going to bed; though it does good to drink it
       at any time. Hoarhound is useful in consumptive
       complaints.</p>

    <p>Motherwort tea is very quieting to the nerves. Students, and
    people troubled with wakefulness, find it useful.</p>

    <p>Thoroughwort is excellent for dyspepsy, and every disorder
    occasioned by indigestion. If the stomach be foul, it operates
    like a gentle emetic.</p>

    <p>Sweet-balm tea is cooling when one is in a feverish
    state.</p>

    <p>Catnip, particularly the blossoms, made into tea, is good to
    prevent a threatened fever. It produces a fine perspiration. It
    should be taken in bed, and the patient kept warm.</p>

    <p>Housekeepers should always dry leaves of the burdock and
    horseradish. Burdocks warmed in vinegar, with the hard, stalky
    parts cut out, are very soothing, applied to the feet; they
    produce a sweet and gentle perspiration. Horseradish is more
    powerful. It is excellent in cases of the ague, placed on the
    part affected. Warmed in vinegar, and clapped.</p>

    <p>Succory is a very valuable herb. The tea, sweetened with
    molasses, is good for the piles. It is a gentle and healthy
    physic, a preventive of dyspepsy, humors, inflammation, and all
    the evils resulting from a restricted state of the system.</p>

    <p>Elder-blow tea has a similar effect. It is cool and
    soothing, and peculiarly efficacious either for babes or grown
    people, when the digestive powers are out of order.</p>

    <p>Lungwort, maiden-hair, hyssop, elecampane and hoarhound
    steeped together, is an almost certain cure for a cough. A
    wine-glass full to be taken when going to bed.</p>

    <p>Few people know how to keep the flavor of sweet-marjoram;
    the best of all herbs for broth and stuffing. It should be
    gathered in bud or blossom, and dried in a tin-kitchen at a
    moderate distance from the fire; when dry, it should be
    immediately rubbed, sifted, and corked up in a bottle
    carefully.</p>

    <p>English-mallows steeped in milk is good for the
    dysentery.</p>

    <h2>CHEAP DYE-STUFFS.</h2>

    <p>A few general rules are necessary to be observed in
    coloring. The materials should be perfectly clean; soap should
    be rinsed out in soft water; the article should be entirely
    wetted, or it will spot; light colors should be steeped in
    brass, tin, or earthen; and if set at all, should be set with
    alum. Dark colors should be boiled in iron, and set with
    copperas. Too much copperas rots the thread.</p>

    <p>The apothecaries and hatters keep a compound of vitriol and
    indigo, commonly called 'blue composition.' An ounce vial full
    may be bought for nine-pence. It colors a fine blue. It is an
    economical plan to use it for old silk linings, ribbons,
    &amp;c. The original color should be boiled out, and the
    material thoroughly rinsed in soft water, so that no soap may
    remain in it; for soap ruins the dye. Twelve or sixteen drops
    of the blue composition, poured into a quart bowl full of warm
    soft water, stirred, (and strained, if any settlings are
    perceptible,) will color a great many articles. If you wish a
    deep blue, pour in more of the compound. Cotton must not be
    colored; the vitriol destroys it; if the material you wish to
    color has cotton threads in it, it will be ruined. After the
    things are thoroughly dried, they should be washed in cool
    suds, and dried again; this prevents any bad effects from the
    vitriol; if shut up from the air without being washed, there is
    danger of the texture being destroyed. If you wish to color
    green, have your cloth free as possible from the old color,
    clean, and rinsed, and, in the first place, color it a deep
    yellow. Fustic boiled in soft water makes the strongest and
    brightest yellow dye; but saffron, barberry bush, peach leaves,
    or onion skins, will answer pretty well. Next take a bowl full
    of strong yellow dye, and pour in a great spoonful or more of
    the blue composition. Stir it up well with a clean stick, and
    dip the articles you have already colored yellow into it, and
    they will take a lively grass green. This is a good plan for
    old bombazet curtains, dessert cloths,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>{39}</span> old flannel for covering a desk,
       &amp;c; it is likewise a handsome color for ribbons.</p>

    <p>Balm blossoms, steeped in water, color a pretty rose-color.
    This answers very well for the linings of children's bonnets,
    for ribbons, &amp;c. It fades in the course of one season; but
    it is very little trouble to recolor with it. It merely
    requires to be steeped and strained. Perhaps a small piece of
    alum might serve to set the color, in some degree. In earthen
    or tin.</p>

    <p>Saffron, steeped in earthen and strained, colors a fine
    straw color. It makes a delicate or deep shade according to the
    strength of the tea. The dry outside skins of onions, steeped
    in scalding water and strained, color a yellow very much like
    'bird of paradise' color. Peach leaves, or bark scraped from
    the barberry bush, colors a common bright yellow. In all these
    cases, a little piece of alum does no harm, and may help to fix
    the color. Ribbons, gauze handkerchiefs, &amp;c. are colored
    well in this way, especially if they be stiffened by a bit of
    gum-Arabic, dropped in while the stuff is steeping.</p>

    <p>The purple paper, which comes on loaf sugar, boiled in
    cider, or vinegar, with a small bit of alum, makes a fine
    purple slate color. Done in iron.</p>

    <p>White maple bark makes a good light-brown slate color. This
    should be boiled in water, set with alum. The color is reckoned
    better when boiled in brass, instead of iron.</p>

    <p>The purple slate and the brown slate are suitable colors for
    stockings; and it is an economical plan, after they have been
    mended and cut down, so that they will no longer look decent,
    to color old stockings, and make them up for children.</p>

    <p>A pailful of lye, with a piece of copperas half as big as a
    hen's egg boiled in it, will color a fine nankin color, which
    will never wash out. This is very useful for the linings of
    bed-quilts, comforters, &amp;c. Old faded gowns, colored in
    this way, may be made into good petticoats. Cheap cotton cloth
    may be colored to advantage for petticoats, and pelisses for
    little girls.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>{40}</span>

    <p>A very beautiful nankin color may likewise be obtained from
    birch-bark, set with alum. The bark should be covered with
    water, and boiled thoroughly in brass or tin. A bit of alum
    half as big as a hen's egg is sufficient. If copperas be used
    instead of alum, slate color will be produced.</p>

    <p>Tea-grounds boiled in iron, and set with copperas, make a
    very good slate color.</p>

    <p>Log-wood and cider, in iron, set with copperas, makes a good
    black. Rusty nails, or any rusty iron, boiled in vinegar, with
    a small bit of copperas, makes a good black,&mdash;black
    ink-powder done in the same way answers the same purpose.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>MEAT CORNED, OR SALTED, HAMS, &amp;c.</h2>

    <p>When you merely want to corn meat, you have nothing to do
    but to rub in salt plentifully, and let it set in the cellar a
    day or two. If you have provided more meat than you can use
    while it is good, it is well to corn it in season to save it.
    In summer, it will not keep well more than a day and a half; if
    you are compelled to keep it longer, be sure and rub in more
    salt, and keep it carefully covered from cellar-flies. In
    winter, there is no difficulty in keeping a piece of corned
    beef a fortnight or more. Some people corn meat by throwing it
    into their beef barrel for a few days; but this method does not
    make it so sweet. A little salt-petre rubbed in before you
    apply the common salt, makes the meat tender; but in summer it
    is not well to use it, because it prevents the other salt from
    impregnating; and the meat does not keep as well.</p>

    <p>If you wish to salt fat pork, scald coarse salt in water and
    skim it, till the salt will no longer melt in the water. Pack
    your pork down in tight layers; salt every layer; when the
    brine is cool, cover the pork with it, and keep a heavy stone
    on the top to keep the pork under brine. Look to it once in a
    while, for the first few weeks, and if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>{41}</span> the salt has all melted, throw
       in more. This brine, scalded and skimmed every time it is
       used, will continue good twenty years. The rind of the pork
       should be packed towards the edge of the barrel.</p>

    <p>It is good economy to salt your own beef as well as pork.
    Six pounds of coarse salt, eight ounces of brown sugar, a pint
    of molasses, and eight ounces of salt-petre, are enough to boil
    in four gallons of water. Skim it clean while boiling. Put it
    to the beef cold; have enough to cover it; and be careful your
    beef never floats on the top. If it does not smell perfectly
    sweet, throw in more salt; if a scum rises upon it, scald and
    skim it again, and pour it on the beef when cold.</p>

    <p>Legs of mutton are very good, cured in the same way as ham.
    Six pounds of salt, eight ounces of salt-petre, and five pints
    of molasses, will make pickle enough for one hundred weight.
    Small legs should be kept in pickle twelve or fifteen days; if
    large, four or five weeks are not too much. They should be hung
    up a day or two to dry, before they are smoked. Lay them in the
    oven, on crossed sticks, and make a fire at the entrance. Cobs,
    walnut-bark, or walnut-chips, are the best to use for smoking,
    on account of the sweet taste they give the meat. The smallest
    pieces should be smoked forty-eight hours, and large legs four
    or five days. Some people prefer the mutton boiled as soon as
    it is taken from the pickle, before it is smoked; others hang
    it up till it gets dry thoroughly, and eat it in thin slices,
    like hung beef. When legs of meat are put in pickle, the
    thickest part of the leg should be placed uppermost, that is,
    standing upright, the same as the creature stood when living.
    The same rule should be observed when they are hung up to dry;
    it is essential in order to keep in the juices of the meat.
    Meat should be turned over once or twice during the process of
    smoking.</p>

    <p>The old-fashioned way for curing hams is to rub them with
    salt very thoroughly, and let them lay twenty-four hours. To
    each ham allow two ounces of salt-petre, one quart of common
    salt and one quart of molasses. First baste them with molasses;
    next rub in the salt-petre; and,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>{42}</span> last of all, the common salt.
       They must be carefully turned and rubbed every day for six
       weeks; then hang them in a chimney, or smoke-house, four
       weeks.</p>

    <p>They should be well covered up in paper bags, and put in a
    chest, or barrel, with layers of ashes, or charcoal, between.
    When you take out a ham to cut for use, be sure and put it away
    in a dark place, well covered up; especially in summer.</p>

    <p>Some very experienced epicures and cooks, think the
    old-fashioned way of preparing bacon is troublesome and
    useless. They say that legs of pork placed upright in pickle,
    for four or five weeks, are just as nice as those rubbed with
    so much care. The pickle for pork and hung beef, should be
    stronger than for legs of mutton. Eight pounds of salt, ten
    ounces of salt-petre and five pints of molasses is enough for
    one hundred weight of meat; water enough to cover the meat
    well&mdash;probably, four or five gallons. Any one can prepare
    bacon, or dried beef, very easily, in a common oven, according
    to the above directions. The same pickle that answers for bacon
    is proper for neat's tongues. Pigs' tongues are very nice,
    prepared in the same way as neat's tongues; an abundance of
    them are sold for rein-deer's tongues, and, under that name,
    considered a wonderful luxury.</p>

    <p>Neat's tongue should be boiled full three hours. If it has
    been in salt long, it is well to soak it over night in cold
    water. Put it in to boil when the water is cold. If you boil it
    in a small pot, it is well to change the water, when it has
    boiled an hour and a half; the fresh water should boil before
    the half-cooked tongue is put in again. It is nicer for being
    kept in a cool place a day or two after being boiled. Nearly
    the same rules apply to salt beef. A six pound piece of corned
    beef should boil full three hours; and salt beef should be
    boiled four hours.</p>

    <p>The saltier meat is, the longer it should be boiled. If very
    salt, it is well to put it in soak over night; change the water
    while cooking; and observe the same rules as in boiling tongue.
    If it is intended to be eaten when cold, it is a good plan to
    put it between clean boards, and press it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>{43}</span> down with heavy weights for a
       day or two. A small leg of bacon should be boiled three
       hours; ten pounds four hours; twelve pounds five hours. All
       meat should boil moderately; furious boiling injures the
       flavor.</p>

    <p>Buffalo's tongue should soak a day and a night, and boil as
    much as six hours.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CHOICE OF MEAT.</h2>

    <p>If people wish to be economical, they should take some pains
    to ascertain what are the cheapest pieces of meat to buy; not
    merely those which are cheapest in price, but those which go
    farthest when cooked. That part of mutton called the rack,
    which consists of the neck, and a few of the rib bones below,
    is cheap food. It is not more than four or five cents a pound;
    and four pounds will make a dinner for six people. The neck,
    cut into pieces, and boiled slowly an hour and a quarter, in
    little more than water enough to cover it, makes very nice
    broth. A great spoonful of rice should be washed and thrown in
    with the meat. About twenty minutes before it is done, put in a
    little thickening, and season with salt, pepper, and sifted
    summer-savory, or sage. The bones below the neck, broiled, make
    a good mutton chop. If your family be small, a rack of mutton
    will make you two dinners,&mdash;broth once, and mutton chop
    with a few slices of salt pork, for another; if your family
    consist of six or seven, you can have two dishes for a dinner.
    If you boil the whole rack for broth, there will be some left
    for mince meat.</p>

    <p>Liver is usually much despised; but when well cooked, it is
    very palatable; and it is the cheapest of all animal food. Veal
    liver is by some considered the best. Veal liver is usually two
    cents a pound; beef liver is one cent. After you have fried a
    few slices of salt pork, put the liver in while the fat is very
    hot, and cook it through thoroughly.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>{44}</span> If you doubt whether it be done,
       cut into a slice, and see whether it has turned entirely
       brown, without any red stripe in the middle. Season it with
       pepper and salt, and butter, if you live on a farm, and have
       butter in plenty. It should not be cooked on furiously hot
       coals, as it is very apt to scorch. Sprinkle in a little
       flour, stir it, and pour in boiling water to make gravy,
       just as you would for fried meat. Some think liver is better
       dipped in sifted Indian meal before it is fried. It is good
       broiled and buttered like a steak. It should be cut into
       slices about as thick as are cut for steaks.</p>

    <p>The heart, liver, &amp;c. of a pig is good fried; so is that
    of a lamb. The latter is commonly called lamb-fry; and a dinner
    may be bought for six or eight cents. Be sure and ask for the
    sweet-bread; for butchers are extremely apt to reserve it for
    their own use; and therefore lamb-fry is almost always sold
    without it. Fry five or six slices of salt pork; after it is
    taken out, put in your lamb-fry while the fat is hot. Do it
    thoroughly; but be careful the fire is not too furious, as it
    is apt to scorch. Take a large handful of parsley, see that it
    is washed clean, cut it up pretty fine; then pour a little
    boiling water into the fat in which your dinner has been fried,
    and let the parsley cook in it a minute or two; then take it
    out in a spoon, and lay it over your slices of meat. Some
    people, who like thick gravies, shake in a little flour into
    the spider, before pouring in the boiling water.</p>

    <p>Bones from which roasting pieces have been cut, may be
    bought in the market for ten or twelve cents, from which a very
    rich soup may be made, besides skimming off fat for shortening.
    If the bones left from the rump be bought, they will be found
    full of marrow, and will give more than a pint of good
    shortening, without injuring the richness of the soup. The
    richest piece of beef for a soup is the leg and the shin of
    beef; the leg is on the hind quarter, and the shin is on the
    fore quarter. The leg rand, that is, the thick part of the leg
    above the bony parts, is very nice for mince pies. Some people
    have an objection to these parts of beef, thinking they must be
    stringy; but, if boiled <i>very tender</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>{45}</span> the sinews are not perceived,
       and add, in fact, to the richness of a soup.</p>

    <p>The thick part of a thin flank is the most profitable part
    in the whole ox to buy. It is not so handsome in appearance as
    some other pieces, but it is thick meat, with very little bone,
    and is usually two cents less in the pound than more
    fashionable pieces. It is good for roasting, and particularly
    for corning and salting. The navel end of the brisket is one of
    the best pieces for salting or corning, and is very good for
    roasting.</p>

    <p>The rattle rand is the very best piece for corning, or
    salting.</p>

    <p>A bullock's heart is very profitable to use as a steak.
    Broiled just like beef. There are usually five pounds in a
    heart, and it can be bought for twenty-five cents. Some people
    stuff and roast it.</p>

    <p>The chuck, between the neck and the shoulder, is a very good
    piece for roasting,&mdash;for steaks, or for salting. Indeed,
    it is good for almost anything; and it is cheap, being from
    four to five cents a pound.</p>

    <p>The richest, tenderest, and most delicate piece of beef for
    roasting, or for steak, is the rump and the last cut of the
    sirloin. It is peculiarly appropriate for an invalid, as it is
    lighter food than any other beef.</p>

    <p>But if economy be consulted instead of luxury, the round
    will be bought in preference to the rump. It is heartier food,
    and, of course, less can be eaten; and it is cheaper in
    price.</p>

    <p>The shoulder of veal is the most economical for roasting or
    boiling. It is always cheap, let veal bear what price it may.
    Two dinners may be made from it; the shoulder roasted, and the
    knuckle cut off to be boiled with a bit of pork and greens, or
    to be made into soup.</p>

    <p>The breast of veal is a favorite piece, and is sold
    high.</p>

    <p>The hind-quarter of veal and the loin make two good roasting
    pieces. The leg is usually stuffed. The line has the kidney
    upon it; the fore-quarter has the brisket on it. This is a
    sweet and delicate morsel; for this reason some people prefer
    the fore-quarter to any other
    part.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>{46}</span>

    <p>Always buy a shoulder of pork for economy, for roasting, or
    coming to boil. Cut off the leg to be boiled. Many people buy
    the upper part of the spare-rib of pork thinking it the most
    genteel; but the lower part of the spare-rib toward the neck is
    much more sweet and juicy, and there is more meat in proportion
    to the bone.</p>

    <p>The breast, or shoulder, of mutton are both nice, either for
    roasting, boiling or broth. The breast is richer than the
    shoulder. It is more economical to buy a fore-quarter of mutton
    than a hind-quarter; there is usually two cents difference per
    pound. The neck of fat mutton makes a good steak for
    broiling.</p>

    <p>Lamb brings the same price, either fore-quarter or
    hind-quarter; therefore it is more profitable to buy a
    hind-quarter than a fore-quarter; especially as its own fat
    will cook it, and there is no need of pork or butter in
    addition. Either part is good for roasting or boiling. The loin
    of lamb is suitable for roasting, and is the most profitable
    for a small family. The leg is more suitable for boiling than
    for anything else; the shoulder and breast are peculiarly
    suitable for broth.</p>

    <p>The part that in lamb is called the loin, in mutton is
    called the chop. Mutton chop is considered very good for
    broiling.</p>

    <p>Pig's head is a profitable thing to buy. It is despised,
    because it is cheap; but when well cooked it is delicious. Well
    cleaned, the tip of the snout chopped off, and put in brine a
    week, it is very good for boiling: the cheeks, in particular,
    are very sweet; they are better than any other pieces of pork
    to bake with beans. The head is likewise very good baked about
    an hour and a half. It tastes like roast pork, and yields
    abundance of sweet fat, for shortening.</p>

    <h2>COMMON COOKING.</h2>

    <p>It is necessary to be very careful of fresh meat in the
    summer season. The moment it is brought into the house, it
    should be carefully covered from the flies, and put in the
    coldest place in the cellar. If it consist of pieces, they
    should be spread out separate from each other, on a large dish,
    and covered. If you are not to cook it soon, it is well to
    sprinkle salt on it. The kidney, and fat flabby parts, should
    be raised up above the lean, by a skewer, or stick, and a
    little salt strewn in. If you have to keep it over night, it
    should be looked to the last thing when you go to bed; and if
    there is danger, it should be scalded.</p>

    <h4>VEAL.</h4>

    <p>Veal should boil about an hour, if a neck-piece; if the meat
    comes from a thicker, more solid part, it should boil longer.
    No directions about these things will supply the place of
    judgment and experience. Both mutton and veal are better for
    being boiled with a small piece of salt pork. Veal broth is
    very good.</p>

    <p>Veal soup should be slowly stewed for two hours. Seasoned
    the same as above. Some people like a little sifted
    summer-savory.</p>

    <p>Six or seven pounds of veal will roast in an hour and a
    half.</p>

    <p>Fried veal is better for being dipped in white of egg, and
    rolled in nicely pounded crumbs of bread, before it is cooked.
    One egg is enough for a common dinner.</p>

    <h4>CALF'S HEAD.</h4>

    <p>Calf's head should be cleansed with very great care;
    particularly the lights. The head, the heart, and the lights
    should boil full two hours; the liver should be boiled only one
    hour. It is better to leave the wind-pipe on, for if it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>{48}</span> hangs out of the pot while the
       head is cooking, all the froth will escape through it. The
       brains, after being thoroughly washed, should be put in a
       little bag; with one pounded cracker, or as much crumbled
       bread, seasoned with sifted sage, and tied up and boiled one
       hour. After the brains are boiled, they should be well
       broken up with a knife, and peppered, salted, and buttered.
       They should be put upon the table in a bowl by themselves.
       Boiling water, thickened with flour and water, with butter
       melted in it, is the proper sauce; some people love vinegar
       and pepper mixed with the melted butter; but all are not
       fond of it; and it is easy for each one to add it for
       themselves.</p>

    <h4>BEEF.</h4>

    <p>Beef soup should be stewed four hours over a slow fire. Just
    water enough to keep the meat covered. If you have any bones
    left of roast meat, &amp;c. it is a good plan to boil them with
    the meat, and take them out half an hour before the soup is
    done. A pint of flour and water, with salt, pepper, twelve or
    sixteen onions, should be put in twenty minutes before the soup
    is done. Be careful and not throw in salt and pepper too
    plentifully; it is easy to add to it, and not easy to diminish.
    A lemon, cut up and put in half an hour before it is done, adds
    to the flavor. If you have tomato catsup in the house, a cupful
    will make soup rich. Some people put in crackers; some thin
    slices of crust, made nearly as short as common shortcake; and
    some stir up two or three eggs with milk and flour, and drop it
    in with a spoon.</p>

    <p>A quarter of an hour to each pound of beef is considered a
    good rule for roasting; but this is too much when the bone is
    large, and the meal thin. Six pounds of the rump should roast
    six quarters of an hour; but bony pieces less. It should be
    done before a quick fire.</p>

    <p>The quicker beef-steak can be broiled the better. Seasoned
    after it is taken from the
    gridiron.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>{49}</span>

    <h4>ALAMODE BEEF.</h4>

    <p>Tie up a round of beef so as to keep it in shape; make a
    stuffing of grated bread, suet, sweet herbs, quarter of an
    ounce of nutmeg, a few cloves pounded, yolk of an egg. Cut
    holes in the beef, and put in the stuffing, leaving about half
    the stuffing to be made into balls. Tie the beef up in a cloth,
    just cover it with water, let it boil an hour and a half; then
    turn it, and let it boil an hour and a half more; then turn out
    the liquor, and put some skewers across the bottom of the pot,
    and lay the beef upon it, to brown; turn it that it may brown
    on both sides. Put a pint of claret, and some allspice and
    cloves, into the liquor, and boil some balls made of the
    stuffing in it.</p>

    <h4>MUTTON AND LAMB.</h4>

    <p>Six or seven pounds of mutton will roast in an hour and a
    half. Lamb one hour. Mutton is apt to taste strong; this may be
    helped by soaking the meat in a little salt and water, for an
    hour before cooking. However, unless meat is very sweet, it is
    best to corn it, and boil it.</p>

    <p>Fresh meat should never be put in to cook till the water
    boils; and it should be boiled in as little water as possible;
    otherwise the flavor is injured. Mutton enough for a family of
    five or six should boil an hour and a half. A leg of lamb
    should boil an hour, or little more than an hour, perhaps. Put
    a little thickening into boiling water; strain it nicely; and
    put sweet butter in it for sauce. If your family like broth,
    throw in some clear rice when you put in the meat. The rice
    should be in proportion to the quantity of broth you mean to
    make. A large table spoonful is enough for three pints of
    water. Seasoned with a very little pepper and salt.
    Summer-savory, or sage, rubbed through a sieve, thrown in.</p>

    <h4>PORK.</h4>

    <p>Fresh pork should be cooked more than any other meat. A
    thick shoulder piece should be roasted full two hours
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>{50}</span> and a half; and other pieces
       less in proportion. The slight sickness occasioned by eating
       roasted pork may be prevented by soaking it in salt and
       water the night before you cook it. If called to prepare it
       on short notice, it will answer to baste it with weak brine
       while roasting; and then turn the brine off, and throw it
       away.</p>

    <h4>ROAST PIG.</h4>

    <p>Strew fine salt over it an hour before it is put down. It
    should not be cut entirely open; fill it up plump with thick
    slices of buttered bread, salt, sweet-marjoram and sage. Spit
    it with the head next the point of the spit; take off the
    joints of the leg, and boil them with the liver, with a little
    whole pepper, allspice, and salt, for gravy sauce. The upper
    part of the legs must be braced down with skewers. Shake on
    flour. Put a little water in the dripping-pan, and stir it
    often. When the eyes drop out, the pig is half done. When it is
    nearly done, baste it with butter. Cut off the head, split it
    open between the eyes. Take out the brains, and chop them fine
    with the liver and some sweet-marjoram and sage; put this into
    melted butter, and when it has boiled a few minutes, add it to
    the gravy in the dripping-pan. When your pig is cut open, lay
    it with the back to the edge of the dish; half a head to be
    placed at each end. A good sized pig needs to be roasted three
    hours.</p>

    <h4>SAUSAGES.</h4>

    <p>Three tea-spoons of powdered sage, one and a half of salt,
    and one of pepper, to a pound of meat, is good seasoning for
    sausages.</p>

    <h4>MINCE MEAT.</h4>

    <p>There is a great difference in preparing mince meat. Some
    make it a coarse, unsavory dish; and others make it nice and
    palatable. No economical house-keeper will despise it; for
    broken bits of meat and vegetables cannot
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>{51}</span> so well be disposed of in any
       other way. If you wish to have it nice, mash your vegetables
       fine, and chop your meat very fine. Warm it with what
       remains of sweet gravy, or roast-meat drippings, you may
       happen to have. Two or three apples, pared, cored, sliced,
       and fried, to mix with it, is an improvement. Some like a
       little sifted sage sprinkled in.</p>

    <p>It is generally considered nicer to chop your meat fine,
    warm it in gravy, season it, and lay it upon a large slice of
    toasted bread to be brought upon the table without being mixed
    with potatoes; but if you have cold vegetables, use them.</p>

    <h4>BEANS AND PEAS.</h4>

    <p>Baked beans are a very simple dish, yet few cook them well.
    They should be put in cold water, and hung over the fire, the
    night before they are baked. In the morning, they should be put
    in a colander, and rinsed two or three times; then again placed
    in a kettle, with the pork you intend to bake, covered with
    water, and kept scalding hot, an hour or more. A pound of pork
    is quite enough for a quart of beans, and that is a large
    dinner for a common family. The rind of the pork should be
    slashed. Pieces of pork alternately fat and lean, are the most
    suitable; the cheeks are the best. A little pepper sprinkled
    among the beans, when they are placed in the bean-pot, will
    render them less unhealthy. They should be just covered with
    water, when put into the oven; and the pork should be sunk a
    little below the surface of the beans. Bake three or four
    hours.</p>

    <p>Stewed beans are prepared in the same way. The only
    difference is, they are not taken out of the scalding water,
    but are allowed to stew in more water, with a piece of pork and
    a little pepper, three hours or more.</p>

    <p>Dried peas need not be soaked over night. They should be
    stewed slowly four or five hours in considerable water, with a
    piece of pork. The older beans and peas are, the longer they
    should cook. Indeed, this is the case with all
    vegetables.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>{52}</span>

    <h4>SOUSE.</h4>

    <p>Pigs' feet, ears, &amp;c., should be cleaned after being
    soaked in water not very hot; the hoofs will then come off
    easily with a sharp knife; the hard, rough places should be cut
    off; they should be thoroughly singed, and then boiled as much
    as four or five hours, until they are too tender to be taken
    out with a fork. When taken from the boiling water, it should
    be put into cold water. After it is packed down tight, boil the
    jelly-like liquor in which it was cooked with an equal quantity
    of vinegar; salt as you think fit, and cloves, allspice, and
    cinnamon, at the rate of a quarter of a pound to one hundred
    weight: to be poured on scalding hot.</p>

    <h4>TRIPE.</h4>

    <p>Tripe should be kept in cold water, or it will become too
    dry for cooking. The water in which it is kept should be
    changed more or less frequently, according to the warmth of the
    weather. Broiled like a steak, buttered, peppered, &amp;c. Some
    people like it prepared like souse.</p>

    <h4>GRAVY.</h4>

    <p>Most people put a half a pint of flour and water into their
    tin-kitchen, when they set meat down to roast. This does very
    well; but gravy is better flavored, and looks darker, to shake
    flour and salt upon the meat; let it brown thoroughly, put
    flour and salt on again, and then baste the meat with about
    half a pint of hot water (or more, according to the gravy you
    want.) When the meat is about done, pour these drippings into a
    skillet, and let it boil. If it is not thick enough, shake in a
    little flour; but be sure to let it boil, and be well stirred,
    after the flour is in. If you fear it will be too greasy, take
    off a cupful of the fat before you boil. The fat of beef, pork,
    turkeys and geese is as good for shortening as lard. Salt gravy
    to your taste. If you are very particular about dark gravies,
    keep your dredging-box full of scorched flour for that
    purpose.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>{53}</span>

    <h4>POULTRY.</h4>

    <p>There are various ways of deciding about the age of
    poultry.</p>

    <p>If the bottom of the breast bone, which extends down between
    the legs, is soft, and gives easily, it is a sign of youth; if
    stiff, the poultry is old.</p>

    <p>If young, the legs are lighter, and the feet do not look so
    hard, stiff, and worn.</p>

    <p>There is more deception in geese than in any other kind of
    poultry. The above remarks are applied to them; but there are
    other signs more infallible. In a young goose, the cavity under
    the wings is very tender; it is a bad sign if you cannot, with
    very little trouble, push your finger directly into the flesh.
    There is another means by which you may decide whether a goose
    be tender, if it be frozen or not. Pass the head of a pin along
    the breast, or sides, and if the goose be young, the skin will
    rip, like fine paper under a knife.</p>

    <p>Something may be judged concerning the age of a goose by the
    thickness of the web between the toes. When young, this is
    tender and transparent; it grows coarser and harder with
    time.</p>

    <p>In broiling chickens, it is difficult to do the inside of
    the thickest pieces without scorching the outside. It is a good
    plan to parboil them about ten minutes in a spider or skillet,
    covered close to keep the steam in; then put them upon the
    gridiron, broil and butter. It is a good plan to cover them
    with a plate, while on the gridiron. They may be basted with a
    very little of the water in which they were broiled; and if you
    have company who like melted butter to pour upon the chicken,
    the remainder of the liquor will be good use for that
    purpose.</p>

    <p>An hour is enough for common sized chickens to roast. A
    smart fire is better than a slow one; but they must be tended
    closely. Slices of bread, buttered, salted, and peppered, put
    into the stomach (not the crop) are excellent.</p>

    <p>Chickens should boil about an hour. If old, they should
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>{54}</span> boil longer. In as little water
       as will cook them. Chicken-broth made like mutton-broth.</p>

    <h4>FRICASSEED CHICKEN, BROWN.</h4>

    <p>Singe the chickens; cut them in pieces; pepper, salt, and
    flour them; fry them in fresh butter, till they are very brown:
    take the chickens out, and make a good gravy, into which put
    sweet herbs (marjoram or sage) according to your taste; if
    necessary, add pepper and salt; butter and flour must be used
    in making the gravy, in such quantities as to suit yourself for
    thickness and richness. After this is all prepared, the chicken
    must be stewed in it, for half an hour, closely covered. A pint
    of gravy is about enough for two chickens; I should think a
    piece of butter about as big as a walnut, and a table-spoonful
    of flour, would be enough for the gravy. The herbs should, of
    course, be pounded and sifted. Some, who love onions, slice two
    or three, and brown them with the chicken. Some slice a half
    lemon, and stew with the chicken. Some add tomatoes catsup.</p>

    <h4>FRICASSEED CHICKEN, WHITE.</h4>

    <p>The chickens are cut to pieces, and covered with warm water,
    to draw out the blood. Then put into a stew-pan, with three
    quarters of a pint of water, or veal broth, salt, pepper,
    flour, butter, mace, sweet herbs pounded and sifted; boil it
    half an hour. If it is too fat, skim it a little. Just before
    it is done, mix the yolk of two eggs with a gill of cream,
    grate in a little nutmeg, stir it up till it is thick and
    smooth, squeeze in half a lemon. If you like onions, stew some
    slices with the other ingredients.</p>

    <h4>TO CURRY FOWL.</h4>

    <p>Fry out two or three slices of salt pork; cut the chicken in
    pieces, and lay it in the stew-pan with one sliced onion; when
    the fowl is tender, take it out, and put in thickening into the
    liquor, one spoonful of flour, and one spoonful of
    curry-powder, well stirred up in water. Then
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>{55}</span> lay the chicken in again, and
       let it boil up a few minutes. A half a pint of liquor is
       enough for one chicken. About half an hour's stewing is
       necessary. The juice of half a lemon improves it; and some
       like a spoonful of tomatoes catsup.</p>

    <h4>CHICKEN BROTH.</h4>

    <p>Cut a chicken in quarters; put it into three or four quarts
    of water; put in a cup of rice while the water is cold; season
    it with pepper and salt; some use nutmeg. Let it stew gently,
    until the chicken falls apart. A little parsley, shred fine, is
    an improvement. Some slice up a small onion and stew with it. A
    few pieces of cracker may be thrown in if you like.</p>

    <p>A common sized goose should roast full three quarters of an
    hour. The oil that drips from it should be nearly all turned
    off; it makes the gravy too greasy; and it is nice for
    shortening. It should first be turned into cold water; when
    hardened, it should be taken off and scalded in a skillet. This
    process leaves it as sweet as lard.</p>

    <p>Ducks do not need to be roasted more than fifteen or twenty
    minutes. Butter melted in boiling flour and water is proper
    sauce for boiled lamb, mutton, veal, turkeys, geese, chickens,
    and fish. Some people cut up parsley fine, and throw in. Some
    people like capers put in. Others heat oysters through on the
    gridiron, and take them out of the shells, and throw them into
    the butter.</p>

    <p>A good sized turkey should be roasted two hours and a half,
    or three hours; very slowly at first. If you wish to make plain
    stuffing, pound a cracker, or crumble some bread very fine,
    chop some raw salt pork very fine, sift some sage, (and
    summer-savory, or sweet-marjoram, if you have them in the
    house, and fancy them,) and mould them all together, seasoned
    with a little pepper. An egg worked in makes the stuffing cut
    better; but it is not worth while when eggs are dear. About the
    same length of time is required for boiling and
    roasting.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>{56}</span>

    <p>Pigeons may be either roasted, potted or stewed. Potting is
    the best, and the least trouble. After they are thoroughly
    picked and cleaned, put a small slice of salt pork, and a
    little ball of stuffing, into the body of every pigeon. The
    stuffing should be made of one egg to one cracker, an equal
    quantity of suet, or butter, seasoned with sweet-marjoram, or
    sage, if marjoram cannot be procured. Flour the pigeons well,
    lay them close together in the bottom of the pot, just cover
    them with water, throw in a bit of butter, and let them stew an
    hour and a quarter if young; an hour and three quarters if old.
    Some people turn off the liquor just before they are done, and
    brown the pigeons on the bottom of the pot; but this is very
    troublesome, as they are apt to break to pieces.</p>

    <p>Stewed pigeons are cooked in nearly the same way, with the
    omission of the stuffing. Being dry meat, they require a good
    deal of butter.</p>

    <p>Pigeons should be stuffed and roasted about fifteen minutes
    before a smart fire. Those who like birds just warmed through,
    would perhaps think less time necessary. It makes them nicer to
    butter them well just before you take them off the spit, and
    sprinkle them with nicely pounded bread, or cracker. All
    poultry should be basted and floured a few minutes before it is
    taken up.</p>

    <p>The age of pigeons can be judged by the color of the legs.
    When young, they are of a pale delicate brown; as they grow
    older, the color is deeper and redder.</p>

    <p>A nice way of serving up cold chicken, or pieces of cold
    fresh meat, is to make them into a meat pie. The gizzards,
    livers, and necks of poultry, parboiled, are good for the same
    purpose. If you wish to bake your meat pie, line a deep earthen
    or tin pan with paste made of flour, cold water, and lard; use
    but little lard, for the fat of the meat will shorten the
    crust. Lay in your bits of meat, or chicken, with two or three
    slices of salt pork; place a few thin slices of your paste here
    and there; drop in an egg or two, if you have plenty. Fill the
    pan with flour and water, seasoned with a little pepper and
    salt. If the meat be very lean, put in a piece of butter, or
    such sweet gravies as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>{57}</span> you may happen to have. Cover
       the top with crust, and put it in the oven, or bake-kettle,
       to cook half an hour, or an hour, according to the size of
       the pie. Some people think this the nicest way of cooking
       fresh chickens. When thus cooked, they should be parboiled
       before they are put into the pan, and the water they are
       boiled in should be added. A chicken pie needs to be cooked
       an hour and a half, if parboiled; two hours, if not.</p>

    <p>If you wish to make a pot pie instead of a baked pie, you
    have only to line the bottom of a porridge pot with paste, lay
    in your meat, season and moisten it in the same way, cover it
    with paste, and keep it slowly stewing about the same time that
    the other takes. In both cases, it is well to lift the upper
    crust, a little while before you take up the pie, and see
    whether the moisture has dried away; if so, pour in flour and
    water well mixed, and let it boil up.</p>

    <p>Potatoes should be boiled in a separate vessel.</p>

    <p>If you have fear that poultry may become musty before you
    want to cook it, skin an onion, and put in it; a little pepper
    sprinkled in is good; it should be kept hung up in a dry, cool
    place.</p>

    <p>If poultry is injured before you are aware of it, wash it
    very thoroughly in pearlash and water, and sprinkle pepper
    inside when you cook it. Some people hang up poultry with a
    muslin bag of charcoal inside. It is a good plan to singe
    injured poultry over lighted charcoal, and to hold a piece of
    lighted charcoal inside, a few minutes.</p>

    <p>Many people parboil the liver and gizzard, and cut it up
    very fine, to be put into the gravy, while the fowls are
    cooking; in this case, the water they are boiled in should be
    used to make the gravy.</p>

    <h4>FISH.</h4>

    <p>Cod has white stripes, and a haddock black stripes; they may
    be known apart by this. Haddock is the best for frying; and cod
    is the best for boiling, or for a chowder. A thin tail is a
    sign of a poor fish; always choose a thick fish.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>{58}</span> When you are buying mackerel,
       pinch the belly to ascertain whether it is good. If it gives
       under your finger, like a bladder half filled with wind, the
       fish is poor; if it feels hard like butter, the fish is
       good. It is cheaper to buy one large mackerel for ninepence,
       than two for four pence half-penny each.</p>

    <p>Fish should not be put in to fry until the fat is boiling
    hot; it is very necessary to observe this. It should be dipped
    in Indian meal before it is put in; and the skinny side
    uppermost, when first put in, to prevent its breaking. It
    relishes better to be fried after salt pork, than to be fried
    in lard alone. People are mistaken, who think fresh fish should
    be put into cold water as soon as it is brought into the house;
    soaking it in water is injurious. If you want to keep it sweet,
    clean it, wash it, wipe it dry with a clean towel, sprinkle
    salt inside and out, put it in a covered dish, and keep it on
    the <i>cellar</i> floor until you want to cook it. If you live
    remote from the seaport, and cannot get fish while hard and
    fresh, wet it with an egg beaten, before you meal it, to
    prevent its breaking.</p>

    <p>Fish gravy is very much improved by taking out some of the
    fat, after the fish is fried, and putting in a little butter.
    The fat thus taken out will do to fry fish again; but it will
    not do for any kind of shortening. Shake in a little flour into
    the hot fat, and pour in a little boiling water; stir it up
    well, as it boils, a minute or so. Some people put in vinegar;
    but this is easily added by those who like it.</p>

    <p>A common sized cod-fish should be put in when the water is
    boiling hot, and boil about twenty minutes. Haddock is not as
    good for boiling as cod; it takes about the same time to
    boil.</p>

    <p>A piece of halibut which weighs four pounds is a large
    dinner for a family of six or seven. It should boil forty
    minutes. No fish put in till the water boils. Melted butter for
    sauce.</p>

    <p>Clams should boil about fifteen minutes in their own water;
    no other need be added, except a spoonful to keep the bottom
    shells from burning. It is easy to tell when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>{59}</span> they are done, by the shells
       starting wide open. After they are done, they should be
       taken from the shells, washed thoroughly in their own water,
       and put in a stewing pan. The water should then be strained
       through a cloth, so as to get out all the grit; the clams
       should be simmered in it ten or fifteen minutes; a little
       thickening of flour and water added; half a dozen slices of
       toasted bread or cracker; and pepper, vinegar and butter to
       your taste. Salt is not needed.</p>

    <p>Four pounds of fish are enough to make a chowder for four or
    five people; half a dozen slices of salt pork in the bottom of
    the pot; hang it high, so that the pork may not burn; take it
    out when done very brown; put in a layer of fish, cut in
    lengthwise slices, then a layer formed of crackers, small or
    sliced onions, and potatoes sliced as thin as a four-pence,
    mixed with pieces of pork you have fried; then a layer of fish
    again, and so on. Six crackers are enough. Strew a little salt
    and pepper over each layer; over the whole pour a bowl-full of
    flour and water, enough to come up even with the surface of
    what you have in the pot. A sliced lemon adds to the flavor. A
    cup of tomato catsup is very excellent. Some people put in a
    cup of beer. A few clams are a pleasant addition. It should be
    covered so as not to let a particle of steam escape, if
    possible. Do not open it, except when nearly done, to taste if
    it be well seasoned.</p>

    <p>Salt fish should be put in a deep plate, with just water
    enough to cover it, the night before you intend to cook it. It
    should not be boiled an instant; boiling renders it hard. It
    should lie in scalding hot water two or three hours. The less
    water is used, and the more fish is cooked at once, the better.
    Water thickened with flour and water while boiling, with sweet
    butter put in to melt, is the common sauce. It is more
    economical to cut salt pork into small bits, and try it till
    the pork is brown and crispy. It should not be done too fast,
    lest the sweetness be scorched out.</p>

    <p>Salted shad and mackerel should be put into a deep plate and
    covered with boiling water for about ten minutes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>{60}</span> after it is thoroughly broiled,
       before it is buttered. This makes it tender, takes off the
       coat of salt, and prevents the strong oily taste, so apt to
       be unpleasant in preserved fish. The same rule applies to
       smoked salmon.</p>

    <p>Salt fish mashed with potatoes, with good butter or pork
    scraps to moisten it, is nicer the second day than it was the
    first. The fish should be minced very fine, while it is warm.
    After it has got cold and dry, it is difficult to do it nicely.
    Salt fish needs plenty of vegetables, such as onions, beets,
    carrots, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>There is no way of preparing salt fish for breakfast, so
    nice as to roll it up in little balls, after it is mixed with
    mashed potatoes; dip it into an egg, and fry it brown.</p>

    <p>A female lobster is not considered so good as a male. In the
    female, the sides of the head, or what look like cheeks, are
    much larger, and jut out more than those of the male. The end
    of a lobster is surrounded with what children call 'purses,'
    edged with a little fringe. If you put your hand under these to
    raise it, and find it springs back hard and firm, it is a sign
    the lobster is fresh; if they move flabbily, it is not a good
    omen.</p>

    <p>Fried salt pork and apples is a favorite dish in the
    country; but it is seldom seen in the city. After the pork is
    fried, some of the fat should be taken out, lest the apples
    should be oily. Acid apples should be chosen, because they cook
    more easily; they should be cut in slices, across the whole
    apple, about twice or three times as thick as a new dollar.
    Fried till tender, and brown on both sides&mdash;laid around
    the pork. If you have cold potatoes, slice them and brown them
    in the same way.</p>

    <h2>PUDDINGS.</h2>

    <h4>BAKED INDIAN PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>Indian pudding is good baked. Scald a quart of milk (skimmed
    milk will do,) and stir in seven table spoonfuls of sifted
    Indian meal, a tea-spoonful of salt, a tea-cupful of molasses,
    and a great spoonful of ginger, or sifted cinnamon. Baked three
    or four hours. If you want whey, you must be sure and pour in a
    little cold milk, after it is all mixed.</p>

    <h4>BOILED INDIAN PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>Indian pudding should be boiled four or five hours. Sifted
    Indian meal and warm milk should be stirred together pretty
    stiff. A little salt, and two or three great spoonfuls of
    molasses, added; a spoonful of ginger, if you like that spice.
    Boil it in a tight covered pan, or a very thick cloth; if the
    water gets in, it will ruin it. Leave plenty of room; for
    Indian swells very much. The milk with which you mix it should
    be merely warm; if it be scalding, the pudding will break to
    pieces. Some people chop sweet suet fine, and warm in the milk;
    others warm thin slices of sweet apple to be stirred into the
    pudding. Water will answer instead of milk.</p>

    <h4>FLOUR OR BATTER PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>Common flour pudding, or batter pudding, is easily made.
    Those who live in the country can beat up five or six eggs with
    a quart of milk, and a little salt, with flour enough to make
    it just thick enough to pour without difficulty. Those who live
    in the city, and are obliged to buy eggs, can do with three
    eggs to a quart, and more flour in proportion. Boil about three
    quarters of an hour.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>{62}</span>

    <h4>BREAD PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>A nice pudding may be made of bits of bread. They should be
    crumbled and soaked in milk over night. In the morning, beat up
    three eggs with it, add a little salt, tie it up in a bag, or
    in a pan that will exclude every drop of water, and boil it
    little more than an hour. No puddings should be put into the
    pot, till the water boils. Bread prepared in the same way makes
    good plum-puddings. Milk enough to make it quite soft; four
    eggs; a little cinnamon; a spoonful of rose-water, or
    lemon-brandy, if you have it; a tea-cupful of molasses, or
    sugar to your taste, if you prefer it; a few dry, clean
    raisins, sprinkled in, and stirred up thoroughly, is all that
    is necessary. It should bake or boil two hours.</p>

    <h4>RENNET PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>If your husband brings home company when you are unprepared,
    rennet pudding may be made at five minutes' notice; provided
    you keep a piece of calf's rennet ready prepared soaking in a
    bottle of wine. One glass of this wine to a quart of milk will
    make a sort of cold custard. Sweetened with white sugar, and
    spiced with nutmeg, it is very good. It should be eaten
    immediately; in a few hours, it begins to curdle.</p>

    <h4>CUSTARD PUDDINGS.</h4>

    <p>Custard puddings sufficiently good for common use can be
    made with five eggs to a quart of milk, sweetened with brown
    sugar, and spiced with cinnamon, or nutmeg, and very little
    salt. It is well to boil your milk, and set it away till it
    gets cold. Boiling milk enriches it so much, that boiled
    skim-milk is about as good as new milk. A little cinnamon, or
    lemon peel, or peach leaves, if you do not dislike the taste,
    boiled in the milk, and afterwards strained from it, give a
    pleasant flavor. Bake fifteen or twenty
    minutes.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>{63}</span>

    <h4>RICE PUDDINGS.</h4>

    <p>If you want a common rice pudding to retain its flavor, do
    not soak it, or put it in to boil when the water is cold. Wash
    it, tie it in a bag, leave plenty of room for it to swell,
    throw it in when the water boils, and let it boil about an hour
    and a half. The same sauce answers for all these kinds of
    puddings. If you have rice left cold, break it up in a little
    warm milk, pour custard over it, and bake it as long as you
    should custard. It makes very good puddings and pies.</p>

    <h4>BIRD'S NEST PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>If you wish to make what is called 'bird's nest puddings,'
    prepare your custard,&mdash;take eight or ten pleasant apples,
    pare them, and dig out the core, but leave them whole, set them
    in a pudding dish, pour your custard over them, and bake them
    about thirty minutes.</p>

    <h4>APPLE PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>A plain, unexpensive apple pudding may be made by rolling
    out a bit of common pie-crust, and filling it full of quartered
    apples; tied up in a bag, and boiled an hour and a half; if the
    apples are sweet, it will take two hours; for acid things cook
    easily. Some people like little dumplings, made by rolling up
    one apple, pared and cored, in a piece of crust, and tying them
    up in spots all over the bag. These do not need to be boiled
    more than an hour: three quarters is enough, if the apples are
    tender.</p>

    <p>Take sweet, or pleasant flavored apples, pare them, and bore
    out the core, without cutting the apple in two Pill up the
    holes with washed rice, boil them in a bag, tied very tight, an
    hour, or hour and a half. Each apple should be tied up
    separately, in different corners of the pudding bag.</p>

    <h4>CHERRY PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>For cherry dumpling, make a paste about as rich as you make
    short-cake; roll it out, and put in a pint and a half,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>{64}</span> or a quart of cherries,
       according to the size of your family. Double the crust over
       the fruit, tie it up tight in a bag, and boil one hour and a
       half.</p>

    <h4>CRANBERRY PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>A pint of cranberries stirred into a quart of batter, made
    like a batter pudding, but very little stiffer, is very nice,
    eaten with sweet sauce.</p>

    <h4>WHORTLEBERRY PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>Whortleberries are good both in flour and Indian puddings. A
    pint of milk, with a little salt and a little molasses, stirred
    quite stiff with Indian meal, and a quart of berries stirred in
    gradually with a spoon, makes a good-sized pudding. Leave room
    for it to swell; and let it boil three hours.</p>

    <p>When you put them into flour, make your pudding just like
    batter puddings; but considerably thicker, or the berries will
    sink. Two hours is plenty long enough to boil No pudding should
    be put in till the water boils. Leave room to swell.</p>

    <h4>PLUM PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>If you wish to make a really nice, soft, custard-like plum
    pudding, pound six crackers, or dried crusts of light bread,
    fine, and soak them over night in milk enough to cover them;
    put them in about three pints of milk, beat up six eggs, put in
    a little lemon-brandy, a whole nutmeg, and about three quarters
    of a pound of raisins which have been rubbed in flour. Bake it
    two hours, or perhaps a little short of that. It is easy to
    judge from the appearance whether it is done.</p>

    <p>The surest way of making a light, rich plum pudding, is to
    spread slices of sweet light bread plentifully with butter; on
    each side of the slices spread abundantly raisins, or currants,
    nicely prepared; when they are all heaped up in a dish, cover
    them with milk, eggs, sugar and spice, well
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>{65}</span> beat up, and prepared just as
       you do for custards. Let it bake about an hour.</p>

    <p>One sauce answers for common use for all sorts of puddings.
    Flour-and-water stirred into boiling water, sweetened to your
    taste with either molasses or sugar, according to your ideas of
    economy; a great spoonful of rose-water, if you have it; butter
    half as big as a hen's egg. If you want to make it very nice,
    put in a glass of wine, and grate nutmeg on the top.</p>

    <p>When you wish better sauce than common, take a quarter of a
    pound of butter and the same of sugar, mould them well together
    with your hand, add a little wine, if you choose. Make it into
    a lump, set it away to cool, and grate nutmeg over it.</p>

    <h4>HASTY PUDDING.</h4>

    <p>Boil water, a quart, three pints, or two quarts, according
    to the size of your family; sift your meal, stir five or six
    spoonfuls of it thoroughly into a bowl of water; when the water
    in the kettle boils, pour into it the contents of the bowl;
    stir it well, and let it boil up thick; put in salt to suit
    your own taste, then stand over the kettle, and sprinkle in
    meal, handful after handful, stirring it very thoroughly all
    the time, and letting it boil between whiles. When it is so
    thick that you stir it with great difficulty, it is about
    right. It takes about half an hour's cooking. Eat it with milk
    or molasses. Either Indian meal or rye meal may be used. If the
    system is in a restricted state, nothing can be better than
    <i>rye</i> hasty pudding and <i>West India</i> molasses. This
    diet would save many a one the horrors of dyspepsia.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CHEAP CUSTARDS.</h2>

    <p>One quart of milk, boiled; when boiling, add three table
    spoonfuls of ground rice, or rice that is boiled, mixed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>{66}</span> smooth and fine in cold milk,
       and one egg beaten; give it one boil up, and sweeten to your
       taste; peach leaves, or any spice you please, boiled in the
       milk.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>COMMON PIES.</h2>

    <h4>MINCE PIES.</h4>

    <p>Boil a tender, nice piece of beef&mdash;any piece that is
    clear from sinews and gristle; boil it till it is perfectly
    tender When it is cold, chop it very fine, and be very careful
    to get out every particle of bone and gristle. The suet is
    sweeter and better to boil half an hour or more in the liquor
    the beef has been boiled in; but few people do this. Pare,
    core, and chop the apples fine. If you use raisins, stone them.
    If you use currants, wash and dry them at the fire. Two pounds
    of beef, after it is chopped; three quarters of a pound of
    suet; one pound and a quarter of sugar; three pounds of apples;
    two pounds of currants, or raisins. Put in a gill of brandy;
    lemon-brandy is better, if you have any prepared. Make it quite
    moist with new cider. I should not think a quart would be too
    much; the more moist the better, if it does not spill out into
    the oven. A very little pepper. If you use corn meat, or
    tongue, for pies, it should be well soaked, and boiled very
    tender. If you use fresh beef, salt is necessary in the
    seasoning. One ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of cloves. Two
    nutmegs add to the pleasantness of the flavor; and a bit of
    sweet butter put upon the top of each pie, makes them rich; but
    these are not necessary. Baked three quarters of an hour. If
    your apples are rather sweet, grate in a whole lemon.</p>

    <h4>PUMPKIN AND SQUASH PIE.</h4>

    <p>For common family pumpkin pies, three eggs do very well to a
    quart of milk. Stew your pumpkin, and strain it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>{67}</span> through a sieve, or colander.
       Take out the seeds, and pare the pumpkin, or squash, before
       you stew it; but do not scrape the inside; the part nearest
       the seed is the sweetest part of the squash. Stir in the
       stewed pumpkin, till it is as thick as you can stir it round
       rapidly and easily. If you want to make your pie richer,
       make it thinner, and add another egg. One egg to a quart of
       milk makes very decent pies. Sweeten it to your taste, with
       molasses or sugar; some pumpkins require more sweetening
       than others. Two tea-spoonfuls of salt; two great spoonfuls
       of sifted cinnamon; one great spoonful of ginger. Ginger
       will answer very well alone for spice, if you use enough of
       it. The outside of a lemon grated in is nice. The more eggs,
       the better the pie; some put an egg to a gill of milk. They
       should bake from forty to fifty minutes, and even ten
       minutes longer, if very deep.</p>

    <h4>CARROT PIE.</h4>

    <p>Carrot pies are made like squash pies. The carrots should be
    boiled very tender, skinned and sifted. Both carrot pies and
    squash pies should be baked without an upper crust, in deep
    plates. To be baked an hour, in quite a warm oven.</p>

    <h4>CHERRY PIE.</h4>

    <p>Cherry pies should be baked in a deep plate. Take the
    cherries from the stalks, lay them in a plate, and sprinkle a
    little sugar, and cinnamon, according to the sweetness of the
    cherries. Baked with a top and bottom crust, three quarters of
    an hour.</p>

    <h4>WHORTLEBERRY PIE.</h4>

    <p>Whortleberries make a very good common pie, where there is a
    large family of children. Sprinkle a little sugar and sifted
    cloves into each pie. Baked in the same way, and as long, as
    cherry pies.</p>

    <h4>APPLE PIE.</h4>

    <p>When you make apple pies, stew your apples very little
    indeed; just strike them through, to make them tender.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>{68}</span> Some people do not stew them at
       all, but cut them up in very thin slices, and lay them in
       the crust. Pies made in this way may retain more of the
       spirit of the apple; but I do not think the seasoning mixes
       in as well. Put in sugar to your taste; it is impossible to
       make a precise rule, because apples vary so much in acidity.
       A very little salt, and a small piece of butter in each pie,
       makes them richer. Cloves and cinnamon are both suitable
       spice. Lemon-brandy and rose-water are both excellent. A
       wine-glass full of each is sufficient for three or four
       pies. If your apples lack spirit, grate in a whole
       lemon.</p>

    <h4>CUSTARD PIE.</h4>

    <p>It is a general rule to put eight eggs to a quart of milk,
    in making custard pies; but six eggs are a plenty for any
    common use. The milk should be boiled and cooled before it is
    used; and bits of stick-cinnamon and bits of lemon-peel boiled
    in it. Sweeten to your taste with clean sugar; a very little
    sprinkling of salt makes them taste better. Grate in a nutmeg.
    Bake in a deep plate. About 20 minutes are usually enough. If
    you are doubtful whether they are done, dip in the handle of a
    silver spoon, or the blade of a small knife; if it come out
    clean, the pie is done. Do not pour them into your plates till
    the minute you put them into the oven; it makes the crust wet
    and heavy. To be baked with an under crust only. Some people
    bake the under crust a little before the custard is poured in;
    this is to keep it from being clammy.</p>

    <h4>CRANBERRY PIE.</h4>

    <p>Cranberry pies need very little spice. A little nutmeg, or
    cinnamon, improves them. They need a great deal of sweetening.
    It is well to stew the sweetening with them; at least a part of
    it. It is easy to add, if you find them too sour for your
    taste. When cranberries are strained, and added to about their
    own weight in sugar, they make very delicious tarts. No upper
    crust.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>{69}</span>

    <h4>RHUBARB STALKS, OR PERSIAN APPLE.</h4>

    <p>Rhubarb stalks, or the Persian apple, is the earliest in
    gradient for pies, which the spring offers. The skin should be
    carefully stripped, and the stalks cut into small bits, and
    stewed very tender. These are dear pies, for they take an
    enormous quantity of sugar. Seasoned like apple pies
    Gooseberries, currants, &amp;c., are stewed, sweetened and
    seasoned like apple pies, in proportions suited to the
    sweetness of the fruit; there is no way to judge but by your
    own taste. Always remember it is more easy to add seasoning
    than to diminish it.</p>

    <h4>PIE CRUST.</h4>

    <p>To make pie crust for common use, a quarter of a pound of
    butter is enough for a half a pound of flour. Take out about a
    quarter part of the flour you intend to use, and lay it aside.
    Into the remainder of the flour rub butter thoroughly with your
    hands, until it is so short that a handful of it, clasped
    tight, will remain in a ball, without any tendency to fall in
    pieces. Then wet it with cold water, roll it out on a board,
    rub over the surface with flour, stick little lumps of butter
    all over it, sprinkle some flour over the butter, and roll the
    dough all up; flour the paste, and flour the rolling-pin; roll
    it lightly and quickly; flour it again; stick in bits of
    butter; do it up; flour the rolling-pin, and roll it quickly
    and lightly; and so on, till you have used up your butter.
    Always roll from you. Pie crust should be made as cold as
    possible, and set in a cool place; but be careful it does not
    freeze. Do not use more flour than you can help in sprinkling
    and rolling. The paste should not be rolled out more than three
    times; if rolled too much, it will not be
    flaky.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"

    <h4>COMMON CAKES.</h4>

    <p>In all cakes where butter or eggs are used, the butter
    should be very faithfully rubbed into the flour, and the eggs
    beat to a foam, before the ingredients are mixed.</p>

    <h4>GINGERBREAD.</h4>

    <p>A very good way to make molasses gingerbread is to rub four
    pounds and a half of flour with half a pound of lard and half a
    pound of butter; a pint of molasses, a gill of milk, tea-cup of
    ginger, a tea-spoonful of dissolved pearlash stirred together.
    All mixed, baked in shallow pans twenty or thirty minutes.</p>

    <p>Hard gingerbread is good to have in the family, it keeps so
    well. One pound of flour, half a pound of butter and sugar,
    rubbed into it; half a pound of sugar; great spoonful of
    ginger, or more, according to the strength of the ginger; a
    spoonful of rose-water, and a handful of caraway seed. Well
    beat up. Kneaded stiff enough to roll out and bake on flat
    pans. Bake twenty or thirty minutes.</p>

    <p>A cake of common gingerbread can be stirred up very quick in
    the following way. Rub in a bit of shortening as big as an egg
    into a pint of flour; if you use lard, add a little salt; two
    or three great spoonfuls of ginger; one cup of molasses, one
    cup and a half of cider, and a great spoonful of dissolved
    pearlash, put together and poured into the shortened flour
    while it is foaming; to be put in the oven in a minute. It
    ought to be just thick enough to pour into the pans with
    difficulty; if these proportions make it too thin, use less
    liquid the next time you try. Bake about twenty minutes.</p>

    <p>If by carelessness you let a piece of short-cake dough grow
    sour, put in a little pearlash and water, warm a little butter,
    according to the size of the dough, knead in a cup or two of
    sugar, (two cups, unless it is a very small bit,) two or three
    spoonfuls of ginger, and a little rose-water
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>{71}</span> Knead it up thoroughly, roll it
       out on a flat pan, and bake it twenty minutes. Every thing
       mixed with pearlash should be put in the oven
       immediately.</p>

    <h4>CUP CAKE.</h4>

    <p>Cup cake is about as good as pound cake, and is cheaper. One
    cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four
    eggs, well beat together, and baked in pans or cups. Bake
    twenty minutes, and no more.</p>

    <h4>TEA CAKE.</h4>

    <p>There is a kind of tea cake still cheaper. Three cups of
    sugar, three eggs, one cup of butter, one cup of milk, a
    spoonful of dissolved pearlash, and four cups of flour, well
    beat up. If it is so stiff it will not stir easily, add a
    little more milk.</p>

    <h4>CIDER CAKE.</h4>

    <p>Cider cake is very good, to be baked in small loaves. One
    pound and a half of flour, half a pound of sugar, quarter of a
    pound of butter, half a pint of cider, one teaspoonful of
    pearlash; spice to your taste. Bake till it turns easily in the
    pans. I should think about half an hour.</p>

    <h4>ELECTION CAKE.</h4>

    <p>Old-fashioned election cake is made of four pounds of flour;
    three quarters of a pound of butter; four eggs; one pound of
    sugar; one pound of currants, or raisins if you choose; half a
    pint of good yeast; wet it with milk as soft as it can be and
    be moulded on a board. Set to rise over night in winter; in
    warm weather, three hours is usually enough for it to rise. A
    loaf, the size of common flour bread, should bake three
    quarters of an hour.</p>

    <h4>SPONGE CAKE.</h4>

    <p>The nicest way to make sponge cake, or diet-bread, is the
    weight of six eggs in sugar, the weight of four eggs in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>{72}</span> flour, a little rose-water. The
       whites and yolks should be beaten thoroughly and separately.
       The eggs and sugar should be well beaten together; but after
       the flour is sprinkled, it should not be stirred a moment
       longer than is necessary to mix it well; it should be poured
       into the pan, and got into the oven with all possible
       expedition. Twenty minutes is about long enough to bake. Not
       to be put in till some other articles have taken off the
       first few minutes of furious heat.</p>

    <h4>WEDDING CAKE.</h4>

    <p>Good common wedding cake may be made thus: Four pounds of
    flour, three pounds of butter, three pounds of sugar, four
    pounds of currants, two pounds of raisins, twenty-four eggs,
    half a pint of brandy, or lemon-brandy, one ounce of mace, and
    three nutmegs. A little molasses makes it dark colored, which
    is desirable. Half a pound of citron improves it; but it is not
    necessary. To be baked two hours and a half, or three hours.
    After the oven is cleared, it is well to shut the door for
    eight or ten minutes, to let the violence of the heat subside,
    before cake or bread is put in.</p>

    <p>To make icing for your wedding cake, beat the whites of eggs
    to an entire froth, and to each egg add five teaspoonfuls of
    sifted loaf sugar, gradually; beat it a great while. Put it on
    when your cake is hot, or cold, as is most convenient. It will
    dry in a warm room, a short distance from a gentle fire, or in
    a warm oven.</p>

    <h4>LOAF CAKE.</h4>

    <p>Very good loaf cake is made with two pounds of flour, half a
    pound of sugar, quarter of a pound of butter, two eggs, a gill
    of sweet emptings, half an ounce of cinnamon, or cloves, a
    large spoonful of lemon-brandy, or rose-water; if it is not
    about as thin as goad white bread dough, add a little milk. A
    common sized loaf is made by these proportions. Bake about
    three quarters of an
    hour.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>{73}</span>

    <p>A handy way to make loaf cake is, to take about as much of
    your white bread dough, or sponge, as you think your pan will
    hold, and put it into a pan in which you have already beat up
    three or four eggs, six ounces of butter warmed, and half a
    pound of sugar, a spoonful of rose-water, little sifted
    cinnamon, or cloves. The materials should be well mixed and
    beat before the dough is put in; and then it should be all
    kneaded well together, about as stiff as white bread. Put in
    half a pound of currants, or raisins, with the butter, if you
    choose. It should Stand in the pan two or three hours to rise;
    and be baked about three quarters of an hour, if the pan is a
    common sized bread-pan.</p>

    <p>If you have loaf cake slightly injured by time, or by being
    kept in the cellar, cut off all appearance of mould from the
    outside, wipe it with a clean cloth, and wet it well with
    strong brandy and water sweetened with sugar; then put it in
    your oven, and let the heat strike through it, for fifteen or
    twenty minutes. Unless very bad, this will restore the
    sweetness.</p>

    <h4>CARAWAY CAKES.</h4>

    <p>Take one pound of flour, three quarters of a pound of sugar,
    half a pound of butter, a glass of rose-water, four eggs, and
    half a tea-cup of caraway seed,&mdash;the materials well rubbed
    together and beat up. Drop them from a spoon on tin sheets, and
    bake them brown in rather a slow oven. Twenty minutes, or half
    an hour, is enough to bake them.</p>

    <h4>DOUGH-NUTS.</h4>

    <p>For dough-nuts, take one pint of flour, half a pint of
    sugar, three eggs, a piece of butter as big as an egg, and a
    tea-spoonful of dissolved pearlash. When you have no eggs, a
    gill of lively emptings will do; but in that case, they must be
    made over night. Cinnamon, rose-water, or lemon-brandy, if you
    have it. If you use part lard instead of butter, add a little
    salt. Not put in till the fat is very hot. The more fat they
    are fried in, the less they will soak
    fat.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>{74}</span>

    <h4>PANCAKES.</h4>

    <p>Pancakes should be made of half a pint of milk, three great
    spoonfuls of sugar, one or two eggs, a tea-spoonful of
    dissolved pearlash, spiced with cinnamon, or cloves, a little
    salt, rose-water, or lemon-brandy, just as you happen to have
    it. Flour should be stirred in till the spoon moves round with
    difficulty. If they are thin, they are apt to soak fat. Have
    the fat in your skillet boiling hot, and drop them in with a
    spoon. Let them cook till thoroughly brown. The fat which is
    left is good to shorten other cakes. The more fat they are
    cooked in, the less they soak.</p>

    <p>If you have no eggs, or wish to save them, use the above
    ingredients, and supply the place of eggs by two or three
    spoonfuls of lively emptings; but in this case they must be
    made five or six hours before they are cooked,&mdash;and in
    winter they should stand all night. A spoonful or more of N.E.
    rum makes pancakes light. Flip makes very nice pancakes. In
    this case, nothing is done but to sweeten your mug of beer with
    molasses; put in one glass of N.E. rum; heat it till it foams,
    by putting in a hot poker; and stir it up with flour as thick
    as other pancakes.</p>

    <h4>FRITTERS.</h4>

    <p>Flat-jacks, or fritters, do not differ from pancakes, only
    in being mixed softer. The same ingredients are used in about
    the same quantities; only most people prefer to have no
    sweetening put in them, because they generally have butter,
    sugar, and nutmeg, put on them, after they are done. Excepting
    for company, the nutmeg can be well dispensed with. They are
    not to be boiled in fat, like pancakes; the spider or griddle
    should be well greased, and the cakes poured on as large as you
    want them, when it is quite hot; when it gets brown on one
    side, to be turned over upon the other. Fritters are better to
    be baked quite thin. Either flour, Indian, or rye, is
    good.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>{75}</span>

    <p>Sour beer, with a spoonful of pearlash, is good both for
    pancakes and fritters.</p>

    <p>If you have any cold rice left, it is nice to break it up
    fine in warm milk; put in a little salt; after you have put
    milk enough for the cakes you wish to make, (a half pint, Or
    more,) stir in flour till it is thick enough to pour for
    fritters. It does very well without an egg; but better with
    one. To be fried like other flat-jacks. Sugar and nutmeg are to
    be put on when they are buttered, if you like.</p>

    <h4>SHORT CAKE.</h4>

    <p>If you have sour milk, or butter-milk, it is well to make it
    into short cakes for tea. Rub in a very small bit of
    shortening, or three table-spoonfuls of cream, with the flour;
    put in a tea-spoonful of strong dissolved pearlash, into your
    sour milk, and mix your cake pretty stiff, to bake in the
    spider, on a few embers.</p>

    <p>When people have to buy butter and lard, short cakes are not
    economical food. A half pint of flour will make a cake large
    enough to cover a common plate. Rub in thoroughly a bit of
    shortening as big as a hen's egg; put in a tea-spoonful of
    dissolved pearlash; wet it with cold water; knead it stiff
    enough to roll well, to bake on a plate, or in a spider. It
    should bake as quick as it can, and not burn. The first side
    should stand longer to the fire than the last.</p>

    <h4>INDIAN CAKE.</h4>

    <p>Indian cake, or bannock, is sweet and cheap food. One quart
    of sifted meal, two great spoonfuls of molasses, two
    tea-spoonfuls of salt, a bit of shortening half as big as a
    hen's egg, stirred together; make it pretty moist with scalding
    water, put it into a well greased pan, smooth over the surface
    with a spoon, and bake it brown on both sides, before a quick
    fire. A little stewed pumpkin, scalded with the meal, improves
    the cake. Bannock split and dipped in butter makes very nice
    toast. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>{76}</span> A richer Indian cake may be made
       by stirring one egg to a half pint of milk, sweetened with
       two great spoonfuls of molasses; a little ginger, or
       cinnamon; Indian stirred in till it is just about thick
       enough to pour. Spider or bake-kettle well greased; cake
       poured in, covered up, baked half an hour, or three
       quarters, according to the thickness of the cake. If you
       have sour milk, or butter-milk, it is very nice for this
       kind of cake; the acidity corrected by a tea-spoonful of
       dissolved pearlash. It is a rule never to use pearlash for
       Indian, unless to correct the sourness of milk; it injures
       the flavor of the meal.</p>

    <p>Nice suet improves all kinds of Indian cakes very much.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Two cups of Indian meal, one table-spoonful molasses, two
    cups milk, a little salt, a handful flour, a little saleratus,
    mixed up thin, and poured into a buttered bake-kettle, hung
    over the fire uncovered, until you can bear your finger upon
    it, and then set down before the fire. Bake half an hour.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>BREAD, YEAST, &amp;c.</h2>

    <p>It is more difficult to give rules for making bread than for
    anything else; it depends so much on judgment and experience.
    In summer, bread should be mixed with cold water; during a
    chilly, damp spell, the water should be slightly warm; in
    severe cold weather, it should be mixed quite warm, and set in
    a warm place during the night. If your yeast is new and lively,
    a small quantity will make the bread rise; if it be old and
    heavy, it will take more. In these things I believe wisdom must
    be gained by a few mistakes.</p>

    <p>Six quarts of meal will make two good sized loaves of
    <i>Brown Bread</i>. Some like to have it half Indian meal and
    half rye meal; others prefer it one third Indian, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>{77}</span> two thirds rye. Many mix their
       brown bread over night; but there is no need of it; and it
       is more likely to sour, particularly in summer. If you do
       mix it the night before you bake it, you must not put in
       more than half the yeast I am about to mention, unless the
       weather is intensely cold. The meal should be sifted
       separately. Put the Indian in your bread-pan, sprinkle a
       little salt among it, and wet it thoroughly with scalding
       water. Stir it up while you are scalding it. Be sure and
       have hot water enough; for Indian absorbs a great deal of
       water. When it is cool, pour in your rye; add two gills of
       lively yeast, and mix it with water as stiff as you can
       knead it. Let it stand an hour and a half, in a cool place
       in summer, on the hearth in winter. It should be put into a
       very hot oven, and baked three or four hours. It is all the
       better for remaining in the oven over night.</p>

    <p><i>Flour Bread</i> should have a sponge set the night
    before. The sponge should be soft enough to pour; mixed with
    water, warm or cold, according to the temperature of the
    weather. One gill of lively yeast is enough to put into sponge
    for two loaves. I should judge about three pints of sponge
    would be right for two loaves. The warmth of the place in which
    the sponge is set, should be determined by the coldness of the
    weather. If your sponge looks frothy in the morning, it is a
    sign your bread will be good; if it does not rise, stir in a
    little more emptings; if it rises too much, taste of it, to see
    if it has any acid taste; if so, put in a tea-spoonful of
    pearlash when you mould in your flour; be sure the pearlash is
    well dissolved in water; if there are little lumps, your bread
    will be full of bitter spots. About an hour before your oven is
    ready, stir in flour into your sponge till it is stiff enough
    to lay on a well floured board or table. Knead it up pretty
    stiff, and put it into well greased pans, and let it stand in a
    cool or warm place, according to the weather. If the oven is
    ready, put them in fifteen or twenty minutes after the dough
    begins to rise up and crack; if the oven is not ready, move the
    pans to a cooler spot, to prevent the dough from becoming sour
    by too much rising. Common sized loaves will bake in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>{78}</span> three quarters of an hour. If
       they slip easily in the pans, it is a sign they are done.
       Some people do not set a soft sponge for flour bread; they
       knead it up all ready to put in the pans the night before,
       and leave it to rise. White bread and pies should not be set
       in the oven until the brown bread and beans have been in
       half an hour. If the oven be too hot, it will bind the crust
       so suddenly that the bread cannot rise; if it be too cold,
       the bread will fall. Flour bread should not be too
       stiff.</p>

    <p>Some people like one third Indian in their flour. Others
    like one third rye; and some think the nicest of all bread is
    one third Indian, one third rye, and one third flour, made
    according to the directions for flour bread. When Indian is
    used, it should be salted, and scalded, before the other meal
    is put in. A mixture of other grains is economical when flour
    is high.</p>

    <p><i>Dyspepsia Bread</i>.&mdash;The American Farmer publishes
    the following receipt for making bread, which has proved highly
    salutary to persons afflicted with that complaint,
    viz:&mdash;Three quarts unbolted wheat meal; one quart soft
    water, warm, but not hot; one gill of fresh yeast; one gill of
    molasses, or not, as may suit the taste; one tea-spoonful of
    saleratus.</p>

    <p>This will make two loaves, and should remain in the oven at
    least one hour; and when taken out, placed where they will cool
    gradually. Dyspepsia crackers can be made with unbolted flour,
    water and saleratus.</p>

    <p><i>To make Rice Bread</i>.&mdash;Boil a pint of rice soft;
    add a pint of leaven; then, three quarts of the flour; put it
    to rise in a tin or earthen vessel until it has risen
    sufficiently; divide it into three parts; then bake it as other
    bread, and you will have three large loaves.</p>

    <p>Heating ovens must be regulated by experience and
    observation. There is a difference in wood in giving out heat;
    there is a great difference in the construction of ovens; and
    when an oven is extremely cold, either on account of the
    weather, or want of use, it must be heated more. Economical
    people heat ovens with pine wood, fagots, brush, and such light
    stuff. If you have none but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>{79}</span> hard wood, you must remember
       that it makes very hot coals, and therefore less of it will
       answer. A smart fire for an hour and a half is a general
       rule for common sized family ovens, provided brown bread and
       beans are to be baked. An hour is long enough to heat an
       oven for flour bread. Pies bear about as much heat as flour
       bread: pumpkin pies will bear more. If you are afraid your
       oven is too hot, throw in a little flour, and shut it up for
       a minute. If it scorches black immediately, the heat is too
       furious; if it merely browns, it is right. Some people wet
       an old broom two or three times, and turn it round near the
       top of die oven till it dries; this prevents pies and cake
       from scorching on the top. When you go into a new house,
       heat your oven two or three times, to get it seasoned,
       before you use it. After the wood is burned, rake the coals
       over the bottom of the oven, and let them lie a few
       minutes.</p>

    <p>Those who make their own bread should make yeast too. When
    bread is nearly out, always think whether yeast is in
    readiness; for it takes a day and night to prepare it. One
    handful of hops, with two or three handsful of malt and rye
    bran, should be boiled fifteen or twenty minutes, in two quarts
    of water, then strained, hung on to boil again, and thickened
    with half a pint of rye and water stirred up quite thick, and a
    little molasses; boil it a minute or two, and then take it off
    to cool. When just about lukewarm, put in a cupful of good
    lively yeast, and set it in a cool place in summer, and warm
    place in winter. If it is too warm when you put in the old
    yeast, all the spirit will be killed.</p>

    <p>In summer, yeast sours easily; therefore make but little at
    a time. Bottle it when it gets well a working; it keeps better
    when the air is corked out. If you find it acid, but still
    spirited, put a little pearlash to it, as you use it; but by no
    means put it into your bread unless it foams up bright and
    lively as soon as the pearlash mixes with it. Never keep yeast
    in tin; it destroys its life.</p>

    <p>There is another method of making yeast, which is much
    easier, and I think quite as good. Stir rye and cold water,
    till you make a stiff thickening. Then pour in boiling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>{80}</span> water, and stir it all the time,
       till you make it as thin as the yeast you buy; three or four
       table spoons heaping full are enough for a quart of water.
       When it gets about cold, put in half a pint of lively yeast.
       When it works well, bottle it; but if very lively, do not
       cork your bottle <i>very</i> tight, for fear it will burst.
       Always think to make new yeast before the old is gone; so
       that you may have some to work with. Always wash and scald
       your bottle clean after it has contained sour yeast. Beware
       of freezing yeast.</p>

    <p>Milk yeast is made quicker than any other. A pint of new
    milk with a tea-spoonful of salt, and a large spoon of flour
    stirred in, set by the fire to keep lukewarm, will make yeast
    fit for use in an hour. Twice the quantity of common yeast is
    necessary, and unless used soon is good for nothing. Bread made
    of this yeast dries sooner. It is convenient in summer, when
    one wants to make biscuits suddenly.</p>

    <p>A species of leaven may be made that will keep any length of
    time. Three ounces of hops in a pail of water boiled down to a
    quart; strain it, and stir in a quart of rye meal while boiling
    hot. Cool it, and add half a pint of good yeast; after it has
    risen a few hours, thicken it with Indian meal stiff enough to
    roll out upon a board; then put it in the sun and air a few
    days to dry. A piece of this cake two inches square, dissolved
    in warm water, and thickened with a little flour, will make a
    large loaf of bread.</p>

    <p>Potatoes make very good yeast. Mash three large potatoes
    fine; pour a pint of boiling water over them; when almost cold,
    stir in two spoonfuls of flour, two of molasses, and a cup of
    good yeast. This yeast should be used while new.</p>

    <h2>PRESERVES, &amp;c.</h2>

    <p>Economical people will seldom use preserves, except for
    sickness. They are unhealthy, expensive, and useless to those
    who are well. Barberries preserved in molasses are very good
    for common use. Boil the molasses, skim it, throw in the
    barberries, and simmer them till they are soft. If you wish to
    lay by a few for sickness, preserve them in sugar by the same
    rule as other preserves. Melt the sugar, skim it, throw in the
    barberries; when done soft, take them out, and throw in
    others.</p>

    <p>A pound of sugar to a pound of fruit is the rule for all
    preserves. The sugar should be melted over a fire moderate
    enough not to scorch it. When melted, it should be skimmed
    clean, and the fruit dropped in to simmer till it is soft.
    Plums, and things of which the skin is liable to be broken, do
    better to be put in little jars, with their weight of sugar,
    and the jars set in a kettle of boiling water, till the fruit
    is done. See the water is not so high as to boil into the
    jars.</p>

    <p>When you put preserves in jars, lay a white paper,
    thoroughly wet with brandy, flat upon the surface of the
    preserves, and cover them carefully from the air. If they begin
    to mould, scald them by setting them in the oven till boiling
    hot. Glass is much better than earthen for preserves; they are
    not half as apt to ferment.</p>

    <h4>CURRANT JELLY.</h4>

    <p>Currant jelly is a useful thing for sickness. If it be
    necessary to wash your currants, be sure they are thoroughly
    drained, or your jelly will be thin. Break them up with a
    pestle, and squeeze them through a cloth. Put a pint of clean
    sugar to a pint of juice, and boil it slowly, till it becomes
    ropy. Great care must be taken not to do it too fast; it is
    spoiled by being scorched. It should be frequently skimmed
    while simmering. If currants are put
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>{82}</span> in a jar, and kept in boiling
       water, and cooked before they are strained, they are more
       likely to keep a long time without fermenting.</p>

    <h4>CURRANT WINE.</h4>

    <p>Those who have more currants than they have money, will do
    well to use no wine but of their own manufacture. Break and
    squeeze the currants, put three pounds and a half of sugar to
    two quarts of juice and two quarts of water. Put in a keg or
    barrel. Do not close the bung tight for three or four days,
    that the air may escape while it is fermenting. After it is
    done fermenting, close it up tight. Where raspberries are
    plenty, it is a great improvement to use half raspberry juice,
    and half currant juice. Brandy is unnecessary when the
    above-mentioned proportions are observed. It should not be used
    under a year or two. Age improves it.</p>

    <h4>RASPBERRY SHRUB.</h4>

    <p>Raspberry shrub mixed with water is a pure, delicious drink
    for summer; and in a country where raspberries are abundant, it
    is good economy to make it answer instead of Port and Catalonia
    wine. Put raspberries in a pan, and scarcely cover them with
    strong vinegar. Add a pint of sugar to a pint of juice; (of
    this you can judge by first trying your pan to see how much it
    holds;) scald it, skim it, and bottle it when cold.</p>

    <h4>COFFEE.</h4>

    <p>As substitutes for coffee, some use dry brown bread crusts,
    and roast them; others soak rye grain in rum, and roast it;
    others roast peas in the same way as coffee. None of these are
    very good; and peas so used are considered unhealthy. Where
    there is a large family of apprentices and workmen, and coffee
    is very dear, it may be worth while to use the substitutes, or
    to mix them half and half with coffee; but, after all, the best
    economy is to go
    without.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>{83}</span>

    <p>French coffee is so celebrated, that it may be worth while
    to tell how it is made; though no prudent housekeeper will make
    it, unless she has boarders, who are willing to pay for
    expensive cooking.</p>

    <p>The coffee should be roasted more than is common with us; it
    should not hang drying over the fire, but should be roasted
    quick; it should be ground soon after roasting, and used as
    soon as it is ground. Those who pride themselves on first-rate
    coffee, burn it and grind it every morning. The powder should
    be placed in the coffee-pot in the proportions of an ounce to
    less than a pint of water. The water should be poured upon the
    coffee boiling hot. The coffee should be kept at the boiling
    point; but should not boil. Coffee made in this way must be
    made in a biggin. It would not be clear in a common
    coffee-pot.</p>

    <p>A bit of fish-skin as big as a ninepence, thrown into coffee
    while it is boiling, tends to make it clear. If you use it just
    as it comes from the salt-fish, it will be apt to give an
    unpleasant taste to the coffee: it should be washed clean as a
    bit of cloth, and hung up till perfectly dry. The white of
    eggs, and even egg shells are good to settle coffee. Rind of
    salt pork is excellent.</p>

    <p>Some people think coffee is richer and clearer for having a
    bit of sweet butter, or a whole egg, dropped in and stirred,
    just before it is done roasting, and ground up, shell and all,
    with the coffee. But these things are not economical, except on
    a farm, where butter and eggs are plenty. A half a gill of cold
    water, poured in after you take your coffee-pot off the fire,
    will <i>usually</i> settle the coffee.</p>

    <p>If you have not cream for coffee, it is a very great
    improvement to boil your milk, and use it while hot.</p>

    <h4>CHOCOLATE.</h4>

    <p>Many people boil chocolate in a coffee-pot; but I think it
    is better to boil it in a skillet, or something open. A piece
    of chocolate about as big as a dollar is the usual quantity for
    a quart of water; but some put in more, and some less. When it
    boils, pour in as much milk as you like
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>{84}</span> and let them boil together three
       or four minutes. It is much richer with the milk boiled in
       it. Put the sugar in either before or after, as you please.
       Nutmeg improves it. The chocolate should be scraped fine
       before it is put into the water.</p>

    <h4>TEA.</h4>

    <p>Young Hyson is supposed to be a more profitable tea than
    Hyson; but though the <i>quantity</i> to a pound is greater, it
    has not so much <i>strength</i>. In point of economy,
    therefore, there is not much difference between them. Hyson tea
    and Souchong mixed together, half and half, is a pleasant
    beverage, and is more healthy than green tea alone. Be sure
    that water boils before it is poured upon tea. A tea-spoonful
    to each person, and one extra thrown in, is a good rule. Steep
    ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

    <h4>PICKLES.</h4>

    <p>Musk-melons should be picked for mangoes, when they are
    green and hard. They should be cut open after they have been in
    salt water ten days, the inside scraped out clean, and filled
    with mustard-seed, allspice, horseradish, small onions,
    &amp;c., and sewed up again. Scalding vinegar poured upon
    them.</p>

    <p>When walnuts are so ripe that a pin will go into them
    easily, they are ready for pickling. They should be soaked
    twelve days in very strong cold salt and water, which has been
    boiled and skimmed. A quantity of vinegar, enough to cover them
    well, should be boiled with whole pepper, mustard-seed, small
    onions, or garlic, cloves, ginger, and horseradish; this should
    not be poured upon them till it is cold. They should be pickled
    a few months before they are eaten. To be kept close covered;
    for the air softens them. The liquor is an excellent catsup to
    be eaten on fish.</p>

    <p>Put peppers into strong salt and water, until they become
    yellow; then turn them green by keeping them in warm salt and
    water, shifting them every two days. Then drain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>{85}</span> them, and pour scalding vinegar
       over them. A bag of mustard-seed is an improvement. If there
       is mother in vinegar, scald and strain it.</p>

    <p>Cucumbers should be in weak brine three or four days after
    they are picked; then they should be put in a tin or wooden
    pail of clean water, and kept slightly warm in the kitchen
    corner for two or three days. Then take as much vinegar as you
    think your pickle jar will hold; scald it with pepper,
    allspice, mustard-seed, flag-root, horseradish, &amp;c., if you
    happen to have them; half of them will spice the pickles very
    well. Throw in a bit of alum as big as a walnut; this serves to
    make pickles hard. Skim the vinegar clean, and pour it scalding
    hot upon the cucumbers. Brass vessels are not healthy for
    preparing anything acid. Red cabbages need no other pickling
    than scalding, spiced vinegar poured upon them, and suffered to
    remain eight or ten days before you eat them. Some people think
    it improves them to keep them in salt and water twenty-four
    hours before they are pickled.</p>

    <p>If you find your pickles soft and insipid, it is owing to
    the weakness of the vinegar. Throw away the vinegar, (or keep
    it to clean your brass kettles,) then cover your pickles with
    strong, scalding vinegar, into which a little allspice, ginger,
    horseradish and alum have been thrown. By no means omit a
    pretty large bit of alum. Pickles attended to in this way, will
    keep for years, and be better and better every year.</p>

    <p>Some people prefer pickled nasturtion-seed to capers. They
    should be kept several days after they are gathered, and then
    covered with boiling vinegar, and bottled when cold. They are
    not fit to be eaten for some months.</p>

    <p>Martinoes are prepared in nearly the same way as other
    pickles. The salt and water in which they are put, two or three
    days previous to pickling, should be changed every day; because
    martinoes are very apt to become soft. No spice should be used
    but allspice, cloves, and cinnamon. The martinoes and the spice
    should be scalded <i>in</i> the vinegar, instead of pouring the
    vinegar <i>over</i> the
    martinoes.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>{86}</span>

    <h4>BEER.</h4>

    <p>Beer is a good family drink. A handful of hops, to a pailful
    of water, and a half-pint of molasses, makes good hop beer.
    Spruce mixed with hops is pleasanter than hops alone. Boxberry,
    fever-bush, sweet fern, and horseradish make a good and healthy
    diet-drink. The winter evergreen, or rheumatism weed, thrown
    in, is very beneficial to humors. Be careful and not mistake
    kill-lamb for winter-evergreen; they resemble each other. Malt
    mixed with a few hops makes a weak kind of beer; but it is cool
    and pleasant; it needs less molasses than hops alone. The rule
    is about the same for all beer. Boil the ingredients two or
    three hours, pour in a half-pint of molasses to a pailful,
    while the beer is scalding hot. Strain the beer, and when about
    lukewarm, put a pint of lively yeast to a barrel. Leave the
    bung loose till the beer is done working; you can ascertain
    this by observing when the froth subsides. If your family be
    large, and the beer will be drank rapidly, it may as well
    remain in the barrel; but if your family be small, fill what
    bottles you have with it; it keeps better bottled. A raw potato
    or two, cut up and thrown in, while the ingredients are
    boiling, is said to make beer spirited.</p>

    <p>Ginger beer is made in the following proportions:&mdash;One
    cup of ginger, one pint of molasses, one pail and a half of
    water, and a cup of lively yeast. Most people scald the ginger
    in half a pail of water, and then fill it up with a pailful of
    cold; but in very hot weather some people stir it up cold.
    Yeast must not be put in till it is cold, or nearly cold. If
    not to be drank within twenty-four hours, it must be bottled as
    soon as it works.</p>

    <p>Table beer should be drawn off into <i>stone</i> jugs, with
    a lump of white sugar in each, securely corked. It is brisk and
    pleasant, and continues good several months.</p>

    <p>Potato cheese is much sought after in various parts of
    Europe. I do not know whether it is worth seeking after,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>{87}</span> or not. The following is the
       receipt for making:&mdash;Select good white potatoes, boil
       them, and, when cold, peel and reduce them to a pulp with a
       rasp or mortar; to five pounds of this pulp, which must be
       very uniform and homogeneous, add a pint of sour milk and
       the requisite portion of salt; knead the whole well, cover
       it, and let it remain three or four days, according to the
       season; then knead it afresh, and place the cheeses in small
       baskets, when they will part with their superfluous
       moisture; dry them in the shade, and place them in layers in
       large pots or kegs, where they may remain a fortnight. The
       older they are, the finer they become.</p>

    <p>This cheese has the advantage of never engendering worms,
    and of being preserved fresh for many years, provided it is
    kept in a dry place, and in well closed vessels.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>GENERAL MAXIMS FOR HEALTH.</h2>

    <p>Rise early. Eat simple food. Take plenty of exercise. Never
    fear a little fatigue. Let not children be dressed in tight
    clothes; it is necessary their limbs and muscles should have
    full play, if you wish for either health or beauty.</p>

    <p>Avoid the necessity of a physician, if you can, by careful
    attention to your diet. Eat what best agrees with your system,
    and resolutely abstain from what hurts you, however well you
    may like it. A few days' abstinence, and cold water for a
    beverage, has driven off many an approaching disease.</p>

    <p>If you find yourself really ill, send for a good physician.
    Have nothing to do with quacks; and do not tamper with quack
    medicines. You do not know what they are; and what security
    have you that they know what they are?</p>

    <p>Wear shoes that are large enough. It not only produces
    corns, but makes the feet misshapen, to cramp
    them.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>{88}</span>

    <p>Wash very often, and rub the skin thoroughly with a hard
    brush.</p>

    <p>Let those who love to be invalids drink strong green tea,
    eat pickles, preserves, and rich pastry. As far as possible,
    eat and sleep at regular hours.</p>

    <p>Wash the eyes thoroughly in cold water every morning. Do not
    read or sew at twilight, or by too dazzling a light. If
    far-sighted, read with rather less light, and with the book
    somewhat nearer to the eye, than you desire. If nearsighted,
    read with a book as far off as possible. Both these
    imperfections may be diminished in this way.</p>

    <p>Clean teeth in pure water two or three times a day; but,
    above all, be sure to have them clean before you go to bed.</p>

    <p>Have your bed-chamber well aired; and have fresh bed linen
    every week. Never have the wind blowing directly upon you from
    open windows during the night. It is <i>not</i> healthy to
    sleep in heated rooms.</p>

    <p>Let children have their bread and milk before they have been
    long up. Cold water and a run in the fresh air before
    breakfast.</p>

    <p>Too frequent use of an ivory comb injures the hair. Thorough
    combing, washing in suds, or N.E. rum, and thorough brushing,
    will keep it in order; and the washing does not injure the
    hair, as is generally supposed. Keep children's hair cut close
    until ten or twelve years old; it is better for health and the
    beauty of the hair. Do not sleep with hair frizzled, or
    braided. Do not make children cross-eyed, by having hair hang
    about their foreheads, where they see it continually.</p>

    <hr class="short" />

    <center>
        When clouds are seen, wise men put on their
        cloaks.&mdash;SHAKSPEARE.
    </center>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h4>FURNITURE.</h4>

    <p>The prevailing evil of the present day is extravagance. I
    know very well that the old are too prone to preach about
    modern degeneracy, whether they have cause or not; but, laugh
    as we may at the sage advice of our fathers, it is too plain
    that our present expensive habits are productive of much
    domestic unhappiness, and injurious to public prosperity. Our
    wealthy people copy all the foolish and extravagant caprice of
    European fashion, without considering that we have not their
    laws of inheritance among us; and that our frequent changes of
    policy render property far more precarious here than in the old
    world. However, it is not to the rich I would speak. They have
    an undoubted right to spend their thousands as they please; and
    if they spend them ridiculously, it is consoling to reflect
    that they must, in some way or other, benefit the poorer
    classes. People of moderate fortunes have likewise an
    unquestioned right to dispose of their hundreds as they please;
    but I would ask, Is it <i>wise</i> to risk your happiness in a
    foolish attempt to keep up with the opulent? Of what <i>use</i>
    is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>{90}</span> effort which takes so much of
       your time, and <i>all</i> of your income? Nay, if any
       unexpected change in affairs should deprive you of a few
       yearly hundreds, you will find your expenses have
       <i>exceeded</i> your income; thus the foundation of an
       accumulating debt will be laid, and your family will have
       formed habits but poorly calculated to save you from the
       threatened ruin. Not one valuable friend will be gained by
       living beyond your means, and old age will be left to
       comparative, if not to utter poverty.</p>

    <p>There is nothing in which the extravagance of the present
    day strikes me so forcibly as the manner in which our young
    people of moderate fortune furnish their houses.</p>

    <p>A few weeks since, I called upon a farmer's daughter, who
    had lately married a young physician of moderate talents, and
    destitute of fortune. Her father had given her, at her
    marriage, all he ever expected to give her: viz. two thousand
    dollars. Yet the lower part of her house was furnished with as
    much splendor as we usually find among the wealthiest. The
    whole two thousand had been expended upon Brussels carpets,
    alabaster vases, mahogany chairs, and marble tables. I
    afterwards learned that the more useful household utensils had
    been forgotten; and that, a few weeks after her wedding, she
    was actually obliged to apply to her husband for money to
    purchase baskets, iron spoons, clothes-lines, &amp;c.; and her
    husband, made irritable by the want of money, pettishly
    demanded why she had bought so many things they did not want.
    Did the doctor gain any patients, or she a single friend, by
    offering their visiters water in richly-cut glass tumblers, or
    serving them with costly damask napkins, instead of plain soft
    towels? No; their foolish vanity made them less happy, and no
    more respectable.</p>

    <p>Had the young lady been content with Kidderminster carpets,
    and tasteful vases of her own making, she might have put
    <i>one</i> thousand dollars at interest; and had she obtained
    six per cent., it would have clothed her as well as the wife of
    any man, who depends merely upon his own industry, ought to be
    clothed. This would have saved much domestic disquiet; for,
    after all, human nature is human
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>{91}</span> nature; and a wife is never
       better beloved, because she teases for money.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>EDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS.</h3>

    <p>There is no subject so much connected with individual
    happiness and national prosperity as the education of
    daughters. It is a true, and therefore an old remark, that the
    situation and prospects of a country may be justly estimated by
    the character of its women; and we all know how hard it is to
    engraft upon a woman's character habits and principles to which
    she was unaccustomed in her girlish days. It is always
    extremely difficult, and sometimes utterly impossible. Is the
    present education of young ladies likely to contribute to their
    own ultimate happiness, or to the welfare of the country? There
    are many honorable exceptions; but we do think the general tone
    of female education is bad. The greatest and most universal
    error is, teaching girls to exaggerate the importance of
    getting married; and of course to place an undue importance
    upon the polite attentions of gentlemen. It was but a few days
    since, I heard a pretty and sensible girl say, 'Did you ever
    see a man so ridiculously fond of his daughters as Mr.
    &mdash;&mdash;? He is all the time with them. The other night,
    at the party, I went and took Anna away by mere force; for I
    knew she must feel dreadfully to have her father waiting upon
    her all the time, while the other girls were talking with the
    beaux.' And another young friend of mine said, with an air most
    laughably serious, 'I don't think Harriet and Julia enjoyed
    themselves at all last night. Don't you think, nobody but their
    <i>brother</i> offered to hand them to the supper-room?'</p>

    <p>That a mother should wish to see her daughters happily
    married, is natural and proper; that a young lady should be
    pleased with polite attentions is likewise natural and
    innocent; but this undue anxiety, this foolish excitement
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>{92}</span> about showing off the attentions
       of somebody, no matter whom, is attended with consequences
       seriously injurious. It promotes envy and rivalship; it
       leads our young girls to spend their time between the public
       streets, the ball room, and the toilet; and, worst of all,
       it leads them to contract engagements, without any knowledge
       of their own hearts, merely for the sake of being married as
       soon as their companions. When married, they find themselves
       ignorant of the important duties of domestic life; and its
       quiet pleasures soon grow tiresome to minds worn out by
       frivolous excitements. If they remain unmarried, their
       disappointment and discontent are, of course, in proportion
       to their exaggerated idea of the eclat attendant upon having
       a lover. The evil increases in a startling ratio; for these
       girls, so injudiciously educated, will, nine times out of
       ten, make injudicious mothers, aunts, and friends; thus
       follies will be accumulated unto the third and fourth
       generation. Young ladies should be taught that usefulness is
       happiness, and that all other things are but incidental.
       With regard to matrimonial speculations, they should be
       taught nothing! Leave the affections to nature and to truth,
       and all will end well. How many can I at this moment
       recollect, who have made themselves unhappy by marrying for
       the sake of the <i>name</i> of being married! How many do I
       know, who have been instructed to such watchfulness in the
       game, that they have lost it by trumping their own
       tricks!</p>

    <p>One great cause of the vanity, extravagance and idleness
    that are so fast growing upon our young ladies, is the absence
    of <i>domestic education</i>. By domestic education, I do not
    mean the sending daughters into the kitchen some half dozen
    times, to weary the patience of the cook, and to boast of it
    the next day in the parlor. I mean two or three years spent
    with a mother, assisting her in her duties, instructing
    brothers and sisters, and taking care of their own clothes.
    This is the way to make them happy, as well as good wives; for,
    being early accustomed to the duties of life, they will sit
    lightly as well as gracefully upon them.</p>

    <p>But what time do modern girls have for the formation of
    quiet, domestic habits? Until sixteen they go to school;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>{93}</span> sometimes these years are
       judiciously spent, and sometimes they are half wasted; too
       often they are spent in acquiring the <i>elements</i> of a
       thousand sciences, without being thoroughly acquainted with
       any; or in a variety of accomplishments of very doubtful
       value to people of moderate fortune. As soon as they leave
       school, (and sometimes before,) they begin a round of balls
       and parties, and staying with gay young friends. Dress and
       flattery take up all their thoughts. What time have they to
       learn to be useful? What time have they to cultivate the
       still and gentle affections, which must, in every situation
       of life, have such an important effect on a woman's
       character and happiness?</p>

    <p>As far as parents can judge what will be a daughter's
    station, education should be adapted to it; but it is well to
    remember that it is always easy to know how to spend riches,
    and always safe to know how to bear poverty.</p>

    <p>A superficial acquaintance with such accomplishments as
    music and drawing is useless and undesirable. They should not
    be attempted unless there is taste, talent, and time enough to
    attain excellence. I have frequently heard young women of
    moderate fortune say, 'I have not opened my piano these five
    years. I wish I had the money expended upon it. If I had
    employed as much time in learning useful things, I should have
    been better fitted for the cares of my family.'</p>

    <p>By these remarks I do not mean to discourage an attention to
    the graces of life. Gentility and taste are always lovely in
    all situations. But good things, carried to excess, are often
    productive of bad consequences. When accomplishments and dress
    interfere with the duties and permanent happiness of life, they
    are unjustifiable and displeasing; but where there is a solid
    foundation in mind and heart, all those elegancies are but
    becoming ornaments.</p>

    <p>Some are likely to have more use for them than others; and
    they are justified in spending more time and money upon them.
    But no one should be taught to consider them valuable for mere
    parade and attraction. Making the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>{94}</span> education of girls such a series
       of 'man-traps,' makes the whole system unhealthy, by
       poisoning the motive.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In tracing evils of any kind, which exist in society, we
    must, after all, be brought up against the great cause of all
    mischief&mdash;<i>mismanagement in education</i>; and this
    remark applies with peculiar force to the leading fault of the
    present day, viz. extravagance. It is useless to expend our
    ingenuity in purifying the stream, unless the fountain be
    cleansed. If young men and young women are brought up to
    consider frugality contemptible, and industry degrading, it is
    vain to expect they will at once become prudent and useful,
    when the cares of life press heavily upon them. Generally
    speaking, when misfortune comes upon those who have been
    accustomed to thoughtless expenditure, it sinks them to
    discouragement, or, what is worse, drives them to desperation.
    It is true there are exceptions. There are a few, an honorable
    few, who, late in life, with Roman severity of resolution,
    learn the long-neglected lesson of economy. But how small is
    the number, compared with the whole mass of the population! And
    with what bitter agony, with what biting humiliation, is the
    hard lesson often learned! How easily might it have been
    engrafted on <i>early habits</i>, and naturally and gracefully
    'grown with their growth, and strengthened with their
    strength!'</p>

    <p>Yet it was but lately that I visited a family, not of
    'moderate fortune,' but of no fortune at all; one of those
    people who live 'nobody knows how;' and I found a young girl,
    about sixteen, practising on the piano, while an elderly lady
    beside her was darning her stockings. I was told (for the
    mother was proud of bringing up her child so genteelly) that
    the daughter had almost forgotten how to sew, and that a woman
    was hired into the house to do her mending! 'But why,' said I,
    'have you suffered your daughter to be ignorant of so useful an
    employment? If she is poor, the knowledge will be necessary to
    her; if she is rich, it is the easiest thing in the world to
    lay it aside, if she <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>{95}</span> chooses; she will merely be a
       better judge whether her work is well done by others.' 'That
       is true,' replied the mother; 'and I always meant she should
       learn; but she never has seemed to have any time. When she
       was eight years old, she could put a shirt together pretty
       well; but since that, her music, and her dancing, and her
       school, have taken up her whole time. I did mean she should
       learn some domestic habits this winter; but she has so many
       visiters, and is obliged to go out so much, that I suppose I
       must give it up. I don't like to say too much about it; for,
       poor girl! she does so love company, and she does so hate
       anything like care and confinement! <i>Now</i> is her time
       to enjoy herself, you know. Let her take all the comfort she
       can, while she is single!' 'But,' said I, 'you wish her to
       marry some time or other; and, in all probability, she will
       marry. When will she learn how to perform the duties, which
       are necessary and important to every mistress of a family?'
       'Oh, she will learn them when she is obliged to,' answered
       the injudicious mother; 'at all events, I am determined she
       shall enjoy herself while she is young.'</p>

    <p>And this is the way I have often heard mothers talk! Yet,
    could parents foresee the almost inevitable consequences of
    such a system, I believe the weakest and vainest would abandon
    the false and dangerous theory. What a lesson is taught a girl
    in that sentence, '<i>Let her enjoy herself all she can, while
    she is single</i>!' Instead of representing domestic life as
    the gathering place of the deepest and purest affections; as
    the sphere of woman's <i>enjoyments</i> as well as of her
    <i>duties</i>; as, indeed, the whole world to her; that one
    pernicious sentence teaches a girl to consider matrimony
    desirable because 'a good match' is a triumph of vanity, and it
    is deemed respectable to be 'well settled in the world;' but
    that it is a necessary sacrifice of her freedom and her gayety.
    And then how many affectionate dispositions have been trained
    into heartlessness, by being taught that the indulgence of
    indolence and vanity were necessary to their happiness; and
    that to have this indulgence, they <i>must</i> marry money! But
    who that marries for money, in this land of precarious
    fortunes, can tell how <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>{96}</span> soon they will lose the
       glittering temptation, to which they have been willing to
       sacrifice so much? And even if riches last as long as life,
       the evil is not remedied. Education has given a wrong end
       and aim to their whole existence; they have been taught to
       look for happiness where it never can be found, viz. in the
       absence of all occupation, or the unsatisfactory and ruinous
       excitement of fashionable competition.</p>

    <p>The difficulty is, education does not usually point the
    female heart to its only true resting-place. That dear English
    word '<i>home</i>,' is not half so powerful a talisman as
    '<i>the world</i>.' Instead of the salutary truth, that
    happiness is <i>in</i> duty, they are taught to consider the
    two things totally distinct; and that whoever seeks one, must
    sacrifice the other.</p>

    <p>The fact is, our girls have no <i>home education</i>. When
    quite young, they are sent to schools where no feminine
    employments, no domestic habits, can be learned; and there they
    continue till they 'come out' into the world. After this, few
    find any time to arrange, and make use of, the mass of
    elementary knowledge they have acquired; and fewer still have
    either leisure or taste for the inelegant, every-day duties of
    life. Thus prepared, they enter upon matrimony. Those early
    habits, which would have made domestic care a light and easy
    task, have never been taught, for fear it would interrupt their
    happiness; and the result is, that when cares come, as come
    they must, they find them misery. I am convinced that
    indifference and dislike between husband and wife are more
    frequently occasioned by this great error in education, than by
    any other cause.</p>

    <p>The bride is awakened from her delightful dream, in which
    carpets, vases, sofas, white gloves, and pearl earrings, are
    oddly jumbled up with her lover's looks and promises. Perhaps
    she would be surprised if she knew exactly how <i>much</i> of
    the fascination of being engaged was owing to the aforesaid
    inanimate concern. Be that as it will, she is awakened by the
    unpleasant conviction that cares devolve upon her. And what
    effect does this produce upon her character? Do the holy and
    tender influences of domestic love render self-denial and
    exertion a bliss? No! They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"
       id="page97"></a>{97}</span> would have done so, had she been
       <i>properly educated</i>; but now she gives way to
       unavailing fretfulness and repining; and her husband is at
       first pained, and finally disgusted, by hearing, 'I never
       knew what care was when I lived in my father's house.' 'If I
       were to live my life over again, I would remain single as
       long as I could, without the risk of being an old maid.' How
       injudicious, how short-sighted is the policy, which thus
       mars the whole happiness of life, in order to make a few
       brief years more gay and brilliant! I have known many
       instances of domestic ruin and discord produced by this
       mistaken indulgence of mothers. <i>I never knew but one,
       where the victim had moral courage enough to change all her
       early habits</i>. She was a young, pretty, and very amiable
       girl; but brought up to be perfectly useless; a rag baby
       would, to all intents and purposes, have been as efficient a
       partner. She married a young lawyer, without property, but
       with good and increasing practice. She meant to be a good
       wife, but she did not know how. Her wastefulness involved
       him in debt. He did not reproach, though he tried to
       convince and instruct her. She loved him; and weeping
       replied, 'I try to do the best I can; but when I lived at
       home, mother always took care of everything.' Finally,
       poverty came upon him 'like an armed man;' and he went into
       a remote town in the Western States to teach a school. His
       wife folded her hands, and cried; while he, weary and
       discouraged, actually came home from school to cook his own
       supper. At last, his patience, and her real love for him,
       impelled her to exertion. She promised to learn to be
       useful, if he would teach her. And she did learn! And the
       change in her habits gradually wrought such a change in her
       husband's fortune, that she might bring her daughters up in
       idleness, had not experience taught her that economy, like
       grammar, is a very hard and tiresome study, after we are
       twenty years old.</p>

    <p>Perhaps some will think the evils of which I have been
    speaking are confined principally to the rich; but I am
    convinced they extend to all classes of people. All manual
    employment is considered degrading; and those who are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>{98}</span> compelled to do it, try to
       conceal it. A few years since, very respectable young men at
       our colleges, cut their own wood, and blacked their own
       shoes. Now, how few, even of the sons of plain farmers and
       industrious mechanics, have moral courage enough to do
       without a servant; yet when they leave college, and come out
       into the battle of life, they <i>must</i> do without
       servants; and in these times it will be fortunate if one
       half of them get what is called 'a decent living,' even by
       rigid economy and patient toil. Yet I would not that servile
       and laborious employment should be forced upon the young. I
       would merely have each one educated according to his
       probable situation in life; and be taught that whatever is
       his duty, is honorable; and that no merely external
       circumstance can in reality injure true dignity of
       character. I would not cramp a boy's energies by compelling
       him always to cut wood, or draw water; but I would teach him
       not to be ashamed, should his companions happen to find him
       doing either one or the other. A few days since, I asked a
       grocer's lad to bring home some articles I had just
       purchased at his master's. The bundle was large; he was
       visibly reluctant to take it; and wished very much that I
       should send for it. This, however, was impossible; and he
       subdued his pride; but when I asked him to take back an
       empty bottle which belonged to the store, he, with a
       mortified look, begged me to do it up neatly in a paper,
       that it might look like a small package. Is this boy likely
       to be happier for cherishing a foolish pride, which will
       forever be jarring against his duties? Is he in reality one
       whit more respectable than the industrious lad who sweeps
       stores, or carries bottles, without troubling himself with
       the idea that all the world is observing his little
       unimportant self? For, in relation to the rest of the world,
       each individual is unimportant; and he alone is wise who
       forms his habits according to his own wants, his own
       prospects, and his own
       principles.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"

    <h3>TRAVELLING AND PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS.</h3>

    <p>There is one kind of extravagance rapidly increasing in this
    country, which, in its effects on our purses and our
    <i>habits</i>, is one of the worst kinds of extravagance; I
    mean the rage for travelling, and for public amusements. The
    good old home habits of our ancestors are breaking up&mdash;it
    will be well if our virtue and our freedom do not follow them!
    It is easy to laugh at such prognostics,&mdash;and we are well
    aware that the virtue we preach is considered almost
    obsolete,&mdash;but let any reflecting mind inquire how decay
    has begun in all republics, and then let them calmly ask
    themselves whether we are in no danger, in departing thus
    rapidly from the simplicity and industry of our
    forefathers.</p>

    <p>Nations do not plunge <i>at once</i> into
    ruin&mdash;governments do not change <i>suddenly</i>&mdash;the
    causes which bring about the final blow, are scarcely
    perceptible in the beginning; but they increase in numbers, and
    in power; they press harder and harder upon the energies and
    virtue of a people; and the last steps only are alarmingly
    hurried and irregular. A republic without industry, economy,
    and integrity, is Samson shorn of his locks. A luxurious and
    idle <i>republic</i>! Look at the phrase!&mdash;The words were
    never made to be married together; every body sees it would be
    death to one of them.</p>

    <p>And are not <i>we</i> becoming luxurious and idle? Look at
    our steamboats, and stages, and taverns! There you will find
    mechanics, who have left debts and employment to take care of
    themselves, while they go to take a peep at the great canal, or
    the opera-dancers. There you will find domestics all agog for
    their wages-worth of travelling; why should they look out for
    'a rainy day?' There are hospitals enough to provide for them
    in sickness; and as for marrying, they have no idea of that,
    till they can find a man who will support them genteelly. There
    you will find mothers, who have left the children at home with
    Betsey, while they go to improve their minds at the Mountain
    House, or the
    Springs.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>{100}</span>

    <p>If only the rich did this, all would be well. They benefit
    others, and do not injure themselves. In any situation,
    idleness is their curse, and uneasiness is the tax they must
    pay for affluence; but their restlessness is as great a benefit
    to the community as the motions of Prince Esterhazy, when at
    every step the pearls drop from his coat.</p>

    <p>People of moderate fortune have just as good a right to
    travel as the wealthy; but is it not unwise? Do they not injure
    themselves and their families? You say travelling is cheap. So
    is staying at home. Besides, do you count <i>all</i> the
    costs?</p>

    <p>The money you pay for stages and steamboats is the smallest
    of the items. There are clothes bought which would not
    otherwise be bought; those clothes are worn out and defaced
    twenty times as quick as they would have been at home; children
    are perhaps left with domestics, or strangers; their health and
    morals, to say the least, under very uncertain influence; your
    substance is wasted in your absence by those who have no
    self-interest to prompt them to carefulness; you form an
    acquaintance with a multitude of people, who will be sure to
    take your house in their way, when they travel next year; and
    finally, you become so accustomed to excitement, that home
    appears insipid, and it requires no small effort to return to
    the quiet routine of your duties. And what do you get in return
    for all this? Some pleasant scenes, which will soon seem to you
    like a dream; some pleasant faces, which you will never see
    again; and much of crowd, and toil, and dust, and bustle.</p>

    <p>I once knew a family which formed a striking illustration of
    my remarks. The man was a farmer, and his wife was an active,
    capable woman, with more of ambition than sound policy. Being
    in debt, they resolved to take fashionable boarders from
    Boston, during the summer season. These boarders, at the time
    of their arrival, were projecting a jaunt to the Springs; and
    they talked of Lake George crystals, and Canadian music, and
    English officers, and 'dark blue Ontario,' with its beautiful
    little brood of <i>lakelets</i>, as Wordsworth would call them;
    and how one lady was dressed superbly at Saratoga; and how
    another was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>{101}</span> scandalized for always
       happening to drop her fan in the vicinity of the wealthiest
       beaux. All this fired the quiet imagination of the good
       farmer's wife; and no sooner had the boarders departed to
       enjoy themselves in spite of heat, and dust, and
       fever-and-ague, than she stated her determination to follow
       them. 'Why have we not as good a right to travel, as they
       have?' said she; 'they have paid us money enough to go to
       Niagara with; and it really is a shame for people to live
       and die so ignorant of their own country.' 'But then we want
       the money to pay for that stock, which turned out unlucky,
       you know.' 'Oh, that can be done next summer; we can always
       get boarders enough, and those that will pay handsomely.
       Give the man a mortgage of the house, to keep him quiet till
       next summer.' 'But what will you do with the children?'
       'Sally is a very smart girl; I am sure she will take as good
       care of them as if I were at home.'</p>

    <p>To make a long story short, the farmer and his wife
    concluded to go to Quebec, just to show they had a <i>right</i>
    to put themselves to inconvenience, if they pleased. They went;
    spent all their money; had a watch stolen from them in the
    steamboat; were dreadfully sea-sick off Point Judith; came home
    tired, and dusty; found the babe sick, because Sally had stood
    at the door with it, one chilly, damp morning, while she was
    feeding the chickens; and the eldest girl screaming and
    screeching at the thoughts of going to bed, because Sally, in
    order to bring her under her authority, had told her a
    frightful 'raw-head-and-bloody-bones' story; the horse had
    broken into the garden, and made wretched work with the
    vegetables; and fifty pounds of butter had become fit for the
    grease-pot, because the hoops of the firkin had sprung, and
    Sally had so much to do, that she never thought of going to see
    whether the butter was covered with brine.</p>

    <p>After six or eight weeks, the children were pretty well
    restored to orderly habits; and the wife, being really a
    notable and prudent woman, resolved to make up for her lost
    butter and vegetables, by doing without help through the
    winter. When summer came, they should have boarders,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>{102}</span> she said; and sure enough,
       they had boarders in plenty; but not profitable ones. There
       were forty cousins, at whose houses they had stopped; and
       twenty people who had been very polite to them on the way;
       and it being such a pleasant season, and <i>travelling so
       cheap</i>, everyone of these people felt they had <i>a
       right</i> to take a journey; and they could not help passing
       a day or two with their friends at the farm. One after
       another came, till the farmer could bear it no longer. 'I
       tell you what, wife,' said he, 'I am going to jail as fast
       as a man can go. If there is no other way of putting a stop
       to this, I'll sell every bed in the house, except the one we
       sleep on.'</p>

    <p>And sure enough, he actually did this; and when the
    forty-first cousin came down on a friendly visit, on account of
    what her other cousins had told her about the cheapness of
    travelling, she was told they should be very happy to sleep on
    the floor, for the sake of accommodating her, for a night or
    two; but the truth was, they had but one bed in the house. This
    honest couple are now busy in paying off their debts, and
    laying by something for their old age. He facetiously tells how
    he went to New York to have his watch stolen, and his boots
    blacked like a looking glass; and she shows her Lake George
    diamond ring, and tells how the steamboat was crowded, and how
    afraid she was the boiler would burst, and always ends by
    saying, 'After all, it was a toil of pleasure.'</p>

    <p>However, it is not our farmers, who are in the greatest
    danger of this species of extravagance; for we look to that
    class of people, as the strongest hold of republican
    simplicity, industry, and virtue. It is from adventurers,
    swindlers, broken down traders,&mdash;all that rapidly
    increasing class of idlers, too genteel to work, and too proud
    to beg,&mdash;that we have most reason to dread examples of
    extravagance. A very respectable tavern-keeper has lately been
    driven to establish a rule, that no customer shall be allowed
    to rise from the table till he pays for his meal. 'I know it is
    rude to give such orders to honest men,' said he, 'and three
    years ago I would as soon cut off my hand as have done it; but
    now, travelling is so cheap, that all sorts of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>{103}</span> characters are on the move;
       and I find more than half of them will get away, if they
       can, without paying a cent.'</p>

    <p>With regard to public amusements, it is still worse.
    Rope-dancers, and opera-dancers, and all sorts of dancers, go
    through the country, making thousands as they go; while, from
    high to low, there is one universal, despairing groan of 'hard
    times,' 'dreadful gloomy times!'</p>

    <p>These things ought not to be. People who have little to
    spend, should partake sparingly of useless amusements; those
    who are in debt should deny themselves entirely. Let me not be
    supposed to inculcate exclusive doctrines. I would have every
    species of enjoyment as open to the poor as to the rich; but I
    would have people consider well how they are likely to obtain
    the greatest portion of happiness, taking the whole of their
    lives into view; I would not have them sacrifice permanent
    respectability and comfort to present gentility and love of
    excitement; above all, I caution them to beware that this love
    of excitement does not grow into a habit, till the fireside
    becomes a dull place, and the gambling table and the bar-room
    finish what the theatre began.</p>

    <p>If men would have women economical, they must be so
    themselves. What motive is there for patient industry, and
    careful economy, when the savings of a month are spent at one
    trip to Nahant, and more than the value of a much desired, but
    rejected dress, is expended during the stay of a new set of
    comedians? We make a great deal of talk about being
    republicans; if we are so in reality, we shall stay at home, to
    mind our business, and educate our children, so long as one or
    the other need our attention, or can suffer by our neglect.</p>

    <h2>PHILOSOPHY AND CONSISTENCY.</h2>

    <p>Among all the fine things Mrs. Barbauld wrote, she never
    wrote anything better than her essay on the Inconsistency of
    Human Expectations. 'Everything,' says she, 'is marked at a
    settled price. Our time, our labor, our ingenuity, is so much
    ready money, which we are to lay out to the best advantage.
    Examine, compare, choose, reject; but stand to your own
    judgment; and do not, like children, when you have purchased
    one thing, repine that you do not possess another, which you
    would not purchase. Would you be rich? Do you think <i>that</i>
    the single point worth sacrificing everything else to? You may
    then be rich. Thousands have become so from the lowest
    beginnings by toil, and diligence, and attention to the
    minutest articles of expense and profit. But you must give up
    the pleasures of leisure, of an unembarrassed mind, and of a
    free, unsuspicious temper. You must learn to do hard, if not
    unjust things; and as for the embarrassment of a delicate and
    ingenuous spirit, it is necessary for you to get rid of it as
    fast as possible. You must not stop to enlarge your mind,
    polish your taste, or refine your sentiments; but must keep on
    in one beaten track, without turning aside to the right hand or
    the left. "But," you say, "I cannot submit to drudgery like
    this; I feel a spirit above it." 'Tis well; be above it then;
    only do not repine because you are not rich. Is knowledge the
    pearl of price in your estimation? That too may be purchased by
    steady application, and long, solitary hours of study and
    reflection. "But," says the man of letters, "what a hardship is
    it that many an illiterate fellow, who cannot construe the
    motto on his coach, shall raise a fortune, and make a figure,
    while I possess merely the common conveniences of life." Was it
    for fortune, then, that you grew pale over the midnight lamp,
    and gave the sprightly years of youth to study and reflection?
    You then have mistaken your path, and ill employed your
    industry. "What reward have I then for all my labor?" What
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>{105}</span> reward! A large comprehensive
       soul, purged from vulgar fears and prejudices, able to
       interpret the works of man and God. A perpetual spring of
       fresh ideas, and the conscious dignity of superior
       intelligence. Good Heaven! what other reward can you ask!
       "But is it not a reproach upon the economy of Providence
       that such a one, who is a mean, dirty fellow, should have
       amassed wealth enough to buy half a nation?" Not in the
       least. He made himself a mean, dirty fellow, for that very
       end. He has paid his health, his conscience, and his liberty
       for it. Do you envy him his bargain? Will you hang your head
       in his presence, because he outshines you in equipage and
       show? Lift up your brow with a noble confidence, and say to
       yourself, "I have not these things, it is true; but it is
       because I have not desired, or sought them; it is because I
       possess something better. I have chosen my lot! I am
       content, and satisfied." The most characteristic mark of a
       great mind is to choose some one object, which it considers
       important, and pursue that object through life. If we expect
       the purchase, we must pay the price.'</p>

    <p>'There is a pretty passage in one of Lucian's dialogues,
    where Jupiter complains to Cupid, that, though he has had so
    many intrigues, he was never sincerely beloved. "In order to be
    loved," says Cupid, "you must lay aside your aegis and your
    thunder-bolts; you must curl and perfume your hair, and place a
    garland on your head, and walk with a soft step, and assume a
    winning, obsequious deportment." "But," replied Jupiter, "I am
    not willing to resign so much of my dignity." "Then," returned
    Cupid, "leave off desiring to be loved."'</p>

    <p>These remarks by Mrs. Barbauld are full of sound philosophy.
    Who has not observed, in his circle of acquaintance, and in the
    recesses of his own heart, the same inconsistency of
    expectation, the same peevishness of discontent.</p>

    <p>Says Germanicus, 'There is my dunce of a classmate has found
    his way into Congress, and is living amid the perpetual
    excitement of intellectual minds, while I am cooped up in an
    ignorant country parish, obliged to be at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>{106}</span> the beck and call of every old
       woman, who happens to feel uneasy in her mind.'</p>

    <p>'Well, Germanicus, the road to political distinction was as
    open to you as to him; why did you not choose it?' 'Oh, I could
    not consent to be the tool of a party; to shake hands with the
    vicious, and flatter fools. It would gall me to the quick to
    hear my opponents accuse me of actions I never committed, and
    of motives which worlds would not tempt me to indulge.' Since
    Germanicus is wise enough to know the whistle costs more than
    it is worth, is he not unreasonable to murmur because he has
    not bought it?</p>

    <p>Matrona always wears a discontented look when she hears the
    praises of Clio. 'I used to write her composition for her, when
    we were at school together,' says she; 'and now she is quite
    the idol of the literary world; while I am never heard of
    beyond my own family, unless some one happens to introduce me
    as the friend of Clio.' 'Why not write, then; and see if the
    world will not learn to introduce Clio as the friend of
    Matrona?' 'I write! not for the world! I could not endure to
    pour my soul out to an undiscerning multitude; I could not see
    my cherished thoughts caricatured by some soulless reviewer,
    and my favorite fancies expounded by the matter-of-fact editor
    of some stupid paper.' Why does Matrona envy what she knows
    costs so much, and is of so little value?</p>

    <p>Yet so it is, through all classes of society. All of us
    covet some neighbor's possession, and think our lot would have
    been happier, had it been different from what it is. Yet most
    of us could obtain worldly distinctions, if our habits and
    inclinations allowed us to pay the immense price at which they
    must be purchased. True wisdom lies in finding out all the
    advantages of a situation in which we <i>are</i> placed,
    instead of imagining the enjoyments of one in which we are
    <i>not</i> placed.</p>

    <p>Such philosophy is rarely found. The most perfect sample I
    ever met was an old woman, who was apparently the poorest and
    most forlorn of the human species&mdash;so true is the maxim
    which all profess to believe, and which none act upon
    invariably, viz. that happiness does not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>{107}</span> depend on outward
       circumstances. The wise woman, to whom I have alluded,
       <i>walks</i> to Boston, from a distance of twenty-five or
       thirty miles, to sell a bag of brown thread and stockings;
       and then patiently foots it back again with her little
       gains. Her dress, though tidy, is a grotesque collection of
       'shreds and patches,' coarse in the extreme. 'Why don't you
       come down in a wagon?' said I, when I observed that she was
       soon to become a mother, and was evidently wearied with her
       long journey. 'We h'an't got any horse,' replied she; 'the
       neighbors are very kind to me, but they can't spare their'n;
       and it would cost as much to hire one, as all my thread will
       come to.' 'You have a husband&mdash;don't he do anything for
       you.' 'He is a good man; he does all he can; but he's a
       cripple and an invalid. He reels my yarn, and <i>specks</i>
       the children's shoes. He's as kind a husband as a woman need
       to have.' 'But his being a cripple is a heavy misfortune to
       you,' said I. 'Why, ma'am, I don't look upon it in that
       light,' replied the thread-woman; 'I consider that I've
       great reason to be thankful he never took to any bad
       habits.' 'How many children have you?' 'Six sons, and five
       <i>darters</i>, ma'am.' 'Six sons and five daughters! What a
       family for a poor woman to support!' 'It's a family, surely,
       ma'am; but there an't one of 'em I'd be willing to lose.
       They are as good children as need to be&mdash;all willing to
       work, and all clever to me. Even the littlest boy, when he
       gets a cent now and then for doing a <i>chore</i>, will be
       sure and bring it to ma'am.' 'Do your daughters spin your
       thread?' 'No, ma'am; as soon as they are old enough, they go
       out to <i>sarvice</i>. I don't want to keep them always
       delving for me; they are always willing to give me what they
       can; but it is right and fair they should do a little for
       themselves. I do all my spinning after the folks are abed.'
       'Don't you think you should be better off, if you had no one
       but yourself to provide for?' 'Why, no, ma'am, I don't. If I
       hadn't been married, I should always have had to work as
       hard as I could; and now I can't do more than that. My
       children are a great comfort to me; and I look forward
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>{108}</span> to the time when they'll do as
       much for me as I have done for them.'</p>

    <p>Here was true philosophy! I learned a lesson from that poor
    woman which I shall not soon forget. If I wanted true, hearty,
    well principled service, I would employ children brought up by
    such a mother.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>REASONS FOR HARD TIMES.</h2>

    <p>Perhaps there never was a time when the depressing effects
    of stagnation in business were so universally felt, all the
    world over, as they are now.&mdash;The merchant sends out old
    dollars, and is lucky if he gets the same number of new ones in
    return; and he who has a share in manufactures, has bought a
    'bottle imp,' which he will do well to hawk about the street
    for the lowest possible coin. The effects of this depression
    must of course be felt by all grades of society. Yet who that
    passes through Cornhill at one o'clock, and sees the bright
    array of wives and daughters, as various in their decorations
    as the insects, the birds and the shells, would believe that
    the community was staggering under a weight which almost
    paralyzes its movements? 'Everything is so cheap,' say the
    ladies, 'that it is inexcusable not to dress well.' But do they
    reflect <i>why</i> things are so cheap? Do they know how much
    wealth has been sacrificed, how many families ruined, to
    produce this boasted result? Do they not know enough of the
    machinery of society, to suppose that the stunning effect of
    crash after crash, may eventually be felt by those on whom they
    depend for support?</p>

    <p>Luxuries are cheaper now than necessaries were a few years
    since; yet it is a lamentable fact, that it costs more to live
    now than it did formerly. When silk was nine shillings per
    yard, seven or eight yards sufficed for a dress;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>{109}</span> now it is four or five
       shillings, sixteen or twenty yards will hardly satisfy the
       mantuamaker.</p>

    <p>If this extravagance were confined to the wealthiest
    classes, it would be productive of more good than evil. But if
    the rich have a new dress every fortnight, people of moderate
    fortune will have one every month. In this way, finery becomes
    the standard of respectability; and a man's cloth is of more
    consequence than his character.</p>

    <p>Men of fixed salaries spend every cent of their income, and
    then leave their children to depend on the precarious charity
    and reluctant friendship of a world they have wasted their
    substance to please. Men who rush into enterprise and
    speculation, keep up their credit by splendor; and should they
    sink, they and their families carry with them extravagant
    habits to corrode their spirits with discontent, perchance to
    tempt them into crime. 'I know we are extravagant,' said one of
    my acquaintance, the other day; 'but how can I help it? My
    husband does not like to see his wife and daughters dress more
    meanly than those with whom they associate.' 'Then, my dear
    lady, your husband has not as much moral dignity and moral
    courage as I thought he had. He should be content to see his
    wife and daughters respected for neatness, good taste, and
    attractive manners.' 'This all sounds very well in talk,'
    replied the lady; 'but, say what you will about pleasing and
    intelligent girls, nobody will attend to them unless they dress
    in the fashion. If my daughters were to dress in the plain,
    neat style you recommend, they would see all their acquaintance
    asked to dance more frequently than themselves, and not a
    gentleman would join them in Cornhill.'</p>

    <p>'I do not believe this in so extensive a sense as you do.
    Girls may appear genteelly without being extravagant, and
    though some fops may know the most approved color for a ribbon,
    or the newest arrangement for trimming, I believe gentlemen of
    real character merely notice whether a lady's dress is
    generally in good taste, or not. But, granting your statement
    to be true, in its widest sense, of what consequence is it? How
    much will the whole happiness of your daughter's life be
    affected by her dancing some fifty times
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>{110}</span> less than her companions, or
       wasting some few hours less in the empty conversation of
       coxcombs? A man often admires a style of dress, which he
       would not venture to support in a wife. Extravagance has
       prevented many marriages, and rendered still more unhappy.
       And should your daughters fail in forming good connexions,
       what have you to leave them, save extravagant habits, too
       deeply rooted to be eradicated. Think you those who now
       laugh at them for a soiled glove, or an unfashionable
       ribbon, will assist their poverty, or cheer their neglected
       old age? No; they would find them as cold and selfish as
       they are vain. A few thousands in the bank are worth all the
       fashionable friends in Christendom.'</p>

    <p>Whether my friend was convinced, or not, I cannot say; but I
    saw her daughters in Cornhill, the next week, with new French
    hats and blonde veils.</p>

    <p>It is really melancholy to see how this fever of
    extravagance rages, and how it is sapping the strength of our
    happy country. It has no bounds; it pervades all ranks, and
    characterizes all ages.</p>

    <p>I know the wife of a pavier, who spends her three hundred a
    year in 'outward adorning,' and who will not condescend to
    speak to her husband, while engaged in his honest calling.</p>

    <p>Mechanics, who should have too high a sense of their own
    respectability to resort to such pitiful competition, will
    indulge their daughters in dressing like the wealthiest; and a
    domestic would certainly leave you, should you dare advise her
    to lay up one cent of her wages.</p>

    <p>'These things ought not to be.' Every man and every woman
    should lay up some portion of their income, whether that income
    be great or small.</p>

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"

    <h2>HOW TO ENDURE POVERTY.</h2>

    <p>That a thorough, religious, <i>useful</i> education is the
    best security against misfortune, disgrace and poverty, is
    universally believed and acknowledged; and to this we add the
    firm conviction, that, when poverty comes (as it sometimes
    will) upon the prudent, the industrious, and the well-informed,
    a judicious education is all-powerful in enabling them to
    <i>endure</i> the evils it cannot always <i>prevent</i>. A mind
    full of piety and knowledge is always rich; it is a bank that
    never fails; it yields a perpetual dividend of happiness.</p>

    <p>In a late visit to the alms-house at &mdash;&mdash;, we saw
    a remarkable evidence of the truth of this doctrine. Mrs.
    &mdash;&mdash; was early left an orphan. She was educated by an
    uncle and aunt, both of whom had attained the middle age of
    life. Theirs was an industrious, well-ordered, and cheerful
    family. Her uncle was a man of sound judgment, liberal
    feelings, and great knowledge of human nature. This he showed
    by the education of the young people under his care. He allowed
    them to waste no time; every moment must be spent in learning
    something, or in doing something. He encouraged an
    entertaining, lively style of conversation, but discountenanced
    all remarks about persons, families, dress, and engagements; he
    used to say, parents were not aware how such topics frittered
    away the minds of young people, and what inordinate importance
    they learned to attach to them, when they heard them constantly
    talked about.</p>

    <p>In his family, Sunday was a happy day; for it was made a day
    of religious instruction, without any unnatural constraint upon
    the gayety of the young. The Bible was the text book; the
    places mentioned in it were traced on maps; the manners and
    customs of different nations were explained; curious phenomena
    in the natural history of those countries were read; in a word,
    everything was done to cherish a spirit of humble, yet earnest
    inquiry. In this excellent family Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; remained
    till her marriage. In the course of fifteen years, she lost her
    uncle, her aunt, and her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>{112}</span> husband. She was left
       destitute, but supported herself comfortably by her own
       exertions, and retained the respect and admiration of a
       large circle of friends. Thus she passed her life in
       cheerfulness and honor during ten years; at the end of that
       time, her humble residence took fire from an adjoining house
       in the night time, and she escaped by jumping from the
       chamber window. In consequence of the injury received by
       this fall, her right arm was amputated, and her right leg
       became entirely useless. Her friends were very kind and
       attentive; and for a short time she consented to live on
       their bounty; but, aware that the claims on private charity
       are very numerous, she, with the genuine independence of a
       strong mind, resolved to avail herself of the public
       provision for the helpless poor. The name of going to the
       alms-house had nothing terrifying or disgraceful to
       <i>her</i>; for she had been taught that <i>conduct</i> is
       the real standard of respectability. She is there, with a
       heart full of thankfulness to the Giver of all things; she
       is patient, pious, and uniformly cheerful. She instructs the
       young, encourages the old, and makes herself delightful to
       all, by her various knowledge and entertaining conversation.
       Her character reflects dignity on her situation; and those
       who visit the establishment, come away with sentiments of
       respect and admiration for this voluntary resident of the
       alms-house.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>What a contrast is afforded by the character of the woman
    who occupies the room next hers! She is so indolent and filthy,
    that she can with difficulty be made to attend to her own
    personal comfort; and even the most patient are worn out with
    her perpetual fretfulness. Her mind is continually infested
    with envy, hatred, and discontent She thinks Providence has
    dealt hardly with her; that all the world are proud and
    ungrateful; and that every one despises her because she is in
    the alms-house. This pitiable state of mind is the natural
    result of her education.</p>

    <p>Her father was a respectable mechanic, and might have been a
    wealthy one, had he not been fascinated by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>{113}</span> beauty of a thoughtless, idle,
       showy girl, whom he made his wife. The usual consequences
       followed&mdash;he could not earn money so fast as she could
       spend it; the house became a scene of discord; the daughter
       dressed in the fashion; learned to play on the piano; was
       taught to think that being engaged in any useful employment
       was very ungenteel; and that to be <i>engaged to be
       married</i> was the chief end and aim of woman; the father
       died a bankrupt; the weak and frivolous mother lingered
       along in beggary, for a while, and then died of vexation and
       shame.</p>

    <p>The friends of the family were very kind to the daughter;
    but her extreme indolence, her vanity, pertness, and
    ingratitude, finally exhausted the kindness of the most
    generous and forbearing; and as nothing could induce her to
    personal exertion, she was at length obliged to take shelter in
    the alms-house. Here her misery is incurable. She has so long
    been accustomed to think dress and parade the necessary
    elements of happiness, that she despises all that is done for
    her comfort; her face has settled into an expression which
    looks like an imbodied growl; every body is tired of listening
    to her complaints; and even the little children run away, when
    they see her coming.</p>

    <p>May not those who have children to educate, learn a good
    lesson from these women? Those who have wealth, have recently
    had many and bitter lessons to prove how suddenly riches may
    take to themselves wings; and those who <i>certainly</i> have
    but little to leave, should indeed beware how they bestow upon
    their children, the accursed inheritance of indolent and
    extravagant habits.</p>

    <p>*VARNISHED FURNITURE.&mdash;If you wish to give a fine soft
    polish to varnished furniture, and remove any slight
    imperfections, rub it once or twice a week with pulverized
    rotten-stone and linseed oil, and afterward wipe clean with a
    soft silk rag.</p>

    <p>CREAM.&mdash;The quantity of cream on milk may be greatly
    increased by the following process: Have two pans ready in
    boiling hot water, and when the new milk is brought in, put it
    into one of these hot pans and cover it with the other. The
    quality as well as the thickness of the cream is improved.</p>

    <p>*TEETH.&mdash;Honey mixed with pure pulverized charcoal is
    said to be excellent to cleanse the teeth, and make them white.
    Lime-water with a little Peruvian bark is very good to be
    occasionally used by those who have defective teeth, or an
    offensive breath.</p>

    <p>TAINTED BUTTER.&mdash;Some good cooks say that bad butter
    may be purified in the following manner: Melt and skim it, then
    put into it a piece of <i>well-toasted</i> bread; in a few
    minutes the butter will lose its offensive taste and smell; the
    bread will absorb it all. Slices of potato fried in rancid lard
    will in a great measure absorb the unpleasant taste.</p>

    <p>TOMATOES PIE.&mdash;Tomatoes make excellent pies. Skins
    taken <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>{115}</span> off with scalding water,
       stewed twenty minutes or more, salted, prepared the same as
       rich squash pies, only an egg or two more.</p>

    <p>*It is a great improvement to the flavor of PUMPKIN PIES to
    boil the milk, stir the sifted pumpkin into it, and let them
    boil up together once or twice. The pumpkin swells almost as
    much as Indian meal, and of course absorbs more milk than when
    stirred together cold; but the taste of the pie is much
    improved.</p>

    <p>Some people cut pumpkin, string it, and dry it like apples.
    It is a much better way to boil and sift the pumpkin, then
    spread it out thin in tin plates, and dry hard in a warm oven.
    It will keep good all the year round, and a little piece boiled
    up in milk will make a batch of pies.</p>

    <p>*Most people think BRASS KETTLES for washing are not as
    likely to collect verdigris, if they are never cleaned in any
    other way than by washing in strong soap suds just before they
    are used.</p>

    <p>INK SPOTS.&mdash;If soaked in warm milk before the ink has a
    chance to dry, the spot may usually be removed. If it has dried
    in, rub table-salt upon it, and drop lemon-juice upon the salt.
    This answers nearly as well as the salts of lemon sold by
    apothecaries. If a lemon cannot be easily procured, vinegar, or
    sorrel-juice, will answer. White soap diluted with vinegar is
    likewise a good thing to take out ink spots.</p>

    <p>STARCH.&mdash;Frozen potatoes yield more flour for starch
    than fresh ones. The frost may be taken out by soaking them in
    cold water a few hours before cooking; if frozen very hard, it
    may be useful to throw a little saltpetre into the water.</p>

    <p>FEATHERS.&mdash;It is said that tumbled plumes may be
    restored to elasticity and beauty by dipping them in hot water,
    then shaking and drying them.</p>

    <p>ICY STEPS.&mdash;Salt strewed upon the door-steps in winter
    will cause the ice to crack, so that it can be easily
    removed.</p>

    <p>FLOWERS.&mdash;Flowers may be preserved fresh in tumblers or
    vases by putting a handful of salt in the water, to increase
    its coldness.</p>

    <p>WHITE-WASHING is said to last longer if the new-slaked lime
    be mixed with skim-milk.</p>

    <p>HORSE-FLIES.&mdash;Indigo-weed stuck plentifully about the
    harness tends to keep flies from horses. Some make a decoction
    of indigo-weed, and others of pennyroyal, and bathe horses with
    it, to defend them from insects.</p>

    <p>PINE APPLES will keep much better if the green crown at top
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>{116}</span> be twisted off. The vegetation
       of the crown takes the goodness from the fruit, in the same
       way that sprouts injure vegetables. The crown can be stuck
       on for ornament, if necessary.</p>

    <p>*THE PILES.&mdash;Those who have tried other remedies for
    this disorder in vain, have found relief from the following
    medicine: Stew a handful of low mallows in about three gills of
    milk; strain it, and mix about half the quantity of West India
    molasses with it. As warm as is agreeable.</p>

    <p>WARTS.&mdash;It is said that if the top of a wart be wet and
    rubbed two or three times a day with a piece of unslaked lime,
    it cures the wart soon, and leaves no scar.</p>

    <p>*CANCERS.&mdash;The Indians have great belief in the
    efficacy of poultices of stewed cranberries, for the relief of
    <i>cancers</i>. They apply them fresh and warm every ten or
    fifteen minutes, night and day. Whether this will effect a cure
    I know not; I simply know that the Indians strongly recommend
    it. Salts, or some simple physic, is taken every day during the
    process.</p>

    <p>EAR-WAX.&mdash;Nothing is better than ear-wax to prevent the
    painful effects resulting from a wound by a nail, skewer,
    &amp;c. It should be put on as soon as possible. Those who are
    troubled with cracked lips have found this remedy successful
    when others have failed. It is one of those sorts of cures,
    which are very likely to be laughed at; but I know of its
    having produced very beneficial results.</p>

    <p>*BURNS.&mdash;If a person who is burned will
    <i>patiently</i> hold the injured part in water, it will
    prevent the formation of a blister. If the water be too cold,
    it may be slightly warmed, and produce the same effect. People
    in general are not willing to try it for a sufficiently long
    time. Chalk and hog's lard simmered together are said to make a
    good ointment for a burn.</p>

    <p>*BRUISES.&mdash;Constant application of warm water is very
    soothing to bruised flesh, and may serve to prevent bad
    consequences while other things are in preparation.</p>

    <p>SORE NIPPLES.&mdash;Put twenty grains of sugar of lead into
    a vial with one gill of rose-water; shake it up thoroughly; wet
    a piece of soft linen with this preparation, and put it on;
    renew this as often as the linen becomes dry. Before nursing,
    wash this off with something soothing; rose-water is very good;
    but the best thing is quince-seed warmed in a little cold tea
    until the liquid becomes quite glutinous. This application is
    alike healing and pleasant.</p>

    <p>A raw onion is an excellent remedy for the STING OF A
    WASP.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
       id="page117"></a>{117}</span>

    <p>CORNS.&mdash;A corn may be extracted from the foot by
    binding on half a raw cranberry, with the cut side of the fruit
    upon the foot. I have known a very old and troublesome corn
    drawn out in this way, in the course of a few nights.</p>

    <p>HEART-BURN.&mdash;Eat magnesia for the heart-burn.</p>

    <p>CHLORIDE OF LIME.&mdash;A room may be purified from
    offensive smells of any kind by a few spoonsful of chloride of
    lime dissolved in water. A good-sized saucer, or some similar
    vessel, is large enough for all common purposes. The article is
    cheap, and is invaluable in the apartment of an invalid.</p>

    <p>EGGS IN WINTER.&mdash;The reason hens do not usually lay
    eggs in the winter is that the gravel is covered up with snow,
    and therefore they are not furnished with lime to form the
    shells. If the bones left of meat, poultry, &amp;c. are pounded
    and mixed with their food, or given to them alone, they will
    eat them very eagerly, and will lay eggs the same as in summer.
    Hens fed on oats are much more likely to lay well than those
    fed on corn.</p>

    <p>PEARLS.&mdash;In order to preserve the beauty of pearl
    ornaments, they should be carefully kept from dampness. A piece
    of paper torn off and rolled up, so as to present a soft,
    ragged edge, is the best thing to cleanse them with.</p>

    <p>VARNISHING GILDED FRAMES.&mdash;It is said that
    looking-glass frames may be cleansed with a damp cloth, without
    injury, provided they are varnished with the <i>pure white
    alcoholic varnish</i>, used for transferred engravings and
    other delicate articles of fancy-work. This would save the
    trouble of covering and uncovering picture-frames with the
    change of the seasons. I never heard how many coats of varnish
    were necessary, but I should think it would be safe to put on
    more than one.</p>

    <p>COLOGNE WATER.&mdash;One pint of alcohol, sixty drops of
    lavender, sixty drops of bergamot, sixty drops of essence of
    lemon, sixty drops of orange water. To be corked up, and well
    shaken. It is better for considerable age.</p>

    <p>GREASE SPOTS.&mdash;Magnesia rubbed upon the spot, covered
    with clean paper, and a warm iron placed above, will usually
    draw out grease. Where a considerable quantity of oil has been
    spilled, it will be necessary to repeat the operation a great
    many times, in order to extract it all.</p>

    <p>RECEIPT FOR MAKING EXCELLENT BREAD WITHOUT
    YEAST.&mdash;Scald about two handsful of Indian meal, into
    which put a little salt, and as much cold water as will make it
    rather warmer than <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>{118}</span> new milk; then stir in wheat
       flour, till it is as thick as a family pudding, and set it
       down by the fire to rise. In about half an hour, it
       generally grows thin; you may sprinkle a little fresh flour
       on the top, and mind to turn the pot round, that it may not
       bake to the side of it. In three or four hours, if you mind
       the above directions, it will rise and ferment as if you had
       set it with hop yeast; when it does, make it up in soft
       dough, flour a pan, put in your bread, set it before the
       fire, covered up, turn it round to make it equally warm, and
       in about half an hour it will be light enough to bake. It
       suits best to bake in a Dutch oven, as it should be put into
       the oven as soon as it is light.</p>

    <p>RICE JELLY.&mdash;Boil a quarter of a pound of rice flour
    with half a pound of loaf sugar, in a quart of water, till the
    whole becomes one glutinous mass, then strain off the jelly and
    let it stand to cool. This food is very nourishing and
    beneficial to invalids.</p>

    <p>APPLE MARMALADE.&mdash;Scald apples till they will pulp from
    the core; take an equal weight of sugar in large lumps, and
    boil it in just water enough to dip the lumps well, until it
    can be skimmed, and is a thick syrup; mix this with the apple
    pulp, and simmer it on a quick fire for fifteen minutes. Keep
    it in pots covered with paper dipped in brandy.</p>

    <p>QUINCE MARMALADE.&mdash;To two pounds of quince put three
    quarters of a pound of nice sugar, and a pint of spring water.
    Boil them till they are tender; then take them up and bruise
    them; again put them in the liquor, and let them boil three
    quarters of an hour, then put it into jars, covered as
    mentioned above. Those who like things very sweet put an equal
    quantity of quince and sugar; but I think the flavor is less
    delicious.</p>

    <p>RASPBERRY JAM.&mdash;Take an equal quantity of fruit and
    sugar. Put the raspberries into a pan, boil and stir them
    constantly till juicy and well broken; add as much sugar, boil
    and skim it till it is reduced to a fine jam. Put it away in
    the same manner as other preserves.</p>

    <p>BLANC-MANGER.&mdash;Boil two ounces of isinglass in one pint
    and a half of new milk; strain it into one pint of thick cream.
    Sweeten it to your taste, add one cup of rose-water, boil it up
    once, let it settle, and put it in your moulds.</p>

    <p>Some prefer to boil two ounces of isinglass in three and a
    half pints of water for half an hour, then strain it to one
    pint and a half of cream, sweeten it, add a teacup of
    rose-water, and boil up once.</p>

    <p>Isinglass is the most expensive ingredient in blanc-manger.
    Some decidedly prefer the jelly of calves' feet. The jelly is
    obtained by boiling four feet in a gallon of water till reduced
    to a quart, strained, cooled, and skimmed. A pint of jelly to a
    pint <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>{119}</span> of cream; in other respects
       done the same as isinglass blanc-manger. Some boil a stick
       of cinnamon, or a grated lemon-peel, in the jelly. The
       moulds should be made thoroughly clean, and wet with cold
       water; the white of an egg, dropped in and shook round the
       moulds, will make it come out smooth and handsomely.</p>

    <p>PORK JELLY.&mdash;Some people like the jelly obtained from a
    boiled hand of pork, or the feet of pork, prepared in the same
    way as calf's-foot jelly; for which see page
    <a href="#page31">31</a>.</p>

    <p>The cloths, or jelly-bags, through which jelly is strained,
    should be first wet to prevent waste.</p>

    <p>CRANBERRY JELLY.&mdash;Mix isinglass jelly, or calf's-foot
    jelly, with a double quantity of cranberry juice, sweeten it
    with fine loaf sugar, boil it up once, and strain it to
    cool.</p>

    <p>RICH CUSTARDS.&mdash;Boil a pint of milk with lemon-peel and
    a stick of cinnamon. While it is boiling, beat up the yolks of
    five eggs with a pint of cream. When the milk tastes of the
    spice, pour it to the cream, stirring well; sweeten it to
    taste. Give the custard a simmer, till of a proper thickness,
    but do not let it boil. Stir the whole time one way. Season it
    with a little rose-water, and a few spoonsful of wine or
    brandy, as you may prefer. When put into cups, grate on
    nutmeg.</p>

    <p>TO PRESERVE PEACHES.&mdash;Scald peaches in boiling water,
    but do not let them boil; take them out and put them in cold
    water, then dry them in a sieve, and put them in long,
    wide-mouthed bottles. To a half dozen peaches put a quarter of
    a pound of clarified sugar; pour it over the peaches, fill up
    the bottles with brandy, and stop them close.</p>

    <p>COCOA-NUT CAKES.&mdash;Grate the meat of two cocoa-nuts,
    after pealing off the dark skin; allow an equal weight of loaf
    sugar, pounded and sifted, and the rind and juice of two
    lemons. Mix the ingredients well; make into cakes about as big
    as a nutmeg, with a little piece of citron in each. Bake them
    on buttered tin sheets about twenty minutes, in a moderately
    hot oven.</p>

    <p>*TO CLARIFY SUGAR.&mdash;Put half a pint of water to a pound
    of sugar; whip up the white of an egg and stir it in, and put
    it over the fire. When it first boils up, check it with a
    little cold water; the second time set it away to cool. In a
    quarter of an hour, skim the top, and turn the syrup off
    quickly, so as to leave the sediment which will collect at the
    bottom.</p>

    <p>*RICH WEDDING CAKE.&mdash;One pound three quarters of flour,
    one pound one quarter of butter, do. of sugar, one dozen eggs,
    two pounds of currants, one gill of wine, half a gill of
    brandy, one pound <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>{120}</span> of citron, cut in slices, a
       wine-glass of rose-water, three quarters of an ounce of
       nutmeg, quarter of an ounce of cloves, the same of allspice.
       The rind of two lemons grated in. See page
       <a href="#page72">72</a> for baking.</p>

    <p>STILL RICHER WEDDING CAKE.&mdash;Three pounds of flour,
    three pounds of butter, three pounds of sugar, twenty-eight
    eggs, six pounds of currants, and six pounds of seeded raisins;
    one ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of nutmeg, three quarters of
    an ounce of cloves, half an ounce of mace, one pound of citron,
    two glasses of brandy, two glasses of rose-water, and one glass
    of wine. For baking, see page <a href="#page72">72</a>.</p>

    <p>*FROSTING FOR CAKE.&mdash;It is a great improvement to
    squeeze a little lemon-juice into the egg and sugar prepared
    for frosting. It gives a fine flavor, and makes it extremely
    white. For frosting, see directions, page
    <a href="#page72">72</a>.</p>

    <p>WHIP SYLLABUB.&mdash;One pint of cream, one pint of wine,
    the juice and grated peel of a lemon, and the white of two
    eggs; sweeten it to your taste, put it into a deep vessel, and
    whip it to a light froth. Fill your glasses with the froth as
    it rises. It is a good plan to put some of the froth in a
    sieve, over a dish, and have it in readiness to heap upon the
    top of your glasses after you have filled them. Some people put
    a spoonful of marmalade or jelly at the bottom of the glasses,
    before they are filled.</p>

    <p>LOBSTER SALAD.&mdash;The meat of one lobster is extracted
    from the shell, and cut up fine. Have fresh hard lettuce cut up
    very fine; mix it with the lobster. Make a dressing, in a deep
    plate, of the yolks of four eggs cut up, a gill of sweet oil, a
    gill of vinegar, half a gill of mustard, half a teaspoonful of
    cayenne, half a teaspoonful of salt; all mixed well together.
    To be prepared just before eaten. Chicken salad is prepared in
    the same way, only chicken is used instead of lobster, and
    celery instead of lettuce.</p>

    <p>ESCALOPED OYSTERS.&mdash;Put crumbled bread around the sides
    and bottom of a buttered dish. Put oysters in a skillet, and
    let the heat just strike them through; then take them out of
    the shells, and rinse them thoroughly in the water they have
    stewed in. Put half of them on the layer of crumbled bread, and
    season with mace and pepper; cover them with crumbs of bread
    and bits of butter; put in the rest of the oysters, season and
    cover them in the same way. Strain their liquor, and pour over.
    If you fear they will be too salt, put fresh water instead.
    Bake fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

    <p>FRIED OYSTERS.&mdash;After they are prepared from the shell,
    they are dipped in batter, made of eggs and crumbs, seasoned
    with nutmeg, mace and salt, stirred up well. Fried in lard till
    brown.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>{121}</span>

    <p>VEGETABLE OYSTER.&mdash;This vegetable is something like a
    parsnip; is planted about the same time, ripens about the same
    time, and requires about the same cooking. It is said to taste
    very much like real oysters. It is cut in pieces, after being
    boiled, dipped in batter, and fried in the same way. It is
    excellent mixed with minced salt fish.</p>

    <p>PARTRIDGES should be roasted ten or fifteen minutes longer
    than chickens, that is, provided they are thick-breasted and
    plump. Being naturally dry, they should be plentifully basted
    with butter.</p>

    <h3>EXTRACTS FROM THE <i>ENGLISH</i> FRUGAL HOUSEWIFE.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[It was the intention of the author of the
        <i>American</i> Frugal Housewife, to have given an Appendix
        from the <i>English</i> Frugal Housewife; but upon
        examination, she found the book so little fitted to the
        wants of this country, that she has been able to extract
        but little.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>CHEESE is to be chosen by its moist, smooth coat; if old
    cheese be rough-coated, ragged, or dry at top, beware of worms.
    If it be over-full of holes, moist and spongy, it is subject to
    maggots. If soft or perished places appear, try how deep they
    go, for the worst part may be hidden.</p>

    <p>EGGS.&mdash;To prove whether they are good or bad, hold the
    large end of the egg to your tongue; if it feels warm, it is
    new; but if cold, it is bad. In proportion to the heat or cold,
    is the goodness of the egg. Another way to know is to put the
    egg in a pan of cold water; the fresher the egg, the sooner it
    will fall to the bottom; if rotten, it will swim. If you keep
    your eggs in ashes, salt or bran, put the small end downwards;
    if you turn them endways once a week, they will keep some
    months.</p>

    <p>VEAL.&mdash;If the vein in the shoulder look blue or bright
    red, it is newly killed; but if black, green, or yellow, it is
    stale. The leg is known to be new by the stiffness of the
    joint. The head of a calf or a lamb is known by the eyes; if
    sunk or wrinkled, it is stale; if plump and lively, it is
    fresh.</p>

    <p>MUTTON.&mdash;If it be young, the flesh will pinch tender;
    if old, it will wrinkle and remain so. If young, the fat will
    easily part from the lean; if old, it will stick by strings and
    skins. Strong, rancid mutton feels spongy, and does not rise
    again easily, when dented. The flesh of ewe mutton is paler, of
    a closer grain, and parts more
    easily.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>{122}</span>

    <p>BEEF.&mdash;Good beef has an open grain, and a tender, oily
    smoothness; a pleasant carnation color, and clear white suet,
    betoken good meat; yellow suet is not so good.</p>

    <p>PORK.&mdash;If young, the lean will break in pinching, and
    if you nip the skin with your nails, it will make a dent; the
    fat will be soft and pulpy, like lard. If the lean be tough,
    and the fat flabby and spongy, feeling rough, it is old,
    especially if the rind be stubborn, and you cannot nip it with
    your nails. Little kernels, like nail-shot, in the fat, are a
    sign that it is measly, and dangerous to be eaten.</p>

    <h2>CARVING.</h2>

    <h4>[Written for the <i>American</i> Frugal Housewife.]</h4>

    <p>TO CARVE A TURKEY.&mdash;Fix the fork firmly on one side of
    the thin bone that rises in the centre of the breast; the fork
    should be placed <i>parallel</i> with the bone, and as close to
    it as possible. Cut the meat from the breast lengthwise, in
    slices of about half an inch in thickness. Then turn the turkey
    upon the side nearest you, and cut off the leg and the wing;
    when the knife is passed between the limbs and the body, and
    pressed outward, the joint will be easily perceived. Then turn
    the turkey on the other side, and cut off the other leg and
    wing. Separate the drum-sticks from the leg-bones, and the
    pinions from the wings; it is hardly possible to mistake the
    joint. Cut the stuffing in thin slices, lengthwise. Take off
    the neck-bones, which are two triangular bones on each side of
    the breast; this is done by passing the knife from the back
    under the blade-part of each neck-bone, until it reaches the
    end; by raising the knife, the other branch will easily crack
    off. Separate the carcass from the back by passing the knife
    lengthwise from the neck downward. Turn the back upwards, and
    lay the edge of the knife across the back-bone, about midway
    between the legs and wings; at the same moment, place the fork
    within the lower part of the turkey, and lift it up; this will
    make the back-bone crack at the knife. The croup, or lower part
    of the back, being cut off, put it on the plate, with the rump
    from you, and split off the side-bones by forcing the knife
    through from the rump to the other end.</p>

    <p>The choicest parts of a turkey are the side-bones, the
    breast, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>{123}</span> and the thigh-bones. The
       breast and wings are called light meat; the thigh-bones and
       side-bones dark meat. When a person declines expressing a
       preference, it is polite to help to both kinds.</p>

    <p>A SIRLOIN OF BEEF.&mdash;Place the curving bone downward
    upon the dish. Cut the outside lengthwise, separating <i>each
    slice</i> from the chine-bone, with the point of the knife.
    Some people cut through at the chine, slip the knife under, and
    cut the meat out in one mass, which they afterward cut in
    slices; but this is not the best, or the most proper way. The
    tender loin is on the inside; it is to be cut crosswise.</p>

    <p>A HAM.&mdash;Begin in the middle of a ham; cut across the
    bone, and take thin slices from either side.</p>

    <p>A GOOSE.&mdash;A goose is carved nearly as a turkey, only
    the breast should be cut in slices narrow and nearly square,
    instead of broad, like that of turkey; and before passing the
    knife to separate the legs and wings, the fork is to be placed
    in the small end of the leg-bone or pinion, and the part
    pressed close to the body, when the separation will be easy.
    Take off the merrythought, the neck-bones, and separate the
    leg-bones from the legs, and the pinions from the wings. The
    best parts are the breast, the thigh-bones, and the fleshy
    parts of the wings.</p>

    <p>A PIG.&mdash;If the pig be whole, cut off the head, and
    split it in halves along the back-bone. Separate the shoulders
    and legs by passing the knife under them in a circular
    direction. The best parts are the triangular piece of the neck,
    the ribs, legs and shoulders.</p>

    <p>A FILLET OF VEAL.&mdash;This is the thick part of the leg,
    and is to be cut smooth, round and close to the bone. Some
    prefer the outside piece. A little fat cut from the skirt is to
    be served to each plate.</p>

    <p>MUTTON.&mdash;A saddle of mutton is the two loins together,
    and the back-bone running down the middle to the tail. Slices
    are to be cut out parallel to the back-bone on either side.</p>

    <p>In a leg of mutton, the knife is to be entered in the thick
    fleshy part, as near the shank as will give a good slice. Cut
    towards the large end, and always to the bone.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
