<p class="title">CHRISTMAS, 1917</p>
<p>A key no thief can steal, no time can rust;</p>
<p>A faery door, adventurous and golden;</p>
<p>A palace, perfect to our eyes&mdash;Ah must</p>
<p>Our eyes be holden?</p>

<p class="stanza">  Has the past died before this present sin?</p>
<p>Has this most cruel age already ston&egrave;d</p>
<p>To martyrdom that magic Day, within</p>
<p>Those halls, enthron&egrave;d?</p>

<p class="stanza">  No. Through the dancing of the young spring rain,</p>
<p>Through the faint summer, and the autumn&rsquo;s burning,</p>
<p>Our still immortal Day has heard again</p>
<p>Our steps returning.</p>

<p class="title">THE SECRET DAY</p>

<p>My yesterday has gone, has gone and left me tired,</p>
<p>And now to-morrow comes and beats upon the door;</p>
<p>So I have built To-day, the day that I desired,</p>
<p>Lest joy come not again, lest peace return no more,</p>
<p>Lest comfort come no more.</p>

<p class="stanza">  So I have built To-day, a proud and perfect day,</p>
<p>And I have built the towers of cliffs upon the sands;</p>
<p>The foxgloves and the gorse I planted on my way;</p>
<p>The thyme, the velvet thyme, grew up beneath my hands,</p>
<p>Grew pink beneath my hands.</p>

<p class="stanza">  So I have built To-day, more precious than a dream;</p>
<p>And I have painted peace upon the sky above;</p>
<p>And I have made immense and misty seas, that seem</p>
<p>More kind to me than life, more fair to me than love&mdash;</p>
<p>More beautiful than love.</p>

<p class="stanza">  And I have built a house&mdash;a house upon the brink</p>
<p>Of high and twisted cliffs; the sea&rsquo;s low singing fills it;</p>
<p>And there my Secret Friend abides, and there I think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hide my heart away before to-morrow kills it&mdash;</p>
<p>A cold to-morrow kills it.</p>

<p class="stanza">  Yes, I have built To-day, a wall against To-morrow,</p>
<p>So let To-morrow knock&mdash;I shall not be afraid,</p>
<p>For none shall give me death, and none shall give me sorrow,</p>
<p>And none shall spoil this darling day that I have made.</p>
<p>No storm shall stir my sea. No night but mine shall shade</p>
<p>This day that I have made.</p>

<p class="title">SONG</p>

<p>There is the track my feet have worn</p>
<p>By which my fate may find me:</p>
<p>From that dim place where I was born</p>
<p>Those footprints run behind me.</p>
<p>Uncertain was the trail I left,</p>
<p>For&mdash;oh, the way was stormy;</p>
<p>But now this splendid sea has cleft</p>
<p>My journey from before me.</p>

<p class="stanza">  Three things the sea shall never end,</p>
<p>Three things shall mock its power:</p>
<p>My singing soul, my Secret Friend,</p>
<p>And this, my perfect hour.</p>
<p>And you shall seek me till you reach</p>
<p>The tangled tide advancing,</p>
<p>And you shall find upon the beach</p>
<p>The traces of my dancing,</p>
<p>And in the air the happy speech</p>
<p>Of Secret Friends romancing.</p>

<p class="title">  THE ORCHARD</p>

<p>I will repent me of my ways;</p>
<p>I will come here and bury</p>
<p>Five thousand odd superfluous days</p>
<p>Beneath a flow&rsquo;ring cherry.</p>

<p class="stanza">  Between a pear and a cherry tree</p>
<p>My temple I will enter&mdash;</p>
<p>My place, where even I may be</p>
<p>The altar and the centre.</p>

<p class="stanza">  One altar to a thousand aisles,</p>
<p>A hundred thousand arches ...</p>
<p>The loud lamb-choir about me files,</p>
<p>The bleating bishop marches,</p>

<p class="stanza">  The congregation kneels and nods,</p>
<p>The bishop leads its praises,</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll pray too, to their dim gods</p>
<p>Whose feet are decked with daisies:</p>

<p class="i4stanza"><i>Ah, let me not grow old. Ah, let</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>Me not grow old, and falter</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>In my delusion, or forget</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>My heart was once an altar. </i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>Let me still think myself a star</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>With these my rays about me; </i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>Pretend these green perspectives are</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>All purposeless without me.</i></p>

<p class="i4stanza"><i> Ah, bid the sun stand still. Ah, bid</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>The coming night retire,</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>And all the good I ever did</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>Shall feed your altar fire;</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>The hour shall stand and sing your praise,</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>The minute shall adore you,</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>And my ten thousand unborn days</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>I&rsquo;ll sacrifice before you.</i></p>

<p class="i4stanza"> <i>Gods of great joy, and little grief, </i></p>
<p class="i4"> <i>See&mdash;I will wear as token</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>A pear leaf and a cherry leaf</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>Until this pledge be broken</i>....</p>

<p class="stanza">  Between a pear and a cherry tree</p>
<p>A cold hand touched my shoulder&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4"> <i>Ah, my false gods have forsaken me,</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>I am a minute older</i>.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br /><a name="page11"></a>
<br />
<br />
<p class="title">THANKS TO MY WORLD FOR THE LOAN OF A FAIR DAY</p>

<p>That day you wrought for me</p>
<p>Shone, and was ended.</p>
<p>Perfect your thought for me,</p>
<p>Whom you befriended.</p>
<p>Such joy was new to me&mdash;</p>
<p>New, and most splendid,</p>
<p>More than was due to me.</p>
<p>More than was due to me.</p>

<p class="stanza">  Though I do wrong to you,</p>
<p>Having no power,</p>
<p>Singing no song to you,</p>
<p>Bringing no flower,</p>
<p>Yet does my youth again</p>
<p>Thrill, for the hour</p>
<p>Cometh in truth again.</p>
<p>Cometh in truth again.</p>

<p class="stanza">  I shall possess to-day</p>
<p>All I have wanted,</p>
<p>All I lacked yesterday</p>
<p>Now shall be granted.</p>
<p>No longer dumb to you,</p>
<p>Changed and enchanted,</p>
<p>Singing I&rsquo;ll come to you.</p>
<p>Singing I&rsquo;ll come to you.</p>

<p class="stanza">  I will amass for you</p>
<p>Very great treasure.</p>
<p>Swift years shall pass for you</p>
<p>Dancing for pleasure.</p>
<p>Time shall be slave to me,</p>
<p>Giving&mdash;full measure&mdash;</p>
<p>All that you gave to me.</p>
<p>All that you gave to me.</p>

<p class="title">SONG</p>
<p>If I have dared to surrender some imitation of splendour,</p>
<p>Something I knew that was tender, something I loved that was brave,</p>
<p>If in my singing I showed songs that I heard on my road,</p>
<p>Were they not debts that I owed, rather than gifts that I gave?</p>

<p class="stanza">If certain hours on their climb up the long ladder of time</p>
<p>Turned my confusion to rhyme, drove me to dare an attempt,</p>
<p>If by fair chance I might seem sometimes abreast of my theme,</p>
<p>Was I translating a dream? Was it a dream that you dreamt?</p>

<p class="stanza">High and miraculous skies bless and astonish my eyes;</p>
<p>All my dead secrets arise, all my dead stories come true.</p>
<p>Here is the Gate to the Sea. Once you unlocked it for me;</p>
<p>Now, since you gave me the key, shall I unlock it for you?</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /><a name="page15"></a>
<br />
<br />

<p class="title">WORDS</p>

<p>Oh words, oh words, and shall you rule</p>
<p>The world? What is it but the tongue</p>
<p>That doth proclaim a man a fool,</p>
<p>So that his best songs go unsung,</p>
<p>So that his dreams are sent to school</p>
<p>And all die young.</p>

<p class="stanza">There pass the trav&rsquo;lling dreams, and these</p>
<p>My soul adores&mdash;my words condemn&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh, I would fall upon my knees</p>
<p>To kiss their golden garments&rsquo; hem,</p>
<p>Yet words do lie in wait to seize</p>
<p>And murder them.</p>

<p class="stanza">To-night the swinging stars shall plumb</p>
<p>The silence of the sky. And herds</p>
<p>Of plum&egrave;d winds like huntsmen come</p>
<p>To hunt with dreams the restless birds.</p>
<p>To-night the moon shall strike you dumb,</p>
<p>Oh words, oh words....</p>

<p class="title">REDNECK&rsquo;S SONG</p>

<p>These thirty years</p>
<p>Old men have filled my ears</p>
<p>With middle-aged ideas</p>
<p>That never have been young,</p>
<p>They made me wise.</p>
<p>I learnt to whitewash lies.</p>
<p>I learnt to shut my eyes,</p>
<p>And hold my tongue.</p>

<p class="stanza">Damned Philistine.</p>
<p>And was it then so fine</p>
<p>To learn to draw the line.</p>
<p>(Is there a line to draw?)</p>
<p>And must I then</p>
<p>For threescore years and ten</p>
<p>Worship the laws of men</p>
<p>Who worshipped law?</p>

<p class="stanza">Those laws are dust</p>
<p>To-day, and yet I must</p>
<p>Be faithful still, and trust</p>
<p>In what dead men did prove.</p>
<p>Magic may kill</p>
<p>Their wisdom and their will,</p>
<p>Yet I must follow still</p>
<p>Their path ... my groove....</p>

<br />
<br />
<br /><a name="page19"></a>
<br />
<br />
<p class="title">TO THE UNBORN</p>

<p>Oh, bend your eyes, nor send your glance about.</p>
<p>Oh, watch your feet, nor stray beyond the kerb.</p>
<p>Oh, bind your heart lest it find secrets out.</p>
<p>For thus no punishment</p>
<p>Of magic shall disturb</p>
<p>Your very great content.</p>

<p class="stanza">Oh, shut your lips to words that are forbidden.</p>
<p>Oh, throw away your sword, nor think to fight.</p>
<p>Seek not the best, the best is better hidden.</p>
<p>Thus need you have no fear,</p>
<p>No terrible delight</p>
<p>Shall cross your path, my dear.</p>

<p class="stanza">Call no man foe, but never love a stranger.</p>
<p>Build up no plan, nor any star pursue.</p>
<p>Go forth with crowds; in loneliness is danger.</p>
<p>Thus nothing God can send,</p>
<p>And nothing God can do</p>
<p>Shall pierce your peace, my friend.</p>

<p class="title">THE NEWER ZION</p>

<p>When I achieve the chestnut joke of dying,</p>
<p>When I slip through that Gate at Kensal Green,</p>
<p>Shall I go spoil the fantasy by prying</p>
<p>Behind the staging of this darling scene?</p>

<p class="stanza">Shall I&mdash;a cast-off puppet&mdash;seek to study</p>
<p>The Showman who manipulates the strings,</p>
<p>The Hand that paints the western drop-scene ruddy,</p>
<p>The prosy truths of all these faery things?</p>

<p class="stanza">Shall I&mdash;self-conscious by a glassy ocean&mdash;</p>
<p>Stammer strange songs amid an alien host?</p>
<p>Or shall I not, refusing such promotion,</p>
<p>Bequeath to London my contented ghost?</p>

<p class="stanza">I will come back to my Eternal City;</p>
<p>Her fogs once more my countenance shall dim;</p>
<p>I will enliven your austere committee</p>
<p>With gossip gleaned among the cherubim.</p>

<p class="stanza">By day I&rsquo;ll tread again the sounding mazes,</p>
<p>By night I&rsquo;ll track the moths about the Park;</p>
<p>My feet shall fall among the dusky daisies,</p>
<p>Nor break nor bruise a petal in the dark.</p>

<p class="stanza">I will repeat old inexpensive orgies;</p>
<p>Drink nectar at the bun-shop in Shoreditch,</p>
<p>Or call for Nut-Ambrosia at St. George&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>And with a ghost-tip make the waitress rich.</p>

<p class="stanza">My soundless feet shall fly among the runners</p>
<p>Through the red thunders of a Zeppelin raid,</p>
<p>My still voice cheer the Anti-Aircraft gunners,</p>
<p>The fires shall glare&mdash;but I shall cast no shade.</p>

<p class="stanza">And if a Shadow, wading in the torrent</p>
<p>Of high excitement, snatch me from the riot&mdash;</p>
<p>(Fool that he is)&mdash;and fumble with his warrant,</p>
<p>And hail a hearse, and beg me to "Go quiet,"</p>

<p class="stanza">Mocking I&rsquo;ll go, and he shall be postillion,</p>
<p>Until we reach the Keeper of the Door:</p>
<p>"H&rsquo;m ... Benson ... Stella ... militant civilian ...</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some mistake, we&rsquo;ve had this soul before...."</p>

<p class="stanza">Ah, none shall keep my soul from this its Zion;</p>
<p>Lost in the spaces I shall hear and bless</p>
<p>The splendid voice of London, like a lion</p>
<p>Calling its lover in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Oh little friend of half my days,</p>
<p>My little friend, who followed me</p>

<p class="stanza">You felt the same. You understood</p>

<p>You lost yourself in puppy things.</p>

<p class="stanza">And you saw me. You bore in mind</p>
<p>The clean and sunny things I felt</p>
<p>When, throwing hate along the wind,</p>
<p>I flashed the lantern at my belt.</p>

<p class="stanza">The moment passed, and we returned</p>
<p>To barren words and old cold truth,</p>
<p>Yet in our hearts our lanterns burned,</p>
<p>We two had seen each other&rsquo;s youth.</p>

<p>We never called to mind</p>
<p>That truth is seldom kind.</p>

<p class="stanza">You promised love, immortal as a star.</p>
<p>You promised true, yet how the truth can lie!</p>
<p>For now we grope for hands where no hands are,</p>
<p>And, deathless, still we cry,</p>
<p>Nor hope for a reply.</p>

<p class="stanza">You promised harvest and a perfect yield.</p>
<p>You promised true, for on the harvest morn,</p>
<p>Behold a reaper strode across the field,</p>
<p>And man of woman born</p>
<p>Was gathered in as corn.</p>

<p class="stanza">You promised honour and ordeal by flame.</p>
<p>You promised true. In joy we trembled lest</p>
<p>We should be found unworthy when it came;</p>
<p>But&mdash;oh&mdash;we never guessed</p>
<p>The fury of the test!</p>

<p class="stanza">You promised friends and songs and festivals.</p>

<p class="title">FIVE SMOOTH STONES</p>

<p>It was young David, lord of sheep and cattle,</p>
<p>Pursued his fate, the April fields among,</p>
<p>Singing a song of solitary battle,</p>
<p>A loud mad song, for he was very young.</p>

<p class="stanza">Vivid the air&mdash;and something more than vivid,&mdash;</p>
<p>Tall clouds were in the sky&mdash;and something more,&mdash;</p>
<p>The light horizon of the spring was livid</p>
<p>With a steel smile that showed the teeth of war.</p>

<p class="stanza">It was young David mocked the Philistine.</p>
<p>It was young David laughed beside the river.</p>
<p>There came his mother&mdash;his and yours and mine&mdash;</p>
<p>With five smooth stones, and dropped them in his quiver.</p>

<p class="stanza">You never saw so green-and-gold a fairy.</p>
<p>You never saw such very April eyes.</p>
<p>She sang him sorrow&rsquo;s song to make him wary,</p>
<p>She gave him five smooth stones to make him wise.</p>

<p class="stanza"><i>The first stone is love, and that shall fail you.</i></p>
<p><i>The second stone is hate, and that shall fail you.</i></p>
<p><i>The third stone is knowledge, and that shall fail you.</i></p>
<p><i>The fourth stone is prayer, and that shall fail you.</i></p>
<p><i>The fifth stone shall not fail you</i>.</p>

<p class="stanza">For what is love, O lovers of my tribe?</p>
<p>And what is love, O women of my day?</p>
<p>Love is a farthing piece, a bloody bribe</p>
<p>Pressed in the palm of God&mdash;and thrown away.</p>

<p class="stanza">And what is hate, O fierce and unforgiving?</p>
<p>And what shall hate achieve, when all is said?</p>
<p>A silly joke that cannot reach the living,</p>
<p>A spitting in the faces of the dead.</p>

<p class="stanza">And what is knowledge, O young men who tasted</p>
<p>The reddest fruit on that forbidden tree?</p>
<p>Knowledge is but a painful effort wasted,</p>
<p>A bitter drowning in a bitter sea.</p>

<p class="stanza">And what is prayer, O waiters for the answer?</p>
<p>And what is prayer, O seekers of the cause?</p>
<p>Prayer is the weary soul of Herod&rsquo;s dancer,</p>
<p>Dancing before blind kings without applause.</p>

<p class="stanza">The fifth stone is a magic stone, my David,</p>
<p>Made up of fear and failure, lies and loss.</p>
<p>Its heart is lead, and on its face is grav&egrave;d</p>
<p>A crook&egrave;d cross, my son, a crook&egrave;d cross.</p>

<p class="stanza">It has no dignity to lend it value;</p>
<p>No purity&mdash;alas, it bears a stain.</p>
<p>You shall not give it gratitude, nor shall you</p>
<p>Recall it all your days, except with pain.</p>

<p class="stanza">Oh, bless your blindness, glory in your groping!</p>
<p>Mock at your betters with an upward chin!</p>
<p>And when the moment has gone by for hoping,</p>
<p>Sling your fifth stone, O son of mine, and win.</p>

<p class="stanza">Grief do I give you, grief and dreadful laughter;</p>
<p>Sackcloth for banner, ashes in your wine.</p>
<p>Go forth, go forth, nor ask me what comes after;</p>
<p>The fifth stone shall not fail you, son of mine.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Go forth, go forth, and slay the Philistine.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
