<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I
<br>
AUNT JANE'S OLD TOYS</h2>
<br>
<p>It was beginning to get dark in the big nursery. Outside the wind
howled and the rain beat steadily against the window-pane. Rudolf and
Ann sat as close to the fire as they could get, waiting for Betsy to
bring the lamp. Peter had built himself a comfortable den beneath the
table and was having a quiet game of Bears with Mittens, the cat, for
his cub&#8212;quiet, that is, except for an angry mew now and then from
Mittens, who had not enjoyed an easy moment since the arrival of the
three children that morning.</p>
<p>"Rudolf," Ann was saying, as she looked uneasily over her shoulder,
"I almost wish we hadn't come to stay at Aunt Jane's alone without
mother. I don't believe I like this room, it's so big and creepy. I
don't want to go to bed. Especially"&#8212;she added, turning about and
pointing into the shadows behind her&#8212;"especially I don't want to go
to bed in that!"</p>
<p>The big bed in Aunt Jane's old nursery was the biggest and queerest
the children had ever seen. It was the very opposite of the little
white enameled beds they were used to sleeping in at their apartment
in New York, being a great old-fashioned four-poster with a canopy
almost touching the ceiling. It was hung with faded chintz, and
instead of a mattress it had a billowy feather bed over which were
tucked grandmother's hand-spun sheets and blankets covered by the
gayest of quilts in an elaborate pattern of sprigged and spotted
calico patches. The two front posts of the bed were of dark shiny
wood carved in a strange design of twisted leaves and branches, and to
Ann, as she looked at them by the leaping flickering firelight, it
seemed as if from between these leaves and branches odd little faces
peered and winked at her, vanished, and came again and yet again.</p>
<p>"Bother!" exclaimed Rudolf so loud that his little sister started.
"It's just a bed, that's all. It'll be jolly fun getting into it. I
believe I'll ask if I can't sleep there, too, instead of in the cot. I
wanted to take a running jump at it when we first came this morning,
but Aunt Jane wouldn't let me with my boots on. She said she made that
quilt herself, when she was a little girl. We'll all climb in together
to-night as soon as Betsy goes, and have a game of something&#8212;I dare
say we'll feel just like raisins in a pudding!"</p>
<p>"All the same," said Ann, "I don't think I like it, Rudolf. I wish
Betsy would bring the lamp!"</p>
<p>It was almost dark now, and they could not see, but only hear, Peter
as he came shuffling out of his den, dragging his unhappy cub, and
prowled around the darkest corners of the room. Being a bear, he was
not at all afraid, but made himself very happy for a while with
pouncing and growling, searching for honey, and eating imaginary
travelers. Then the cub escaped, and Peter tired of his game. Rudolf
and Ann heard him tugging at the door of an old-fashioned cupboard in
a far corner of the room, and presently he came over to the fire,
carrying a wooden box in his arms.</p>
<p>"Oh, Peter, you naughty boy!" cried Ann. "You've been at the
cupboard,
and Aunt Jane said expressly we were not to take anything out of it!"</p>
<p>"You are just like Bluebeard's wife," began Rudolf, but Peter&#8212;as was
his way&#8212;paid no attention to either of them. He put the box down on
the hearth-rug, and got on his hands and knees to open it. Then, of
course, the other two thought they might as well see what there was to
see, and all three heads bent over the box. After all it contained
nothing very wonderful, the cover itself being the prettiest part, Ann
thought, for on it was painted a bright-colored picture of a little
girl in a funny, high-waisted, old-fashioned dress, making a curtsy to
a little boy dressed like an old gentleman and carrying a toy ship in
his hand. The box was filled with old toys, most of them chipped or
broken. There was a very small tea-set with at least half of the cups
missing, a wooden horse which only possessed three legs, and the
remains of a regiment of battered tin soldiers.</p>
<p>"How funny the box smells&#8212;and the toys, too!" Ann said. "Sort of
queer and yet sweet, like mother's glove case. I think she said it was
sandal-wood. That set must have been a darling when it was new, but
there's only just a speck of blue left and the gilt is every bit gone.
These must be Aunt Jane's toys that she had when she was little."</p>
<p>"That was a long time ago," remarked Rudolf thoughtfully. "I don't
see
why Aunt Jane didn't throw 'em away, they're awful trash, I think.
Those soldiers aren't bad, but&#8212;"</p>
<p>Just then Ann's sharp eyes caught Peter as he was about to slip away
with a little parcel done up in silver paper that had lain all by
itself at the very bottom of the box. By this time she and Rudolf had
both forgotten that they had no more right than Peter to any of the
things in the box, and both threw themselves on their little brother.
Peter fought and kicked, but was at last forced to surrender the
little parcel. Under the silver paper which Rudolf hurriedly tore
off, was layer after layer of pink tissue infolding something which
the boy, when he came to it at last, tossed on the floor in his
disgust.</p>
<p>"Pshaw," he exclaimed, "it's nothing in the world but an old
corn-cob!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is, too," said Ann, picking it up. "It's a doll, the
funniest
old doll I ever saw!"</p>
<p>And a strange little doll she was, made out of nothing more or less
than a withered corn-cob, her face&#8212;such a queer little face&#8212;painted
on it, and her hair and dress made very cleverly out of the corn
shucks. Ann burst out laughing as she looked at the old doll, and
turning to her new children, Marie-Louise and Angelina-Elfrida, which
her mother had given her for Christmas, she placed the two beauties on
the hearth-rug, one on each side of the corn-cob, just to see the
difference. This seemed to make Peter very cross. He tried his best
to snatch away the old doll, but Rudolf, to tease him, held him off
with one hand while with the other he seized the poor creature by her
long braids and swung her slowly over the fire.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be fun, Ann," said he, "to see how quick she'd burn?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you mustn't, Rudolf," Ann cried, "Aunt Jane mightn't like it. I
shouldn't be surprised if she'd punish you."</p>
<p>At that Rudolf lowered the old doll almost into the blaze, and she
would most certainly have burned up, she was so very dry and crackly,
if at that very moment Aunt Jane had not come into the room and
snatched her out of his hand. Rudolf never remembered to have seen
Aunt Jane so vexed before. Her blue eyes flashed, and her cheeks were
quite pink under her silver-colored hair. He expected she would
scold, but she didn't, she only said&#8212;"Oh, Rudolf!" in a rather
unpleasant way, and then, after she had carefully restored the
corn-cob doll to her wrappings, she knelt down and began to gather up
the old toys which the children had scattered over the hearth-rug. Ann
and Rudolf helped her, and Peter who, though a very mischievous little
boy, was always honest, confessed that he had been the one to open the
old cupboard and take out the box. He seemed to feel rather
uncomfortable about it, and after the things had been put away, he
climbed upon Aunt Jane's lap and hid his head upon her shoulder.
"Never mind, Peter, dear," she said, holding him very tight, "I always
meant to show you my old toys some day. I dare say you children think
it strange that I have kept such shabby things so long, but when I was
a little girl I did not have such beautiful toys as you have now, and
the few I had I loved very dearly."</p>
<p>"Was this your nursery, Aunt Jane," Ann asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear. I slept all alone in the big bed, and I kept my toys
always in the old cupboard. I spent many and many an hour curled up on
that window-seat, playing with my doll. Yes, I did have others, Ann,
but I think I loved the corn-cob doll best of all, perhaps because she
was the least beautiful."</p>
<p>"Didn't you have any little boys to play with?" Rudolf asked. "Other
boys beside father and Uncle Jim, I mean."</p>
<p>"There was one little boy who came sometimes," Aunt Jane said. "He
lived in the nearest house to ours, though that was a mile away. Those
were his tin soldiers you saw in the box. He gave them to me to keep
for him when he went away to school, and thought himself too big to
play at soldiers any more."</p>
<p>"And when he came back from school, did he used to come and see you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he used to come every summer till he got big."</p>
<p>"And what did the little boy do when he got big, Aunt Jane?"</p>
<p>"When he got big," said Aunt Jane slowly, looking very hard into the
fire, "he went away to sea."</p>
<p>"O-ho!" cried Rudolf. "And when he came back what did he bring you?"</p>
<p>"He never did come back," said Aunt Jane, and she bent her head low
over Peter's so that the children should not see how shiny wet her
eyes were. Ann and Rudolf did see, however, and politely forced back
the dozen questions trembling on the tips of their tongues about the
different ways there were of being lost at sea. Rudolf in particular
would have liked to know whether it was a hurricane or sharks or
pirates or a nice desert island that had been the end of that little
boy, and he was about to begin his questioning in a roundabout manner
by asking whether sea serpents had often been known to swallow ships
whole, when the door opened, and in came Betsy, Aunt Jane's old
servant. She had the lamp in one hand and the great brass warming-pan,
with which she always warmed the big bed, in the other.</p>
<p>Her arrival disturbed the pleasant group by the nursery fire, and
reminded Aunt Jane that it was the children's bedtime. She kissed them
good night, heard them say their prayers, and then went quickly away,
leaving Betsy to help them undress. Now this was rather unwise of Aunt
Jane, for Betsy and the children did not get on. She was one of those
uncomfortable persons who refuse to understand how a little
conversation makes undressing so much less unpleasant. She was not
inclined to give Rudolf any information on the subject of sea
serpents, nor would she listen to Ann's remarks on how much more
fashionable hot-water bottles were than warming-pans. She had even no
sympathy for Peter when he wished to be considered a diver going down
to the bottom of the sea after gold, instead of a little boy being
bathed in a tin tub.</p>
<p>Betsy had a horrid way of scrubbing, being none too careful about
soap
in people's eyes, and Peter came out dreadfully clean. Feeling that he
needed comforting of some sort, he looked about for Mittens and
discovered him at last, taking a much needed nap behind the sofa.
Squeezing the weary cat carefully under one arm, Peter began to climb
by the aid of a chair into the big bed. Betsy caught sight of him and
guessed his plan. Poor little Peter's hopes were dashed.</p>
<p>"No you don't, Master Peter," she snapped at him. "Ye don't take no
cats to bed with ye&#8212;not in this house!" And she grabbed Mittens away
very roughly, set him outside the door, and shut it with a bang. After
she had tucked the bedclothes firmly about the little boy, she turned
her attention to Rudolf and Ann, evidently thinking Peter was settled
for the night&#8212;which shows just how much Betsy knew about him. Peter
waited patiently till she was in the depths of an argument with Rudolf
who was trying vainly to make her understand that the dirt upon his
face was merely the effect of his dark complexion. Then Peter slipped
out of bed, darted out of the door, and returned in a moment or two
with the unhappy Mittens once more a prisoner beneath his arm. This
time he managed to conceal the cat from Betsy's sharp eyes.</p>
<p>At last all three children were in the big bed, Rudolf having
refused
to consider sleeping in the cot, and Betsy, after a gruff good night,
departed, carrying the lamp with her. Now that the room was in
darkness except for the flickering light of the dying fire, Ann's
fears began to come back to her. She sat up in bed and peered round
her into the dark corners.</p>
<p>"I&#8212;I wish Betsy had left the light," she said. "But it would have
been no use asking her."</p>
<p>"Not a scrap," said Rudolf. "Not that <i>I</i> mind the dark," he
added
hastily, "<i>I</i> rather like it, only don't let's lie still
and&#8212;and&#8212;listen for things. Let's play something."</p>
<p>"Shall we try who can keep their eyes shut longest," suggested Ann.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a stupid game! Beside Peter would beat anyway, for he's
half asleep now. Shake him up, Ann."</p>
<p>When shaken up Peter refused to admit that, he was even sleepy. He
was
very cross, and immediately began to accuse Rudolf of having taken his
cat. This Rudolf&#8212;and also Ann&#8212;denied. They had seen Peter smuggle
Mittens into bed the second time, but had supposed he must have
escaped and followed Betsy out.</p>
<p>"No, he didn't neither," Peter insisted. "I had him after she went.
He
was 'most tamed."</p>
<p>"Then," said Ann, "he must be in the room and we might as well have
him to play with. Rudolf, I dare you to get up and look for him!"</p>
<p>And Rudolf got up&#8212;just to show he was not afraid. Before stepping
into those dark shadows, however, he armed himself with his tin
sword, a weapon he was in the habit of taking to bed with him in case
of burglars, and with this he poked bravely under the bed and in all
the dark corners, calling and coaxing Mittens to come forth. At last
both he and Ann felt sure the cat could not be in the room.</p>
<p>"He <i>must</i> have got out somehow," said Rudolf. "Anyway, I
sha'n't
bother any more looking for him." Still grasping his sword, he climbed
back into the big bed between his brother and sister. Peter was still
cross and grumbly. He kept insisting that Mittens might have
disappeared <i>inside</i> the bed&#8212;which was a piece of nonsense
neither of
the others would listen to.</p>
<p>After some discussion Rudolf and Ann agreed that the very nicest
thing
to do would be to make a tent out of the bedclothes, and seeing Peter
was again inclined to nod, they shook him awake and sternly insisted
on his joining in the game. By tying the two upper corners of the
covers to the posts at the head of the great bed a splendid tent was
quickly made, bigger than any the children had ever played in before,
so big that Rudolf, who was to lead the procession into its white
depths, began to feel just the least little bit afraid,&#8212;of what he
hardly knew. How high the white walls rose! Not like a snuggly
bed-tent, but like&#8212;like a real white-walled cave. Being a brave boy,
he quickly put these unpleasant thoughts out of his mind, and grasping
his sword, crawled on his hands and knees into the dark opening.
Behind him came Ann, and behind Ann, Peter.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" asked Rudolf. "Then in we go!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II
<br>
THE ANGRY WARMING-PAN</h2>
<br>
<p>It was not surprising that the big bed should be different from any
other bed the children had ever played in, yet it was certainly taking
them a long, long time to crawl to the foot!</p>
<p>"It must have a foot," thought the brave captain of the band, as he
plunged farther and farther into the depths of the white cave. "All
beds have." Then he stopped suddenly as a loud squeal of mingled
surprise and terror came from just behind him.</p>
<p>"Oh, Rudolf," Ann cried, "I don't want to play this game any
longer&#8212;let's go back!" In the half-darkness Rudolf felt her turn
round on Peter, who was close behind her. "Go back, Peter," she
ordered.</p>
<p>"I can't," came a little voice out of the gloom.</p>
<p>"You must&#8212;oh, Peter, hurry!"</p>
<p>"I can't go back," said Peter calmly, "because there isn't any back.
Put your hand behind me and feel."</p>
<p>It was true. Just how or when it had happened none of them could
tell,
but the soft drooping bedcovers had suddenly, mysteriously risen and
spread into firm white walls behind and on either side, leaving only a
narrow passageway open in front. It was nonsense to go on their hands
and knees any longer, for even Rudolf, who was tallest, could not
touch the arched white roof when he stood up and stretched his arm
above his head. He could not see Ann's face clearly, but he could hear
her beginning to sniff.</p>
<p>"Now, Ann," said he sternly, though in rather a weak voice, "don't
you
know what this is? This is an adventure."</p>
<p>"I don't care," sniffed Ann, "I don't want an adventure. I want to
go
back&#8212;back to Aunt Jane!" And the sniff developed into a flood of
tears.</p>
<p>"Peter is not crying, and he is only six."</p>
<p>This rebuke told on Ann, for she was almost eight. "But what are we
go&#8212;going to do?" she asked, her sobs decreasing into sniffs again.</p>
<p>"We'll just have to go on, I suppose, and see what happens."</p>
<p>"Well, I think&#8212;I think Aunt Jane ought to be ashamed of herself to
put us in such a big bed we could get lost in it!"</p>
<p>"Maybe"&#8212;came the voice of Peter cheerfully from behind them&#8212;"maybe
she <i>wanted</i> to lose us, like bad people does kittens."</p>
<p>"Peter, don't be silly," ordered Rudolf sternly. "There isn't really
anything that can happen to us," he went on, speaking slowly and
thoughtfully, "because we all know that we really are in bed. We know
we didn't get <i>out</i>, so of course we must be <i>in</i>."</p>
<p>This was good sense, yet somehow it was not so comforting as it
ought
to have been, not even to Rudolf himself who now began to be troubled
by a disagreeable kind of lump in his throat. Luckily he remembered,
in time to save himself from the disgrace of tears, how his father had
once told him that whistling was an excellent remedy for boys who did
not feel quite happy in their minds. He began to whistle now, a poor,
weak, little whistle at first, but growing stronger as he began to
feel more cheerful. Grasping his sword, he started ahead, calling to
the others to follow him.</p>
<p>The white passage was so narrow that the children had to walk along
it
one behind another in Indian file. The floor was no longer soft and
yielding but firm and hard under their feet, and by stretching out
their hands they could almost touch the smooth white walls on either
side of them. At first the way was perfectly straight ahead, but after
they had walked what seemed to them a long, long time, the passage
curved sharply and widened a little. The children noticed, much to
their relief, that it was growing lighter around them.</p>
<p>"I'm getting tired," Ann announced at last. "See, Ruddy, there is a
nice flat black rock. Let's sit down and rest on it."</p>
<p>There was room for them all on the large flat rock, and when they
were
settled on it, Peter remarked: "I'm hungry!" Now this was a thing
Peter was used to saying at all times and on all occasions, so it was
just like him to bring it out now as cheerfully and confidently as if
Betsy had been at his elbow with a plate of bread and butter.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," Ann exclaimed, "what a long, long while it seems since
we
had our tea! I suppose it will soon be time to think about starving."
And she took her little handkerchief out of the pocket of her nighty
and began to wipe her eyes with it.</p>
<p>"Not yet," said Rudolf hastily. "I put some candy into my pajamas
pocket when I went to bed, because the time I like to eat it best is
just before breakfast&#8212;if people only wouldn't row so about my doing
it. Let me see&#8212;it was two chocolate mice I had&#8212;I hope they didn't
get squashed when we were playing! No, here they are." The chocolate
mice were a little the worse for wear, in fact there were white
streaks on them where the chocolate had rubbed off on the inside of
Rudolf's pocket, but the children didn't mind that. They thought they
had never seen anything that looked more delicious.</p>
<p>"I will cut them in three pieces with my sword," said Rudolf. "You
may
have the heads, Ann, and me the middle parts, and Peter the tails
because he is the youngest."</p>
<p>This arrangement did not suit Peter. "I will <i>not</i> eat the
tails," he
screamed, kicking his heels angrily against the rock,&#8212;"the tails is
made out of nassy old string!" And, I am sorry to say, Peter made a
snatch at both chocolate mice and knocked them out of Rudolf's hand.
This, of course, made it necessary for Rudolf to box Peter's ears, and
a tussle quickly followed, in the middle of which something dreadful
happened. The large flat rock they were sitting on gave several queer
shakes and heaves and then suddenly rose right up under the three
children and threw them head over heels into the air. They were not a
bit hurt, but they were very, very much surprised when they scrambled
to their feet and saw the rock erect on a long kind of tail it had,
glaring at them out of one red angry eye.</p>
<p>Ann was the first to recognize it. "Oh, oh," she cried, "it's not a
rock at all&#8212;it's Betsy's Warming-pan!"</p>
<p>The Pan, giving a deep throaty kind of growl, began to shuffle
toward
them. "I'd like to have the warming of <i>you</i> three," he snarled.
"I'll
teach you to come sitting on top of me playing your tricks on my
rheumatic bones&#8212;waking me out of the first good nap I've had in
weeks!--I'll fix you&#8212;"</p>
<p>"We're really very sorry," Ann began. "We didn't mean to sit on you,
we thought&#8212;"</p>
<p>But the Warming-pan did not want to hear what Ann thought. He turned
round on her fiercely. "<i>You're</i> the young person," he snapped,
"who
made the polite remarks about my figure this evening? Eh, didn't you?
Can you deny it? Called me old-fashioned and 'country'&#8212;said nobody
ever used <i>me</i> any more!--I'll teach you to talk about hot-water
bottles when <i>I'm</i> through with you!" As he spoke he came closer
and
closer to Ann, snorting and puffing and glaring at her out of his one
terrible eye. Although he was so round and waddled so clumsily,
dragging his long tail behind him, his appearance was quite dreadful.
He reminded Rudolf of the dragon in Peter's picture-book, and he
hastily tried to imagine how Saint George must have felt when
defending his princess. Clutching his sword, he thrust himself in
front of Ann and bravely faced the Warming-pan. "Run!" he called to
the others, "Fly!--and I will fight this monster to the death."</p>
<p>Ann, dragging Peter by the hand, made off as fast as she could go,
and
the Pan tried his best to dodge Rudolf and rush after her. Again and
again Rudolf's sword struck him, but it only rattled on his
brassiness, and making a horrible face, he popped three live coals out
of his mouth which rolled on the ground unpleasantly close to Rudolf's
bare toes. Then they had it hot and heavy until at last the knight
managed to get his blade entangled with the dragon's long tail, and
tripped the creature up. Then, without waiting for his enemy to get
himself together again and heartily tired of playing Saint George,
Rudolf turned and ran after Ann and Peter. Long before he caught up to
them, however, he heard the Pan behind him, snorting and scolding.
Luckily it did not seem able to stop talking, so that it lost what
little breath it had and was soon obliged to halt. For some time
Rudolf caught snatches of its unpleasant remarks, such as&#8212;"Children
nowadays&#8212;wish he had 'em&#8212;he'd show 'em&#8212;bread and water&#8212;good thick
stick!--" Rudolf was obliged to run with his fingers in his ears
before that disagreeable voice died away in the distance.</p>
<p>At last he saw Peter and Ann waiting for him at a turn in the
passage
just ahead, and in another moment he flung himself panting on the
ground beside them. "What a beast he was!" Rudolf exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Dreadful!" said Ann. "I shall tell Aunt Jane never, never to let
Betsy put him in our bed again." And then, after she had thanked
Rudolf very prettily for saving her life, and that hero had recovered
his breath and rested a little after the excitement of the battle,
they all felt ready to start on their way again.</p>
<p>No sooner had they turned the corner ahead of them than they found
themselves in broad daylight. The passage was now so wide that all
three could walk abreast, holding hands; a moment more and they stood
at the mouth of the long white cave or tunnel they had been walking
through. There was open country beyond them, and just opposite to
where the children stood was the queerest little house that they had
ever seen. It was long and very low, hardly more than one story high,
and was painted blue and white in stripes running lengthwise. In the
middle was a little front door with a window on either side of it and
three square blue and white striped steps leading up to it. From the
chimney a trail of thick white smoke poured out. As the three children
stood staring at the house, Peter cried out: "It's snowing!"</p>
<p>Sure enough the air was full of thick white flakes.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, oh, dear!" Ann wailed, "what shall we do now? We can't go
back in the cave because the Warming-pan might catch us, and if we
stay here Peter will catch his death of cold out in the snow in his
night drawers&#8212;and so will we all. Oh, what <i>would</i> mother say!"</p>
<p>"But we are not out in the snow, Ann," began Rudolf in his arguing
voice. "We are <i>in</i> in the snow."</p>
<p>"And it is not wet," added Peter who was trying to roll a snowball
out
of the white flakes that were piling themselves on the ground with
amazing quickness.</p>
<p>"I don't care," said Ann. "I know mother wouldn't like us to be in
in
it or out in it. I'm going to knock at the door of that house this
minute and ask if they won't let us stay there till the storm's over."</p>
<p>"All right," said Rudolf, "only I hope the people who live there
don't
happen to be any relation of the Warming-pan."</p>
<p>It was a dreadful thought. The three children looked at the house
and
hesitated. Then Rudolf laughed, drew his precious sword, which he had
fastened into the belt of his pajamas, and mounted the steps, the
others following behind him.</p>
<p>"You be all ready to run," he whispered, "if you don't like the
looks
of the person who comes. Now!" And he knocked long and loud upon the
blue and white striped door.</p>

<br>
A VISIT TO THE GOOSE</h2>
<br>
<p>The door flew open almost before Rudolf had stopped knocking, but
there was nothing very alarming about the person who stood on the
threshold. Ann said afterward she had thought at first it was a Miss
Spriggins who came sometimes to sew for her mother, but it was not; it
was only a very large gray goose neatly dressed in blue and white
bed-ticking, with a large white apron tied round her waist and wearing
big spectacles with black rims to them.</p>
<p>"Nothing to-day, thank you," said the Goose.</p>
<p>"But please&#8212;" began Rudolf.</p>
<p>"No soap, no baking powder, no lightning rods, no hearth-brooms, no
cake tins, no life insurance&#8212;" rattled the Goose so rapidly that the
children could hardly understand her&#8212;"nothing at all to-day, <i>thank</i>
you!"</p>
<p>"But <i>we</i> want something," Ann cried, "we want to come in!"</p>
<p>"I never let in peddlers," said the Goose, and she slammed the door
in
their faces. As she slammed it one of her broad apron-strings caught
in the crack, and Rudolf seized the end of it. When the Goose opened
the door an inch or so to free herself he held on firmly and said:</p>
<p>"Tell us, please, are you the Warming-pan's aunt?"</p>
<p>The Gray Goose looked immensely pleased, but shook her head.</p>
<p>"Nothing so simple," said she, "nor, so to speak, commonplace, since
the relationship or connection if you will have it, is, though
perfectly to be distinguished, not always, as it were, entirely
clear, through his great-grandfather who, as I hope you are aware, was
a Dutch-Oven, having run away with a cousin of my mother's uncle's
stepfather, who was three times married, numbers one, two and three
all having children but none of 'em resembling one another in the
slightest, which, as you may have perceived, is only the beginning of
the story, but if you will now come in, not forgetting to wipe your
feet, and try to follow me very carefully, I'll be delighted to
explain all particulars."</p>
<p>The children were glad to follow the Lady Goose into the house,
though
they thought she had been quite particular enough. They found it
impossible to wipe their feet upon the mat because it was thick with
snow, and when the door was closed behind them, they were surprised to
feel that it was snowing even harder inside the house than it was
out. For a moment they stood half blinded by the storm, unable to see
clearly what kind of room they were in or to tell whose were the
voices they heard so plainly. A great fluttering, cackling, and
complaining was going on close to them, and a hoarse voice cried out:</p>
<p>"One hundred and seventeen and three-quarters feathers to be
multiplied by two-sevenths of a pound. That's a sweet one! Do that if
you can, Squealer."</p>
<p>"You can't do it yourself," a whining voice replied. "I've tried the
back and the corners and the edges&#8212;there's no more room&#8212;"</p>
<p>Then came the sound of a sudden smack, as if some one's ears had
been
boxed when he least expected it, and this was followed by a loud angry
squawk. Now the flakes, which had been gradually thinning, died away
entirely, and the children suddenly discovered that they had not been
snowflakes at all but only a cloud of white feathers sent whirling
through the house, out of the windows, and up the chimney by some
disturbance in the midst of a great heap in one corner of the room as
high as a haystack. From the middle of this heap of feathers stuck up
two very thin yellow legs with shabby boots that gave one last
despairing kick and then were still. Near by at a counter a Gentleman
Goose in a long apron was weighing feathers on a very small pair of
scales, and at his elbow stood a little duck apprentice with the tears
running down his cheeks. He was doing sums in a greasy sort of
butcher's book that seemed quite full already of funny scratchy
figures.</p>
<p>"That must be Squealer, the one who got his ears boxed," whispered
Ann
to Rudolf, "but what do you suppose is the matter with the other
duck, the one in the heap? He will be smothered, I know he will!"</p>
<p>Rudolf thought so, too, yet it didn't seem polite to mention it. The
Lady Goose had been busily helping the children to brush off the
feathers that were sticking to them, and patting Peter on the back
with her bill because he said he was sure he had swallowed at least a
pound. She now brought forward chairs for them all. As the children
looked around more closely they saw that the room they were in was a
very cozy sort of place, long and low and neatly furnished with a
white deal table, a shiny black cook-stove, a great many bright copper
saucepans, and a red geranium in the window. A large iron pot was
boiling merrily on the stove and from time to time the Gray Goose
stirred its contents with a wooden spoon. It smelled rather good, and
Peter, sniffing, began to put on his hungry expression.</p>
<p>"No, not even a family resemblance," went on the Gray Goose, waving
her spoon, "although, as is generally known, a Roman nose is
characteristic in our family, having developed in fact at the time of
that little affair when we repelled the Gauls in the year&#8212;"</p>
<p>But Rudolf felt he could not stand much more of this. "I beg your
pardon," he interrupted, "but would you mind if we helped the little
one out of the heap, the&#8212;the&#8212;duck who is getting so thoroughly
smothered?"</p>
<p>"Not at all, if you care about it," said the Gray Goose kindly.
"Squawker'll be good now, won't he, Father?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sure he'll be good," Ann cried, and she ran ahead of Rudolf
to catch hold of one of the thin yellow legs and give it a mighty
pull.</p>
<p>"He'll be good," said the Gentleman Goose gravely, speaking for the
first time, "when he's roasted. Very good indeed'll Squawker be&#8212;with
apple sauce!" And he smacked his lips and winked at Peter who was
standing close beside him, looking up earnestly into his face.</p>
<p>Peter thought a moment. Then he said: "<i>I</i> likes currant jelly
on my
duck. I eats apple sauce on goose."</p>
<p>The Gentleman Goose appeared suddenly uncomfortable. He began
nervously stuffing little parcels of the feathers he had been weighing
into small blue and white striped bags, which he threw one after the
other to Squealer, who never by any chance caught them as he turned
his back at every throw. "I suppose," said the Gentleman Goose to
Peter in a hesitating, anxious sort of voice, "you believe along with
all the rest, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,
don't you? I suppose there's nothing sauce-y about yourself now, is
there?" And apparently comforted by his miserable little joke he went
on with his weighing.</p>
<p>By this time the other little duck had been hauled out of the heap
of
feathers by Ann and Rudolf, and stood coughing and sneezing and
gasping in the middle of the floor. As soon as he had breath enough he
began calling pitifully for some one to brush the down off his Sunday
trousers. The Gray Goose came good-naturedly to his assistance, but as
she brushed him all the wrong way, the children couldn't see that she
improved him very much. Squawker seemed quite pleased, however, and
turned himself round and round for their approval.</p>
<p>"What kind of birds are these new ones?" he asked the Lady Goose
when
she had finished with him.</p>
<p>"Why just three more of us, Squawker, dear," she answered.</p>
<p>This remark made all three children open their eyes very wide.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," began Rudolf angrily, "<i>we</i> aren't geese!"</p>
<p>From the other end of the room came the voice of the Gentleman
Goose,
who spoke without turning round. "What makes you think that?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"Because we aren't&#8212;we&#8212;"</p>
<p>&#8212;"You're molting pretty badly, of course, now you mention it,"
interrupted the Lady Goose, "you and the little one. But this one's
feathers seem in nice condition." As she spoke she laid a long claw
lovingly on Ann's head. "How much would you say a pound, father?"</p>
<p>"Can't say till I get 'em in the scales, of course," and, smoothing
down his apron, the Gentleman Goose advanced toward Ann in a
businesslike fashion. The two little apprentices, carrying bags,
followed at his heels.</p>
<p>Ann clung to Rudolf. "I haven't any feathers," she screamed.
"They're
curls. I'm not a nasty bird&#8212;I'm a little girl with hair!"</p>
<p>"She doesn't want to be plucked!" exclaimed the Gray Goose who had
returned to the stove to stir the contents of the iron pot. "Well,
now, did you ever! Maybe it goes in her family. I had a great-aunt
once on my father's side who&#8212;"</p>
<p>"They're feathers, all right," chuckled Squawker. "You're a perfect
little duck, that's what I think."</p>
<p>"Me, too," chimed in Squealer.</p>
<p>The Gentleman Goose reached over the Lady Goose's shoulder, snatched
the spectacles off her nose without so much as by your leave, set them
crookedly on his own, and looked over them long and earnestly at Ann.
"So you want to call 'em hair, do you?" he snapped. "I suppose you
think you belong in a hair mattress!"</p>
<p>Ann was ready to cry, and Rudolf had drawn his sword with the
intention of doing his best to protect her, when at that moment a new
voice was heard. Looking in at the little window over the top of the
red geranium the children saw a good-humored furry face with long
bristly whiskers and bright twinkly eyes.</p>
<p>"Anybody mention my name?" said the voice, and a large Belgian Hare
leaped lightly into the room. He was handsomely dressed in a light
overcoat and checked trousers, and wore gaiters over his
patent-leather boots. He had a thick gold watch-chain, gold studs and
cuff buttons besides other jewelry, and in one hand he carried a high
hat, in the other a small dress-suit case and a tightly rolled
umbrella.</p>
<p>"What's the matter here?" he inquired cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Why, this bird," explained the Gentleman Goose, pointing his claw
disdainfully at Ann, "says it has no feathers, which you can see for
yourself is not the case. It has feathers, therefore it is a bird.
Birds of a feather flock together. That settles it, I think! Come
along, boys. To work!"</p>
<p>At his command the two duck apprentices, who were standing one on
either side of Ann, made feeble dashes at the two long curls nearest
them. Rudolf stepped forward but the Hare was before him. He only
needed to stare at the two ducks through a single eye-glass he had
screwed into one of his eyes to make them turn pale and drop their
claws to their sides.</p>
<p>"Now once more," said the Hare to Ann. "What did you say you call
those unpleasantly long whiskers of yours?"</p>
<p>"Hair," Ann answered meekly, for she was too frightened to be
offended.</p>
<p>"Hair!" echoed Rudolf and Peter loudly.</p>
<p>"Bless me," said their new friend, "that's not at all <i>my</i>
business,
is it? Not at all in my line&#8212;oh, no!" He gathered up his hat,
dress-suit case, and little umbrella from the floor where he had
dropped them. "Be sure you don't follow me," he said, nodding
pleasantly and winking at the children. Then he stepped to the door
without so much as a look at the Gentleman Goose who called out
angrily:</p>
<p>"Stop, stop! Catch 'em, Squealer&#8212;at 'em, Squawker&#8212;hold 'em, boys!"</p>
<p>It was too late. The boys were too much afraid of the Hare to do
more
than flutter and squawk a little, and as the Gentleman Goose did not
seem inclined to make an attack single-handed, the Hare, with the
children behind him, got to the door in safety. Peter, however, had
to be dragged along by Ann and Rudolf, for the Lady Goose had just
removed the great pot from the stove in time to prevent its contents
from boiling over, and the little boy was sniffing hungrily at the
steam. Now she came after the children carrying a large spoonful of
the bubbling stuff. "All done, all done," she cried. "Don't go without
a taste, dears."</p>
<p>"What's done?" asked Peter, eagerly turning back to her.</p>
<p>"Worms, dear; red ones and brown ones," answered the Lady
Goose,&#8212;"boiled in vinegar, you know&#8212;just like mother used to
make&#8212;with a wee bit of a grasshopper here and there for flavoring.
Mother had the recipe handed down in her family&#8212;her side&#8212;you know,
from my great-great-grandmother's half-sister who was a De l'Oie but
married a Mr. Gans and was potted in the year&#8212;"</p>
<p>They got Peter through the door by main force, Ann and Rudolf
pushing
behind and the Hare pulling in front. Even then, I am ashamed to say,
Peter kept calling out that he would like "just a taste", and he
didn't see why the Goose's worms wouldn't be just as good as the white
kind cook sent up with cheese on the top!</p>

<br>
THE FALSE HARE</h2>
<br>
<p>As they hurried away from the Goose's house, the children cast one
last look behind them. There at the window was the Lady Goose waving
in farewell the spoon she had stirred the hot worms with. Suddenly a
whirl of white feathers flew out of the chimney, the window and the
door, which the children in their haste had left open behind them, and
hid her completely from their sight. At the same instant two feeble
shrieks came from within the house.</p>
<p>"Squealer and Squawker both went into the heap that time, I guess,"
said Rudolf.</p>
<p>"I'm glad of it!" Ann cried. "<i>I'd</i> never help either of the
horrid
little things out again. Would you, sir?" she asked, turning politely
to the Hare.</p>
<p>"I dare say not," he answered, yawning. "That is, of course, unless
I
had particularly promised <i>not</i> to. In that case I suppose I'd
have
to."</p>
<p>All three children looked very much puzzled.</p>
<p>"Would you mind telling us," asked Ann timidly, "what you meant when
you said <i>this</i>"&#8212;and she touched her hair&#8212;"was not your business?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," said the Hare cheerfully. "I meant that it was."</p>
<p>"But you said&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Oh, what I <i>said</i> was, of course, untrue."</p>
<p>"Do you mean you tell stories?" Ann looked very much shocked, and so
did the others.</p>
<p>"Certainly," said the Hare, "that's my business, I'm a False Hare,
you
know. Oh, dear, yes, I tell heaps and heaps of stories, as many as I
possibly can, only sometimes I forget and then something true will
slip out of me. Oh, it's a hard life, it is, to be thoroughly
untruthful every single day from the time you get up in the morning
till the time you go to bed at night&#8212;round and round the clock, you
know! No eight-hour day for me. Ah, it's a sad, sad life!" He sighed
very mournfully, at the same time winking at Rudolf in such a funny
way that the boy burst out laughing. "Take warning by me, young man,"
he continued solemnly, "and inquire very, <i>very</i> carefully
concerning
whatever business you go into. If I had known what the life of a False
Hare really was, I doubt if I should have ever&#8212;But, dear me, this
will never do&#8212;you're getting me into mischief! I've hardly done so
much as a fib since we met."</p>
<p>"Oh, you mustn't mind <i>us</i>," said Rudolf, trying hard not to
laugh,
as he and Ann and Peter marched along beside the False Hare. "You
mustn't let us interfere with your&#8212;your business, you know. We
sha'n't mind, at least we'll try not to. Whatever you say we'll
believe just the opposite. It'll be as if he were a kind of game," he
added to Ann who was still looking very doubtful. She looked happier
at once, for Ann was quick at games and knew it.</p>
<p>"I think," said she to the False Hare, "that I heard something about
you the other day&#8212;at least I suppose it must have been you. It was at
a tea-party given by a friend of mine,"&#8212;here Ann put on her most
grown-up manner and made her voice sound as much like her mother's as
possible&#8212;"a Mrs. Mackenzie who lives in the city. One lady said to
another lady, 'How fashionable false hair is getting!'"</p>
<p>The False Hare stroked his whiskers to hide a pleased smile. "Bless
me," said he, "I should think so! Keeps a fellow on the jump, I can
tell you&#8212;this social whirl. And then, when bedtime comes along and a
chap ought to get a bit of rest after a day's hard fibbing, why
then&#8212;there's the dream business. I can't neglect that."</p>
<p>The children did not understand and said so.</p>
<p>"Well," said the False Hare, "I'll just explain, and then I really
must get back to business. Now then, suppose a hound dreams about a
hare? It's a dream hare, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course," they cried.</p>
<p>"And a dream hare is not a real hare, is it? And a hare that's not a
real hare is a false hare, isn't it? So there <i>I</i> am. That's
where I
come in. Simple, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"You make it sound simple," said Rudolf politely. "We're much
obliged.
And now would you mind telling us where we are coming to, and what is
beyond this steep hill just ahead of us?"</p>
<p>The Hare screwed his glass into his eye and looked thoughtfully at
the
country round about. "I can tell you, of course," he said, "but it
won't be the truth. I really <i>must</i> get back to business."</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind telling us at all, then," said Rudolf, who was
becoming rather vexed, "I see there's no use asking <i>you</i> any
questions."</p>
<p>During their conversation with the False Hare, the children had been
hurrying along over a stretch of open level country. Now the ground
began to slope gradually upward and soon they were climbing a very
steep hill. It was hard traveling, for the hill was covered with
thick, fuzzy, whitish-yellow grass which tangled itself round their
feet, and gave them more than one fall. Ann and Rudolf had to stop
often to pick up Peter, for he was rather fat and his legs were too
short to carry him along as fast as theirs did. The False Hare hurried
ahead by leaps and bounds that would soon have carried him out of
sight of his companions if he had not stopped now and then to wait for
them. When the children caught up to him, they would find him sitting
on his little dress-suit case, smoking a chocolate cigarette, and
laughing at them.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't mention it," he would say when they apologized for
keeping
him waiting. "<i>I</i> don't mind. I like waiting for slow-pokes! It's
nothing to me if I miss a dozen appointments and get driven out of the
dream business by that old what's-his-name&#8212;Welsh Rabbit!"</p>
<p>This sort of talk was rather annoying, and after a while the
children
decided not to heed it any longer. Indeed they were all three tired
with their climb, and were glad to sink down on the soft fuzzy grass
and rest a while. The False Hare bounded ahead, calling back to them
"Not to hurry", but when he found he could not tease them into
following, he sauntered back to meet them, looking as cool and fresh
and neat as when he started. Peter had been rather in the dumps ever
since he had been refused a taste of the Lady Goose's dinner, and now
he looked thoughtfully at the Hare's suit case.</p>
<p>"Has you got anything to eat in there?" he asked, his little face
brightening.</p>
<p>"Gracious, yes," said the False Hare lightly. "Lemme see! What do
little boys like best? Cinnamon buns an' chocolate cake an'
butterscotch an' lemon pie an' soda-water an' gingerbread an' jujubes
an' hokey-pokey an 'popcorn balls an'&#8212;" He might have gone on
forever, but Ann and Rudolf would not stand any more of it. They rose
angrily and dragging Peter after them, continued their climb. Just as
they had almost reached the top of the hill, the False Hare bounded
past them with a laughing salute and a wave of his paw, and dropped
out of sight over the brink of the ridge. A moment more and they all
stood on the edge of a cliff so steep that they were in danger of
tumbling over. From beneath the Hare's voice called up to them,
"Nobody ever thought of a sheet of water&#8212;<i>oh</i>, no!"</p>
<p>Before their eyes lay the last thing the children had expected to
see,
a large piece of water quite calm and smooth, without a sign of a sail
on it, nor were there any bathers or children playing on the narrow
strip of beach directly beneath them. At first it seemed as if it
would be impossible for them to climb down the face of that steep
cliff to the water, but the False Hare had done it, and they
determined that they must manage it somehow. After looking about
carefully, they found a set of rude steps cut in the side of the
cliff. They were very far apart, to be sure, for climbers whose legs
were not of the longest, but Rudolf helped Ann and Ann helped Peter
and at last they were all safely down and standing beside the False
Hare, who was strolling along the edge of the water.</p>
<p>"Hullo," said he, sticking his glass in his eye and looking at Ann.
"What makes the whiskerless one so cheerful?"</p>
<p>Rudolf and Peter were not surprised when they turned to look at Ann
to
see that she was ready to cry.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Ann?" they asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, dear!" sighed Ann. "Whatever will become of us now? We
can't go back. Even if we could climb up the cliff, I'd never pass
that dreadful Goose's house again, no, not for anything! But how are
we going to get any farther without a boat?"</p>
<p>The False Hare pretended to wipe away a tear with the back of his
paw.
"No boat," he groaned. "Oh, dear, dear, dear&#8212;no boat!"</p>
<p>The faces of the three children brightened immediately, for they
were
beginning to understand his ways. "Hurrah!" cried Rudolf, waving his
sword.</p>
<p>Sure enough, coming round a bend in the shore where the bushes had
hidden it from their sight, was a small boat rowed by two white candy
mice.</p>

<br>
REAL LIVE PIRATES</h2>
<br>
<p>After neatly and carefully turning up the bottoms of his trousers so
that they should not get wet, the False Hare bounded on a rock that
rose out of the water a few feet from shore, and stood ready to direct
the landing of the boat. There was some sense in this, for certainly
neither of the two mice was what could be called good oarsmen. One of
them had just unshipped the little sail, and&#8212;not seeming to know what
else to do with it&#8212;had cut it loose from the oar that served as a
mast and wrapped it round and round his body, tying himself tightly
with a piece of string.</p>
<p>Rudolf thought he had never in his life seen people in a boat do so
many queer and unnecessary things in so short a time as those two
mice did. They would stop rowing every few minutes and begin sweeping
out the floor of their boat with a small broom, dusting seats,
cushions, and oar-locks with a little feather duster tied with a pink
ribbon. Then, after a few, rapid, nervous strokes at the oars, one or
the other of them would pull his blade out of the water and polish it
anxiously with his handkerchief, as if the important thing was to keep
it dry. They would probably never have reached land that day if this
had depended on their own efforts, but luckily the breeze was blowing
them in the right direction.</p>
<p>All this time the False Hare had been waiting on the rock, and now
as
the boat was almost within reach, he began leaping up and down,
clapping his paws and calling out in the heartiest tones: "Go it, my
dear old Salts! Hurrah, my fine Jack Tars! You're a pair of swell old
sea-dogs, you are. Only don't <i>hurt</i> yourselves, you know. We
wouldn't
like to see you <i>work</i>!"</p>
<p>It seemed as if the white mice knew the False Hare and the value of
his remarks, for they made no attempt to answer him, but only looked
more and more frightened and uncomfortable. When their boat was at
last beached, they jumped out of it, turned their backs to the rest of
the party, and standing as close together as they could get, gazed
anxiously out over the water. Seen close by there was something
familiar about the look of these mice to the three children, yes, even
though they <i>had</i> grown a great deal, and had disguised
themselves by
the simple method of licking the chocolate off each other! Rudolf and
Ann hoped Peter would not notice it, but nothing of the sort ever
escaped him. He walked around in front of the two mice, who tried
vainly not to meet his eye, looked at them long and earnestly, and
said:</p>
<p>"I say, Mr. Mouses, was you always white?"</p>
<p>The mice turned a pale greenish color in their embarrassment and
looked nervously at each other, but answered never a word.</p>
<p>"I thought," continued Peter, staring steadily at them, "that last
time I saw you you was choc'late. Did you wash it off&#8212;on purpose?" he
added sternly.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir, we don't believe in washing," muttered one of the
poor things hastily.</p>
<p>Ann shook her head at Peter. "Hush!" she whispered. "You mustn't be
rude to them when they are going to lend us their boat so kindly."
Then she asked in a loud voice, hoping to change the subject: "Who is
going to row? Will you, Mr. False Hare?"</p>
<p>"Why certainly, dearie, I adore rowing," said the False Hare sweetly.</p>
<p>"Then you will have to, Rudolf, and I will look after Peter. 'He is
always <i>so</i> apt to fall out of a boat. I dare say the mice will
be
glad of a rest."</p>
<p>They all got into the boat, Rudolf took the oars, Ann sat in the bow
with Peter beside her, and the False Hare settled himself comfortably
in the stern with a mouse squeezed on either side of him. He wanted to
pet them a little, so he said, but from the strained expressions on
their faces and the startled squeaks they gave from time to time, it
seemed as if they were hardly enjoying his attentions. The children
loved being on the water better than anything else, and they would
have been perfectly happy now, if the False Hare had not had quite so
many nice compliments to make to Rudolf on his rowing, and if the
white mice had not complained so bitterly of them all for "sitting all
over the boat cushions," and "wetting the nice dry oars!" They were
enjoying themselves very much, in spite of this, when suddenly Ann,
who had very sharp eyes, called out:</p>
<p>"Sail ahead!"</p>
<p>At first Rudolf thought she had said this just because it sounded
well, but on turning his head he saw for himself a small boat heading
toward them as fast as it could come. A moment more and the children
could see the black flag floating at its masthead.</p>
<p>"Oh, oh!" screamed Ann, "that's a skull and cross-bones. It's a
pirate
ship!"</p>
<p>"Hurrah!" Rudolf shouted. "How awfully jolly! Just like a book."</p>
<p>"Dee-lightful!" the False Hare exclaimed, shuddering all over to the
tips of his whiskers. "If there's one thing I do dote on it is
pirates&#8212;dear old things!"</p>
<p>As for the two white mice, after one glance at the ship, they gave
two little shrieks and hid their faces in their paws.</p>
<p>Rudolf shipped his oars while he loosened his sword. "I shall be
prepared to fight," said he, "though I am afraid we must make up our
minds to being captured. Our enemy's boat is not so large&#8212;it's not
much more than a catboat&#8212;but there are only four of us, as the mice
don't count, and I suppose there must be at least a dozen of the
pirates."</p>
<p>The False Hare smiled a sickly sort of smile. "And such nice ones,"
he
murmured. "Such gentle, well-behaved, well-brought-up, <i>polite</i>
pirates! Just the sort your dear parents would like to have you meet.
<i>Those</i> fellows don't know anything about shooting, stabbing,
mast-heading or plank-walking; <i>oh</i>, no! <i>They</i> don't do
such things."</p>
<p>Ann turned pale at the False Hare's words, but Rudolf only laughed.
"What luck!" he exclaimed. "I'm nine years old and I've never seen a
real live pirate, and goodness knows when I ever will again&#8212;I
wouldn't miss this for anything." Then, as he saw how really worried
his little sister looked, he added cheerfully. "They may sail right
past without speaking to us, you know."</p>
<p>But this was not to be the case. Nearer and nearer came the pirate
craft until at last the children could see, painted in black letters
on her side, her name, <i>The Merry Mouser</i>. A group of pirates was
gathered at the rail, staring at the rowboat through their glasses.
There was no mistake about these fellows being pirates&#8212;that was easy
enough to see from their queer bright-colored clothes and the number
of weapons they carried, even if the ugly black flag had not been
floating over their heads. At the bow stood he who was evidently the
Pirate Chief. He was dressed in some kind of tight gray and white
striped suit with a red sash tied round his waist stuck full of
shiny-barreled pistols and long bright-bladed knives. A red turban
decorated his head and under it his brows met in the fiercest kind of
frown. His arms were folded on his breast. As Rudolf looked at this
fellow, he began to have the queerest feeling that
somewhere&#8212;somehow&#8212;under very different conditions&#8212;he had seen the
Pirate Chief before!</p>
<p>Just at that instant he heard the sound of a struggle behind him,
and
turning round he saw that Peter had become terribly excited. "Mittens!
Mittens!" he screamed, and breaking loose from Ann's hold, he stood up
and leaned so far over the side of the boat that he lost his balance
and fell into the water. Ann screamed, the False Hare&#8212;I am ashamed to
say&#8212;merely yawned and kept his paws in his pockets. Rudolf had kicked
off his shoes and was ready to jump in after Peter, when he saw that
quick as a flash, on an order from their Chief, the pirates had
lowered a long rope with something bobbing at the end of it. Peter
when he came to the surface, seized this rope and was rapidly hauled
on board the pirate ship.</p>
<p>Ann came near falling overboard herself in her excitement. "Oh,
Ruddy,
Ruddy!" she begged, "let's surrender right away quick. We can't leave
poor darling Peter to be carried off by those terrible cats."</p>
<p>"Cats?" said Rudolf, staring stupidly at the pirates. "Why so they
are
cats, Ann! Somehow I hadn't noticed that before. But, look, they are
sending a boat to us now."</p>
<p>In a small boat which had been towed behind the catboat, a couple of
pirates&#8212;big, rough-looking fellows&#8212;were sculling rapidly toward the
children. Cats indeed they were, but such cats as Ann and Rudolf had
never seen before, so big and black and bold were they, their teeth so
sharp and white, their eyes so round and yellow! One had a red sash
and one a green, and each carried knives and pistols enough to set up
a shop.</p>
<p>"Surrender!" they cried in a businesslike kind of way as they laid
hold of the bow of the rowboat, "or have your throats cut&#8212;just as you
like, you know."</p>
<p>Of course the children didn't like, and then, as Ann said, they had
to
remember Peter. Much against his will, Rudolf was now forced to
surrender his beloved sword. The False Hare handed over all his
belongings&#8212;his jewelry, his suit case, and his little
umbrella&#8212;without the slightest hesitation, humming a tune as he did
so, but his voice cracked, and Ann and Rudolf noticed that the tip of
his nose had turned quite pale. The prisoners were quickly
transferred to the other boat, and the pirate with the green sash took
the oars. Just as all was ready for the start the cat in red cried:</p>
<p>"Hold on a minute, Growler! I'll just jump back into their old tub
to
see if we've left any vallybles behind!"</p>
<p>"All right, Prowler."</p>
<p>It was then and only then that Rudolf and Ann remembered the two
white
mice! The last time they had noticed them was at the moment of Peter's
ducking when in their excitement, the foolish creatures had hidden
their faces on each other's shoulders, rolled themselves into a kind
of ball, and stowed themselves under a seat. Prowler leaped into the
little boat which the pirates had fastened by a tow-rope to their own,
and during his search he kept his back turned to his companions. He
was gone but a moment, and when he returned his whiskers were very
shiny, and he was looking extremely jolly as he hummed a snatch of a
pirate song.</p>
<p>"Find anything?" asked Growler, eying him suspiciously. "If you did,
and don't fork it out before the Chief, <i>you'll</i> catch it. 'Twill
be
as much as your nine lives are worth!"</p>
<p>"Oh, 'twas nothing&#8212;nothing of any importance," answered Prowler
airily.</p>
<p>Rudolf and Ann looked at each other, but neither of them spoke. Both
the pirate cats now settled to the oars and the boat skimmed along the
water in the direction of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>. As they drew
alongside,
Growler muttered in a not unfriendly whisper:</p>
<p>"Look here, youngsters, here's a word of advice that may save you
your
skins. Don't show any cheek&#8212;not to me or Prowler, we're the
mates&#8212;and above all, not to the Chief!"</p>
<p>"What is your Chief's name, Mr. Growler, dear sir?" asked Ann
timidly.</p>
<p>Growler flashed his white teeth at her. Then he looked at Prowler
and
both mates repeated together as if they were saying a lesson: "The
name of our illustrious Chief is Captain Mittens&#8212;Mittens, the
Pitiless Pirate&#8212;Mittens, the Monster of the Main!"</p>
<p>"Why&#8212;why&#8212;my Aunt Jane had a tiger cat once with white paws&#8212;" Ann
began, but then she stopped suddenly, for Rudolf had given her a sharp
pinch. A terrible frown had spread over the faces of both Growler and
Prowler. "Above <i>all</i>," whispered the mate in low and earnest
tones,
"none of that! If you don't want to be keel-hauled, don't recall his
shameful past!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI
<br>
ABOARD THE MERRY MOUSER</h2>
<br>
<p>When Rudolf and Ann and the False Hare, under guard of Growler and
Prowler, reached the deck of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>, they found
Peter,
dressed in a dry suit of pirate clothing and looking none the worse
for his wetting. He was being closely watched by a big Maltese pirate
whose strong paw with its sharp claws outspread rested on his
shoulder, but as Rudolf and Ann were led past him, he managed to
whisper, "Look out! Mittens is awful cross at us!"</p>
<p>Foolish Ann paid no attention to this warning. She was so glad to
see
her Aunt Jane's pet again that she snatched her hand out of Prowler's
paw, and ran toward the Pirate Chief. "Kitty, Kitty, don't you know
me?" she cried. "Oh, Puss, Puss!"</p>
<p>For a moment Captain Mittens stood perfectly silent, bristling to
the
very points of his whiskers with passion. Then he ordered in a hoarse
kind of growl: "Bring the bags."</p>
<p>Instantly two ugly black and white spotted cats dived into the
little
cabin and brought out an armful of neat, black, cloth bags with
drawing strings in them. "One moment," commanded Mittens in a very
stern voice, "any plunder?"</p>
<p>Growler, the mate, bowed low before his chief. "'Ere's a werry
'andsome weapon, sir," said he, handing over Rudolf's sword. "Nothing
else on the little ones, sir, but <i>this</i> 'ere gentleman"&#8212;pointing
to
the False Hare&#8212;"was loaded down with jools."</p>
<p>Hearty cheers sprang from the furry throats of the crew, while broad
grins spread over their whiskered faces as they listened to this
pleasing news.</p>
<p>"Silence," snarled Mittens&#8212;and every cat was still. "Now then," he
commanded Growler, "hand 'em over."</p>
<p>Very much against his will, Growler emptied his pockets of the False
Hare's jewelry and handed it over to his Chief. Mittens took the gold
watch and chain, the flashing pin and studs, the beautiful diamond
ring and put them all on, glaring defiantly at his crew as he did so.
So fierce was that scowl of his, so sharp and white the teeth he
flashed at them, so round and terrible his gleaming yellow eyes that
not a cat dared object, though the faces of all plainly showed their
anger and disappointment at this unfair division of the spoils.</p>
<p>"Now, what's in <i>there</i>," demanded Mittens, as he gave a
contemptuous
kick to the False Hare's dress-suit case. Growler opened it and took
out a dozen paper collars, a little pair of pink paper pajamas, and a
small black bottle labeled "Hare Restorer."</p>
<p>"All of 'em worth about two cents retail," snorted Mittens with a
bitter look at the False Hare. "And that umbrella, I see, is not made
to go up! Huh! Drowning's too good for <i>you</i>!"</p>
<p>"I feel so myself, sir," said the False Hare humbly. "You see," he
added, wiping away a tear with the back of his paw, "I'm so <i>fond</i>
of
the water!"</p>
<p>Mittens thought a moment, keeping his eye firmly fastened on the
Hare.
"I'll fix you," he cried, "I'll tie you up in one of those bags!"</p>
<p>The False Hare put his paw behind his ear. "Bags?" said he. "Excuse
me, sir, but did you say bags?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did," roared the Pirate Chief. "Bags! Bags! Bags!"</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>thank</i> you!" cried the False Hare cheerily. "Just my
favorite
resting-place&#8212;a nice snug bag. Mind you have them draw the string
<i>tight</i>, won't you?"</p>
<p>Mittens flew into a terrible passion. "I have it," he roared, "I'll
send you adrift! Here, boys, get that boat ready!"</p>
<p>Then the Hare began to cry, to sob, to beg for mercy, till the
children felt actually ashamed of him. "Look here, Mittens," Rudolf
began.</p>
<p>"<i>Captain</i> Mittens," corrected the pirate coldly.</p>
<p>It was hard for Rudolf, but he dared not anger the pirate cat any
further. "Don't hurt him, please, Captain Mittens," he begged. "He's
only a&#8212;" Then he stopped, for the False Hare was making a terrible
face at him behind the handkerchief with which he was pretending to
wipe his eyes.</p>
<p>"Tie his paws!" commanded Mittens, without so much as a look at
Rudolf. "There&#8212;that's a nice bit of string hanging out of his
pocket&#8212;take that. Now&#8212;chuck him in the boat!"</p>
<p>In a trice the black and white spotted cats, who seemed to be common
sailors, had tied the False Hare's paws behind him with his own
string, lowered him into the mice's little boat from which they had
already removed the oars, gave it a push, and sent him cruelly adrift!</p>
<p>"Oh, Rudolf," cried tender-hearted Ann, "what will become of him?
Poor
old Hare!"</p>
<p>"Po-o-o-r old Hare," came back a dismal echo from the little boat
already some distance away. Then they saw that the False Hare had
freed his paws&#8212;that string must have been made of paper like his
clothes and his umbrella&#8212;and was standing up in his boat waving a
gay farewell to all aboard the <i>Merry Mouser</i>.</p>
<p>"Good-by, kidlets!" he called in mocking tones. "Hope you have a
good
time with the tabbies!" And then to Mittens, "Good-by, old Whiskers!"</p>
<p>At this insult to their Chief all the pirate cats began firing their
revolvers, but their aim must have been very poor indeed, as none of
their shots came anywhere near the Hare's boat. Indeed, a great many
of the cats had forgotten to load their weapons, though they kept
snapping away at their triggers as if that did not matter in the
slightest. The False Hare merely bowed, kissed his paw to Captain
Mittens, and then began using his silk hat as a paddle so skilfully
that in a few moments he was far beyond their range.</p>
<p>Growler edged up to Prowler. "I say, old chap," he chuckled, "I
s'pose that's what they mean by a hare-breadth escape?"</p>
<p>Prowler grinned. "It's one on the Chief, anyway," said he joyfully.
"Not a breath of wind, ye know, not so much as a cats-paw&#8212;no chance
of a chase."</p>
<p>"What's that?" Captain Mittens had crept up behind the two mates and
bawled in Prowler's ear. "What's that? No wind? Why not, I'd like to
know? What d'ye mean by running out o' wind? Head her for Catnip
Island this instant, or I'll have ye skinned!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I'll do my best, sir," answered Prowler meekly. "But you
see, sir, the breeze havin' died, sir, it'll be a tough job to get the
<i>Merry Mouser</i>&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Prowler!" The chief, who had been standing close beside the unlucky
mate while he spoke, now came closer yet and fixed his terrible eye
on Prowler's shining whiskers. "How long," he asked, speaking very
slowly and distinctly, "is&#8212;it&#8212;since&#8212;you&#8212;have&#8212;tasted mouse?"</p>
<p>Prowler trembled all over. "A&#8212;a&#8212;week, sir," he mumbled, "that is, I
couldn't <i>swear</i> to the date, sir, but 'twas at my aunt's and she
never has us to tea on a Monday, for that's wash-day, nor on a
Tuesday, for that's missionary, so it must 'a' been&#8212;"</p>
<p>"No use, 't won't work, Prowler." The Chief grinned and waved a paw
to
one of the spotted sailors. "Here, you, bring along the
Cat-O'-Nine-Tails!"</p>
<p>At this the children were immediately very much interested, for they
had never in their lives seen a cat with more than one tail.</p>
<p>"It would take nine times as much pulling&#8212;" Rudolf was whispering to
Peter, when he noticed a new commotion among the sailors. The black
and white sea-cat had turned to carry out the Chief's order when
suddenly some one called out "A breeze, a breeze!" and in the
excitement of getting the <i>Merry Mouser</i> under way, the captain's
attention was turned, and Prowler and his crime were forgotten.</p>
<p>All this time Ann and Rudolf and Peter had been standing a little
apart from the rest under guard of the Maltese pirate at whose feet
lay the dreadful black bags all ready for use. In the confusion Rudolf
turned to Ann and whispered, "Do you suppose we could possibly stir up
a mutiny? Prowler must be pretty sore against the Chief! If we could
only get him and Growler on our side and make them help us seize
Mittens and drop him overboard."</p>
<p>But Ann shook her head, and as for Peter he doubled up his little
fists and cried out loud: "Nobody sha'n't touch my Mittens! I don't
care if he <i>is</i> a pirate cat. I'm going to ask my Aunt Jane if I
can't take him home with me to Thirty-fourth Street!"</p>
<p>"Sh&#8212;sh!" Ann whispered, putting her hand over his mouth, but it was
too late! Mittens had crept stealthily up behind Peter and now he
popped one of the black bags over his head. At the same instant, Ann,
kicking and struggling, vanished into another held open by two of the
spotted cats, and before Rudolf could rush to her rescue a third bag
descended over his own head. It was no use struggling, yet struggle
they did, till Mittens sent three of the spotted sailors to sit on
them, and <i>then</i> they soon quieted down. There were one or two
small
breathing holes in each bag, or else the children would surely have
suffocated, so stout and heavy were those spotted cats. After what
seemed to them a very long time a cry of "Land ho!" was raised, and
the cats got up and rushed away to join in the general fuss and
confusion of getting the <i>Merry Mouser</i> ready for her landing.</p>
<p>Rudolf had been working his hardest at one of the holes in his bag
and
soon he was able to get a good view of his immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>"Cheer up!" he called to Ann and Peter. "We're coming close to the
island."</p>
<p>"Has it got coral reefs and palm-trees and cocoanuts and savages,
friendly ones, I mean?" came in muffled tones from Ann's bag.</p>
<p>"Has it got monkeys and serpents an' turtles an'&#8212;an'&#8212;shell-fish?"
demanded Peter from his.</p>
<p>"N-no," said Rudolf, "I don't see any of those things <i>yet</i>.
There are
a great many trees, some of 'em coming most down to the edge of the
water, but they're not palm-trees, they're willows, the kind you pick
the little furry gray things off in early spring&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Pussy-willows, of course, stupid!" interrupted Ann.</p>
<p>"Yes, and back of that there are fields with tall reeds or grasses
with brown tips to them."</p>
<p>"Cattails!" giggled Ann.</p>
<p>"And there's a big high cliff, too, with a little stream of water
running down, and&#8212;" But here Rudolf stopped, for Growler and Prowler
rushed up, cut the strings of the three bags, and released the
children from their imprisonment. Hardly did they have time to stretch
themselves before the <i>Merry Mouser</i> brought up alongside her
landing-place, and in a moment more the children were being led
ashore, each under guard of a cat pirate to prevent escape.</p>

<br>
CATNIP ISLAND</h2>
<br>
<p>Little cats, big cats, black, white, gray, yellow, striped, spotted,
Maltese, tortoise-shell, calico, and tiger cats! Cats of all sizes and
all kinds, cats of all ages, from tiny furry babies wheeled in
perambulators by their mamas to gray old grandpas hobbling along by
the aid of canes or crutches&#8212;all the cats of Catnip Island had
trooped down to the shore to watch the landing of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>.
Captain Mittens, decked out in the False Hare's jewelry, was the first
to leave the pirate ship. He stepped along jauntily, nose in the air
and the haughtiest kind of expression on his whiskered face. After him
came Growler leading Rudolf, then Prowler with Ann, then the Maltese
pirate with Peter by the hand. The spotted sailors brought up the
rear, all but two who had been left to guard the ship. As soon as the
shore cats saw that their Chief had brought home three prisoners from
his cruise, they set up a great yowl of joy, and began to dance,
prancing and bounding in the air and whirling round and round upon
their hind legs.</p>

<p>"Oh, my eye!" exclaimed Rudolf, quite forgetting where he was and
standing still to watch their antics. "Don't I wish I had my
slingshot!"</p>
<p>"Hush! Silence&#8212;'nless ye want to be skinned!" It was the voice of
Prowler just behind him.</p>
<p>"If you think I'm afraid of a lot of silly cats&#8212;" began Rudolf, but
his voice was drowned by the angry yowls that burst from a hundred
furry throats as the islanders pressed closer and closer.</p>
<p>"Oh, Rudolf, do be quiet!" Ann begged, and Rudolf, remembering that
he
was not only a long way from his sling shot, but that even his sword
had been taken away from him, was obliged to submit. By this time the
pirates had cleared a way through the crowd and the procession left
the beach and entered the pussy-willow grove which Rudolf had
described from the deck of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>. Half hidden among
the
trees were a number of pretty little houses, each with a neat door
yard and a high back fence. Each had its name, too, on a small door
plate, and it amused Ann and Peter to spell out as they went
along&#8212;"Furryfield," "Mousetail Manor," "Kitten-cote," etc.</p>
<p>"Oh, look," Ann whispered, "see the darling, little, front doors,
Peter! Just like the cat-hole in Aunt Jane's big door. The chimneys
are shaped something like ears and the roofs are all covered with
fur!"</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Peter, "and they've got little gardens to 'em, Ann.
I
guess that must be the catnip we smell so strong. I don't see any
flowers, though, only big tall weeds, rows and rows of
'em&#8212;milkweed&#8212;that's what it is! What do you suppose they planted
that for?"</p>
<p>Prowler, who was walking just ahead of Peter, overheard this last
remark, and turning, fixed his large, round, yellow eyes on the little
boy. "Don't you like milk, young man?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Why, yes," said Peter, very puzzled, "but not <i>that</i> kind,
you know."</p>
<p>"Well, milk's milk these hard times," said Prowler, wagging his
head.
"It don't do to be too particerler. You like mice, don't you?" he
continued.</p>
<p>"Why, <i>I</i> like candy mice," said Peter grinning, "but I never
knew
before that cats did!"</p>
<p>"Sh-sh!" Poor Prowler began to tremble all over and look anxiously
about him. "Not a word of that," he murmured, "or I'm a dead cat! You
keep mum about that little affair, young'un, and I'll do you a good
turn yet, see if I don't!"</p>
<p>"All right; don't you forget!" whispered Peter.</p>
<p>The procession was now approaching a house considerably larger than
any of the others and which had "The Pirattery" written in large
letters over its door. Mittens led the way inside, the mates with the
children and all the other pirates followed, together with as many of
the island cats as could squeeze themselves in. The Pirattery, so the
children were informed by Growler and Prowler, was an assembly hall or
general meeting-place for the pirates when on shore. Its floor and
the little platform at one end were strewn with rat-skin rugs of the
finest quality, and its walls were adorned with handsomely stuffed and
mounted mouse and fish heads, snake skins, and other trophies of the
chase.</p>
<p>Mittens now took up his position on the platform and began a long
and
eloquent speech in which he related the story of the capture of his
prisoners, making the most absurd boasts of the terrible risks he had
run, and dwelling most particularly on the awful fate of the False
Hare&#8212;while quite forgetting to mention his escape. This speech was
interrupted by tremendous cheers from the island cats which were only
faintly joined in by the pirates. Mittens finished by saying that a
concert in celebration of the victory would now be given, after which
there would be refreshments&#8212;Peter pricked up his ears at the word!
&#8212;and then the plunder taken from the prisoners would be distributed
among the officers and crew of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>. This last
announcement was greeted by a volley of shrill and joyful yowls from
the younger cat pirates, but Growler, frowning, whispered in Rudolf's
ear:</p>
<p>"Don't you believe a word of that, about whacking up on the
treasure!
He'll never give up so much as a single shirt stud, he won't."</p>
<p>"I would 'a' liked them pink pajamas, I would," sighed Prowler.
"They'd just suit my dark complexion."</p>
<p>"I can't understand," said Ann, "what it is that has made such a
change in Mittens! Why, just yesterday when we got to Aunt Jane's he
was asleep before the fire with a little red bow on his collar&#8212;just
as soft and nice as anything, and he let us all take turns holding
him!"</p>
<p>"He never scratched really <i>deep</i> all day," said Peter
mournfully,
"only when we dressed him up in the doll's clothes&#8212;he didn't seem to
'preciate that&#8212;an'&#8212;an' when I pulled his tail&#8212;he didn't <i>like</i>
that, neither."</p>
<p>"He's a bad old thief, that's what he is!" exclaimed Rudolf,
forgetting in his excitement to lower his voice. "And if we ever get
back to Aunt Jane's and he's there, <i>I'll</i> fix him&#8212;"</p>
<p>A general warning hiss went up from the pirate cats who stood
nearest
to the children. "Be quiet," muttered Growler, "unless you want your
ears bitten off? Don't you see the Chief is going to sing?"</p>
<p>Mittens had stepped to the front of the platform and was fixing an
angry scowl upon the three children who stood between Growler and
Prowler directly beneath him. When all was so quiet in the hall you
could have heard a pin drop, the Chief cleared his throat and nodded
to the Maltese pirate who stood ready to accompany him upon the
tambourine. In the background a semicircle of other singers clutched
their music and shuffled their feet rather nervously as they waited to
come in at the chorus.</p>
<p>Mittens sang in a high plaintive voice:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was young,
you know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not very long ago,<br>
I was a mild, a happy Pussy-cat!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fur was soft as silk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived on bread and milk,<br>
And I dozed away my days upon the mat!"<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><i>Chorus</i><br>
</div>
<br>
("He was then a happy, happy Pussy-cat!")<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really blush to say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How idly I would play<br>
With my tail or silly spool upon the floor&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till one unlucky day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three children came to stay&#8212;<br>
After that I wasn't happy any more."<br>
<br>
<i>Chorus</i><br>
<br>
("No, <i>indeed</i>, he wasn't happy any more!")<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They drove me nearly wild,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My temper, once so mild,<br>
They spoiled&#8212;the truth of that you'll say is plain&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I ran away to sea&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis a pirate's life for me,<br>
And I'll never be a Pussy-cat again!"<br>
<br>
<i>Chorus</i><br>
<br>
("No, <i>he'll</i> never be a Pussy-cat again!")<br>
</div>
<br>
<p>You may be sure that Rudolf and Ann did not join in the burst of
applause which greeted the end of Captain Mittens' song. Peter would
have been glad to, for he was too young and foolish to understand how
really impertinent Mittens had been, but his brother and sister
quickly stopped that. As for Growler and Prowler, they merely yawned,
as if they had heard this song more than once before, only faintly
clapping their paws together in order not to attract the tyrant's
attention to themselves. The next piece on the program, so Mittens
announced, would be a duet between himself and Miss Tabitha Tortoise,
entitled <i>Moonbeams on the Back Fence</i>. This selection proved so
very
noisy, so full of quavers, trills, and loud and piercing yowls, that
the children decided it would be safe to attempt a little
conversation.</p>
<p>"Oh, Rudolf," whispered Ann, "how shall we ever get away from here?"</p>
<p>"Don't want to get away," grumbled Peter. "We're going to have
refreshments; Mittens said so."</p>
<p>"Nonsense; you'll have to go if we do," answered Rudolf. "But
listen,
what are the mates saying?"</p>
<p>The two black cat pirates were conversing excitedly under cover of
the
music, and presently the children heard what Prowler was whispering
to Growler: "Look here, Matey, where's the rest of the swag, the suit
case and <i>his</i> sword, you know?"</p>
<p>"On board ship, stowed away in Cap'n's cabin," answered Growler.
"You
don't mean to&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do&#8212;I'm no 'fraid-cat&#8212;I mean to have them pink pajamas, or&#8212;"</p>
<p>"And where do <i>I</i> come in, eh?" exclaimed Growler indignantly.</p>
<p>"Oh, you can have the shirts and collars, Matey. Share and share
alike, you know. We'll just slip off to the ship, and&#8212;"</p>
<p>"And take us with you," broke in Rudolf. "Do!"</p>
<p>"You know you promised to do us a good turn," whispered Ann. "And if
you don't take us we'll tell, and we'll tell about what happened to
the white mice, too&#8212;"</p>
<p>"And while you're about it," went on Rudolf, "you'd better take
possession of the vessel. Between us we can easily manage those old
spotties that were left on board. Then, don't you see, when you
fellows are masters of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>, you'll have Mittens in
your
power and you can make him whack up on all the treasure!"</p>
<p>At this brilliant suggestion the two mates gave a smothered cheer,
gazing at each other with their round yellow eyes full of joy and
their whiskered mouths grinning so widely that the children could see
their little red tongues and all their sharp white teeth.</p>
<p>"But how shall we get away without being seen?" Ann asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that'll be all right," said Prowler, looking about him
nervously.
"Just wait till you hear 'em announce the refreshments&#8212;that always
means a rush, you know. Then slip through the crowd and out by that
door behind the curtain, and hustle down to the ship just as fast as
ever you can lay your paws to the ground!"</p>
<p>Prowler had hardly finished speaking before, with a final long-drawn
piercing yowl, the duet of the Pirate Chief and Miss Tabitha Tortoise
came to an end, and an intermission of ten minutes for refreshments
was announced. From an inner room at the back of the hall a dozen or
so white cats in caps and aprons trotted forth bearing large trays
loaded with very curious-looking cat-eatables.</p>
<p>Rudolf and Ann had now their usual trouble with Peter who at first
absolutely refused to budge until he had tasted at least "one of
each". When at last he was made to understand that the trays around
which the cats were so greedily thronging contained nothing more
inviting than roasted rats and pickled fish fins, and that these
delicacies would probably not be offered to prisoners anyway, he
regretfully allowed himself to be pushed through a door at the side of
the hall and hurried off in the direction of the shore. Although the
children, followed closely by the two mates, had managed to slip away
almost unnoticed in the general excitement, yet they knew their escape
must soon be discovered and they ran as fast as ever they could go.</p>
<p>At last they reached the wharf and scrambled up the side of the <i>Merry
Mouser</i>, expecting each instant to receive some kind of challenge
from
the two spotted cats on guard. Much to their surprise they received
none. This was soon explained, for the two common sailors were found
in the cabin, curled up in the Captain's bunk, fast asleep.</p>
<p>"A nice mess they'd be in if the Chief caught 'em!" cried Growler.</p>
<p>Prowler said nothing, but winked at his friend, and taking a piece
of
strong string from his pocket, he bound the poor spotted cats' eight
paws all in a bunch together and left them to continue their nap. This
little matter attended to, all hands now turned their attention to
raising the sail, and by the time the advance-guard of cat pirates
came rushing down through the pussy-willow grove in their pursuit, the
<i>Merry Mouser</i>, borne along by a breeze that was something more
than a
catspaw, was fast leaving the shores of Catnip Island behind her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII
<br>
MUTINY ON BOARD</h2>
<br>
<p>For some time the children leaned over the rail looking back at the
group of cats gathered at the water's edge. The form of the Pirate
Chief towered above them all as he ran up and down the beach yowling
out all sorts of commands to which was paid very little attention by
any one, and stopping every little while to flourish an angry paw in
the direction of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>.</p>
<p>Peter regarded him sadly. "Poor old Mitts," he sighed, "it was an
awful mean trick to play on him! He hasn't got any other boat and he
looks so mad, I b'lieve he'd swim after us if he could."</p>
<p>"He could, all right," said Prowler gravely, "but he'd get his paws
wet, and that's a serious thing, you know."</p>
<p>Rudolf and Ann burst out laughing, and even Peter smiled, for it
seemed to them a funny thing for a pirate to fuss about.</p>
<p>"Now," exclaimed Rudolf, as the breeze freshened and the forms of
the
cat pirates began to fade from sight, "there's a great deal to be
attended to. What do you think we'd better get at first?"</p>
<p>"My pink pajamas!" cried Prowler, leaping in the air and turning a
double somersault in his delight.</p>
<p>"My paper collars!" shouted Growler, following his example.</p>
<p>Rudolf was disgusted with the two mates for thinking of such
nonsense
at a time like this, but it was no use trying to do anything with
them. They left the <i>Merry Mouser</i> to his management, and rushed
below
to bring up the False Hare's suit case. When they returned they were
followed by the two spotted sailors whom they introduced to the
children as Toddles and Towser. Toddles and Towser were still very
sleepy. They had managed to free themselves by chewing the string that
bound their paws, but they did not seem at all disturbed by the change
in affairs or inclined to make any trouble.</p>
<p>Rudolf placed them both at the wheel with stern directions to keep
each other awake if possible. He then went below to see if he could
find his sword before either Growler or Prowler should take a fancy to
it. It was hanging up over Captain Mittens' berth, and under the
Chief's pillow, neatly folded ready for the night, Rudolf found
Peter's pajamas. As they were quite dry now, he called Peter and
insisted on his putting them on, much against the little boy's
wishes, for hot and tight and furry as his borrowed suit had been,
Peter had felt gloriously like a pirate in it! Very sulkily he
followed his brother out of the cabin, but when the two had mounted to
the deck Peter's sulks gave way to a burst of giggles at the sight of
Growler and Prowler.</p>
<p>Ann was sitting on the deck quite weak with laughter, while the two
mates, dressed in their stolen finery, paraded up and down in front of
her. Prowler's pink pajamas were a better fit for him than Growler's
paper collar which nearly concealed his pirate's nose, only the points
of his whiskers and the tips of his black ears showing. Ann had added
to his costume by the loan of her blue hair-ribbon which she had tied
in a nice bow on the tip of his tail. But Prowler, if possible, looked
even more silly than Growler, for he copied the actions of Captain
Mittens as closely as he could, folding his paws on his chest and
scowling gloomily about him. He seemed extremely vexed when the
children laughed, but they really could not help it, since a pirate in
pink pajamas is not particularly dreadful. At last, after much
coaxing, Rudolf got the whole party to sit down in a circle on the
deck and consult with him on some plan of action.</p>
<p>"We <i>must</i> make up our minds," said he firmly, "on where we
are going,
and what is the nearest land, and what we are going to do when we get
there, and who is in command of the <i>Merry Mouser</i>, anyway, and&#8212;"</p>
<p>Here he was interrupted by Prowler who said would he please go a
little slower, for Rudolf was making his head ache and it reminded him
of going to his aunt's to say his catechism.</p>
<p>"The thing ter do," drawled Growler sleepily, "is ter do nothin'
'tall
till ye git somewheres where somethin's gotter be did, an' then
like's not it's too late ter do anything an' all yer trouble's saved
for ye!"</p>
<p>Rudolf did not think much of this as advice, but Prowler seemed
delighted. "Hurrah, my hearties!" he shouted, and up he jumped, stood
on his furry head on the deck, and waved his pink pajamaed legs in the
air. "Now we can have our tea!" he cried.</p>
<p>The faces of the three children brightened at the pleasant thought
of
tea, and when the tray arrived, carried by Towser, Ann asked if she
might pour.</p>
<p>"Paw away!" cried Prowler, grinning widely as he fixed his round
yellow eyes on a small covered dish that Toddles had just set before
him.</p>
<p>Ann lifted the cover of the tea-pot to peep inside but as she
sniffed
the steam an expression of disgust wrinkled up her little nose.
"Ugh!" she cried, "it's catnip tea."</p>
<p>"Course it is," answered Prowler calmly. "Catnip tea and stewed
mouses' tails&#8212;an' I asks what could anybody want nicer?"</p>
<p>"Little girls that don't like what's put before 'em can go without.
Ever hear anything like that before?" asked Growler sweetly, and as he
spoke he reached over and took the covered dish away from Prowler and
helped himself to it largely.</p>
<p>"But we don't any of us like this kind of a tea!" cried Rudolf
angrily.</p>
<p>"Then all the more for us that does," said Prowler, and he snatched
the dish in his turn away from Growler and emptied all that was left
of it on his own plate. Since there was nothing else for the children
to do, they sat and watched the two mates eat, all of them feeling
decidedly cross, especially Peter. When every drop was finished and
every crumb licked up, Growler said to Prowler, "Time for a nap, old
boy," and without so much as a look in the children's direction the
two rude fellows turned tail and marched off arm in arm to their
bunks.</p>
<p>"Well, they <i>are</i> nice!" cried Ann. "And what are <i>we</i>
going to do, I
would like to know?"</p>
<p>"What we are going to do," said Rudolf thoughtfully, "is probably to
be shipwrecked. Oh, not <i>right</i> away," he added quickly as he saw
how
frightened his little sister looked. "But there's land close ahead, as
sure as sure can be, and, if I'm not much mistaken, Toddles and Towser
have both gone to sleep at the wheel."</p>
<p>It was true. The two common sea-cats had left the wheel to take care
of itself and had curled themselves up in a soft round ball on the
deck for a nap from which the children found it impossible to arouse
them.</p>
<p>"I will try to steer and also mind the sheet, I think that's what
it's
called," said Rudolf, "but as I don't know <i>much</i> about sailing a
boat
except what I've read in books, and you and Peter don't know
<i>anything</i>, I think the least we'll do will be to run her aground."</p>
<p>"Let's try to wake Growler and Prowler up," Ann begged. "They can't
be
sound asleep yet."</p>
<p>The two mates were not only sound asleep but snoring loudly. Ann and
Peter tried shaking them, spanking them, even drenching them with the
cold remains of the catnip tea, but it was all no use, they could not
get them to stir. Meanwhile the <i>Merry Mouser</i> was drifting
dangerously near land, in spite of all Rudolf could do to prevent her.
He did several things and he ordered Peter and Ann to do a good many
others, but all of them felt glad the False Hare was not there to
compliment them on their seamanship. At last there came a dull shock
and a jar, and the <i>Merry Mouser</i> ran her nose into a sand-bar,
quivered all over, and then stood still.</p>
<p>"The thing to do <i>now</i>" said Rudolf easily, just as if he had
planned
it all, "is for us to get into the little boat we are towing and row
ourselves ashore. Of course we must wake up the mates and the crew and
take them with us."</p>
<p>It was simply astonishing the things those children had to do to
Growler and Prowler before they could get either of them so much as to
open an eye! When they were at last able to understand what had
happened, they merely turned over and growled out: "Oh, is <i>that</i>
all?
Aground, are we? Ye needn't have waked us up for <i>that</i>! Be off
as
soon as ye like and give us some rest&#8212;do!" They had hardly left off
speaking before they were sound asleep again. As for Toddles and
Towser they refused to wake at all.</p>
<p>The children left them where they lay and climbed Over the side of
the
<i>Merry Mouser</i> into the little rowboat which Rudolf had brought
alongside. When all were safely aboard, he cut loose the tow-rope,
took the oars, and pulled away from the pirate ship. After a short and
pleasant row they reached a gently shelving beach where it was not
difficult to make a landing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX
<br>
CAPTAIN JINKS</h2>
<br>
<p>Ann stood and stared at the line of low hills that fringed the edge
of
the water. "What funny, funny country!" she exclaimed. "It's like a
checker-board going up-hill."</p>
<p>"No, it isn't either," said Rudolf, who loved to disagree, "because
the squares are not square, they're all different shapes and sizes and
they're not just red and black but ever and ever so many different
colors."</p>
<p>"It's something like the countries in the geography maps, anyway,"
said Ann.</p>
<p>"It's like patchwork," said Peter, and he came nearest the truth.</p>
<p>As it did not seem likely they would need the little boat again, the
children left it to float away if it liked, and crossed the strip of
gray sand to where they saw a little pink and white striped path
winding up the side of a crimson hill. This path they began to follow,
and it took them by so many twists and turns that they hardly noticed
the climb. When the last loop brought them to the top of the slope
they stood still and looked about them, surprised and delighted at the
beauty of the bare bright hills that sloped away in front of them.</p>
<p>The ground under their feet was now a bright beautiful yellow,
powdered all over with little white dots that proved to be daisies.
With shouts of delight, Ann and Peter stooped to gather these, but
Rudolf cried out: "Oh, look, look! Don't let's stop here. It's
prettier yet farther on!" So on they ran, all three of them, over the
yellow ground, over a stretch of green and blue checks, across a
lavender meadow, and found themselves at last in a wonderful pale
blue field scattered all over with bunches of little pink roses.</p>
<p>"This is the prettiest yet," exclaimed Ann, "though of course it is
very old-fashioned. I wonder what it reminds me of? Ruddy, do you
remember that picture of Aunt Jane when she was little in such a funny
dress with low neck and short sleeves&#8212;"</p>
<p>The children had been wandering across the field as Ann spoke,
stopping to pull a rose here and there, too busy and too happy to
notice where their feet were taking them. All at once they looked up
and saw that they had come to the end of the pale blue field where it
bordered on a broad brown road. Just ahead of them stood a little
white tent, and from the door of the tent two tin soldiers suddenly
sprang out, shouldered arms, and cried: "Halt!"</p>
<p>Of course the children halted. There was nothing else to do, so
astonished were they to meet any one when they had supposed themselves
to be in quite a wild and uninhabited country. Besides, though these
were small and tinny-looking, yet soldiers are soldiers wherever you
meet them, and have an air about them which makes people feel
respectful. These two handled their little guns in a most businesslike
manner. The taller of the two, who seemed by his uniform to be a
superior officer, now stepped forward and snapped out: "Give the
countersign!"</p>
<p>The children stood still and stared, Peter with his thumb in his
mouth.</p>
<p>"We haven't got any, sir, so we can't give it to you," said Ann at
last.</p>
<p>"Silly! He means <i>say</i> it," whispered Rudolf in her ear.</p>
<p>"We can't say it either," Ann went on, "because we don't know it.
But
we know lots of other things," she added, looking pleadingly at the
officer. "Rudolf, he can say the whole of ''Twas the night before
Christmas, and all through the house not a creature was stirring, not
even a mouse'&#8212;and I can say 'The Gentle Cow all Red and White I Love
with all my Heart',&#8212;and Peter he says 'I have a Little Shadow',&#8212;he
knows it all, every word!"</p>
<p>The little officer turned sharply to his companion. "Make a note of
that, Sergeant," he snorted. "Head it, suspicious information: first
prisoner, probably dangerous burglar burgling on Christmas eve; second
prisoner, cattle thief; third prisoner&#8212;"</p>
<p>"But we aren't anything like that," broke in Rudolf hastily. "You're
entirely mistaken, we&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Say what you are, then," snapped the officer, "and where you have
come from and where you are going and what you are going to do when
you get there; say it, quick!" And raising his little gun, the officer
pointed it straight at Rudolf's nose.</p>
<p>"We have come from Catnip Island where we were captured by the cat
pirates," began Rudolf, stumbling over the words in his excitement,
"and we&#8212;we don't know exactly where we are going, and we&#8212;we aren't
doing exactly anything!"</p>
<p>"Aha!" The officer turned to his sergeant with a triumphant
expression. "Just what I thought. Anybody that can't give a better
account of himself than that had better be locked up. Spies&#8212;aha!
Another of you came ashore a while ago&#8212;a glib-tongued, story-telling
gentleman who fooled us into letting him off, but we've got <i>you</i>
safe
and sound and here you'll stay! Sergeant, arrest these spies!"</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir," said the sergeant, making a note of it in his
book,
"but please, sir, how do they be spelled, Captain Jinks, sir?"</p>
<p>"S-p-i-s-e, spies, of course, idiot!" snapped the captain. "Now
then,
off with 'em. Separate cell for each prisoner, bars to the windows.
Heavy chains on this gentleman in particeler," pointing to Rudolf.
"Bread and water, on a Sunday. Off to the jail with 'em&#8212;march 'em
along!"</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, sir," interrupted the sergeant who was glad of an
excuse
to stop at a very difficult bit of spelling. "We'll have to wait a
bit. I hear the Queen's band playin'&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Then stand at attention and hold yourself answerable for the
prisoners!" With this command, Captain Jinks faced about to the road,
and stiffened all over till he looked like a little tin statue. For
some time the children had been hearing the sound of music, at first
faint and far-away, now growing louder and louder. The sergeant
pulled them hastily to the side of the road, and bade them in a gruff
voice, "Keep quiet, or he'd settle 'em!" Then he, too, stiffened all
over just as Captain Jinks had done, and both of them presented arms.
The head of a procession was coming in sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X
<br>
MEETING A QUEEN</h2>
<br>
<p>First came a large company of soldiers almost exactly like Captain
Jinks and the sergeant, except that their uniforms were a little
shabbier-looking, and their arms a little less brightly polished. They
held themselves stiffly and marched very well, in spite of the fact
that many of them had suffered severe injuries, such as the loss of a
leg or an arm at the least, in some former campaign, and all of them
were rather the worse for wear. After the soldiers came the band,
playing shrilly on their tiny instruments, and next, to the children's
delight and astonishment, rolled a number of little carriages drawn by
mechanical horses. Rudolf was so keenly interested in the working of
these mechanical horses, that he hardly noticed the fine ladies who
sat stiffly on the cushioned seats of the carriages, very grandly
dressed, and holding beautiful pink and blue parasols over their
curled heads.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ann grabbed his arm and whispered: "Look, look! Did you see
them? Marie-Louise and Angelina-Elfrida, my <i>own</i> dolls, and they
never so much as bowed!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps they didn't know you," whispered Rudolf.</p>
<p>"They did, too," returned his sister angrily. "They just laughed and
turned their heads the other way, horrid things! Just wait, I'll tell
them what I think of them; but, oh, Rudolf, here come more carriages
and more dolls in them, and how queerly they are dressed, these last,
I mean! I never saw any dolls like them before. See their poke
bonnets, and their fringed mantles, and their little hoop-skirts,
but, oh, look, <i>look</i>, can that be the Queen?"</p>
<p>Ann's voice sounded disappointed as well as surprised, and in her
excitement she spoke so loud that Captain Jinks himself turned his
threatening eye on her and called out: "Silence!" But Ann paid no
attention to him, nor did the other children; the eyes of all three
were fixed upon a little figure who rode all alone at the very end of
the procession. They knew she must be the Queen by the respectful way
in which Captain Jinks and the sergeant saluted, but she was very
different from what they had imagined a Queen to be. The wooden horse
which she rode was not handsome, indeed one of his legs was missing,
but he pranced and curvetted so proudly upon the remaining three that
it seemed as if he knew he carried a Queen upon his back. The royal
lady kept her seat with perfect ease, and when she came opposite the
children, she checked her steed, halted, and gazed down upon them.</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten me?" she said. Then she smiled and they knew her
at once. It was the corn-cob doll! Though she had grown so much larger
and seemed so much grander, yet she looked just the same as when they
had taken her out of Aunt Jane's sandal-wood box from which, the
children now remembered, certain tin soldiers and a three-legged
wooden horse had also come! The Queen still wore her flowing
greeny-yellow gown, her hair was braided in two long braids that hung
over her shoulders, and she carried her quaint little head high, in
truly royal fashion.</p>
<p>Now she dismounted gracefully from her horse and came toward the
children, holding out her hand. They dared not look her in the face.
They were all three ashamed to speak to her, and especially Rudolf who
remembered only too clearly all the unkind things he had said about
the corn-cob doll, and how very, very near he had come to roasting her
over the nursery fire! Whatever would happen, thought he, if any of
her subjects who seemed to stand in such awe of her, should find out
that attempt on their Queen's life? Captain Jinks would probably think
imprisonment on bread and water entirely too good for him, probably it
would be slow torture.</p>
<p>"Answer her majesty," muttered the captain in his ear, "or I'll have
your head cut off!"</p>
<p>Still Rudolf, blushing fiery red, and not knowing what to say,
continued to stare down at his toes. Peter put his thumb in his mouth,
Ann hung down her head; neither of them was any better off.</p>
<p>The little tin captain stepped eagerly forward. "Shall I give orders
to prepare for the execution, your Majesty?" he began, in a voice
full of pleased excitement. "These suspicious persons are already
under arrest. They would furnish very excellent targets for the
artillery practise? If it should please your Majesty to offer a prize
for the best shot? Or, if your Majesty is in a <i>hurry</i>, now, a
nice
dip in boiling oil would finish them off very neatly!"</p>
<p>"Be quiet, Jinks," said the Queen frowning. "You talk so much I
can't
think. If it wasn't for those tiresome revolutions in my capital city,
I believe I'd banish you. Let me see, how many of them have you
suppressed for me?"</p>
<p>"Exactly twelve, your Majesty," answered Jinks with a low bow, "and
I
beg to announce that we are at this moment on the brink of the
thirteenth&#8212;baker's dozen, your Majesty."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's the baker this time, is it?" asked the Queen with a sigh.
"What's the matter with <i>him</i>, Jinks?"</p>
<p>"Same old trouble, your Majesty. Your court, those doll ladies in
particular, have become so haughty&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Naughty, you mean, Jinks," corrected the Queen.</p>
<p>"So haughty <i>and</i> naughty, your Majesty, that they've
absolutely
refused to eat their crusts. Did anybody, I ask your Majesty, ever
hear the likes of that?"</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence. The Queen shook her head. The children
tried to appear at their ease, but they were not. Ann looked
particularly uncomfortable. She was not fond of her crusts.</p>
<p>"Well, go on, Jinks, what else?" said the Queen.</p>
<p>"Well, your Majesty, this keeps the baker busy day and night baking
'em bread, not to speak of the cakes and pies, and he says he feels he
hadn't orter stand it any longer. He's going to strike. As for the
populace, your Majesty, they only get the stale loaves or none at
all, and they're wild, your Majesty, very wild indeed."</p>
<p>"I suppose they are, Jinks," sighed the Queen.</p>
<p>"And the worst of it is, your Majesty, we're very short of soldiers.
The Commander-in-Chief"&#8212;both Jinks and the sergeant drew themselves
up and saluted at the name&#8212;"has taken a whole company to the seaboard
for to repel the cat pirates, and very fierce them pirates are, I've
heard tell. We may have to send him reinforcements at any time."</p>
<p>"The Commander-in-Chief, Jinks," said the Queen haughtily, "is a
great
general. He will manage the pirates and the baker, too, if you can't
do it. And if the worst should come to the worst before he gets back,
why I'll just abdicate, that's all, and the baker can be king and much
good may it do him." She turned to the children and smiled at them.
"Now," she said, "you shall come with me and I will show you where I
used to live before I was a Queen."</p>
<p>The corn-cob doll waved her hand, gave an order, and immediately the
carriage in which sat Marie-Louise and Angelina-Elfrida was turned and
driven back to where the children stood.</p>
<p>"These ladies will enjoy a walk," said the Queen.</p>
<p>Very sulkily the two elegant doll-ladies got out of their carriage,
not daring to disobey, and passed by Ann, noses in the air, without so
much as a nod.</p>
<p>"Never mind them, dears," said the Queen kindly. "They don't know
any
better. Now jump in!"</p>
<p>The children obeyed, hardly able to believe in their good luck, and
in
another moment, much to the surprise and indignation of Captain
Jinks, they were rolling away from him, the Queen riding close beside
their carriage.</p>
<p>"You are safe now," said she, "at least until the revolution begins.
If Jinks should fire his cannon, that's a sign it's starting, but
don't worry"&#8212;as she saw that the children were looking rather
alarmed&#8212;"I dare say it will blow over without a battle. And now I
want you to look about you, for I don't think you have ever seen
anything like this before."</p>
<p>They had not indeed, and as their shyness wore off, the children
began
to ask the Queen a great many questions. Was this her capital city
they were coming to? Were those the stores where all the dolls'
clothes in the world came from? Was it real water in the little
fountain playing in the middle of the square? All this time they were
being carried swiftly through the streets of the neatest, prettiest,
little, toy town any one could wish to see. Both sides of the main
street were lined with little shops, and as the children leaned out of
the carriage for a brief glimpse into their glittering windows, they
saw sights that made them long to stop and look more closely.</p>
<p>There were clothing shops, shoe shops, candy shops, a very
grand-looking milliner's establishment where the children were amused
to catch a glimpse of Angelina-Elfrida and Marie-Louise trying on
hats, and a gaily decorated doll theater where a crowd of dolls were
pushing their way in to see a Punch and Judy show. There were markets
where busy customers thronged to buy all sorts and kinds of doll
eatables, turkeys and chickens the size of sparrows and humming-birds,
yellow pumpkins as big as walnuts, red-cheeked apples like
cranberries, cabbages fully as large as the end of your thumb, and
freshly baked pies as big around as a penny.</p>
<p>Peter's eyes nearly popped out of his head as he passed all these
good
things without hope of sampling any of them! The last shop they passed
was that of the royal baker, and they noticed that its windows were
boarded up, while a crowd of common dolls stood about in front of the
door, muttering angrily.</p>
<p>But now the business part of the town was left behind, and the
children were being driven through street after street of gaily
painted, neatly built, little houses with gardens full of tiny
bright-colored flowers, stables, garages&#8212;everything complete that the
heart of the most exacting doll in the world could desire. Ann and
Peter were quite wild about it all, and even Rudolf condescended to
admire. Now the houses were left behind and they entered a little
park, where tiny artificial lakes glittered and stiff little trees
were set about on the bright green grass. In the center of this park
stood the doll palace. It was pure white, finished in gold, and had
real glass windows in it, and white marble steps leading up to it, and
high gilded gates where a guard of soldiers turned out to present
arms, and a band was beginning to play. The rest of the procession
turned in at the gates of the palace, but rather to the children's
disappointment, the Queen gave their coachman orders to drive on.</p>
<p>"You may see my palace afterward, if we have time," she said, "but I
want to take you first of all to see my dear old home where I used to
live when I was a girl, when the little mother took care of me."</p>
<p>The children looked at one another. Then Peter said boldly: "Was
that
when you were Aunt Jane's doll? You weren't a Queen <i>then</i>, were
you?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed," answered her majesty, smiling. "I was just an ugly
little doll, the happiest, best-loved little doll in all the world,
and with the dearest little mother. But here we are, and you shall see
for yourself what a snug home I had."</p>
<p>The old doll house looked neat enough from the outside, to be sure,
but I am afraid if the children had run across it in the attic at Aunt
Jane's they would have taken it for a couple of large packing-boxes
set one upon the other. Once inside, however, they forgot how
impatient they had been to see the palace and its gorgeous
furnishings, they were so interested and amused by the homely
furnishings and neat little arrangements so proudly displayed to them
by the Corn-cob Queen.</p>
<p>She led the children through one room after another, explaining each
thing as they passed it. Those little muslin curtains at the windows,
the little mother had hemmed them all herself. It was she who had made
that wonderful cradle out of cardboard, with sheets from a pair of
grandfather's old pocket-handkerchiefs, she who had pieced that
tiniest of tiny patchwork quilts! In the kitchen that neat set of pots
and pans made from acorns and the shells of walnuts was the work of
her hands, assisted, perhaps, by the penknife of a certain little boy.
That blue and white tea-set on the pantry shelves&#8212;the children
recognized it at once as having come out of the sandal-wood box&#8212;why
it was almost worn out from the number of cups of tea the old doll and
her little mother had taken together in the good old days!</p>
<p>"It's just the dearest little house in the world," sighed Ann, when,
after having seen and admired everything to their heart's content,
they took their places in the carriage again, "and we don't wonder you
love it! The things that come straight from the toy shops are not
really half so nice as the things you fix yourself&#8212;we understand now.
But I suppose," she added thoughtfully, "you find it much grander
being a Queen?"</p>
<p>"Grander, perhaps," sighed the corn-cob doll, "but a great deal more
of a nuisance. However&#8212;"</p>
<p>Just then the pop of a toy cannon interrupted the Queen's speech.
They
had driven back almost to the palace, and could see a crowd of common
dolls of all kinds and sizes gathering on the green in front of the
gilded gates. At the same moment a troop of soldiers, headed by the
little tin captain, came running from the direction of the town
evidently with the intention of putting a stop to the disturbance.</p>
<p>"The revolution," said the Queen calmly, "just as I expected. Now I
am
afraid I shall have to send you out of town."</p>
<p>"But why?" Rudolf began in his arguing voice. "We don't <i>want</i>
to go.
We want to stay and fight on your side, and I'm sure we'd be very
useful! Why I'd just as lief command your army as not, and&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," said the Corn-cob Queen, "but what would
Captain Jinks say to that? He is in command, you know. And if he
<i>should</i> fail me, why the Commander-in-Chief will soon be back
from
capturing the cat pirates."</p>
<p>"Who is this fellow you call the Commander-in-Chief, anyway?" Rudolf
interrupted crossly.</p>
<p>The Queen looked him straight in the eye. "I hope," she said, "that
you may all be allowed to see him some day, if you are good. He is a
<i>great</i> soldier. He never sulks, and always obeys without asking
questions. That is more than some little boys do." Rudolf hung his
head, and the Queen added hastily: "But now I see that Captain Jinks
and the baker are going to hold a conference. I must go and join them.
Your coachman will drive you out of town the back way. Now where would
you like to go?"</p>
<p>"Back to our Aunt Jane, please," said Ann quickly. "Can you tell us
the way?"</p>
<p>"No," said the Queen, "I mustn't, but I have a friend who is a
dream-keeper just over the border, and I think he may be able to help
you. I'll tell the coachman to drive you there. Now good-by!"</p>
<p>"Good-by, good-by!" called the children. The coachman touched up the
horses, they were whirled away in a cloud of dust through which they
looked back regretfully at the queenly figure on the little wooden
horse who waved her hand again and again in kindly farewell. They saw
her joined by Captain Jinks and by a stout person in a white cap and
apron who handed the Queen what seemed to be some kind of document
printed upon a large sheet of pie crust.</p>
<p>"That was the Baker, I guess," said Rudolf, "and I dare say what he
was handing her was the declaration of war! Oh, what a shame it is we
are going to miss all the fun!"</p>
<p>"And the refreshments," sighed Peter. "We <i>always</i> do! I never
did
taste a declarashun of war, but it looked awful good. The very next
time I see one, I'm going to&#8212;"</p>
<p>But what Peter was going to do Ann and Rudolf did not hear, for at
that moment they were all three nearly spilled out of the little
carriage by the furious rate at which their driver turned a corner.
They had left the dolls' city far behind them and were out on the long
brown road that led past the little tent where the children had been
arrested by Jinks and the sergeant. Now they were out in the open
country hurrying past the wonderful bright-colored plains, past fields
of pink and purple, blue and green and yellow, white and scarlet,
faster and faster all the time, the horses rushing along with such
curious irregular jerks and bounds that it was almost impossible for
the children to keep their seats, and they expected at each moment to
be dumped in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>"Look out!" shouted Rudolf to the coachman. "Don't you see you are
going to upset us?"</p>
<p>The coachman was a very grand-looking person in a white and gold
livery. He never even turned his powdered head as he shouted back:</p>
<p>"Didn't have no&#8212;or-ders&#8212;not&#8212;to!" And for some time they tore on
faster than ever.</p>
<p>At last Ann leaned forward and caught hold of one of the coachman's
little gold-embroidered coat tails. "Oh, do take care," she cried,
"you might run somebody down!"</p>
<p>"That's it,"&#8212;the coachman's voice sounded faint and jerky, and the
children could hardly catch the words that floated back to them:
"Running&#8212;down&#8212;run-ing&#8212;down! As&#8212;fast&#8212;as&#8212;ev-er&#8212;I&#8212;can.
Most&#8212;com-pli-cated&#8212;insides&#8212;in&#8212;all&#8212;the&#8212;king-dom. Can't&#8212;be
&#8212;wound&#8212;up&#8212;not&#8212;by&#8212;likes&#8212;of&#8212;you&#8212;"</p>
<p>The horses were no longer galloping, now they were slowing up, now
they stopped, but with such a sudden jerk that all three children were
tumbled out into the road. They had been expecting this to happen for
so long that the thing was not such a shock after all, and somehow
they landed without being hurt in the slightest. They picked
themselves up, and saw the little carriage standing at the side of the
road, the horses perfectly motionless, each with a forefoot raised in
the air, the coachman stiff and still upon his box, <i>gazing</i>
straight
in front of him.</p>
<p>"He'll stay like that," said Peter mournfully, rubbing the dust from
his knees, "till he's wound up again. I wish we had the key!"</p>
<p>"I wish we did," said Rudolf crossly. "You know what Betsy says
about&#8212;'If wishes were horses, beggars could ride'&#8212;well, they aren't,
so we've got to walk now. I wonder where we are?"</p>
<p>Looking around them, the children saw that they had come to the very
last of the many colored fields, where the brown road ended in a
stretch of creamy-yellow grass. Just beyond a thick woods began, but
was divided from the creamy field by a broad bright strip of color,
like a long flower bed planted with flowers of all kinds and colors
set in all sorts of different patterns&#8212;stars, triangles, diamonds,
and squares.</p>
<p>"That's the border," shouted Ann, "and over there somewhere we'll
find
the person the Queen said would help us get back to Aunt Jane. Come
on!" As she spoke she bounded off across the field, the two boys after
her, and in less time than it takes to tell it they had run through
the tall yellow grass, jumped the border, and stood upon the edge of
the wood.</p>

<br>
THE GOOD DREAMS</h2>
<br>
<p>A thin screen of bushes was all that hid from the children's eyes
the
people whose voices they could hear so plainly.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's some kind of picnic they're having in there," cried
Peter,
pushing eagerly forward. "Come on quick!"</p>
<p>"No, you don't, either," whispered Rudolf, catching him and holding
him back. "Don't let's get caught this time, let's peep through first
and see what the people are like."</p>
<p>"Yes, do let's be careful," pleaded Ann. "We don't want to get
arrested again, it's not a bit nice&#8212;though I suppose if this is where
the Queen's friend lives, it isn't likely anything so horrid will
happen to us."</p>
<p>"Do stop talking, Ann, and listen. Whoever they are in there, they
are making so much noise they can't possibly hear me, so I'm going to
creep into those bushes and see what I can see."</p>
<p>As he spoke Rudolf carefully parted the bushes at a spot where they
were thin and peeped between the leaves, Ann and Peter crowding each
other to see over his shoulder. They looked into a kind of open glade
not much larger than a good-sized room and walled on all sides by tall
trees and thick underbrush. It had a flooring of soft green turf, and
about in the middle lay a great rock as large as a playhouse. This
rock was all covered over with moss and lichens, and the strange thing
about it was that a neat door had been cut in its side. Before this
door, talking and waving his hands to the crowd that thronged about
him, stood a man&#8212;the queerest little man the children had ever seen!
He looked like a collection of stout sacks stuffed very tightly and
tied firmly at the necks. One sack made his head, another larger one
his body, four more his arms and legs. His broad face, though rather
dull, wore a good-humored expression, and he smiled as he looked about
him.</p>
<p>A pile of empty sacking-bags lay on the ground beside him, and from
time to time he caught up one of these, ran his eye over the crowd,
chose one of them, and popped him, or it, as it happened to be, into
the sack which he then swung on his shoulder and heaved into the open
doorway in the big rock, where it disappeared from sight. He would
then taken another sack and make a fresh selection, looking about him
all the while with sleepy good humor, and paying little if any
attention to the cries, questions, and complaints with which he was
attacked on all sides.</p>
<p>What a funny lot they were&#8212;this crowd that surrounded the little
man!
The children could hardly smother their excitement at the sight of
them. Not people or animals only were they, but all kinds of odd
objects also, such as no one could expect to see running about loose.
A Birthday Cake was there, with lighted candles; a little pile of
neatly darned socks and stockings, a white-cotton Easter Rabbit with
pink pasteboard ears, a Jolly Santa Claus, a smoking hot Dinner, a
Nice Nurse who rocked a smiling baby, a brown-faced grinning
Organ-Man, his organ strapped before him, his Monkey on his shoulder.
There were too many by far for the children to take in all at once,
but at the sight of one particular member of the crowd, the children
gasped with astonishment; and Peter's excitement nearly betrayed
them. There, lounging by the side of a mild-faced School-Mistress
Person, still smoking his chocolate cigarette, was&#8212;the False Hare!</p>
<p>"Look alive now!" the little man was crying out. "Who's next, who's
next?"</p>
<p>"Me, me, me&#8212;take me next, Sandy!" A dozen little voices cried this
at
one and the same time. There was a scramble, bursts of laughter,
followed by a sharp rebuke from Sandy. "No, you don't either. Stand
back, you small fry. No shoving!"</p>
<p>When Peter had seen and recognized the False Hare he had been so
excited that it had been almost impossible for Rudolf and Ann to keep
him quiet. Now, as he watched the scramble and the rush and the fuss
the funny crowd was making about the little man, he laughed out so
loud that it was too late even to pinch him. The children's presence
was discovered, and two, tall, silver candlesticks jumped from a
satin-lined box and ran to draw them into the middle of the glade.
Sandy, as the little man appeared to be called, paused in his
business, turned round, and smiled at the children.</p>
<p>"Now then," said he, "what are you doing here? Don't you know this
is
my busy night? Who are you, anyway? Not on my list, I'll warrant.
Who's dreams are you?"</p>
<p>"Nobody's," began Rudolf. "The Corn-cob Queen sent us to see if you
could tell us any way to get back to our Aunt Jane&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Nobody's?" interrupted the little man. "Did you say you were
Nobody's
dreams? Don't see him in the N's." And he took a printed list out of
his pocket and ran his eye anxiously over it. "Are you sure&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Please, he means we're not dreams," said Ann, stepping forward, "at
least we don't think so." She hesitated a second and then added: "It
depends on what happens to them. Are these all dreams?"</p>
<p>"All perfectly Good Dreams, or my name's not Sandman," answered the
baggy fellow briskly. "We don't handle the Bad Ones here, not us!"</p>
<p>Peter looked interested. "Where does the Bad Ones live?" he asked.
"I
wants to see them."</p>
<p>The Sandman shook his head at Peter. "Oh, no, you don't, little
boy,"
he said. "No, you don't! Don't you go meddling in their direction or
you'll get into trouble, take my word for it. They live way off in the
woods and they're a bad lot. They've got a worse boss than old Sandy!
No, no;&#8212;the good kind are trouble enough for me. What with the hurry
and the flurry and the general mix-up, something a little off color
will slip in now and then. Everybody makes mistakes <i>sometimes</i>!"</p>
<p>As he made this last remark Sandy cast a doubtful look at the False
Hare, who grinned and tipped his silk hat to him.</p>
<p>"I told Sandy <i>all</i> about myself," said the False Hare,
winking at the
children. "I told him I was just as good as I could be!"</p>
<p>The children could not help laughing. "I'm afraid you don't know him
as well as we do, Mr. Sandy," said Ann.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know about as much as I want to know about him," said Sandy,
pretending to frown very fiercely. "I've almost made up my mind to get
rid of him, but the truth is I don't really know just where he
belongs."</p>
<p>"Doesn't matter to <i>me</i> whether I spend the night with a
bald-headed
old gentleman or a bird-dog&#8212;all the same to <i>me</i>," said the False
Hare meekly. This speech sounded so like him that the children looked
at one another and burst out laughing again, at which the False Hare
gave a kind of solemn wink, sighed, and touched his eyes with a little
paper handkerchief he held gracefully in one paw.</p>
<p>The Sandman turned his back on the silly fellow, and went on with
his
explanations to the children: "We have a very select set of
customers," he said, "and it's our aim to supply 'em with the finest
line of goods on the market. Wears me to a frazzle sometimes, this
business does," he stopped to wipe from his brow a tiny stream of sand
that was trickling down it, "but I've got to keep at it! All the
folks, big and little, like Good Dreams, and want 'em every night, and
if they get mixed up or the quality's inferior, or there's not enough
to go around, I tell you what, it makes trouble for Sandy! But just
step a little nearer, and you shall see for yourselves how the whole
thing is managed."</p>
<p>The children followed Sandy, who walked back to the pile of empty
sacks, picked one up, compared the label on it with a name on his
list, and called out in a loud voice: "Mrs. Patrick O'Flynn, Wash
Lady&#8212;excellent character&#8212;never misses on a Monday&#8212;six
children&#8212;husband not altogether satisfactory. Here, now,
Noddy&#8212;Blink! I'll want some help, boys."</p>
<p>As he called out these two names, two very fat, sleepy boys, looking
like pillows with strings tied round their waists, slouched from
behind the rock where they had been waiting, and stood sulkily at
attention. There was a scramble and a rush and a fuss among the Good
Dreams, just as there had been before when the children first peeped
into the glade, each one struggling and pushing and crowding to get
ahead of the next, without any regard as to whether or not it was
wanted. It took a tremendous effort on the part of Sandy, together
with all the help the sleepy sulky boys would give, to get the right
collection of dreams into the Wash Lady's sack, and to keep the wrong
ones out.</p>
<p>"Letter from the Old Country," Sandy cried. "That's it, boys, more
lively there. Tell that Pound of Tea to step up&#8212;No, no pink silk
stockings to-day, thank you. Tell that Landlord the rent's paid, I'll
let him know when he's wanted. Hand over that pile of mended
clothing&#8212;and the pay envelope, mind it's the right amount&#8212;all the
rest of you, step aside!" Waving away a gay bonnet with a bird on it,
a bottle marked "Patent Medicine," and the persistent pink stockings,
the Sandman closed the mouth of Mrs. O'Flynn's sack, and swung it on
his shoulder, nodding to the children to watch what would happen.
Much excited, they crowded round the open door in the side of the big
rock and peered down into what seemed to be a kind of dark well with a
toboggan-slide descending into it. Sandy placed the Wash Lady's sack
at the top of the slide, and before the children could so much as
wink, it had slid off into the darkness and disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>"Oh, my!" cried Ann, "Is it a shoot-the-chutes? Does it bump when it
gets there?"</p>
<p>"No, no," said the Sandman. "No bumps whatsoever, the most
comfortable
kind of traveling I know, in fact you're there the same time you
start, and I'd like to know how you can beat that? I ought to know,
for I use this route myself on my rounds a little earlier in the
evening." He walked back to his pile of sacks, and picked up another
of them. "Now then," said he, examining the label, "who's next?
Aha&#8212;Miss Jane Mackenzie!"</p>
<p>The children could hardly believe their ears. "Oh, Ruddy," whispered
Ann in Rudolf's ear, "what kind of dreams do you suppose Aunt Jane
will get?"</p>
<p>"Sh! Listen, he's going to tell us," answered Rudolf.</p>
<p>The Sandman was gravely consulting his list.
"M-hm&#8212;Cook-that-likes-living-in-the-Country! Step this way, ma'am,
and don't take any more room than you can help. New Non-fadable Cheap
but Elegant Parlor Curtains&#8212;One Able-bodied Intelligent Gardener,
with a Generous Disposition&#8212;hurry the gentleman forward, boys, he's a
curiosity! What's next? Aha! One niece, two nephews&#8212;three perfectly
good children." Sandy paused, stared about him at the throng of
jumping, pushing dreams&#8212;then added: "Don't see 'em."</p>
<p>"Why, yes you do!" Ann was pulling impatiently at the Sandman's
sleeve&#8212;"Here you are." Then she turned to Rudolf and whispered
excitedly: "Don't you see? We must make the Sandman believe we are
Aunt Jane's Good Dreams, and then he'll send us back to her."</p>
<p>"I'd like a ride on that slide, all right!" returned Rudolf.</p>
<p>"But I doesn't want to go back to Aunt Jane yet," came the voice of
Peter clearly from behind them. "I shan't go till I've seen the Bad
Dreams."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" Rudolf turned round on him angrily. "Of course you'll
go.
You're the youngest, and you've <i>got</i> to mind us." And then
without
paying any more attention to Peter, Rudolf thrust himself in front of
the Sandman. "Here we are," he said. "We're all ready."</p>
<p>The Sandman looked the boy up and down, consulted his list again,
smiled and shook his head very doubtfully.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he said, "but I'm afraid you don't exactly answer. Just
listen to this." And he read aloud: "Number one. Boy: polite and
gentlemanly in manner&#8212;brown hair neatly smoothed and parted&#8212;Eton
suit, clean white collar, boots well polished&#8212;Latin grammar under
arm&#8212;"</p>
<p>He stopped. Rudolf, in his pajamas, with his ruffled locks, tin
sword,
and angry expression, did not answer very closely to this description.
The Cook-who-liked-living-in-the-Country, the
Gardener-with-the-Generous-Disposition, and several other Good Dreams
burst out laughing. Only the False Hare kept a solemn expression, but
Rudolf knew very well what <i>that</i> meant.</p>
<p>The Sandman continued: "Number two. Little girl: modest and timid in
her manners, not apt to address her elders until spoken to&#8212;hair
braided neatly and tied with blue ribbon&#8212;white apron over dark
dress&#8212;doing patchwork with a pleased expression. Has not forgotten
thimble&#8212;"</p>
<p>Here Sandy was interrupted by the Cook and the Gardener, who
declared
that if he didn't stop they'd die a-laughin', that they would! The
False Hare wiped away a tear, and none of the dreams seemed to
consider the description correct. Sandy shook his head again, as he
glanced at Ann in her nighty, her ruffled curls tumbling over her
flushed face&#8212;Ann without patchwork, thimble, or pleased expression!</p>
<p>"Afraid you won't do, miss," said he, looking quite sorry for her.
"Let's see what's next. Number three"&#8212;he read&#8212;"Very small boy: clean
blue sailor suit&#8212;white socks&#8212;looks sorry for&#8212;"</p>
<p>All turned to look at Peter, but Peter was not looking sorry for
anything&#8212;Peter was not there! Ann gave a hasty look all round the
glade, then burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Oh, Rudolf," she cried, "what shall we do? He's gone&#8212;he's slipped
away to find those Bad Dreams all by himself&#8212;you know how Peter is,
when he says he's going to do anything, he <i>will</i> do it. Oh, oh,
I
<i>ought</i> to have watched him!"</p>
<p>"Don't cry," said Rudolf hastily. "It's just as much my fault. You
stay here and I'll go fetch him back. I have my sword, you know."</p>
<p>"No, no," sobbed Ann. "Don't leave me. It was my fault&#8212;I promised
mother I would always look after Peter. We'll go together. The Sandman
will tell us where the Bad Dreams live, won't you?" she added, turning
to Sandy.</p>
<p>"There, there, of course I will," said the little man kindly. "I'd
go
along with you, if there wasn't such a press of business just now, but
you can see for yourselves what a mess things would be in if I should
leave. You must go right ahead, right into the thick of the woods.
Follow that path on the other side of the glade. You needn't be afraid
you'll miss those Bad Ones&#8212;they'll be on the lookout for you, I'm
afraid."</p>
<p>The children thanked Sandy for all his kindness, and turned to leave
him. "One moment," he cried, and he ran ahead of them to draw aside
the wall of prickly bushes and show them the little path he had spoken
of which wound from the Good Dreams' glade toward the heart of the
wood.</p>
<p>"Keep right on," said Sandy, "and don't be afraid. Remember&#8212;they're
a
queer lot, those fellows, but they can't hurt you if you are careful.
Don't answer 'em back and don't ask 'em too many questions. One thing
in particular&#8212;if they offer you anything to eat, don't taste a
mouthful of it. If you do it'll be the worse for you!"</p>
<p>Rudolf and Ann thought of Peter and his passion for "refreshments",
and they started hastily forward.</p>
<p>"Just <i>one</i> thing more," called Sandy after them. "About that
consignment of your aunt's, you know! I'll hold that over till you get
back, and we'll see what can be done. Maybe we can fit you in yet,
somehow. Now good-by, and good luck to you!"</p>
<p>"Good-by, and thank you!" Rudolf and Ann called back to him, and
then
they plunged into the path. The wall of bushes sprang back again
behind them, and cut them off from the shelter of the Good Dreams'
glade. As the path was very narrow, Rudolf walked first, sword drawn,
and Ann trotted behind him, trying not to think of what queer things
might be waiting behind the trees to jump out at them, trying only to
think of her naughty Peter, and how glad she would be to see him
again.</p>

<br>
ENTER THE KNIGHT-MARE</h2>
<br>
<p>At first it was easy enough for the children to follow the narrow
winding path which the Sandman had pointed out, but soon they came to
a part of the wood where the underbrush grew thicker and their path
lost itself in a network of other little paths spread out as if on
purpose to confuse them. Rudolf and Ann hurried along as fast as they
could go, but it was hard work to make their way through the tangled
undergrowth where the twisted roots set traps for their feet&#8212;and
caught them, too, sometimes&#8212;while overhead the tall trees met and
mingled their branches. From these hung down great masses of trailing
vines and spreading creepers like long, lean, hairy arms stretched
out to bar their way. Rudolf had to stop now and then to hack at these
arms with his sword before he and Ann could pass through. Worst of
all&#8212;the thick growth of trees made the wood so dark that they could
not see more than a few feet ahead of them.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ruddy, I'm sure we're not on the right path any more," said Ann
at last. "Peter is so little&#8212;he never, never could have pushed his
way through here!"</p>
<p>"N-no," admitted Rudolf. "Perhaps he couldn't, but maybe he stuck to
the right path, Ann, and if he did he's there by this time."</p>
<p>"But I don't want him to get there!" poor Ann cried. "That would be
much worse for him than being lost. If he's just around the wood
somewhere we can find him and bring him back and then coax Sandy to
send us all home by the toboggan-slide to Aunt Jane, but if he's found
the Bad Dreams or they've found him&#8212;Oh, Ruddy, how do we know what
awful things they may be doing to him!"</p>
<p>"Don't be a goose, Ann," said Rudolf stoutly, though he was really
beginning to feel worried himself. "You know they are only dreams if
they <i>are</i> bad. What can a dream do, anyway? They're not real."</p>
<p>"Oh, they're real enough," sighed little Ann. "Sometimes the things
in
dreams are real-er than real things. I'm 'fraid enough of real cows,
but <i>they</i> can't walk up-stairs like the dream cows can&#8212;and, oh,
I
remember the dream I dreamed about the Dentist-man, after I had my
tooth pulled, the one father gave me the dollar for&#8212;and&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Bother!" said Rudolf. "I've had lots worse dreams than cows and
dentists. P'licemen and Indian chiefs, and&#8212;oh, heaps of things, and I
didn't really mind 'em, either, but then I'm braver than&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Sh!" interrupted Ann, stopping and catching at Rudolf's arm. "I
hear
something&#8212;something queer. Listen!"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/wb017.jpg"
 title="&quot;I hear something&#8212;something queer.&quot;"
 alt="&quot;I hear something&#8212;something queer.&quot;"
 style="width: 512px; height: 787px;"></p>
<p>Rudolf listened. "I don't hear anything," he said at last. "What was
it like?"</p>
<p>"Oh, such a creepy, crawly sound, and&#8212;Oh, Ruddy&#8212;there is a face&#8212;see
it? A horrid little face peeping out at us from behind that tree!"</p>
<p>Rudolf saw the face too, a winking, blinking, leering, little face
much like the one that had grinned at Ann from the post of the big bed
not so very long ago.</p>
<p>All at once as the children looked about them, they began to see
faces
everywhere, faces in the crotches of the trees, faces where the
branches crossed high above their heads, faces even in the undergrowth
about their feet. It reminded Rudolf of the puzzle pictures he and Ann
were so fond of studying where you have to look and look before you
can find the hidden people, but when once you have found them you
wonder how you could have been so stupid as not to have spied them
long before. He heard distinctly now the noises Ann had heard. It was
as if the hidden places of the wood were full of small live things
which were gathering together and coming toward the children from
every direction, closing them in on every side. Then somebody laughed
in a high cracked voice just behind them, one of Ann's curls was
sharply pulled, and Rudolf's precious sword was plucked from his hand
and tossed upon the ground. Still they could see no bodies to which
the little faces could belong, and they began to feel very queer
indeed.</p>
<p>Then came the laugh again, repeated a number of times and coming now
from directly over their heads where the branches of a great beech
tree swept almost to the ground. Rudolf and Ann looked up just in time
to catch sight of the queer little creatures who were looking down at
them from between the beech leaves. It was no wonder they had been so
hard to see, for they were dressed in tight-fitting suits of fur
exactly the color of the bark, and had small pointed fur hoods upon
their heads which made them look very much like squirrels. Even now
that the children had spied them out, it was impossible to examine
them closely for they were never quiet, never in the same place more
than an instant, but swung themselves restlessly from bough to bough,
then to the ground and back again in two jumps, peeping, peering,
racing each other along the branches, all the time without the
slightest noise other than was made by their light feet among the
leaves and the two laughs the children had heard.</p>
<p>Rudolf picked up his sword, and said in as bold a voice as he could
manage&#8212;"Please, could any of you tell us the right path to&#8212;"</p>
<p>A burst of sharp squeals, shrill laughs, and jeering remarks
interrupted his question. The whole company of queer creatures dropped
to the ground at the same time, and instantly formed a circle about
the children, snapping their little white teeth, and grinning and
chattering like monkeys.</p>
<p>"Are you the Bad Dreams?" asked Rudolf. Then, as a burst of laughter
contradicted this idea&#8212;"Who are you, then?"</p>
<p>"Who are we? Who are we?" mocked the creatures. "O-ho, hear the
human!
Doesn't know us&#8212;never got scolded on <i>our</i> account, did he, did
he?
<i>Oh</i>, no; <i>oh</i>, no! Bite him, snatch him, scratch him! <i>Catch</i>
him!"</p>
<p>Closer and closer the horrid little things pressed about the two
children. "What do you mean, anyway?" cried Rudolf, keeping them back
with his foot as best he could. "Who are you? You're squirrels&#8212;that's
all you are!"</p>
<p>"Squirrels!" The leader of the little wretches seemed furious at the
idea. "No, no," he screamed, making a dash at Rudolf's leg with his
sharp teeth. "We're Fidgets, Fidgets, Fidgets! Don't you know the
Fidgets when you see 'em, you great blundering human, you? An old,
<i>old</i> family, that's what we are. Guess Methuselah had the Fidgets
sometimes, guess he did, did, did!" With every one of the last three
words he made a snatch at Rudolf, trying his best to bite him, and at
the same time dodging cleverly the blows Rudolf was now dealing on all
sides with his sword.</p>
<p>Ann had picked up a little stick and was doing her best to help
Rudolf
in his battle. "I know you," she cried, turning angrily on the
Fidgets, "you horrid little things! I've had you often, in school just
before it's out, and in church, and when mother takes me out to make
calls&#8212;you've disgraced her often&#8212;" Then she stopped, really afraid
of saying too much. The Fidgets, with a wild squeal, now began a mad
sort of dance round and round the two children, giving them now a nip,
now a pinch, now a sharp pull till they were dizzy and frightened and
weary of trying to defend themselves against such unequal numbers.</p>
<p>All at once, above the shrill cries of their enemies, the children
heard a new sound, a crackling rustling noise in the bushes as if some
large creature was making its way through the wood. The Fidgets heard
it, too, and in a twinkling they had hushed their shrill voices,
broken their circle, and completely hidden themselves from sight. It
was all so sudden that Rudolf and Ann had no time to run, but stood
perfectly still, gazing at the bushes just in front of them from which
the noises came.</p>
<p>As they looked the bushes were parted, and a long lean head poked
itself through, a large black head with a white streak down its nose,
and two great mournful eyes that stared into theirs. Ann gave a little
scream and shrank closer to Rudolf. The creature opened a wide mouth
that showed enormous, ugly, yellow teeth, and said in a rough but not
unfriendly voice: "Hullo! Oats-and-Broadswords&#8212;if it's not a couple
of lost colts! Where'd you come from, youngsters?"</p>
<p>Without waiting for them to answer, it crashed through the bushes
and
stood before them, a curious sight, indeed the strangest they had yet
seen in the course of their adventures. What they had thought was a
horse from the sight of its head, was a horse no farther down than the
shoulders, all the rest of him was a Knight, a splendid knight in full
armor of shining steel. He was without weapon of any kind, and even
while the children shrank from the sight of his big ugly head with its
sad eyes and long yellow teeth, they saw that this was not a creature
to be much afraid of.</p>
<p>"Well, I scared 'em away, didn't I?" he asked triumphantly, and
then,
hanging his head a little, he added in rather a humble tone, "It's
pretty poor sport hunting Fidgets, I know, but it's about all I can
get nowadays. Hope they didn't hurt you?" he added politely.</p>
<p>"Not a bit," said Rudolf, "but I'm sure I'm glad you came along when
you did, for I don't know how we ever would have got rid of the
beastly little things. Only when we first saw you, we thought&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know," interrupted the stranger hastily&#8212;"you thought it was
something worse. That's it, that's just my luck! I'm the gentlest
creature in the world and everybody's afraid of me. My business," he
explained, turning to Ann, "is to redress wrongs and to see after the
ladies, but&#8212;bless you&#8212;they won't let me get near enough to do
anything for 'em!" A great tear rolled down his long nose as he spoke,
and he looked so silly that Ann and Rudolf could hardly help laughing
at him, though they did not in the least want to be rude.</p>
<p>"And then," continued the creature, sobbing, "I'm so divided in my
feelings. If I were only <i>all</i> Knight, now, or even all Mare, I'd
be
thankful, but a Knight-mare is an unsatisfactory sort of thing to be."</p>
<p>"A Knight-mare&#8212;Oh, how dreadful!" cried Ann, drawing away from him.
"Is <i>that</i> what you are?"</p>
<p>"There! You see how it is!" exclaimed the Knight-mare, tossing his
long black mane. "Nobody's got any sympathy for me. How would <i>you</i>
like it? Suppose you were a little girl only as far as your shoulders
and all the rest of you hippopotamus, eh?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't like it at all," said Ann, after thinking a moment.</p>
<p>"Then no more do I," said the Knight-mare, and sighed a long sad
sigh.</p>
<p>"Would you mind telling us how it happened?" asked Rudolf politely.</p>
<p>"Not at all," said the Knight-mare. "You see I was a great boy for
fighting in the old days&#8212;though you mightn't think it to see me
now&#8212;and I used to ride forth to battle on my coal-black steed, this
very mare whose head I'm wearing now. Well, of course I was a terror
to my enemies, used to scare 'em into fits, and I suppose it was one
of those very fellows that got me into this fix, dreamed me into it
one night, you know, only he got me and my steed mixed. We've stayed
mixed ever since, and the worst of it is I oughtn't to be a Bad Dream
at all. I was the nicest kind of a Good Dream once&#8212;why I belonged to
a lady who lived in a castle, and she thought a lot of me, she did!"</p>
<p>"It's too bad," said Rudolf sympathetically; "but isn't there
anything
you can do about it?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," groaned the Knight-mare, "nothing at all. At least not
till
I can find a way to get rid of this ugly head of mine. If there was
anybody big enough and brave enough, now, to&#8212;" He interrupted his
speech to stoop down and snatch up something from the grass. It was
Rudolf's sword which he had dropped from his hand in his weariness
after his battle with the Fidgets. "What's this?" the Knight-mare
cried. "Hurrah, a sword!"</p>
<p>"My sword," said Rudolf, stretching out his hand for it.</p>
<p>"Just the thing for cutting heads off!" cried the Knight. "Will you
lend it to me, like a good fellow? Mine is lost."</p>
<p>"What for?" asked Rudolf suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Why, to cut my head off with, of course, or better yet, perhaps
you'll do it for me. Come, now! Just to oblige me?"</p>
<p>Rudolf took back his sword, while Ann gave a little scream and
seized
both the Knight's mailed hands in hers. "I'm sorry not to oblige you,"
said Rudolf firmly, "but I can't do anything of the sort. I never cut
anybody's head off in my life, and the sword's not so awful sharp,
you know, and then how can you tell a new head will grow at your time
of life?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'd risk that," said the Knight-mare lightly. "I do wish you'd
think it over. If you knew what a life mine is! All my days spent
browsing round on shoots here in the wood, without a single adventure
because nobody's willing to be rescued by the likes of me! And then
the nights! Oh"&#8212;groaned the poor fellow&#8212;"the nights are the worst of
all!"</p>
<p>"What do you do then?" asked Rudolf and Ann.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm ridden to death," sighed the Knight-mare. "As if it wasn't
bad enough to scare folks all day <i>not</i> meaning to, without being
sent
out nights to do it on purpose!" He looked over his shoulder as if he
was afraid some one might be listening, and then added in a low
voice, "And it's not my fault, either, I swear it's not. <i>They</i>
actually make me do it!"</p>
<p>The children shivered, for they guessed at once that "they" meant
the
Bad Dreams. Then they suddenly recollected poor little Peter, whom
their last adventure and the Knight-mare's talk had quite put out of
their minds.</p>
<p>"I tell you what," said Rudolf suddenly, "I'll make a bargain with
you. My little brother has run away to find the Bad Dreams, and we
have got to find him and bring him back. If you'll lead us to him and
help us all you can, why&#8212;why&#8212;I won't promise&#8212;but I'll see what I
can do for you."</p>
<p>The Knight-mare gave a loud triumphant neigh. "Ods-bodikins and bran
mash!" he cried. "You're worth rescuing for nothing, the whole lot of
you! But"&#8212;he added mournfully&#8212;"I ought to warn you to keep away
from that crowd&#8212;they're a bad lot. You'd do better to cut along
home."</p>
<p>"We can't do that," cried Rudolf and Ann together.</p>
<p>"Then come with me," said the Knight-mare. "It's only a short way
to&#8212;"</p>
<p>He was suddenly interrupted by a fresh commotion in the wood. Heavy
bodies were parting the undergrowth back of where they stood. Before
the children could think of escape, four strange figures sprang on
them from behind, their arms were seized, they were tripped up, and
they landed very hard upon the ground. Both knew in a moment what had
happened. The Bad Dreams had caught them!</p>

<br>
THE BAD DREAMS</h2>
<br>
<p>At first the children's view was entirely shut off by the size and
heaviness of the things that were sitting on their chests. They had
been completely taken by surprise and they had not even breath enough
left to cry out, but lay still and listened to what was going on about
them. This is what they heard:</p>
<p>"Ye arre arristid in the name of the Law!" a gruff voice was saying.
"Move on, move on, move on."</p>
<p>"One moment, Officer," a second voice interrupted. "Imprison these
young persons, if you are so disposed, but pray allow me first my
little opportunity to practise on them. This young lady&#8212;ahem! We will
begin by extracting that large molar on the upper left-hand side, we
will then have out two or three&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Ugh&#8212;ugh!" A series of hoarse grunts, and what had been sitting on
Rudolf rose up and rushed at the last speaker. "No, no! Big Chief
first! Big Chief Thunder-snorer take two fine scalp&#8212;ha! ha!"</p>
<p>There was a confused sound of struggling and voices arguing, and in
another moment Ann was relieved of her burden which, with a mighty
moo, got up and joined the others. Ann sat up and clung to Rudolf,
while the Knight-mare who was standing close beside her, laid a
protecting hand upon her shoulder. When she saw what had been holding
her down, she gave a little shriek. It was a small spotted cow in a
red flannel petticoat. She wore stout button boots on her hind feet,
and she now reared herself upon these to flourish two angry hoofs
over the sleek head of a little man in a white linen coat who held a
tiny mirror in one hand and a pair of pincers in the other. Ann took a
great dislike to this little man at once, and felt more afraid of him
than of the Cow or of the handsome Indian Chief in full
war-paint&#8212;feather head-dress and all&#8212;who was brandishing his
tomahawk, sometimes in the face of the Little Dentist, again under the
turned-up nose of a large fat Policeman who stood with folded arms,
the only calm member of that much-excited group.</p>
<p>The Knight-mare stepped forward and put himself between the children
and the Bad Dreams. "Look here, you fellows," he said quietly, "you
may as well stop this nonsense first as last. You haven't got any
business here, and well you know it. If the Boss finds you've been
disposing of any prisoners without his permission&#8212;well&#8212;<i>you</i> know
what'll happen!"</p>
<p>That the Bad Dreams did know was to be seen by their foolish scared
expressions. The Indian Chief, with a disappointed grunt, replaced his
tomahawk in his belt, and seated himself cross-legged on the grass,
drawing his blanket closely about him. The Policeman stopped murmuring
"Move on!" The Cow dropped clumsily on all fours and began to crop the
bushes. Even the Little Dentist put his pincers back into his pocket,
though he still looked wistfully at Ann, who avoided his eye as much
as she could. This was a very terrifying company in which the children
found themselves, and in spite of the comforting presence of the
friendly Knight-mare, they felt very doubtful of their present safety,
not to speak of what might be done to them when once they were in the
clutches of that dreadful "Boss", whom even the Bad Dreams seemed to
be afraid of.</p>
<p>"He has all the fun, anyway," snorted the Cow, switching her tail.
"All the choice bits of torturing. Why, I've not had so much as a
single toss since I've been on this job; no I haven't!" And she shook
her sharp curved horns at Ann.</p>
<p>"Not a tooth out yet!" complained the Dentist, "not a single one."
He
sighed, glancing from Ann to Rudolf and from Rudolf back again to Ann,
as if he expected they might be coaxed into presenting him with a full
set each.</p>
<p>"'Tis himsilf does all the arristin'," muttered the Policeman sadly.</p>
<p>"Big-boss-chief take all good scalp," Thunder-snorer, the Indian,
grunted.</p>
<p>The children began to think this "Boss" must indeed be a terror.</p>
<p>"Now, come, come," continued the Knight-mare soothingly, "it's not
so
bad as that. You all get plenty of fun, but you mustn't mix it up with
business. We're in a row now, every one of us, for being out of
bounds. Better move along and have it over, that's my advice."</p>
<p>The Policeman looked more cheerful. "That's it," cried he. "Move on!"</p>
<p>Ann put her little arms around the Knight-mare's neck and whispered
something in his ear. He turned to the Cow and said:</p>
<p>"Madam, this young lady wishes to know if anything has been seen or
heard of another prisoner, a small fat one called Peter?"</p>
<p>"Sir," said the Cow, "he was taken just a little while ago. That's
why
we four went off in a huff. We wanted a little fun with him, just a
bit of our pretty play, you know, but the Boss wouldn't have it. He's
saving him up for the Banquet, and not one of us is to be let at him
till after that."</p>
<p>Rudolf and Ann looked at each other, both suddenly remembering the
Sandman's warning that on no account were any of them to taste the Bad
Dreams' food. Could Peter be expected to refuse any kind of
refreshments at any time? They knew that he could not.</p>
<p>"Come," cried Rudolf, pulling at the Knight-mare's arm. "Take us to
him, please. We've got to hurry."</p>
<p>The Knight-mare obligingly stepped forward, leading Ann by the hand,
and the Bad Dreams&#8212;to the children's surprise&#8212;rose meekly to
accompany them. It was decided that the Cow should go first, to clear
a way through the forest by her simple method of trampling down
everything before her. The Indian walked next, stepping softly and
silently on his moccasined feet, and turning now and then to make a
horrid face at the children who followed behind him, one on either
side of the Knight-mare. The Dentist and Policeman, walking arm in
arm, brought up the rear. The party had not gone a great distance
through the wood, before Ann and Rudolf noticed that the underbrush
was growing thinner and the trees beginning to be taller and farther
apart. At last they could see through a veil of branches the light of
a fire burning on the ground not a great distance ahead of them, and
soon they came close to the enormous oak tree under which this fire
was kindled. Its flames were a strange bluish color, and as they shot
up into the darkness which was almost complete under the shade of that
great tree, the children could plainly see strange figures showing
black against the light, leaping and dancing around the fire.</p>
<p>"The party's begun, but not the Banquet," whispered the Knight-mare.
"You can come a little closer, but you mustn't interrupt till it's
over."</p>
<p>In silence they all moved a little nearer to the cleared space under
the tree, but not so near as to be discovered. Rudolf and Ann gazed
anxiously at the scene before them. First of all they noticed that the
fire was not an ordinary fire, but a huge blazing plum pudding which
accounted for the queer color of its flames. It was stuck full of bits
of crackling holly and dripped sweet-smelling sauce in every
direction. On the other side of the fire, just opposite to them, was a
moss-grown log, and on this log sat Peter. His big brown eyes, shining
with excitement, were fixed on the dancers passing before him, his
little nose sniffed the burning plum pudding with great satisfaction.
As soon as her eye fell on her little brother, Ann started toward him,
but the Knight-mare held her back.</p>
<p>"No use," said he. "Wait a bit, and I'll tell you when the real
trouble's going to begin."</p>
<p>The children had no choice but to obey, and their attention was soon
occupied by the strange sights before them. As one odd figure after
another sprang out of the dark into the firelight, capered and
pranced, and then disappeared into the blackness again, Ann and Rudolf
drew closer together and squeezed hands, very queer feelings creeping
up and down their back-bones. The strangest part of it all was that
among that crazy company were many whom the children did not see for
the first time, who were old acquaintances of theirs! There&#8212;grinning
and brandishing his stick&#8212;was the Little Black Man who had worried
Rudolf many a night as far back as he could remember. There was the
Old Witch on the Broomstick, whom Ann had often described to him.
There again, were other Bad Dreams that made the children almost smile
as they remembered certain exciting times. The Angry Farmer&#8212;Rudolf
had seen him before; he remembered his fierce expression, yes, and his
short black whip, too! Also the Cross Cook, her fat arms rolled up in
her apron, and "I'm going to tell your mother," written plainly on her
round red face. A great white Jam Pot danced just behind the Cook, and
was followed by a dozen bright Green Apples. A Dancing-master came
next, bowing and smiling at Peter as he passed him, then a Bear
paddling clumsily along on its hind legs, its great red mouth wide
open to show its long white teeth, then a Gooseberry Tart marked
"Stolen", then an Arithmetic with a mean sort of face, rulers for
legs, and compasses for arms; then a Clock that had been meddled with
by somebody (Rudolf felt certain it was not by him) and kept striking
all the time; then a Piano with a lot of horrid exercises waiting to
be practised; then last of all a familiar clumsy figure with one red
glaring eye&#8212;their old enemy, the Warming-pan!</p>
<p>As Rudolf was trying to take in these, and many others in that
curious
throng, he felt himself sharply pinched by Ann. "Look, look," she
whispered, "over there where it's so dark, close to Peter. Oh, don't
you know <i>now</i> who their Boss is?"</p>
<p>Rudolf looked. Clearly enough now he saw two flaming green eyes and
a
clumsy black figure crouching on the ground. Before this figure every
one of the dancers made a low bow as he passed.</p>
<p>"Don't you know him?" repeated Ann, shivering with excitement. "It's
Manunderthebed!"</p>
<p>"Oh, well, what if it is?" whispered Rudolf. "I stopped bothering
about <i>him</i> years ago. He's only for babies."</p>
<p>Ann was not deceived by Rudolf's cheerful tone. Manunderthebed might
not amount to much at home with nurse and mother to frighten him away,
but here in his own country it was not pleasant to meet him.</p>
<p>"He's horrid," said she. "Oh, look, Ruddy, what is he doing now?"</p>
<p>Manunderthebed had stretched out a long black arm and pointed to the
fire. Instantly the Bad Dreams stopped their dance and vanished into
the darkness. When they came again into the firelight the children saw
that the Cook, the Dancing-master, and several others carried large
dishes in their hands which they now presented with low bows to
Peter.</p>
<p>"It's the Banquet!" whispered the Knight-mare nervously. "If he
touches a morsel, he's lost. He'll go to sleep and dream Bad Dreams
forever and a day&#8212;which won't be pleasant, I assure you."</p>
<p>Ann and Rudolf had not waited for the Knight-mare to finish his
speech. They rushed on Peter, just as he had helped himself to an
enormous slice of mince pie, and while Ann threw her arms about his
neck, Rudolf snatched the tempting morsel out of his hand and cast it
in the fire. Of course Peter struggled and fussed and was not a bit
grateful, but Rudolf and Ann did not care, for the Knight-mare's
warning rang in their ears. Meanwhile the Bad Dreams had gathered
round the three children in an angry circle, and Manunderthebed
growled out:</p>
<p>"Seize 'em, some of you! Where's that fat Policeman?"</p>
<p>"Here, sorr." Very much against his will the Policeman had been
pushed
forward till he stood in front of the children, hanging his head and
looking very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Arrest 'em, why don't you?" shouted the Boss.</p>
<p>"Please, sorr, Oi have," muttered the Policeman humbly, shifting
from
one foot to the other and looking more and more unhappy.</p>
<p>"Then do it all over again, and be quick about it&#8212;or&#8212;"
Manunderthebed made a terrible face at the Policeman, who shivered,
and edging up to Rudolf, laid a timid hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"No you don't!" cried Rudolf. "I'm not afraid of <i>you</i>!" And
he gave
the Policeman a poke with his sword, just a little one, about where
his belt came. The Policeman gave a frightened yell, doubled up as if
he had been shot, and ducking under the shoulders of the crowd made
off into the darkness. Manunderthebed was furious. The children heard
him roar out a command, and then the Bad Dreams advanced on them in a
body. The leaping dancing flames of the plum-pudding fire showed their
angry faces and strange figures.</p>
<p>Rudolf was not really afraid now, for he saw at once that the Bad
Dreams were not much at fighting, yet there were so many of them that
by sheer force of their numbers they were slowly but surely pushing
the three children back, back, until they were crowded against the
trunk of the great oak tree where Manunderthebed had been crouching.
He had run to fetch a great branch of burning holly from the fire, and
holding this like a torch above his head, he pressed through the
crowd toward Rudolf and dashed it almost into his eyes. Rudolf shrank
back, half blinded by the glare, and bumped sharply into Peter, who in
turn was pushed violently against Ann, who had set her back firmly
against the tree trunk. The tree, as she described it afterward,
seemed to give way behind her, and she fell backward into soft
smothery darkness. Peter fell after her and Rudolf on top of Peter.
The little door which had opened to receive them snapped to again, as
if by magic, and from the other side of it the triumphant howls of the
Bad Dreams came very faintly to their ears.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV
<br>
IN THE HOLLOW TREE</h2>
<br>
<p>At first it seemed perfectly dark inside the tree, but after the
children had rubbed out of their eyes the soft powdery dust which
their fall had stirred up, they made out the dull glow of a dying
fire, a real one in a real fireplace this time, and no plum-pudding
affair. From the amount of furniture they knocked against in moving
about they knew they must be in somebody's house.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," whispered Ann, "I hope the owner is not at home!"</p>
<p>Rudolf said nothing, for he was groping about after the poker. He
found it presently and stirred the embers into quite a cheerful blaze.
By this light the children were able to see dimly what the room was
like. It was circular in shape and the walls and ceiling were covered
with rough bark. The floor was of earth, covered with a thick carpet
of dry leaves. There were several chairs and a round table all made of
boughs with the bark left on and the mantel-piece was built of
curiously twisted branches. On it stood a round wooden clock and a
pair of wooden candlesticks. A pair of spectacles lay on the top of a
pile of large fat books upon the table.</p>
<p>"I'd like to know whose house this is," said Rudolf.</p>
<p>"It's Manunderthebed's house," said Peter calmly.</p>
<p>"How do you know?" cried Ann and Rudolf.</p>
<p>"'Cause I <i>do</i> know," said Peter.</p>
<p>"Oh, Peter, you naughty boy, you are so provoking!" exclaimed Ann,
hugging him. "Tell sister what you mean, and what you've been doing
and why you ran away to find those horrid creatures!"</p>
<p>"Aren't horrid," said Peter, wriggling away from her, "and '<i>tis</i>
Manunderthebed's house, 'cause he came out by the little door when the
Bad Dreams brought me. He came out of his little door, and he said
'Peter, will you come to my party?'"</p>
<p>"But there isn't any little door now," interrupted Rudolf, "anyway,
<i>I</i> can't find it." He had taken a candle from the mantel-piece,
had
lighted it at the fire, and was making a careful search of the walls.
No trace of a door or any opening except the fireplace could be seen.</p>
<p>"It's a magic door," said Peter cheerfully. "Manunderthebed touched
something with his foot and that opened it and then he pushed you and
you pushed me and I bumped into Ann, and here we are."</p>
<p>"He's shut us up on purpose!" cried Ann. "It's just like him."</p>
<p>"He's shut us up to starve us into submission, like they do in
books,"
said Rudolf gloomily.</p>
<p>"I'm starved now," began Peter, "and that was the very <i>nicest</i>
pie!"
But the other two were much provoked with Peter for having led them
into such a fix, and they would not listen to him any longer. By
Rudolf's orders, Ann lighted the other candle and both searched again
with the greatest care for some trace of the secret door. At last
Ann's sharp eyes spied not a door, but a small opening in the wall far
above their heads, like a little round window not much bigger than a
knothole. Rudolf climbed upon the table, but found he was hardly tall
enough to look through, so he was obliged to hoist Peter upon his
shoulders and let him have first look. When the little boy got his
eye to the window he gave such a shout of surprise that he nearly
knocked Rudolf and himself completely off the table.</p>
<p>"Hush," warned his brother, "you mustn't make a noise! Can you see
what the Bad Dreams are doing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can see 'em," whispered Peter.</p>
<p>"They're all sitting round the fire and Manunderthebed is making a
speech."</p>
<p>"What's he saying?" asked Ann anxiously.</p>
<p>"I can't hear, but he's awful cross. Now the Little Black Man has
gone&#8212;now he's come back again, and&#8212;oh!"</p>
<p>"What is it? What is it?" cried Ann and Rudolf.</p>
<p>"He's got three animals on a chain&#8212;a bear, an'&#8212;an'&#8212;a lion&#8212;an' a
great big white wolf!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Peter, darling, you <i>know</i> they're only dream animals!"
Ann
hastily reminded him.</p>
<p>"Well, they're most as nice as real ones, they're awful fierce&#8212;"</p>
<p>"What's the Little Black Man doing with 'em?" interrupted Rudolf.</p>
<p>"He's letting them loose," said Peter, "and they're smelling round&#8212;"</p>
<p>"He's putting them by the tree to guard us&#8212;that's what he's doing,"
broke in Rudolf.</p>
<p>"To swallow us up if we ever do escape!" wailed Ann, now thoroughly
frightened. "Oh, Rudolf, whatever shall we do?"</p>
<p>Rudolf hastily lowered Peter to the floor and got down off the
table.
"Ann," said he, "there must be another way out. In books there always
are two ways out of secret rooms, and this," he added cheerfully, "is
the bookiest thing that's happened to us yet. Come, let's look again
for it."</p>
<p>He and Ann began the search once more, going over and over the walls
by the light of their candles, but without any success. Peter was
nosing about by himself in a little recess by the fireplace, and soon
the other two heard him give a gleeful chuckle.</p>
<p>"What is it? Have you found the spring of the secret door?" cried
Rudolf, running to him.</p>
<p>"Nope," said Peter. "It's nicer than that, it's a cake. I found it
right here on this little shelf that you went past and never noticed."</p>
<p>"Oh, Peter," Ann scolded, "I think you are the very greediest little
boy I ever knew!"</p>
<p>"That cake belongs to Manunderthebed, and you know it," said Rudolf
sternly. "It's a dream cake, of course, a Bad-dream cake, so you can't
eat it."</p>
<p>Peter clasped the small round cake tightly to his breast.</p>
<p>"It's a nice seed-cake like Cook makes," he said stubbornly, "and I
<i>must</i> eat it."</p>
<p>"The seeds in it are poppy-seeds," explained Rudolf, "and you'll go
to sleep and dream Bad Dreams forever, like the Knight-mare said, so
you <i>sha'n't</i> eat it!" He tried to get the cake away from his
naughty
little brother who only grasped it the more tightly. There would have
been a quarrel, and a fierce one, if it had not been for Ann.</p>
<p>"I tell you," said she, "let's try it on the animals!"</p>
<p>This seemed a really bright idea, and Rudolf agreed at once, though
Peter considered it wasteful. Ann had to coax some time, but at last
she persuaded him to part with his cake. Rudolf would not trust Peter
with the distributing, so he piled three fat dictionaries that lay on
the table one on top of another and climbed upon them himself,
managing in this way to bring his eye to the level of the little
window. The plum-pudding fire was burning very low by this time, and
Rudolf could barely make out the forms of some of the Bad Dreams who
were stretched on the ground around it.</p>
<p>Suddenly he gave a great start and nearly tumbled off the
dictionaries, for he found himself staring down into the yellow hungry
eyes of the big white wolf. Peter had described him truly, he was very
fierce, wolfier-looking, Rudolf thought, than any of his kind the boy
had seen in the dens at the park. Now the beast gave a low growl and
opened his great red mouth. Rudolf dropped a generous bit of cake
straight into it. The big jaws closed with a snap, and the white wolf
looked up for more. By this time the other beasts had discovered the
presence of refreshments, and came slinking forward, squatting
themselves one on either side of their companion.</p>
<p>Rudolf could hardly help a squeal of surprise at the sight of the
yellow lion and the big shambling bear. He remembered in time, though,
to smother it, and hastily divided the rest of the cake between the
two animals. When they had licked it up greedily, Rudolf turned his
attention again to the white wolf, and this time he could not suppress
an exclamation of delight.</p>
<p>"Oh, what <i>is</i> it, tell us," cried Ann, while Peter jumped up
and down
impatiently, begging to be allowed to see.</p>
<p>"He's going to sleep&#8212;the white wolf is," whispered Rudolf. "He's
rocking from side to side&#8212;he can hardly stand up&#8212;his red tongue is
hanging out of his mouth&#8212;he looks too silly for anything&#8212;now he's
rolled over on his back&#8212;now he's snoring!"</p>
<p>"And the other animals&#8212;the lion and the bear?"</p>
<p>"They are lying down, too, they will be asleep in a moment! There,
Peter, didn't I tell you it was a dream cake?"</p>
<p>But even then Peter did not appear grateful. He went back to the
shelf
where he had found the cake and stood looking at it wistfully, as if
he hoped he would find another. Rudolf came up behind him and looked
over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"It's no use," said Peter mournfully, "there isn't any more."</p>
<p>"There's this!" cried Rudolf triumphantly, and reaching over Peter
he
pressed a little round knob of wood half hidden under the shelf.
Instantly the whole shelf, together with a large piece of the wall,
swung aside, and the children were standing on the threshold of just
such another little door as that by which they had entered, only on
the other side of the tree. For a moment the three children
hesitated, half afraid to believe in their good luck, and then,
taking hold of hands they stepped softly out of their prison. Almost
at their feet lay the great white wolf, the yellow lion, and the
shaggy bear, all snoring in concert. Carefully avoiding them, the
children made for the thick woods ahead, not caring where they went so
long as they could escape from their enemies. The big tree was now
between them and the plum-pudding fire around which the Bad Dreams lay
asleep, so it really seemed as if they had a good chance of getting
away unseen.</p>
<p>"Hurry, hurry," Rudolf whispered, dragging Ann by the hand. "If we
can
only get to those thick trees I am sure we shall be safe."</p>
<p>"If they only don't wake up!" she panted.</p>
<p>Just at that exciting moment Peter had to make trouble&#8212;as usual. He
stumbled and fell over a twisted root, hurt his knee, and gave a loud
angry squeal. Rudolf clapped a hand over his mouth and dragged him to
his feet, but it was too late&#8212;they were discovered. A tall form shot
up out of the grass just behind them, and instantly a loud war-whoop
rang through the woods.</p>
<p>"It's Thunder-snorer&#8212;it's the Indian," Rudolf cried. "Run for your
lives!"</p>

<br>
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
<br>
</h2>
<p>The Bad Dreams were all aroused by Thunder-snorer's war-whoop, and
in
an instant the whole pack of them, headed by Manunderthebed, were at
the children's heels. Rudolf and Ann ran as fast as ever they could,
dragging Peter after them, but it was both difficult and dangerous to
run fast through that dark wood, especially as they had no idea in
what direction they ought to go. Each moment they expected to be
overtaken, each moment they seemed to feel Manunderthebed's long black
arm stretched out to drag them back to their prison&#8212;or to something
worse.</p>
<p>Then suddenly from just ahead of them came the sound of a great
crashing and rustling among the bushes and the tramp of approaching
feet. Some new danger&#8212;perhaps something worse than what was behind
them&#8212;seemed to threaten the children, but they were too breathless,
too bewildered even to try to avoid it. On they ran&#8212;straight into the
arms of a tall figure who was hurrying to meet them, a knight dressed
in shining armor wearing a plumed helmet on his handsome head. At the
same moment a troop of little tin soldiers broke through the bushes
and rushed past the children to attack the Bad Dreams. All of them
were quickly put to flight except their leader, Manunderthebed, who at
first sight of the soldiers had hidden himself behind a tree. As soon
as they had passed he crept forth and made a dart at the children. But
they had a protector now! The tall knight stepped in front of them and
raised his glittering sword. Before he could bring it down, the
cowardly King of the Bad Dreams gave a horrible yell and turned to
run. He might have escaped, but as he passed Rudolf the boy put out
his foot and tripped him up. There the rascal lay on his back, kicking
wildly, while the Knight stood guard over him. Seen close by,
Manunderthebed was not quite so dreadful as when he crouched in his
dark haunt near the hollow tree, but still his shaggy fur, sharp white
teeth, and gleaming green eyes were very terrifying to Ann, who gave a
little shriek and turned her face away. "Don't be afraid," cried the
Knight. "This is the end of Manunderthebed!" And he stooped and caught
hold of the shaggy fellow by the shoulder. A crack, a rip, and the
whole silly disguise came away in one piece, fur suit, teeth, claws,
and green glass eyes. The terrible King of the Bad Dreams was just a
big naughty boy in knickerbockers who kicked and cried and begged to
be let go! The children had to laugh, they could not help it, to hear
him blubber and whine and promise over and over again that he'd never,
no, <i>never</i> frighten little girls and boys any more! So at last
the
Knight let him scramble to his feet and rush off through the woods as
fast as he could go.</p>
<p>"That's the last of <i>him</i>" said the children's protector
smiling, "but
now tell me, you three, what do you think of the change in <i>my</i>
appearance?"</p>
<p>For a moment the three children stared up at the tall figure,
admiring
yet puzzled, then Ann clapped her hands and shouted: "Oh, I know <i>now</i>
who you are&#8212;you're the Knight-mare!"</p>
<p>The tall figure swept off his helmet and made Ann such a low bow
that
his fair curling locks brushed the ground, fluttering like yellow
plumes about his ruddy face. "I'm all knight now," cried he, "and none
of me mare. I'm a Good Dream now, and I've no doubt she'll be rather
pleased to get me back&#8212;the lady I belong to in the castle, you know.
I'm wearing her glove, as you may perceive."</p>
<p>"But how did it happen?" asked Ann, fingering the helmet with the
greatest admiration.</p>
<p>"Well," said the Knight, "as soon as you children were imprisoned in
the hollow tree I managed to escape from those fellows and rushed off
to Sandy to get you help. I found he had already sent to the Corn-cob
Queen for rescuers and just as we were talking they arrived. I agreed
to guide their leader through the woods to Manunderthebed's place if
he would first settle a certain little matter for me&#8212;that one your
brother wasn't very anxious to tackle, you know. Well, when I asked
him if he'd cut off my head, <i>he</i> said he'd just as lief as not!"</p>
<p>All three children burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"There's only one person we've met as fierce as that," said Ann,
"and
that's Captain Jinks."</p>
<p>"Captain Jinks&#8212;at your service," snapped a sharp voice at her elbow,
and turning, Ann found the little tin captain standing beside her. "I
have to report," said he, wheeling around to Rudolf and saluting him
stiffly&#8212;"the enemy&#8212;routed completely!"</p>
<p>Never, never had the children expected to be so glad to meet the
little captain again! They thanked him heartily for his part in their
splendid rescue, and asked him what he thought it was best to do next.</p>
<p>"Sound a recall," answered the officer, "and return in good order
according to commands."</p>
<p>"Whose commands, Captain Jinks?" Rudolf wanted to know, but Jinks
would not answer any more questions just then. He recalled those of
his fierce little soldiers who, with the sergeant at their head, were
still chasing the last remnants of the Bad Dreams back to the depths
of the wood, formed them into marching order, and taking the head of
the procession himself, placed the children directly behind him under
the protection of the Knight. They were anxious to have the little
captain explain all the particulars of their rescue, but found it very
hard indeed to make him talk while on duty. He marched so fast that
they had to trot to keep up with him, and stared straight ahead
without winking an eye. "Queen's orders," was all they could at first
get out of him.</p>
<p>"But, Jinks, dear, who was it brought the message to the Queen?" Ann
coaxed.</p>
<p>"Traveling Gentleman!" The little captain made a disgusted face.
"<i>He's</i> a nice one! Said nobody was being shut up nowhere, nor
didn't
<i>want</i> to be rescued."</p>
<p>For a moment the children were puzzled, then Rudolf called out, "Oh,
I
know&#8212;the False Hare!"</p>
<p>They all laughed and Ann said: "I suppose Sandy didn't know any
better
than to send him, but I should think he'd make a pretty funny
messenger!"</p>
<p>"Make a better pie," said Jinks grimly, and not another word could
they get out of him after that. They were now coming to that part of
the wood Ann and Rudolf remembered so well, where the kindly Knight
had rescued them from the attack of the tiresome Fidgets. They looked
about for signs of the little creatures' presence in the branches
overhead, and listened for their chattering laughter, but the coming
of so large a company must have scared the cowardly Fidgets away, for
not a trace of them was to be seen.</p>
<p>At last the procession struck the little path Sandy had pointed out
to
the children, and in another moment it was being met and greeted by a
whole troop of Good Dreams who had rushed to welcome the returning
party and escort them back to the glade. Here they found the whole
family assembled: the Cook-that-liked-living-in-the-Country, the
Gardener-with-the-Generous-Disposition, the Pink Stockings, the Nice
Nurse, the Good Baby, the Easter Rabbit, the Birthday Cake, the Organ
Man, the Tall Candlesticks, and the Jolly Santa Claus&#8212;one and all of
the Good Dreams, with Noddy and Blink, the two fat boys, and&#8212;best of
all&#8212;old Sandy himself, a twinkle in his sleepy eyes, a grin on his
round good-humored face.</p>
<p>"Well, well, well," cried he. "Glad to see you back again, my
friends! Guess <i>you've</i> had enough of the bad 'uns&#8212;eh, young
man?"
And he gave Peter a kindly dig in the ribs. Peter grinned and looked
rather foolish but said nothing. "And now," went on Sandy, pushing
aside the excited dreams that crowded round him, "make way, all of
you! Let these young people see who's come to welcome them." He led
the children across the glade to where, throned on a pile of sacks,
sat the Corn-cob Queen! There she was in her greeny-yellowy gown, her
little head erect, her sweet face smiling, her tiny hands stretched
out to greet the children. They could have hugged her, but they didn't
dare, she looked, in spite of being just a doll and an old-fashioned
one at that, so truly like a Queen. Back of her majesty stood a group
of doll ladies-in-waiting dressed in their gayest clothes, and among
them were Ann's very own children, Marie-Louise and Angelina-Elfrida!
They did not look haughty or naughty or cross any more, but smiled
sweetly at their little mother.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the Queen, "I have come to welcome you back, dears, and
to
say good-by, for I suppose you would like to go home to your Aunt Jane
now, wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, please your Majesty," cried Rudolf and Ann in one
breath&#8212;but Peter said nothing. He was gazing rather regretfully at
the False Hare who lounged near by, smoking his chocolate cigarette
and polishing the nap of his silk hat with the back of his paw. The
False Hare winked at Peter and edged a little closer to him. "Mighty
glad to see the last of you, old chap," he whispered. Then Peter
smiled all over, he was so pleased.</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose it's time for you to be going, if go you really
must," sighed Sandy. "And since you're in such a hurry, I'm happy to
be able to include you in that consignment of your aunt's after all.
She"&#8212;and he bowed gallantly to the Queen&#8212;"says it's all right, and
what she says goes, though to be sure, it's out of order, slightly out
of order!" As he spoke he took his list out of his pocket and ran his
eye over it once more. "Hullo," said he in a surprised tone, "there's
one more item on Miss Jane Mackenzie's and it seems to be missing!
Comparatively unimportant, but I like to have my things complete. 'One
lost Kitten!' Now what can have become of that, I wonder?"</p>
<p>It was Captain Jinks' voice that broke the silence. "Prisoner of
War,
sir! Taken with others by the Commander-in-Chief in the recent
glorious victory of the tin soldiers over the cat pirates. Here you
are, sir!" He motioned to two of the soldiers who stood on guard
over something in a dim corner of the glade. The soldiers hustled the
object forward. It was Captain Mittens! Mittens despoiled of his
scarlet sash, his turban, his sword and pistols, even of his fierce
expression! Mittens, no longer a bold and bloody robber of the seas
but a humble repentant kitten who let himself be cuddled into Peter's
arms without so much as a single scratch.</p>
<p>Peter stroked the pirate&#8212;and the pirate purred!</p>
<p>"Now then, all ready? All aboard!" It was Sandy's voice who spoke
and
Sandy's were the arms that lifted the children gently into the
enormous sack held open by Noddy and Blink, and placed them at the top
of the toboggan-slide&#8212;but they were feeling too curiously tired and
sleepy to understand exactly what was happening. Rudolf, still
clasping his tin sword&#8212;that invaluable weapon&#8212;pillowed his sleepy
head on the shoulder of the Generous Gardener. Ann rested comfortably
on the large lap of the Cook-who-liked-living-in-the-Country, and
Peter snuggled close beside her, holding Mittens tightly in his arms.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/wb018.jpg"
 title="&quot;Now then, all ready?&quot;" alt="&quot;Now then, all ready?&quot;"
 style="width: 512px; height: 775px;"></p>
<p>They thought the new non-fadable curtains were packed in somewhere,
they thought they saw the kindly face of old Sandy peeping into the
mouth of the sack at them while the whole troop of Good Dreams pushed
and crowded one another to peer at them over his shoulder. Among all
the familiar faces were some they had almost forgotten but were not
sorry to see again: the Lady Goose, waving her spoon; the Gentleman
Goose, and Squealer and Squawker, his two little duck apprentices; the
cheerful grinning countenances of Prowler and Growler, the mates, with
Toddles and Towser the common sea-cats. But at the last all grew dim,
faded, melted into mist until two figures only stood out clearly and
distinctly. One was the Corn-cob Queen smiling and waving her tiny
hand in loving farewell, the other that of a little boy in long
trousers and a frill collar, a merry-faced boy with a toy sword
buckled round his waist and a toy ship in his hand. Though they had
not seen him until now, the children recognized him at once. It was
the little boy Aunt Jane had told them of&#8212;the Little Boy who Went
Away to Sea. It was also the Commander-in-Chief of the tin soldiers,
whom the Queen had said they might be allowed to see, if they were
good.</p>
<p>Just then the children began to feel it impossible to keep their
eyes
open any longer. They heard the voices of all their friends calling
"Good-by", but they could not answer. They tried to get one more
glimpse of the Good Dreams, but their eyes dropped shut&#8212;they were far
away.</p>
<p>In the morning Aunt Jane woke to find all three children in her
room.
Ann jumped into bed on one side of her, Peter, holding Mittens,
snuggled himself on the other, and Rudolf bestrode the foot.</p>
<p>"Why, good morning, dears," she said. "Did you sleep well in the big
bed?"</p>
<p>The children looked at one another thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Did you have good dreams?" asked Aunt Jane politely. "I did, I
dreamt
about you three all night."</p>
<p>"We had funny dreams," said Rudolf, "at least, I suppose they were&#8212;"
He stopped, looking very puzzled.</p>
<p>"We woke up laughing," Ann said, "and we got right out of bed to
come
quickly to tell you something awful funny that happened to us, but
now&#8212;"</p>
<p>"Now we've forgotten it!" finished Rudolf sadly.</p>
<p>Peter said nothing at all. He looked very grave and thoughtful and
squeezed Mittens just a little&#8212;only a little too hard. The kitten
gave a slight squeak.</p>
<p>"Will you be good now?" whispered Peter in his furry ear. "Will you
never run away no more&#8212;<i>never</i>?"</p>
<p>But Mittens would not answer.<br>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
