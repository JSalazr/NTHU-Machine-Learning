    <h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
    <h2>THE AIM</h2>
    <p>At the beginning a misconception must be removed from the path. Many people, if
    not most, look on literary taste as an elegant accomplishment, by acquiring which
    they will complete themselves, and make themselves finally fit as members of a
    correct society. They are secretly ashamed of their ignorance of literature, in the
    same way as they would be ashamed of their ignorance of etiquette at a high
    entertainment, or of their inability to ride a horse if suddenly called upon to do
    so. There are certain things that a man ought to know, or to know about, and
    literature is one of them: such is their idea. They have learnt to dress themselves
    with propriety, and to behave with propriety on all occasions; they are fairly "up"
    in the questions of the day; by industry <span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"
    id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span> and enterprise they are succeeding in their vocations;
    it behoves them, then, not to forget that an acquaintance with literature is an
    indispensable part of a self-respecting man's personal baggage. Painting doesn't
    matter; music doesn't matter very much. But "everyone is supposed to know" about
    literature. Then, literature is such a charming distraction! Literary taste thus
    serves two purposes: as a certificate of correct culture and as a private pastime. A
    young professor of mathematics, immense at mathematics and games, dangerous at chess,
    capable of Haydn on the violin, once said to me, after listening to some chat on
    books, "Yes, I must take up literature." As though saying: "I was rather forgetting
    literature. However, I've polished off all these other things. I'll have a shy at
    literature now."</p>
    <p>This attitude, or any attitude which resembles it, is wrong. To him who really
    comprehends what literature is, and what the function of literature is, this attitude
    is simply ludicrous. It is also fatal to the formation of literary taste. <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span> People who regard
    literary taste simply as an accomplishment, and literature simply as a distraction,
    will never truly succeed either in acquiring the accomplishment or in using it
    half-acquired as a distraction; though the one is the most perfect of distractions,
    and though the other is unsurpassed by any other accomplishment in elegance or in
    power to impress the universal snobbery of civilised mankind. Literature, instead of
    being an accessory, is the fundamental <i>sine qua non</i> of complete living. I am
    extremely anxious to avoid rhetorical exaggerations. I do not think I am guilty of
    one in asserting that he who has not been "presented to the freedom" of literature
    has not wakened up out of his prenatal sleep. He is merely not born. He can't see; he
    can't hear; he can't feel, in any full sense. He can only eat his dinner. What more
    than anything else annoys people who know the true function of literature, and have
    profited thereby, is the spectacle of so many thousands of individuals going about
    under the delusion that they are alive, when, as a fact, they are no nearer being
    alive than a bear in winter.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
    <p>I will tell you what literature is! No&mdash;I only wish I could. But I can't. No
    one can. Gleams can be thrown on the secret, inklings given, but no more. I will try
    to give you an inkling. And, to do so, I will take you back into your own history, or
    forward into it. That evening when you went for a walk with your faithful friend, the
    friend from whom you hid nothing&mdash;or almost nothing ...! You were, in truth,
    somewhat inclined to hide from him the particular matter which monopolised your mind
    that evening, but somehow you contrived to get on to it, drawn by an overpowering
    fascination. And as your faithful friend was sympathetic and discreet, and flattered
    you by a respectful curiosity, you proceeded further and further into the said
    matter, growing more and more confidential, until at last you cried out, in a
    terrific whisper: "My boy, she is simply miraculous!" At that moment you were in the
    domain of literature.</p>
    <p>Let me explain. Of course, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, she was not
    miraculous. Your faithful friend had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
    id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> never noticed that she was miraculous, nor had about
    forty thousand other fairly keen observers. She was just a girl. Troy had not been
    burnt for her. A girl cannot be called a miracle. If a girl is to be called a
    miracle, then you might call pretty nearly anything a miracle.... That is just it:
    you might. You can. You ought. Amid all the miracles of the universe you had just
    wakened up to one. You were full of your discovery. You were under a divine impulsion
    to impart that discovery. You had a strong sense of the marvellous beauty of
    something, and you had to share it. You were in a passion about something, and you
    had to vent yourself on somebody. You were drawn towards the whole of the rest of the
    human race. Mark the effect of your mood and utterance on your faithful friend. He
    knew that she was not a miracle. No other person could have made him believe that she
    was a miracle. But you, by the force and sincerity of your own vision of her, and by
    the fervour of your desire to make him participate in your vision, did for quite a
    long time cause him to feel that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
    id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> he had been blind to the miracle of that girl.</p>
    <p>You were producing literature. You were alive. Your eyes were unlidded, your ears
    were unstopped, to some part of the beauty and the strangeness of the world; and a
    strong instinct within you forced you to tell someone. It was not enough for you that
    you saw and heard. Others had to see and hear. Others had to be wakened up. And they
    were! It is quite possible&mdash;I am not quite sure&mdash;that your faithful friend
    the very next day, or the next month, looked at some other girl, and suddenly saw
    that she, too, was miraculous! The influence of literature!</p>
    <p>The makers of literature are those who have seen and felt the miraculous
    interestingness of the universe. And the greatest makers of literature are those
    whose vision has been the widest, and whose feeling has been the most intense. Your
    own fragment of insight was accidental, and perhaps temporary. <i>Their</i> lives are
    one long ecstasy of denying that the world is a dull place. Is it nothing to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> you to learn to
    understand that the world is not a dull place? Is it nothing to you to be led out of
    the tunnel on to the hillside, to have all your senses quickened, to be invigorated
    by the true savour of life, to feel your heart beating under that correct necktie of
    yours? These makers of literature render you their equals.</p>
    <p>The aim of literary study is not to amuse the hours of leisure; it is to awake
    oneself, it is to be alive, to intensify one's capacity for pleasure, for sympathy,
    and for comprehension. It is not to affect one hour, but twenty-four hours. It is to
    change utterly one's relations with the world. An understanding appreciation of
    literature means an understanding appreciation of the world, and it means nothing
    else. Not isolated and unconnected parts of life, but all of life, brought together
    and correlated in a synthetic map! The spirit of literature is unifying; it joins the
    candle and the star, and by the magic of an image shows that the beauty of the
    greater is in the less. And, not content with the disclosure of beauty and the
    bringing together of all things whatever <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
    id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> within its focus, it enforces a moral wisdom by the
    tracing everywhere of cause and effect. It consoles doubly&mdash;by the revelation of
    unsuspected loveliness, and by the proof that our lot is the common lot. It is the
    supreme cry of the discoverer, offering sympathy and asking for it in a single
    gesture. In attending a University Extension Lecture on the sources of Shakespeare's
    plots, or in studying the researches of George Saintsbury into the origins of English
    prosody, or in weighing the evidence for and against the assertion that Rousseau was
    a scoundrel, one is apt to forget what literature really is and is for. It is well to
    remind ourselves that literature is first and last a means of life, and that the
    enterprise of forming one's literary taste is an enterprise of learning how best to
    use this means of life. People who don't want to live, people who would sooner
    hibernate than feel intensely, will be wise to eschew literature. They had better, to
    quote from the finest passage in a fine poem, "sit around and eat blackberries." The
    sight of a "common bush afire with God" might upset their nerves.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
    <h2>YOUR PARTICULAR CASE</h2>
    <p>The attitude of the average decent person towards the classics of his own tongue
    is one of distrust&mdash;I had almost said, of fear. I will not take the case of
    Shakespeare, for Shakespeare is "taught" in schools; that is to say, the Board of
    Education and all authorities pedagogic bind themselves together in a determined
    effort to make every boy in the land a lifelong enemy of Shakespeare. (It is a mercy
    they don't "teach" Blake.) I will take, for an example, Sir Thomas Browne, as to whom
    the average person has no offensive juvenile memories. He is bound to have read
    somewhere that the style of Sir Thomas Browne is unsurpassed by anything in English
    literature. One day he sees the <i>Religio Medici</i> in a shop-window (or, rather,
    outside a shop-window, for he would hesitate about <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> entering a bookshop), and he buys it, by
    way of a mild experiment. He does not expect to be enchanted by it; a profound
    instinct tells him that Sir Thomas Browne is "not in his line"; and in the result he
    is even less enchanted than he expected to be. He reads the introduction, and he
    glances at the first page or two of the work. He sees nothing but words. The work
    makes no appeal to him whatever. He is surrounded by trees, and cannot perceive the
    forest. He puts the book away. If Sir Thomas Browne is mentioned, he will say, "Yes,
    very fine!" with a feeling of pride that he has at any rate bought and inspected Sir
    Thomas Browne. Deep in his heart is a suspicion that people who get enthusiastic
    about Sir Thomas Browne are vain and conceited <i>poseurs</i>. After a year or so,
    when he has recovered from the discouragement caused by Sir Thomas Browne, he may, if
    he is young and hopeful, repeat the experiment with Congreve or Addison. Same sequel!
    And so on for perhaps a decade, until his commerce with the classics finally expires!
    That, magazines and newish fiction apart, is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
    id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> the literary history of the average decent person.</p>
    <p>And even your case, though you are genuinely preoccupied with thoughts of
    literature, bears certain disturbing resemblances to the drab case of the average
    person. You do not approach the classics with gusto&mdash;anyhow, not with the same
    gusto as you would approach a new novel by a modern author who had taken your fancy.
    You never murmured to yourself, when reading Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall</i> in bed:
    "Well, I really must read one more chapter before I go to sleep!" Speaking generally,
    the classics do not afford you a pleasure commensurate with their renown. You peruse
    them with a sense of duty, a sense of doing the right thing, a sense of "improving
    yourself," rather than with a sense of gladness. You do not smack your lips; you say:
    "That is good for me." You make little plans for reading, and then you invent excuses
    for breaking the plans. Something new, something which is not a classic, will surely
    draw you away from a classic. It is all very well for you to <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> pretend to agree with the verdict of the
    elect that <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i> is one of the greatest novels in the world&mdash;a
    new Kipling, or even a new number of a magazine, will cause you to neglect
    <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, just as though Kipling, etc., could not be kept for a few
    days without turning sour! So that you have to ordain rules for yourself, as: "I will
    not read anything else until I have read Richardson, or Gibbon, for an hour each
    day." Thus proving that you regard a classic as a pill, the swallowing of which
    merits jam! And the more modern a classic is, the more it resembles the stuff of the
    year and the less it resembles the classics of the centuries, the more easy and
    enticing do you find that classic. Hence you are glad that George Eliot, the
    Bront&euml;s, Thackeray, are considered as classics, because you really <i>do</i>
    enjoy them. Your sentiments concerning them approach your sentiments concerning a
    "rattling good story" in a magazine.</p>
    <p>I may have exaggerated&mdash;or, on the other hand, I may have
    understated&mdash;the unsatisfactory characteristics of your particular <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> case, but it is
    probable that in the mirror I hold up you recognise the rough outlines of your
    likeness. You do not care to admit it; but it is so. You are not content with
    yourself. The desire to be more truly literary persists in you. You feel that there
    is something wrong in you, but you cannot put your finger on the spot. Further, you
    feel that you are a bit of a sham. Something within you continually forces you to
    exhibit for the classics an enthusiasm which you do not sincerely feel. You even try
    to persuade yourself that you are enjoying a book, when the next moment you drop it
    in the middle and forget to resume it. You occasionally buy classical works, and do
    not read them at all; you practically decide that it is enough to possess them, and
    that the mere possession of them gives you a <i>cachet</i>. The truth is, you are a
    sham. And your soul is a sea of uneasy remorse. You reflect: "According to what
    Matthew Arnold says, I ought to be perfectly mad about Wordsworth's <i>Prelude</i>.
    And I am not. Why am I not? Have I got to be learned, to undertake a vast course of
    study, in order <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
    to be perfectly mad about Wordsworth's <i>Prelude</i>? Or am I born without the
    faculty of pure taste in literature, despite my vague longings? I do wish I could
    smack my lips over Wordsworth's <i>Prelude</i> as I did over that splendid story by
    H.G. Wells, <i>The Country of the Blind</i>, in the <i>Strand Magazine</i>!" ... Yes,
    I am convinced that in your dissatisfied, your diviner moments, you address yourself
    in these terms. I am convinced that I have diagnosed your symptoms.</p>
    <p>Now the enterprise of forming one's literary taste is an agreeable one; if it is
    not agreeable it cannot succeed. But this does not imply that it is an easy or a
    brief one. The enterprise of beating Colonel Bogey at golf is an agreeable one, but
    it means honest and regular work. A fact to be borne in mind always! You are
    certainly not going to realise your ambition&mdash;and so great, so influential an
    ambition!&mdash;by spasmodic and half-hearted effort. You must begin by making up
    your mind adequately. You must rise to the height of the affair. You must approach a
    grand undertaking in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg
    15]</span> grand manner. You ought to mark the day in the calendar as a solemnity.
    Human nature is weak, and has need of tricky aids, even in the pursuit of happiness.
    Time will be necessary to you, and time regularly and sacredly set apart. Many people
    affirm that they cannot be regular, that regularity numbs them. I think this is true
    of a very few people, and that in the rest the objection to regularity is merely an
    attempt to excuse idleness. I am inclined to think that you personally are capable of
    regularity. And I am sure that if you firmly and constantly devote certain specific
    hours on certain specific days of the week to this business of forming your literary
    taste, you will arrive at the goal much sooner. The simple act of resolution will
    help you. This is the first preliminary.</p>
    <p>The second preliminary is to surround yourself with books, to create for yourself
    a bookish atmosphere. The merely physical side of books is important&mdash;more
    important than it may seem to the inexperienced. Theoretically (save for works of
    reference), a student has need <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
    id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> for but one book at a time. Theoretically, an amateur
    of literature might develop his taste by expending sixpence a week, or a penny a day,
    in one sixpenny edition of a classic after another sixpenny edition of a classic, and
    he might store his library in a hat-box or a biscuit-tin. But in practice he would
    have to be a monster of resolution to succeed in such conditions. The eye must be
    flattered; the hand must be flattered; the sense of owning must be flattered.
    Sacrifices must be made for the acquisition of literature. That which has cost a
    sacrifice is always endeared. A detailed scheme of buying books will come later, in
    the light of further knowledge. For the present, buy&mdash;buy whatever has received
    the <i>imprimatur</i> of critical authority. Buy without any immediate reference to
    what you will read. Buy! Surround yourself with volumes, as handsome as you can
    afford. And for reading, all that I will now particularly enjoin is a general and
    inclusive tasting, in order to attain a sort of familiarity with the look of
    "literature in all its branches." A turning over of the pages of a volume of
    Chambers's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
    <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature</i>, the third for preference, may be
    suggested as an admirable and a diverting exercise. You might mark the authors that
    flash an appeal to you.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
    <h2>WHY A CLASSIC IS A CLASSIC</h2>
    <p>The large majority of our fellow-citizens care as much about literature as they
    care about aeroplanes or the programme of the Legislature. They do not ignore it;
    they are not quite indifferent to it. But their interest in it is faint and
    perfunctory; or, if their interest happens to be violent, it is spasmodic. Ask the
    two hundred thousand persons whose enthusiasm made the vogue of a popular novel ten
    years ago what they think of that novel now, and you will gather that they have
    utterly forgotten it, and that they would no more dream of reading it again than of
    reading Bishop Stubbs's <i>Select Charters</i>. Probably if they did read it again
    they would not enjoy it&mdash;not because the said novel is a whit worse now than it
    was ten years ago; not because their taste has improved&mdash;but because they have
    not had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
    sufficient practice to be able to rely on their taste as a means of permanent
    pleasure. They simply don't know from one day to the next what will please them.</p>
    <p>In the face of this one may ask: Why does the great and universal fame of
    classical authors continue? The answer is that the fame of classical authors is
    entirely independent of the majority. Do you suppose that if the fame of Shakespeare
    depended on the man in the street it would survive a fortnight? The fame of classical
    authors is originally made, and it is maintained, by a passionate few. Even when a
    first-class author has enjoyed immense success during his lifetime, the majority have
    never appreciated him so sincerely as they have appreciated second-rate men. He has
    always been reinforced by the ardour of the passionate few. And in the case of an
    author who has emerged into glory after his death the happy sequel has been due
    solely to the obstinate perseverance of the few. They could not leave him alone; they
    would not. They kept on savouring him, and talking about him, and buying him, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> they generally
    behaved with such eager zeal, and they were so authoritative and sure of themselves,
    that at last the majority grew accustomed to the sound of his name and placidly
    agreed to the proposition that he was a genius; the majority really did not care very
    much either way.</p>
    <p>And it is by the passionate few that the renown of genius is kept alive from one
    generation to another. These few are always at work. They are always rediscovering
    genius. Their curiosity and enthusiasm are exhaustless, so that there is little
    chance of genius being ignored. And, moreover, they are always working either for or
    against the verdicts of the majority. The majority can make a reputation, but it is
    too careless to maintain it. If, by accident, the passionate few agree with the
    majority in a particular instance, they will frequently remind the majority that such
    and such a reputation has been made, and the majority will idly concur: "Ah, yes. By
    the way, we must not forget that such and such a reputation exists." Without that
    persistent memory-jogging the reputation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
    id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> would quickly fall into the oblivion which is death.
    The passionate few only have their way by reason of the fact that they are genuinely
    interested in literature, that literature matters to them. They conquer by their
    obstinacy alone, by their eternal repetition of the same statements. Do you suppose
    they could prove to the man in the street that Shakespeare was a great artist? The
    said man would not even understand the terms they employed. But when he is told ten
    thousand times, and generation after generation, that Shakespeare was a great artist,
    the said man believes&mdash;not by reason, but by faith. And he too repeats that
    Shakespeare was a great artist, and he buys the complete works of Shakespeare and
    puts them on his shelves, and he goes to see the marvellous stage-effects which
    accompany <i>King Lear</i> or <i>Hamlet</i>, and comes back religiously convinced
    that Shakespeare was a great artist. All because the passionate few could not keep
    their admiration of Shakespeare to themselves. This is not cynicism; but truth. And
    it is important that those who wish to form their literary taste should grasp it.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
    <p>What causes the passionate few to make such a fuss about literature? There can be
    only one reply. They find a keen and lasting pleasure in literature. They enjoy
    literature as some men enjoy beer. The recurrence of this pleasure naturally keeps
    their interest in literature very much alive. They are for ever making new
    researches, for ever practising on themselves. They learn to understand themselves.
    They learn to know what they want. Their taste becomes surer and surer as their
    experience lengthens. They do not enjoy to-day what will seem tedious to them
    to-morrow. When they find a book tedious, no amount of popular clatter will persuade
    them that it is pleasurable; and when they find it pleasurable no chill silence of
    the street-crowds will affect their conviction that the book is good and permanent.
    They have faith in themselves. What are the qualities in a book which give keen and
    lasting pleasure to the passionate few? This is a question so difficult that it has
    never yet been completely answered. You may talk lightly about truth, insight,
    knowledge, wisdom, humour, and beauty. But these comfortable <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> words do not really carry you very far,
    for each of them has to be defined, especially the first and last. It is all very
    well for Keats in his airy manner to assert that beauty is truth, truth beauty, and
    that that is all he knows or needs to know. I, for one, need to know a lot more. And
    I never shall know. Nobody, not even Hazlitt nor Sainte-Beuve, has ever finally
    explained why he thought a book beautiful. I take the first fine lines that come to
    hand&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>The woods of Arcady are dead,</p>
        <p>And over is their antique joy&mdash;</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>and I say that those lines are beautiful, because they give me pleasure. But why?
    No answer! I only know that the passionate few will, broadly, agree with me in
    deriving this mysterious pleasure from those lines. I am only convinced that the
    liveliness of our pleasure in those and many other lines by the same author will
    ultimately cause the majority to believe, by faith, that W.B. Yeats is a genius. The
    one reassuring aspect of the literary affair is that the passionate few are
    passionate about the same things. A continuance <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> of interest does, in actual practice,
    lead ultimately to the same judgments. There is only the difference in width of
    interest. Some of the passionate few lack catholicity, or, rather, the whole of their
    interest is confined to one narrow channel; they have none left over. These men help
    specially to vitalise the reputations of the narrower geniuses: such as Crashaw. But
    their active predilections never contradict the general verdict of the passionate
    few; rather they reinforce it.</p>
    <p>A classic is a work which gives pleasure to the minority which is intensely and
    permanently interested in literature. It lives on because the minority, eager to
    renew the sensation of pleasure, is eternally curious and is therefore engaged in an
    eternal process of rediscovery. A classic does not survive for any ethical reason. It
    does not survive because it conforms to certain canons, or because neglect would not
    kill it. It survives because it is a source of pleasure, and because the passionate
    few can no more neglect it than a bee can neglect a flower. The passionate few do not
    read "the right <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
    things" because they are right. That is to put the cart before the horse. "The right
    things" are the right things solely because the passionate few <i>like</i> reading
    them. Hence&mdash;and I now arrive at my point&mdash;the one primary essential to
    literary taste is a hot interest in literature. If you have that, all the rest will
    come. It matters nothing that at present you fail to find pleasure in certain
    classics. The driving impulse of your interest will force you to acquire experience,
    and experience will teach you the use of the means of pleasure. You do not know the
    secret ways of yourself: that is all. A continuance of interest must inevitably bring
    you to the keenest joys. But, of course, experience may be acquired judiciously or
    injudiciously, just as Putney may be reached <i>via</i> Walham Green or <i>via</i>
    St. Petersburg.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
    <h2>WHERE TO BEGIN</h2>
    <p>I wish particularly that my readers should not be intimidated by the apparent
    vastness and complexity of this enterprise of forming the literary taste. It is not
    so vast nor so complex as it looks. There is no need whatever for the inexperienced
    enthusiast to confuse and frighten himself with thoughts of "literature in all its
    branches." Experts and pedagogues (chiefly pedagogues) have, for the purpose of
    convenience, split literature up into divisions and sub-divisions&mdash;such as prose
    and poetry; or imaginative, philosophic, historical; or elegiac, heroic, lyric; or
    religious and profane, etc., <i>ad infinitum</i>. But the greater truth is that
    literature is all one&mdash;and indivisible. The idea of the unity of literature
    should be well planted and fostered in the head. All literature is the expression of
    feeling, of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
    passion, of emotion, caused by a sensation of the interestingness of life. What
    drives a historian to write history? Nothing but the overwhelming impression made
    upon him by the survey of past times. He is forced into an attempt to reconstitute
    the picture for others. If hitherto you have failed to perceive that a historian is a
    being in strong emotion, trying to convey his emotion to others, read the passage in
    the <i>Memoirs</i> of Gibbon, in which he describes how he finished the <i>Decline
    and Fall</i>. You will probably never again look upon the <i>Decline and Fall</i> as
    a "dry" work.</p>

    <p>What applies to history applies to the other "dry" branches. Even Johnson's
    Dictionary is packed with emotion. Read the last paragraph of the preface to it: "In
    this work, when it shall be found that much is omitted, let it not be forgotten that
    much likewise is performed.... It may repress the triumph of malignant criticism to
    observe that if our language is not here fully displayed, I have only failed in an
    attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed...." <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> And so on to the close: "I have
    protracted my work till most of those whom I wish to please have sunk into the grave,
    and success and miscarriage are empty sounds: I therefore dismiss it with frigid
    tranquillity, having little to fear or hope from censure or from praise." Yes,
    tranquillity; but not frigid! The whole passage, one of the finest in English prose,
    is marked by the heat of emotion. You may discover the same quality in such books as
    Spencer's <i>First Principles</i>. You may discover it everywhere in literature, from
    the cold fire of Pope's irony to the blasting temperatures of Swinburne. Literature
    does not begin till emotion has begun.</p>
    <p>There is even no essential, definable difference between those two great branches,
    prose and poetry. For prose may have rhythm. All that can be said is that verse will
    scan, while prose will not. The difference is purely formal. Very few poets have
    succeeded in being so poetical as Isaiah, Sir Thomas Browne, and Ruskin have been in
    prose. It can only be stated that, as a rule, writers <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> have shown an instinctive tendency to
    choose verse for the expression of the very highest emotion. The supreme literature
    is in verse, but the finest achievements in prose approach so nearly to the finest
    achievements in verse that it is ill work deciding between them. In the sense in
    which poetry is best understood, all literature is poetry&mdash;or is, at any rate,
    poetical in quality. Macaulay's ill-informed and unjust denunciations live because
    his genuine emotion made them into poetry, while his <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i> are
    dead because they are not the expression of a genuine emotion. As the literary taste
    develops, this quality of emotion, restrained or loosed, will be more and more widely
    perceived at large in literature. It is the quality that must be looked for. It is
    the quality that unifies literature (and all the arts).</p>

    <p>It is not merely useless, it is harmful, for you to map out literature into
    divisions and branches, with different laws, rules, or canons. The first thing is to
    obtain some possession of literature. When you have actually felt some of the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> emotion which great
    writers have striven to impart to you, and when your emotions become so numerous and
    puzzling that you feel the need of arranging them and calling them by names,
    then&mdash;and not before&mdash;you can begin to study what has been attempted in the
    way of classifying and ticketing literature. Manuals and treatises are excellent
    things in their kind, but they are simply dead weight at the start. You can only
    acquire really useful general ideas by first acquiring particular ideas, and putting
    those particular ideas together. You cannot make bricks without straw. Do not worry
    about literature in the abstract, about theories as to literature. Get at it. Get
    hold of literature in the concrete as a dog gets hold of a bone. If you ask me where
    you ought to begin, I shall gaze at you as I might gaze at the faithful animal if he
    inquired which end of the bone he ought to attack. It doesn't matter in the slightest
    degree where you begin. Begin wherever the fancy takes you to begin. Literature is a
    whole.</p>
    <p>There is only one restriction for you. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
    id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> You must begin with an acknowledged classic; you must
    eschew modern works. The reason for this does not imply any depreciation of the
    present age at the expense of past ages. Indeed, it is important, if you wish
    ultimately to have a wide, catholic taste, to guard against the too common assumption
    that nothing modern will stand comparison with the classics. In every age there have
    been people to sigh: "Ah, yes. Fifty years ago we had a few great writers. But they
    are all dead, and no young ones are arising to take their place." This attitude of
    mind is deplorable, if not silly, and is a certain proof of narrow taste. It is a
    surety that in 1959 gloomy and egregious persons will be saying: "Ah, yes. At the
    beginning of the century there were great poets like Swinburne, Meredith, Francis
    Thompson, and Yeats. Great novelists like Hardy and Conrad. Great historians like
    Stubbs and Maitland, etc., etc. But they are all dead now, and whom have we to take
    their place?" It is not until an age has receded into history, and all its mediocrity
    has dropped away from it, that we can see it as it is&mdash;as <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> a group of men of
    genius. We forget the immense amount of twaddle that the great epochs produced. The
    total amount of fine literature created in a given period of time differs from epoch
    to epoch, but it does not differ much. And we may be perfectly sure that our own age
    will make a favourable impression upon that excellent judge, posterity. Therefore,
    beware of disparaging the present in your own mind. While temporarily ignoring it,
    dwell upon the idea that its chaff contains about as much wheat as any similar
    quantity of chaff has contained wheat.</p>
    <p>The reason why you must avoid modern works at the beginning is simply that you are
    not in a position to choose among modern works. Nobody at all is quite in a position
    to choose with certainty among modern works. To sift the wheat from the chaff is a
    process that takes an exceedingly long time. Modern works have to pass before the bar
    of the taste of successive generations. Whereas, with classics, which have been
    through the ordeal, almost the reverse is the case. <i>Your taste has to pass before
    the bar of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
    classics</i>. That is the point. If you differ with a classic, it is you who are
    wrong, and not the book. If you differ with a modern work, you may be wrong or you
    may be right, but no judge is authoritative enough to decide. Your taste is unformed.
    It needs guidance, and it needs authoritative guidance. Into the business of forming
    literary taste faith enters. You probably will not specially care for a particular
    classic at first. If you did care for it at first, your taste, so far as that classic
    is concerned, would be formed, and our hypothesis is that your taste is not formed.
    How are you to arrive at the stage of caring for it? Chiefly, of course, by examining
    it and honestly trying to understand it. But this process is materially helped by an
    act of faith, by the frame of mind which says: "I know on the highest authority that
    this thing is fine, that it is capable of giving me pleasure. Hence I am determined
    to find pleasure in it." Believe me that faith counts enormously in the development
    of that wide taste which is the instrument of wide pleasures. But it must be faith
    founded on unassailable authority.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
    <h2>HOW TO READ A CLASSIC</h2>
    <p>Let us begin experimental reading with Charles Lamb. I choose Lamb for various
    reasons: He is a great writer, wide in his appeal, of a highly sympathetic
    temperament; and his finest achievements are simple and very short. Moreover, he may
    usefully lead to other and more complex matters, as will appear later. Now, your
    natural tendency will be to think of Charles Lamb as a book, because he has arrived
    at the stage of being a classic. Charles Lamb was a man, not a book. It is extremely
    important that the beginner in literary study should always form an idea of the man
    behind the book. The book is nothing but the expression of the man. The book is
    nothing but the man trying to talk to you, trying to impart to you some of his
    feelings. An experienced student will divine the man <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> from the book, will understand the man
    by the book, as is, of course, logically proper. But the beginner will do well to aid
    himself in understanding the book by means of independent information about the man.
    He will thus at once relate the book to something human, and strengthen in his mind
    the essential notion of the connection between literature and life. The earliest
    literature was delivered orally direct by the artist to the recipient. In some
    respects this arrangement was ideal. Changes in the constitution of society have
    rendered it impossible. Nevertheless, we can still, by the exercise of the
    imagination, hear mentally the accents of the artist speaking to us. We must so
    exercise our imagination as to feel the man behind the book.</p>
    <p>Some biographical information about Lamb should be acquired. There are excellent
    short biographies of him by Canon Ainger in the <i>Dictionary of National
    Biography</i>, in Chambers's <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, and in Chambers's
    <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature</i>. If you have none of these (but you
    ought to have the last), <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg
    36]</span> there are Mr. E.V. Lucas's exhaustive <i>Life</i> (Methuen, 7s. 6d.), and,
    cheaper, Mr. Walter Jerrold's <i>Lamb</i> (Bell and Sons, 1s.); also introductory
    studies prefixed to various editions of Lamb's works. Indeed, the facilities for
    collecting materials for a picture of Charles Lamb as a human being are prodigious.
    When you have made for yourself such a picture, read the <i>Essays of Elia</i> the
    light of it. I will choose one of the most celebrated, <i>Dream Children: A
    Reverie</i>. At this point, kindly put my book down, and read <i>Dream Children</i>.
    Do not say to yourself that you will read it later, but read it now. When you have
    read it, you may proceed to my next paragraph.</p>
    <p>You are to consider <i>Dream Children</i> as a human document. Lamb was nearing
    fifty when he wrote it. You can see, especially from the last line, that the death of
    his elder brother, John Lamb, was fresh and heavy on his mind. You will recollect
    that in youth he had had a disappointing love-affair with a girl named Ann Simmons,
    who afterwards married a man named Bartrum. You will know <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> that one of the influences of his
    childhood was his grandmother Field, housekeeper of Blakesware House, in
    Hertfordshire, at which mansion he sometimes spent his holidays. You will know that
    he was a bachelor, living with his sister Mary, who was subject to homicidal mania.
    And you will see in this essay, primarily, a supreme expression of the increasing
    loneliness of his life. He constructed all that preliminary tableau of paternal
    pleasure in order to bring home to you in the most poignant way his feeling of the
    solitude of his existence, his sense of all that he had missed and lost in the world.
    The key of the essay is one of profound sadness. But note that he makes his sadness
    beautiful; or, rather, he shows the beauty that resides in sadness. You watch him
    sitting there in his "bachelor arm-chair," and you say to yourself: "Yes, it was sad,
    but it was somehow beautiful." When you have said that to yourself, Charles Lamb, so
    far as you are concerned, has accomplished his chief aim in writing the essay. How
    exactly he produces his effect can never be fully explained. But one reason of his
    success is certainly his regard for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
    id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> truth. He does not falsely idealise his brother, nor
    the relations between them. He does not say, as a sentimentalist would have said,
    "Not the slightest cloud ever darkened our relations;" nor does he exaggerate his
    solitude. Being a sane man, he has too much common-sense to assemble all his woes at
    once. He might have told you that Bridget was a homicidal maniac; what he does tell
    you is that she was faithful. Another reason of his success is his continual regard
    for beautiful things and fine actions, as illustrated in the major characteristics of
    his grandmother and his brother, and in the detailed description of Blakesware House
    and the gardens thereof.</p>
    <p>Then, subordinate to the main purpose, part of the machinery of the main purpose,
    is the picture of the children&mdash;real children until the moment when they fade
    away. The traits of childhood are accurately and humorously put in again and again:
    "Here John smiled, as much as to say, 'That would be foolish indeed.'" "Here little
    Alice spread her hands." "Here Alice's little right foot played an <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> involuntary movement,
    till, upon my looking grave, it desisted." "Here John expanded all his eyebrows, and
    tried to look courageous." "Here John slily deposited back upon the plate a bunch of
    grapes." "Here the children fell a-crying ... and prayed me to tell them some stories
    about their pretty dead mother." And the exquisite: "Here Alice put out one of her
    dear mother's looks, too tender to be upbraiding." Incidentally, while preparing his
    ultimate solemn effect, Lamb has inspired you with a new, intensified vision of the
    wistful beauty of children&mdash;their imitativeness, their facile and generous
    emotions, their anxiety to be correct, their ingenuous haste to escape from grief
    into joy. You can see these children almost as clearly and as tenderly as Lamb saw
    them. For days afterwards you will not be able to look upon a child without recalling
    Lamb's portrayal of the grace of childhood. He will have shared with you his
    perception of beauty. If you possess children, he will have renewed for you the charm
    which custom does very decidedly stale. It is further to be noticed that the measure
    of his success in picturing the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
    id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> children is the measure of his success in his main
    effect. The more real they seem, the more touching is the revelation of the fact that
    they do not exist, and never have existed. And if you were moved by the reference to
    their "pretty dead mother," you will be still more moved when you learn that the girl
    who would have been their mother is not dead and is not Lamb's.</p>
    <p>As, having read the essay, you reflect upon it, you will see how its emotional
    power over you has sprung from the sincere and unexaggerated expression of actual
    emotions exactly remembered by someone who had an eye always open for beauty, who
    was, indeed, obsessed by beauty. The beauty of old houses and gardens and aged
    virtuous characters, the beauty of children, the beauty of companionships, the
    softening beauty of dreams in an arm-chair&mdash;all these are brought together and
    mingled with the grief and regret which were the origin of the mood. Why is <i>Dream
    Children</i> a classic? It is a classic because it transmits to you, as to
    generations before you, distinguished emotion, because it makes you respond to the
    throb <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> of life
    more intensely, more justly, and more nobly. And it is capable of doing this because
    Charles Lamb had a very distinguished, a very sensitive, and a very honest mind. His
    emotions were noble. He felt so keenly that he was obliged to find relief in
    imparting his emotions. And his mental processes were so sincere that he could
    neither exaggerate nor diminish the truth. If he had lacked any one of these three
    qualities, his appeal would have been narrowed and weakened, and he would not have
    become a classic. Either his feelings would have been deficient in supreme beauty,
    and therefore less worthy to be imparted, or he would not have had sufficient force
    to impart them; or his honesty would not have been equal to the strain of imparting
    them accurately. In any case, he would not have set up in you that vibration which we
    call pleasure, and which is super-eminently caused by vitalising participation in
    high emotion. As Lamb sat in his bachelor arm-chair, with his brother in the grave,
    and the faithful homicidal maniac by his side, he really did think to himself, "This
    is beautiful. Sorrow is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg
    42]</span> beautiful. Disappointment is beautiful. Life is beautiful. <i>I must tell
    them</i>. I must make them understand." Because he still makes you understand he is a
    classic. And now I seem to hear you say, "But what about Lamb's famous literary
    style? Where does that come in?"</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
    <h2>THE QUESTION OF STYLE</h2>
    <p>In discussing the value of particular books, I have heard people say&mdash;people
    who were timid about expressing their views of literature in the presence of literary
    men: "It may be bad from a literary point of view, but there are very good things in
    it." Or: "I dare say the style is very bad, but really the book is very interesting
    and suggestive." Or: "I'm not an expert, and so I never bother my head about good
    style. All I ask for is good matter. And when I have got it, critics may say what
    they like about the book." And many other similar remarks, all showing that in the
    minds of the speakers there existed a notion that style is something supplementary
    to, and distinguishable from, matter; a sort of notion that a writer who wanted to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> classical had
    first to find and arrange his matter, and then dress it up elegantly in a costume of
    style, in order to please beings called literary critics.</p>
    <p>This is a misapprehension. Style cannot be distinguished from matter. When a
    writer conceives an idea he conceives it in a form of words. That form of words
    constitutes his style, and it is absolutely governed by the idea. The idea can only
    exist in words, and it can only exist in one form of words. You cannot say exactly
    the same thing in two different ways. Slightly alter the expression, and you slightly
    alter the idea. Surely it is obvious that the expression cannot be altered without
    altering the thing expressed! A writer, having conceived and expressed an idea, may,
    and probably will, "polish it up." But what does he polish up? To say that he
    polishes up his style is merely to say that he is polishing up his idea, that he has
    discovered faults or imperfections in his idea, and is perfecting it. An idea exists
    in proportion as it is expressed; it exists when it is expressed, and not before. It
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> expresses
    itself. A clear idea is expressed clearly, and a vague idea vaguely. You need but
    take your own case and your own speech. For just as science is the development of
    common-sense, so is literature the development of common daily speech. The difference
    between science and common-sense is simply one of degree; similarly with speech and
    literature. Well, when you "know what you think," you succeed in saying what you
    think, in making yourself understood. When you "don't know what to think," your
    expressive tongue halts. And note how in daily life the characteristics of your style
    follow your mood; how tender it is when you are tender, how violent when you are
    violent. You have said to yourself in moments of emotion: "If only I could
    write&mdash;," etc. You were wrong. You ought to have said: "If only I could
    <i>think</i>&mdash;on this high plane." When you have thought clearly you have never
    had any difficulty in saying what you thought, though you may occasionally have had
    some difficulty in keeping it to yourself. And when you cannot express yourself,
    depend upon it that you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg
    46]</span> have nothing precise to express, and that what incommodes you is not the
    vain desire to express, but the vain desire to <i>think</i> more clearly. All this
    just to illustrate how style and matter are co-existent, and inseparable, and
    alike.</p>
    <p>You cannot have good matter with bad style. Examine the point more closely. A man
    wishes to convey a fine idea to you. He employs a form of words. That form of words
    is his style. Having read, you say: "Yes, this idea is fine." The writer has
    therefore achieved his end. But in what imaginable circumstances can you say: "Yes,
    this idea is fine, but the style is not fine"? The sole medium of communication
    between you and the author has been the form of words. The fine idea has reached you.
    How? In the words, by the words. Hence the fineness must be in the words. You may
    say, superiorly: "He has expressed himself clumsily, but I can <i>see</i> what he
    means." By what light? By something in the words, in the style. That something is
    fine. Moreover, if the style is clumsy, are you sure that you can see what he <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> means? You cannot be
    quite sure. And at any rate, you cannot see distinctly. The "matter" is what actually
    reaches you, and it must necessarily be affected by the style.</p>
    <p>Still further to comprehend what style is, let me ask you to think of a writer's
    style exactly as you would think of the gestures and manners of an acquaintance. You
    know the man whose demeanour is "always calm," but whose passions are strong. How do
    you know that his passions are strong? Because he "gives them away" by some small,
    but important, part of his demeanour, such as the twitching of a lip or the whitening
    of the knuckles caused by clenching the hand. In other words, his demeanour,
    fundamentally, is not calm. You know the man who is always "smoothly polite and
    agreeable," but who affects you unpleasantly. Why does he affect you unpleasantly?
    Because he is tedious, and therefore disagreeable, and because his politeness is not
    real politeness. You know the man who is awkward, shy, clumsy, but who, nevertheless,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> impresses you
    with a sense of dignity and force. Why? Because mingled with that awkwardness and so
    forth <i>is</i> dignity. You know the blunt, rough fellow whom you instinctively
    guess to be affectionate&mdash;because there is "something in his tone" or "something
    in his eyes." In every instance the demeanour, while perhaps seeming to be contrary
    to the character, is really in accord with it. The demeanour never contradicts the
    character. It is one part of the character that contradicts another part of the
    character. For, after all, the blunt man <i>is</i> blunt, and the awkward man
    <i>is</i> awkward, and these characteristics are defects. The demeanour merely
    expresses them. The two men would be better if, while conserving their good
    qualities, they had the superficial attributes of smoothness and agreeableness
    possessed by the gentleman who is unpleasant to you. And as regards this latter, it
    is not his superficial attributes which are unpleasant to you; but his other
    qualities. In the end the character is shown in the demeanour; and the demeanour is a
    consequence of the character and resembles the character. <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> So with style and matter. You may argue
    that the blunt, rough man's demeanour is unfair to his tenderness. I do not think so.
    For his churlishness is really very trying and painful, even to the man's wife,
    though a moment's tenderness will make her and you forget it. The man really is
    churlish, and much more often than he is tender. His demeanour is merely just to his
    character. So, when a writer annoys you for ten pages and then enchants you for ten
    lines, you must not explode against his style. You must not say that his style won't
    let his matter "come out." You must remember the churlish, tender man. The more you
    reflect, the more clearly you will see that faults and excellences of style are
    faults and excellences of matter itself.</p>
    <p>One of the most striking illustrations of this neglected truth is Thomas Carlyle.
    How often has it been said that Carlyle's matter is marred by the harshness and the
    eccentricities of his style? But Carlyle's matter is harsh and eccentric to precisely
    the same degree as his style is harsh and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
    id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> eccentric. Carlyle was harsh and eccentric. His
    behaviour was frequently ridiculous, if it were not abominable. His judgments were
    often extremely bizarre. When you read one of Carlyle's fierce diatribes, you say to
    yourself: "This is splendid. The man's enthusiasm for justice and truth is glorious."
    But you also say: "He is a little unjust and a little untruthful. He goes too far. He
    lashes too hard." These things are not the style; they are the matter. And when, as
    in his greatest moments, he is emotional and restrained at once, you say: "This is
    the real Carlyle." Kindly notice how perfect the style has become! No harshnesses or
    eccentricities now! And if that particular matter is the "real" Carlyle, then that
    particular style is Carlyle's "real" style. But when you say "real" you would more
    properly say "best." "This is the best Carlyle." If Carlyle had always been at his
    best he would have counted among the supreme geniuses of the world. But he was a
    mixture. His style is the expression of the mixture. The faults are only in the style
    because they are in the matter.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
    <p>You will find that, in classical literature, the style always follows the mood of
    the matter. Thus, Charles Lamb's essay on <i>Dream Children</i> begins quite simply,
    in a calm, narrative manner, enlivened by a certain quippishness concerning the
    children. The style is grave when great-grandmother Field is the subject, and when
    the author passes to a rather elaborate impression of the picturesque old mansion it
    becomes as it were consciously beautiful. This beauty is intensified in the
    description of the still more beautiful garden. But the real dividing point of the
    essay occurs when Lamb approaches his elder brother. He unmistakably marks the point
    with the phrase: "<i>Then, in somewhat a more heightened tone</i>, I told how," etc.
    Henceforward the style increases in fervour and in solemnity until the culmination of
    the essay is reached: "And while I stood gazing, both the children gradually grew
    fainter to my view, receding and still receding till nothing at last but two mournful
    features were seen in the uttermost distance, which, without speech, strangely
    impressed upon me the effects of speech...." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
    id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> Throughout, the style is governed by the matter.
    "Well," you say, "of course it is. It couldn't be otherwise. If it were otherwise it
    would be ridiculous. A man who made love as though he were preaching a sermon, or a
    man who preached a sermon as though he were teasing schoolboys, or a man who
    described a death as though he were describing a practical joke, must necessarily be
    either an ass or a lunatic." Just so. You have put it in a nutshell. You have
    disposed of the problem of style so far as it can be disposed of.</p>
    <p>But what do those people mean who say: "I read such and such an author for the
    beauty of his style alone"? Personally, I do not clearly know what they mean (and I
    have never been able to get them to explain), unless they mean that they read for the
    beauty of sound alone. When you read a book there are only three things of which you
    may be conscious: (1) The significance of the words, which is inseparably bound up
    with the thought. (2) The look of the printed words on the page&mdash;I do not
    suppose that anybody reads any author for the visual <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> beauty of the words on the page. (3) The
    sound of the words, either actually uttered or imagined by the brain to be uttered.
    Now it is indubitable that words differ in beauty of sound. To my mind one of the
    most beautiful words in the English language is "pavement." Enunciate it, study its
    sound, and see what you think. It is also indubitable that certain combinations of
    words have a more beautiful sound than certain other combinations. Thus Tennyson held
    that the most beautiful line he ever wrote was:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>The mellow ouzel fluting in the elm.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Perhaps, as sound, it was. Assuredly it makes a beautiful succession of sounds,
    and recalls the bird-sounds which it is intended to describe. But does it live in the
    memory as one of the rare great Tennysonian lines? It does not. It has charm, but the
    charm is merely curious or pretty. A whole poem composed of lines with no better
    recommendation than that line has would remain merely curious or pretty. It would not
    permanently <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
    interest. It would be as insipid as a pretty woman who had nothing behind her
    prettiness. It would not live. One may remark in this connection how the merely
    verbal felicities of Tennyson have lost our esteem. Who will now proclaim the
    <i>Idylls of the King</i> as a masterpiece? Of the thousands of lines written by him
    which please the ear, only those survive of which the matter is charged with emotion.
    No! As regards the man who professes to read an author "for his style alone," I am
    inclined to think either that he will soon get sick of that author, or that he is
    deceiving himself and means the author's general temperament&mdash;not the author's
    verbal style, but a peculiar quality which runs through all the matter written by the
    author. Just as one may like a man for something which is always coming out of him,
    which one cannot define, and which is of the very essence of the man.</p>
    <p>In judging the style of an author, you must employ the same canons as you use in
    judging men. If you do this you will not be tempted to attach importance to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> trifles that are
    negligible. There can be no lasting friendship without respect. If an author's style
    is such that you cannot <i>respect</i> it, then you may be sure that, despite any
    present pleasure which you may obtain from that author, there is something wrong with
    his matter, and that the pleasure will soon cloy. You must examine your sentiments
    towards an author. If when you have read an author you are pleased, without being
    conscious of aught but his mellifluousness, just conceive what your feelings would be
    after spending a month's holiday with a merely mellifluous man. If an author's style
    has pleased you, but done nothing except make you giggle, then reflect upon the
    ultimate tediousness of the man who can do nothing but jest. On the other hand, if
    you are impressed by what an author has said to you, but are aware of verbal
    clumsinesses in his work, you need worry about his "bad style" exactly as much and
    exactly as little as you would worry about the manners of a kindhearted, keen-brained
    friend who was dangerous to carpets with a tea-cup in his hand. The friend's antics
    in a drawing-room are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg
    56]</span> somewhat regrettable, but you would not say of him that his manners were
    bad. Again, if an author's style dazzles you instantly and blinds you to everything
    except its brilliant self, ask your soul, before you begin to admire his matter, what
    would be your final opinion of a man who at the first meeting fired his personality
    into you like a broadside. Reflect that, as a rule, the people whom you have come to
    esteem communicated themselves to you gradually, that they did not begin the
    entertainment with fireworks. In short, look at literature as you would look at life,
    and you cannot fail to perceive that, essentially, the style is the man. Decidedly
    you will never assert that you care nothing for style, that your enjoyment of an
    author's matter is unaffected by his style. And you will never assert, either, that
    style alone suffices for you.</p>
    <p>If you are undecided upon a question of style, whether leaning to the favourable
    or to the unfavourable, the most prudent course is to forget that literary style
    exists. For, indeed, as style is understood by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
    id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> most people who have not analysed their impressions
    under the influence of literature, there <i>is</i> no such thing as literary style.
    You cannot divide literature into two elements and say: This is matter and that
    style. Further, the significance and the worth of literature are to be comprehended
    and assessed in the same way as the significance and the worth of any other
    phenomenon: by the exercise of common-sense. Common-sense will tell you that nobody,
    not even a genius, can be simultaneously vulgar and distinguished, or beautiful and
    ugly, or precise and vague, or tender and harsh. And common-sense will therefore tell
    you that to try to set up vital contradictions between matter and style is absurd.
    When there is a superficial contradiction, one of the two mutually-contradicting
    qualities is of far less importance than the other. If you refer literature to the
    standards of life, common-sense will at once decide which quality should count
    heaviest in your esteem. You will be in no danger of weighing a mere maladroitness of
    manner against a fine trait of character, or of letting a graceful deportment blind
    you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> to a
    fundamental vacuity. When in doubt, ignore style, and think of the matter as you
    would think of an individual.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
    <h2>WRESTLING WITH AN AUTHOR</h2>
    <p>Having disposed, so far as is possible and necessary, of that formidable question
    of style, let us now return to Charles Lamb, whose essay on <i>Dream Children</i> was
    the originating cause of our inquiry into style. As we have made a beginning of Lamb,
    it will be well to make an end of him. In the preliminary stages of literary culture,
    nothing is more helpful, in the way of kindling an interest and keeping it well
    alight, than to specialise for a time on one author, and particularly on an author so
    frankly and curiously "human" as Lamb is. I do not mean that you should imprison
    yourself with Lamb's complete works for three months, and read nothing else. I mean
    that you should regularly devote a proportion of your learned leisure to the study of
    Lamb until you are acquainted <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
    id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> with all that is important in his work and about his
    work. (You may buy the complete works in prose and verse of Charles and Mary Lamb,
    edited by that unsurpassed expert Mr. Thomas Hutchison, and published by the Oxford
    University Press, in two volumes for four shillings the pair!) There is no reason why
    you should not become a modest specialist in Lamb. He is the very man for you;
    neither voluminous, nor difficult, nor uncomfortably lofty; always either amusing or
    touching; and&mdash;most important&mdash;himself passionately addicted to literature.
    You cannot like Lamb without liking literature in general. And you cannot read Lamb
    without learning about literature in general; for books were his hobby, and he was a
    critic of the first rank. His letters are full of literariness. You will naturally
    read his letters; you should not only be infinitely diverted by them (there are no
    better epistles), but you should receive from them much light on the works.</p>
    <p>It is a course of study that I am <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
    id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span> suggesting to you. It means a certain amount of
    sustained effort. It means slightly more resolution, more pertinacity, and more
    expenditure of brain-tissue than are required for reading a newspaper. It means, in
    fact, "work." Perhaps you did not bargain for work when you joined me. But I do not
    think that the literary taste can be satisfactorily formed unless one is prepared to
    put one's back into the affair. And I may prophesy to you, by way of encouragement,
    that, in addition to the advantages of familiarity with masterpieces, of increased
    literary knowledge, and of a wide introduction to the true bookish atmosphere and
    "feel" of things, which you will derive from a comprehensive study of Charles Lamb,
    you will also be conscious of a moral advantage&mdash;the very important and very
    inspiring advantage of really "knowing something about something." You will have
    achieved a definite step; you will be proudly aware that you have put yourself in a
    position to judge as an expert whatever you may hear or read in the future concerning
    Charles Lamb. This <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg
    62]</span> legitimate pride and sense of accomplishment will stimulate you to go on
    further; it will generate steam. I consider that this indirect moral advantage even
    outweighs, for the moment, the direct literary advantages.</p>
    <p>Now, I shall not shut my eyes to a possible result of your diligent intercourse
    with Charles Lamb. It is possible that you may be disappointed with him. It
    is&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;almost probable that you will be disappointed with him,
    at any rate partially. You will have expected more joy in him than you have received.
    I have referred in a previous chapter to the feeling of disappointment which often
    comes from first contacts with the classics. The neophyte is apt to find them&mdash;I
    may as well out with the word&mdash;dull. You may have found Lamb less diverting,
    less interesting, than you hoped. You may have had to whip yourself up again and
    again to the effort of reading him. In brief, Lamb has not, for you, justified his
    terrific reputation. If a classic is a classic because it gives <i>pleasure</i> to
    succeeding generations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg
    63]</span> of the people who are most keenly interested in literature, and if Lamb
    frequently strikes you as dull, then evidently there is something wrong. The
    difficulty must be fairly fronted, and the fronting of it brings us to the very core
    of the business of actually forming the taste. If your taste were classical you would
    discover in Lamb a continual fascination; whereas what you in fact do discover in
    Lamb is a not unpleasant flatness, enlivened by a vague humour and an occasional
    pathos. You ought, according to theory, to be enthusiastic; but you are apathetic,
    or, at best, half-hearted. There is a gulf. How to cross it?</p>
    <p>To cross it needs time and needs trouble. The following considerations may aid. In
    the first place, we have to remember that, in coming into the society of the classics
    in general and of Charles Lamb in particular, we are coming into the society of a
    mental superior. What happens usually in such a case? We can judge by recalling what
    happens when we are in the society of a mental inferior. We say things of <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> which he misses the
    import; we joke, and he does not smile; what makes him laugh loudly seems to us
    horseplay or childish; he is blind to beauties which ravish us; he is ecstatic over
    what strikes us as crude; and his profound truths are for us trite commonplaces. His
    perceptions are relatively coarse; our perceptions are relatively subtle. We try to
    make him understand, to make him see, and if he is aware of his inferiority we may
    have some success. But if he is not aware of his inferiority, we soon hold our
    tongues and leave him alone in his self-satisfaction, convinced that there is nothing
    to be done with him. Every one of us has been through this experience with a mental
    inferior, for there is always a mental inferior handy, just as there is always a
    being more unhappy than we are. In approaching a classic, the true wisdom is to place
    ourselves in the position of the mental inferior, aware of mental inferiority, humbly
    stripping off all conceit, anxious to rise out of that inferiority. Recollect that we
    always regard as quite hopeless the mental inferior who does <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> not suspect his own inferiority. Our
    attitude towards Lamb must be: "Charles Lamb was a greater man than I am, cleverer,
    sharper, subtler, finer, intellectually more powerful, and with keener eyes for
    beauty. I must brace myself to follow his lead." Our attitude must resemble that of
    one who cocks his ear and listens with all his soul for a distant sound.</p>
    <p>To catch the sound we really must listen. That is to say, we must read carefully,
    with our faculties on the watch. We must read slowly and perseveringly. A classic has
    to be wooed and is worth the wooing. Further, we must disdain no assistance. I am not
    in favour of studying criticism of classics before the classics themselves. My notion
    is to study the work and the biography of a classical writer together, and then to
    read criticism afterwards. I think that in reprints of the classics the customary
    "critical introduction" ought to be put at the end, and not at the beginning, of the
    book. The classic should be allowed to make his own impression, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> however faint, on the
    virginal mind of the reader. But afterwards let explanatory criticism be read as much
    as you please. Explanatory criticism is very useful; nearly as useful as pondering
    for oneself on what one has read! Explanatory criticism may throw one single gleam
    that lights up the entire subject.</p>
    <p>My second consideration (in aid of crossing the gulf) touches the quality of the
    pleasure to be derived from a classic. It is never a violent pleasure. It is subtle,
    and it will wax in intensity, but the idea of violence is foreign to it. The artistic
    pleasures of an uncultivated mind are generally violent. They proceed from
    exaggeration in treatment, from a lack of balance, from attaching too great an
    importance to one aspect (usually superficial), while quite ignoring another. They
    are gross, like the joy of Worcester sauce on the palate. Now, if there is one point
    common to all classics, it is the absence of exaggeration. The balanced sanity of a
    great mind makes impossible exaggeration, and, therefore, distortion. The beauty of a
    classic is not at all apt <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg
    67]</span> to knock you down. It will steal over you, rather. Many serious students
    are, I am convinced, discouraged in the early stages because they are expecting a
    wrong kind of pleasure. They have abandoned Worcester sauce, and they miss it. They
    miss the coarse <i>tang</i>. They must realise that indulgence in the <i>tang</i>
    means the sure and total loss of sensitiveness&mdash;sensitiveness even to the
    <i>tang</i> itself. They cannot have crudeness and fineness together. They must
    choose, remembering that while crudeness kills pleasure, fineness ever intensifies
    it.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
    <h2>SYSTEM IN HEADING</h2>
    <p>You have now definitely set sail on the sea of literature. You are afloat, and
    your anchor is up. I think I have given adequate warning of the dangers and
    disappointments which await the unwary and the sanguine. The enterprise in which you
    are engaged is not facile, nor is it short. I think I have sufficiently predicted
    that you will have your hours of woe, during which you may be inclined to send to
    perdition all writers, together with the inventor of printing. But if you have become
    really friendly with Lamb; if you know Lamb, or even half of him; if you have formed
    an image of him in your mind, and can, as it were, hear him brilliantly stuttering
    while you read his essays or letters, then certainly you are in a fit condition to
    proceed and you want to know in which direction you are to <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> proceed. Yes, I have caught your
    terrified and protesting whisper: "I hope to heaven he isn't going to prescribe a
    Course of English Literature, because I feel I shall never be able to do it!" I am
    not. If your object in life was to be a University Extension Lecturer in English
    literature, then I should prescribe something drastic and desolating. But as your
    object, so far as I am concerned, is simply to obtain the highest and most tonic form
    of artistic pleasure of which you are capable, I shall not prescribe any regular
    course. Nay, I shall venture to dissuade you from any regular course. No man, and
    assuredly no beginner, can possibly pursue a historical course of literature without
    wasting a lot of weary time in acquiring mere knowledge which will yield neither
    pleasure nor advantage. In the choice of reading the individual must count; caprice
    must count, for caprice is often the truest index to the individuality. Stand
    defiantly on your own feet, and do not excuse yourself to yourself. You do not exist
    in order to honour literature by becoming an encyclop&aelig;dia of literature.
    Literature exists for your service. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
    id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> Wherever you happen to be, that, for you, is the
    centre of literature.</p>
    <p>Still, for your own sake you must confine yourself for a long time to recognised
    classics, for reasons already explained. And though you should not follow a course,
    you must have a system or principle. Your native sagacity will tell you that caprice,
    left quite unfettered, will end by being quite ridiculous. The system which I
    recommend is embodied in this counsel: Let one thing lead to another. In the sea of
    literature every part communicates with every other part; there are no land-locked
    lakes. It was with an eye to this system that I originally recommended you to start
    with Lamb. Lamb, if you are his intimate, has already brought you into relations with
    a number of other prominent writers with whom you can in turn be intimate, and who
    will be particularly useful to you. Among these are Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey,
    Hazlitt, and Leigh Hunt. You cannot know Lamb without knowing these men, and some of
    them are of the highest importance. From the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
    id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> circle of Lamb's own work you may go off at a tangent
    at various points, according to your inclination. If, for instance, you are drawn
    towards poetry, you cannot, in all English literature, make a better start than with
    Wordsworth. And Wordsworth will send you backwards to a comprehension of the poets
    against whose influence Wordsworth fought. When you have understood Wordsworth's and
    Coleridge's <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, and Wordsworth's defence of them, you will be in
    a position to judge poetry in general. If, again, your mind hankers after an earlier
    and more romantic literature, Lamb's <i>Specimens of English Dramatic Poets
    Contemporary with Shakspere</i> has already, in an enchanting fashion, piloted you
    into a vast gulf of "the sea which is Shakspere."</p>
    <p>Again, in Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt you will discover essayists inferior only to Lamb
    himself, and critics perhaps not inferior. Hazlitt is unsurpassed as a critic. His
    judgments are convincing and his enthusiasm of the most catching nature. Having
    arrived at Hazlitt or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg
    72]</span> Leigh Hunt, you can branch off once more at any one of ten thousand points
    into still wider circles. And thus you may continue up and down the centuries as far
    as you like, yea, even to Chaucer. If you chance to read Hazlitt on <i>Chaucer and
    Spenser</i>, you will probably put your hat on instantly and go out and buy these
    authors; such is his communicating fire! I need not particularise further. Commencing
    with Lamb, and allowing one thing to lead to another, you cannot fail to be more and
    more impressed by the peculiar suitability to your needs of the Lamb entourage and
    the Lamb period. For Lamb lived in a time of universal rebirth in English literature.
    Wordsworth and Coleridge were re-creating poetry; Scott was re-creating the novel;
    Lamb was re-creating the human document; and Hazlitt, Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, and
    others were re-creating criticism. Sparks are flying all about the place, and it will
    be not less than a miracle if something combustible and indestructible in you does
    not take fire.</p>
    <p>I have only one cautionary word to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
    id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> utter. You may be saying to yourself: "So long as I
    stick to classics I cannot go wrong." You can go wrong. You can, while reading naught
    but very fine stuff, commit the grave error of reading too much of one kind of stuff.
    Now there are two kinds, and only two kinds. These two kinds are not prose and
    poetry, nor are they divided the one from the other by any differences of form or of
    subject. They are the inspiring kind and the informing kind. No other genuine
    division exists in literature. Emerson, I think, first clearly stated it. His terms
    were the literature of "power" and the literature of "knowledge." In nearly all great
    literature the two qualities are to be found in company, but one usually predominates
    over the other. An example of the exclusively inspiring kind is Coleridge's <i>Kubla
    Khan</i>. I cannot recall any first-class example of the purely informing kind. The
    nearest approach to it that I can name is Spencer's <i>First Principles</i>, which,
    however, is at least once highly inspiring. An example in which the inspiring quality
    predominates is <i>Ivanhoe</i>; and an example in which the <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> informing quality predominates is
    Hazlitt's essays on Shakespeare's characters. You must avoid giving undue preference
    to the kind in which the inspiring quality predominates or to the kind in which the
    informing quality predominates. Too much of the one is enervating; too much of the
    other is desiccating. If you stick exclusively to the one you may become a mere
    debauchee of the emotions; if you stick exclusively to the other you may cease to
    live in any full sense. I do not say that you should hold the balance exactly even
    between the two kinds. Your taste will come into the scale. What I say is that
    neither kind must be neglected.</p>
    <p>Lamb is an instance of a great writer whom anybody can understand and whom a
    majority of those who interest themselves in literature can more or less appreciate.
    He makes no excessive demand either on the intellect or on the faculty of sympathetic
    emotion. On both sides of Lamb, however, there lie literatures more difficult, more
    recondite. The "knowledge" side need not detain us here; it <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> can be mastered by concentration and
    perseverance. But the "power" side, which comprises the supreme productions of
    genius, demands special consideration. You may have arrived at the point of keenly
    enjoying Lamb and yet be entirely unable to "see anything in" such writings as
    <i>Kubla Khan</i> or Milton's <i>Comus</i>; and as for <i>Hamlet</i> you may see
    nothing in it but a sanguinary tale "full of quotations." Nevertheless it is the
    supreme productions which are capable of yielding the supreme pleasures, and which
    <i>will</i> yield the supreme pleasures when the pass-key to them has been acquired.
    This pass-key is a comprehension of the nature of poetry.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
    <h2>VERSE</h2>
    <p>There is a word, a "name of fear," which rouses terror in the heart of the vast
    educated majority of the English-speaking race. The most valiant will fly at the mere
    utterance of that word. The most broad-minded will put their backs up against it. The
    most rash will not dare to affront it. I myself have seen it empty buildings that had
    been full; and I know that it will scatter a crowd more quickly than a hose-pipe,
    hornets, or the rumour of plague. Even to murmur it is to incur solitude, probably
    disdain, and possibly starvation, as historical examples show. That word is
    "poetry."</p>
    <p>The profound objection of the average man to poetry can scarcely be exaggerated.
    And when I say the average man, I do <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
    id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> not mean the "average sensual man"&mdash;any man who
    gets on to the top of the omnibus; I mean the average lettered man, the average man
    who does care a little for books and enjoys reading, and knows the classics by name
    and the popular writers by having read them. I am convinced that not one man in ten
    who reads, reads poetry&mdash;at any rate, knowingly. I am convinced, further, that
    not one man in ten who goes so far as knowingly to <i>buy</i> poetry ever reads it.
    You will find everywhere men who read very widely in prose, but who will say quite
    callously, "No, I never read poetry." If the sales of modern poetry, distinctly
    labelled as such, were to cease entirely to-morrow not a publisher would fail;
    scarcely a publisher would be affected; and not a poet would die&mdash;for I do not
    believe that a single modern English poet is living to-day on the current proceeds of
    his verse. For a country which possesses the greatest poetical literature in the
    world this condition of affairs is at least odd. What makes it odder is that,
    occasionally, very occasionally, the average lettered <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> man will have a fit of idolatry for a
    fine poet, buying his books in tens of thousands, and bestowing upon him immense
    riches. As with Tennyson. And what makes it odder still is that, after all, the
    average lettered man does not truly dislike poetry; he only dislikes it when it takes
    a certain form. He will read poetry and enjoy it, provided he is not aware that it is
    poetry. Poetry can exist authentically either in prose or in verse. Give him poetry
    concealed in prose and there is a chance that, taken off his guard, he will
    appreciate it. But show him a page of verse, and he will be ready to send for a
    policeman. The reason of this is that, though poetry may come to pass either in prose
    or in verse, it does actually happen far more frequently in verse than in prose;
    nearly all the very greatest poetry is in verse; verse is identified with the very
    greatest poetry, and the very greatest poetry can only be understood and savoured by
    people who have put themselves through a considerable mental discipline. To others it
    is an exasperating weariness. Hence chiefly the fearful prejudice of <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> the average lettered
    man against the mere form of verse.</p>
    <p>The formation of literary taste cannot be completed until that prejudice has been
    conquered. My very difficult task is to suggest a method of conquering it. I address
    myself exclusively to the large class of people who, if they are honest, will declare
    that, while they enjoy novels, essays, and history, they cannot "stand" verse. The
    case is extremely delicate, like all nervous cases. It is useless to employ the arts
    of reasoning, for the matter has got beyond logic; it is instinctive. Perfectly
    futile to assure you that verse will yield a higher percentage of pleasure than
    prose! You will reply: "We believe you, but that doesn't help us." Therefore I shall
    not argue. I shall venture to prescribe a curative treatment (doctors do not argue);
    and I beg you to follow it exactly, keeping your nerve and your calm. Loss of
    self-control might lead to panic, and panic would be fatal.</p>
    <p>First: Forget as completely as you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
    id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> can all your present notions about the nature of verse
    and poetry. Take a sponge and wipe the slate of your mind. In particular, do not
    harass yourself by thoughts of metre and verse forms. Second: Read William Hazlitt's
    essay "On Poetry in General." This essay is the first in the book entitled
    <i>Lectures on the English Poets</i>. It can be bought in various forms. I think the
    cheapest satisfactory edition is in Routledge's "New Universal Library" (price 1s.
    net). I might have composed an essay of my own on the real harmless nature of poetry
    in general, but it could only have been an echo and a deterioration of Hazlitt's. He
    has put the truth about poetry in a way as interesting, clear, and reassuring as
    anyone is ever likely to put it. I do not expect, however, that you will instantly
    gather the full message and enthusiasm of the essay. It will probably seem to you not
    to "hang together." Still, it will leave bright bits of ideas in your mind. Third:
    After a week's interval read the essay again. On a second perusal it will appear more
    persuasive to you.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
    <p>Fourth: Open the Bible and read the fortieth chapter of Isaiah. It is the chapter
    which begins, "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people," and ends, "They shall run and not
    be weary, and they shall walk and not faint." This chapter will doubtless be more or
    less familiar to you. It cannot fail (whatever your particular <i>ism</i>) to impress
    you, to generate in your mind sensations which you recognise to be of a lofty and
    unusual order, and which you will admit to be pleasurable. You will probably agree
    that the result of reading this chapter (even if your particular <i>ism</i> is
    opposed to its authority) is finer than the result of reading a short story in a
    magazine or even an essay by Charles Lamb. Now the pleasurable sensations induced by
    the fortieth chapter of Isaiah are among the sensations usually induced by high-class
    poetry. The writer of it was a very great poet, and what he wrote is a very great
    poem. Fifth: After having read it, go back to Hazlitt, and see if you can find
    anything in Hazlitt's lecture which throws light on the psychology of your own
    emotions upon reading Isaiah.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>
    <p>Sixth: The next step is into unmistakable verse. It is to read one of Wordsworth's
    short narrative poems, <i>The Brothers</i>. There are editions of Wordsworth at a
    shilling, but I should advise the "Golden Treasury" Wordsworth (2s. 6d. net), because
    it contains the famous essay by Matthew Arnold, who made the selection. I want you to
    read this poem aloud. You will probably have to hide yourself somewhere in order to
    do so, for, of course, you would not, as yet, care to be overheard spouting poetry.
    Be good enough to forget that <i>The Brothers</i> is poetry. <i>The Brothers</i> is a
    short story, with a plain, clear plot. Read it as such. Read it simply for the story.
    It is very important at this critical stage that you should not embarrass your mind
    with preoccupations as to the <i>form</i> in which Wordsworth has told his story.
    Wordsworth's object was to tell a story as well as he could: just that. In reading
    aloud do not pay any more attention to the metre than you feel naturally inclined to
    pay. After a few lines the metre will present itself to you. Do <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> not worry as to what
    kind of metre it is. When you have finished the perusal, examine your
    sensations....</p>
    <p>Your sensations after reading this poem, and perhaps one or two other narrative
    poems of Wordsworth, such as <i>Michael</i>, will be different from the sensations
    produced in you by reading an ordinary, or even a very extraordinary, short story in
    prose. They may not be so sharp, so clear and piquant, but they will probably be, in
    their mysteriousness and their vagueness, more impressive. I do not say that they
    will be diverting. I do not go so far as to say that they will strike you as pleasing
    sensations. (Be it remembered that I am addressing myself to an imaginary tyro in
    poetry.) I would qualify them as being "disturbing." Well, to disturb the spirit is
    one of the greatest aims of art. And a disturbance of spirit is one of the finest
    pleasures that a highly-organised man can enjoy. But this truth can only be really
    learnt by the repetitions of experience. As an aid to the more exhaustive examination
    of your feelings under Wordsworth, in order <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
    id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> that you may better understand what he was trying to
    effect in you, and the means which he employed, I must direct you to Wordsworth
    himself. Wordsworth, in addition to being a poet, was unsurpassed as a critic of
    poetry. What Hazlitt does for poetry in the way of creating enthusiasm Wordsworth
    does in the way of philosophic explanation. And Wordsworth's explanations of the
    theory and practice of poetry are written for the plain man. They pass the
    comprehension of nobody, and their direct, unassuming, and calm simplicity is
    extremely persuasive. Wordsworth's chief essays in throwing light on himself are the
    "Advertisement," "Preface," and "Appendix" to <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>; the letters to
    Lady Beaumont and "the Friend" and the "Preface" to the Poems dated 1815. All this
    matter is strangely interesting and of immense educational value. It is the
    first-class expert talking at ease about his subject. The essays relating to
    <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> will be the most useful for you. You will discover these
    precious documents in a volume entitled <i>Wordsworth's Literary Criticism</i>
    (published by Henry <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg
    85]</span> Frowde, 2s. 6d.), edited by that distinguished Wordsworthian Mr. Nowell C.
    Smith. It is essential that the student of poetry should become possessed, honestly
    or dishonestly, either of this volume or of the matter which it contains. There is,
    by the way, a volume of Wordsworth's prose in the Scott Library (1s.). Those who have
    not read Wordsworth on poetry can have no idea of the na&iuml;ve charm and the
    helpful radiance of his expounding. I feel that I cannot too strongly press
    Wordsworth's criticism upon you.</p>
    <p>Between Wordsworth and Hazlitt you will learn all that it behoves you to know of
    the nature, the aims, and the results of poetry. It is no part of my scheme to dot
    the "i's" and cross the "t's" of Wordsworth and Hazlitt. I best fulfil my purpose in
    urgently referring you to them. I have only a single point of my own to make&mdash;a
    psychological detail. One of the main obstacles to the cultivation of poetry in the
    average sensible man is an absurdly inflated notion of the ridiculous. At the bottom
    of that man's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
    mind is the idea that poetry is "silly." He also finds it exaggerated and artificial;
    but these two accusations against poetry can be satisfactorily answered. The charge
    of silliness, of being ridiculous, however, cannot be refuted by argument. There is
    no logical answer to a guffaw. This sense of the ridiculous is merely a bad,
    infantile habit, in itself grotesquely ridiculous. You may see it particularly in the
    theatre. Not the greatest dramatist, not the greatest composer, not the greatest
    actor can prevent an audience from laughing uproariously at a tragic moment if a cat
    walks across the stage. But why ruin the scene by laughter? Simply because the
    majority of any audience is artistically childish. This sense of the ridiculous can
    only be crushed by the exercise of moral force. It can only be cowed. If you are
    inclined to laugh when a poet expresses himself more powerfully than you express
    yourself, when a poet talks about feelings which are not usually mentioned in daily
    papers, when a poet uses words and images which lie outside your vocabulary and range
    of thought, then you had better <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
    id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> take yourself in hand. You have to decide whether you
    will be on the side of the angels or on the side of the nincompoops. There is no
    surer sign of imperfect development than the impulse to snigger at what is unusual,
    na&iuml;ve, or exuberant. And if you choose to do so, you can detect the cat walking
    across the stage in the sublimest passages of literature. But more advanced souls
    will grieve for you.</p>
    <p>The study of Wordsworth's criticism makes the seventh step in my course of
    treatment. The eighth is to return to those poems of Wordsworth's which you have
    already perused, and read them again in the full light of the author's defence and
    explanation. Read as much Wordsworth as you find you can assimilate, but do not
    attempt either of his long poems. The time, however, is now come for a long poem. I
    began by advising narrative poetry for the neophyte, and I shall persevere with the
    prescription. I mean narrative poetry in the restricted sense; for epic poetry is
    narrative. <i>Paradise Lost</i> is narrative; so is <i>The Prelude</i>. <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> I suggest neither of
    these great works. My choice falls on Elizabeth Browning's <i>Aurora Leigh</i>. If
    you once work yourself "into" this poem, interesting yourself primarily (as with
    Wordsworth) in the events of the story, and not allowing yourself to be obsessed by
    the fact that what you are reading is "poetry"&mdash;if you do this, you are not
    likely to leave it unfinished. And before you reach the end you will have encountered
    <i>en route</i> pretty nearly all the moods of poetry that exist: tragic, humorous,
    ironic, elegiac, lyric&mdash;everything. You will have a comprehensive acquaintance
    with a poet's mind. I guarantee that you will come safely through if you treat the
    work as a novel. For a novel it effectively is, and a better one than any written by
    Charlotte Bront&euml; or George Eliot. In reading, it would be well to mark, or take
    note of, the passages which give you the most pleasure, and then to compare these
    passages with the passages selected for praise by some authoritative critic.
    <i>Aurora Leigh</i> can be got in the "Temple Classics" (1s. 6d.), or in the
    "Canterbury Poets" (1s.). The indispensable biographical information <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> about Mrs. Browning
    can be obtained from Mr. J.H. Ingram's short Life of her in the "Eminent Women"
    Series (1s. 6d.), or from <i>Robert Browning</i>, by William Sharp ("Great Writers"
    Series, 1s.).</p>
    <p>This accomplished, you may begin to choose your poets. Going back to Hazlitt, you
    will see that he deals with, among others, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton,
    Dryden, Pope, Chatterton, Burns, and the Lake School. You might select one of these,
    and read under his guidance. Said Wordsworth: "I was impressed by the conviction that
    there were four English poets whom I must have continually before me as
    examples&mdash;Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton." (A word to the wise!)
    Wordsworth makes a fifth to these four. Concurrently with the careful, enthusiastic
    study of one of the undisputed classics, modern verse should be read. (I beg you to
    accept the following statement: that if the study of classical poetry inspires you
    with a distaste for modern poetry, then there is something seriously wrong <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> in the method of your
    development.) You may at this stage (and not before) commence an inquiry into
    questions of rhythm, verse-structure, and rhyme. There is, I believe, no good,
    concise, cheap handbook to English prosody; yet such a manual is greatly needed. The
    only one with which I am acquainted is Tom Hood the younger's <i>Rules of Rhyme: A
    Guide to English Versification</i>. Again, the introduction to Walker's <i>Rhyming
    Dictionary</i> gives a fairly clear elementary account of the subject. Ruskin also
    has written an excellent essay on verse-rhythms. With a manual in front of you, you
    can acquire in a couple of hours a knowledge of the formal principles in which the
    music of English verse is rooted. The business is trifling. But the business of
    appreciating the inmost spirit of the greatest verse is tremendous and lifelong. It
    is not something that can be "got up."</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
    <h2>BROAD COUNSELS</h2>
    <p>I have now set down what appear to me to be the necessary considerations,
    recommendations, exhortations, and dehortations in aid of this delicate and arduous
    enterprise of forming the literary taste. I have dealt with the theory of literature,
    with the psychology of the author, and&mdash;quite as important&mdash;with the
    psychology of the reader. I have tried to explain the author to the reader and the
    reader to himself. To go into further detail would be to exceed my original
    intention, with no hope of ever bringing the constantly-enlarging scheme to a logical
    conclusion. My aim is not to provide a map, but a compass&mdash;two very different
    instruments. In the way of general advice it remains for me only to put before you
    three counsels which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg
    92]</span> apply more broadly than any I have yet offered to the business of
    reading.</p>
    <p>You have within yourself a touchstone by which finally you can, and you must, test
    every book that your brain is capable of comprehending. Does the book seem to you to
    be sincere and true? If it does, then you need not worry about your immediate
    feelings, or the possible future consequences of the book. You will ultimately like
    the book, and you will be justified in liking it. Honesty, in literature as in life,
    is the quality that counts first and counts last. But beware of your immediate
    feelings. Truth is not always pleasant. The first glimpse of truth is, indeed,
    usually so disconcerting as to be positively unpleasant, and our impulse is to tell
    it to go away, for we will have no truck with it. If a book arouses your genuine
    contempt, you may dismiss it from your mind. Take heed, however, lest you confuse
    contempt with anger. If a book really moves you to anger, the chances are that it is
    a good book. Most good books have begun by causing anger which <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> disguised itself as
    contempt. Demanding honesty from your authors, you must see that you render it
    yourself. And to be honest with oneself is not so simple as it appears. One's
    sensations and one's sentiments must be examined with detachment. When you have
    violently flung down a book, listen whether you can hear a faint voice saying within
    you: "It's true, though!" And if you catch the whisper, better yield to it as quickly
    as you can. For sooner or later the voice will win. Similarly, when you are hugging a
    book, keep your ear cocked for the secret warning: "Yes, but it isn't true." For bad
    books, by flattering you, by caressing, by appealing to the weak or the base in you,
    will often persuade you what fine and splendid books they are. (Of course, I use the
    word "true" in a wide and essential significance. I do not necessarily mean true to
    literal fact; I mean true to the plane of experience in which the book moves. The
    truthfulness of <i>Ivanhoe</i>, for example, cannot be estimated by the same
    standards as the truthfulness of Stubbs's <i>Constitutional History</i>.) In reading
    a book, a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>
    sincere questioning of oneself, "Is it true?" and a loyal abiding by the answer, will
    help more surely than any other process of ratiocination to form the taste. I will
    not assert that this question and answer are all-sufficient. A true book is not
    always great. But a great book is never untrue.</p>
    <p>My second counsel is: In your reading you must have in view some definite
    aim&mdash;some aim other than the wish to derive pleasure. I conceive that to give
    pleasure is the highest end of any work of art, because the pleasure procured from
    any art is tonic, and transforms the life into which it enters. But the maximum of
    pleasure can only be obtained by regular effort, and regular effort implies the
    organisation of that effort. Open-air walking is a glorious exercise; it is the
    walking itself which is glorious. Nevertheless, when setting out for walking
    exercise, the sane man generally has a subsidiary aim in view. He says to himself
    either that he will reach a given point, or that he will progress at a given speed
    for a given <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>
    distance, or that he will remain on his feet for a given time. He organises his
    effort, partly in order that he may combine some other advantage with the advantage
    of walking, but principally in order to be sure that the effort shall be an adequate
    effort. The same with reading. Your paramount aim in poring over literature is to
    enjoy, but you will not fully achieve that aim unless you have also a subsidiary aim
    which necessitates the measurement of your energy. Your subsidiary aim may be
    &aelig;sthetic, moral, political, religious, scientific, erudite; you may devote
    yourself to a man, a topic, an epoch, a nation, a branch of literature, an
    idea&mdash;you have the widest latitude in the choice of an objective; but a definite
    objective you must have. In my earlier remarks as to method in reading, I advocated,
    without insisting on, regular hours for study. But I both advocate and insist on the
    fixing of a date for the accomplishment of an allotted task. As an instance, it is
    not enough to say: "I will inform myself completely as to the Lake School." It is
    necessary to say: <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg
    96]</span> "I will inform myself completely as to the Lake School before I am a year
    older." Without this precautionary steeling of the resolution the risk of a
    humiliating collapse into futility is enormously magnified.</p>
    <p>My third counsel is: Buy a library. It is obvious that you cannot read unless you
    have books. I began by urging the constant purchase of books&mdash;any books of
    approved quality, without reference to their immediate bearing upon your particular
    case. The moment has now come to inform you plainly that a bookman is, amongst other
    things, a man who possesses many books. A man who does not possess many books is not
    a bookman. For years literary authorities have been favouring the literary public
    with wondrously selected lists of "the best books"&mdash;the best novels, the best
    histories, the best poems, the best works of philosophy&mdash;or the hundred best or
    the fifty best of all sorts. The fatal disadvantage of such lists is that they leave
    out large quantities of literature which is admittedly first-class. The <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span> bookman cannot
    content himself with a selected library. He wants, as a minimum, a library reasonably
    complete in all departments. With such a basis acquired, he can afterwards wander
    into those special byways of book-buying which happen to suit his special
    predilections. Every Englishman who is interested in any branch of his native
    literature, and who respects himself, ought to own a comprehensive and inclusive
    library of English literature, in comely and adequate editions. You may suppose that
    this counsel is a counsel of perfection. It is not. Mark Pattison laid down a rule
    that he who desired the name of book-lover must spend five per cent. of his income on
    books. The proposal does not seem extravagant, but even on a smaller percentage than
    five the average reader of these pages may become the owner, in a comparatively short
    space of time, of a reasonably complete English library, by which I mean a library
    containing the complete works of the supreme geniuses, representative important works
    of all the first-class men in all departments, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
    id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> and specimen works of all the men of the second rank
    whose reputation is really a living reputation to-day. The scheme for a library,
    which I now present, begins before Chaucer and ends with George Gissing, and I am
    fairly sure that the majority of people will be startled at the total inexpensiveness
    of it. So far as I am aware, no such scheme has ever been printed before.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
    <h2>AN ENGLISH LIBRARY: PERIOD I</h2>
    <p>[For much counsel and correction in the matter of editions and prices I am
    indebted to my old and valued friend, Charles Young, head of the firm of Lamley &amp;
    Co., booksellers, South Kensington.]</p>
    <p>For the purposes of book-buying, I divide English literature, not strictly into
    historical epochs, but into three periods which, while scarcely arbitrary from the
    historical point of view, have nevertheless been calculated according to the space
    which they will occupy on the shelves and to the demands which they will make on the
    purse:</p>
    <p><b>I.</b> From the beginning to John Dryden, or roughly, to the end of the
    seventeenth century.</p>
    <p><b>II.</b> From William Congreve to Jane Austen, or roughly, the eighteenth
    century.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
    <p><b>III.</b> From Sir Walter Scott to the last deceased author who is recognised as
    a classic, or roughly, the nineteenth century.</p>
    <p>Period III. will bulk the largest and cost the most; not necessarily because it
    contains more absolutely great books than the other periods (though in my opinion it
    <i>does</i>), but because it is nearest to us, and therefore fullest of interest for
    us.</p>
    <p>I have not confined my choice to books of purely literary interest&mdash;that is
    to say, to works which are primarily works of literary art. Literature is the vehicle
    of philosophy, science, morals, religion, and history; and a library which aspires to
    be complete must comprise, in addition to imaginative works, all these branches of
    intellectual activity. Comprising all these branches, it cannot avoid comprising
    works of which the purely literary interest is almost nil.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, I have excluded from consideration:&mdash;</p>
    <p>i. Works whose sole importance is that they form a link in the chain of <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> development. For
    example, nearly all the productions of authors between Chaucer and the beginning of
    the Elizabethan period, such as Gower, Hoccleve, and Skelton, whose works, for
    sufficient reason, are read only by professors and students who mean to be
    professors.</p>
    <p>ii. Works not originally written in English, such as the works of that very great
    philosopher Roger Bacon, of whom this isle ought to be prouder than it is. To this
    rule, however, I have been constrained to make a few exceptions. Sir Thomas More's
    <i>Utopia</i> was written in Latin, but one does not easily conceive a library to be
    complete without it. And could one exclude Sir Isaac Newton's <i>Principia</i>, the
    masterpiece of the greatest physicist that the world has ever seen? The law of
    gravity ought to have, and does have, a powerful sentimental interest for us.</p>
    <p>iii. Translations from foreign literature into English.</p>
    <p>Here, then, are the lists for the first period:</p>

    <p>There were a number of brilliant minor writers in the seventeenth century whose
    best work, often trifling in bulk, either scarcely merits the acquisition of a
    separate volume for each author, or cannot be obtained at all in a modern edition.
    Such authors, however, may not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
    id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> be utterly neglected in the formation of a library.
    It is to meet this difficulty that I have included the last three volumes on the
    above list. Professor Arber's anthologies are full of rare pieces, and comprise
    admirable specimens of the verse of Samuel Daniel, Giles Fletcher, Countess of
    Pembroke, James I., George Peele, Sir Walter Raleigh, Thomas Sackville, Sir Philip
    Sidney, Drummond of Hawthornden, Thomas Heywood, George Wither, Sir Henry Wotton, Sir
    William Davenant, Thomas Randolph, Frances Quarles, James Shirley, and other greater
    and lesser poets.</p>
    <p>I have included all the important Elizabethan dramatists except John Marston, all
    the editions of whose works, according to my researches, are out of print.</p>
    <p>In the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods talent was so extraordinarily plentiful
    that the standard of excellence is quite properly raised, and certain authors are
    thus relegated to the third, or excluded, class who in a less fertile period would
    have counted as at least second-class.</p>

<p>In addition, scores of authors of genuine interest are represented in the
    anthologies.</p>
    <p>The prices given are gross, and in many instances there is a 25 per cent. discount
    to come off. All the volumes can be procured immediately at any bookseller's.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
    <h2>AN ENGLISH LIBRARY: PERIOD II</h2>
    <p>After dealing with the formation of a library of authors up to John Dryden, I must
    logically arrange next a scheme for the period covered roughly by the eighteenth
    century. There is, however, no reason why the student in quest of a library should
    follow the chronological order. Indeed, I should advise him to attack the nineteenth
    century before the eighteenth, for the reason that, unless his taste happens to be
    peculiarly "Augustan," he will obtain a more immediate satisfaction and profit from
    his acquisitions in the nineteenth century than in the eighteenth. There is in
    eighteenth-century literature a considerable proportion of what I may term
    "unattractive excellence," which one must have for the purposes of completeness,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span> but which
    may await actual perusal until more pressing and more human books have been read. I
    have particularly in mind the philosophical authors of the century.</p>

    immorality of the stage is his slender title to remembrance; Richard Bentley, whose
    scholarship principally died with him, and whose chief works are no longer current;
    and "Junius," who would have been deservedly forgotten long ago had there been a

    <h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
    <h2>AN ENGLISH LIBRARY: PERIOD III</h2>
    <p>The catalogue of necessary authors of this third and last period being so long, it
    is convenient to divide the prose writers into Imaginative and Non-imaginative.</p>
    <p>In the latter half of the period the question of copyright affects our scheme to a
    certain extent, because it affects prices. Fortunately it is the fact that no single
    book of recognised first-rate general importance is conspicuously dear. Nevertheless,
    I have encountered difficulties in the second rank; I have dealt with them in a
    spirit of compromise. I think I may say that, though I should have included a few
    more authors had their books been obtainable at a reasonable price, I have omitted
    none that I consider indispensable to a thoroughly representative <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> collection. No
    living author is included.</p>
    <p>Where I do not specify the edition of a book the original copyright edition is
    meant.</p>

    <p>The following authors are omitted, I think justifiably:&mdash;Hallam, Whewell,
    Grote, Faraday, Herschell, Hamilton, John Wilson, Richard Owen, Stirling Maxwell,
    Buckle, Oscar Wilde, P.G. Hamerton, F.D. Maurice, Henry Sidgwick, and Richard
    Jebb.</p>
    <p>Lastly, here is the list of poets. In the matter of price per volume it is the
    most expensive of all the lists. This is due to the fact that it contains a larger
    proportion of copyright works. Where I do not specify the edition of a book, the
    original copyright edition is meant:</p>

    <p>Poets whom I have omitted after hesitation are: Ebenezer Elliott, Thomas Woolner,
    William Barnes, Gerald Massey, and Charles Jeremiah Wells. On the other hand, I have
    had no hesitation about omitting David Moir, Felicia Hemans, Aytoun, Sir Edwin
    Arnold, and Sir Lewis Morris. I have included John Keble in deference to much
    enlightened opinion, but against my inclination. There are two names in the list
    which may be somewhat unfamiliar to many readers. James Clarence Mangan is the author
    of <i>My Dark Rosaleen</i>, an acknowledged <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
    id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> masterpiece, which every library must contain. T.E.
    Brown is a great poet, recognised as such by a few hundred people, and assuredly
    destined to a far wider fame. I have included FitzGerald because <i>Omar Khayyam</i>
    is much less a translation than an original work.</p>

    <p>I think it will be agreed that the total cost of this library is surprisingly
    small. By laying out the sum of sixpence a day for three years you may become the
    possessor of a collection of books which, for range and completeness in all branches
    of literature, will bear comparison with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
    id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> libraries far more imposing, more numerous, and more
    expensive.</p>
    <p>I have mentioned the question of discount. The discount which you will obtain
    (even from a bookseller in a small town) will be more than sufficient to pay for
    Chambers's <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature</i>, three volumes, price 30s.
    net. This work is indispensable to a bookman. Personally, I owe it much.</p>
    <p>When you have read, wholly or in part, a majority of these three hundred and
    thirty-five volumes, <i>with enjoyment</i>, you may begin to whisper to yourself that
    your literary taste is formed; and you may pronounce judgment on modern works which
    come before the bar of your opinion in the calm assurance that, though to err is
    human, you do at any rate know what you are talking about.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
    <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
    <h2>MENTAL STOCKTAKING</h2>
    <p>Great books do not spring from something accidental in the great men who wrote
    them. They are the effluence of their very core, the expression of the life itself of
    the authors. And literature cannot be said to have served its true purpose until it
    has been translated into the actual life of him who reads. It does not succeed until
    it becomes the vehicle of the vital. Progress is the gradual result of the unending
    battle between human reason and human instinct, in which the former slowly but surely
    wins. The most powerful engine in this battle is literature. It is the vast reservoir
    of true ideas and high emotions&mdash;and life is constituted of ideas and emotions.
    In a world deprived of literature, the intellectual and emotional <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> activity of all
    but a few exceptionally gifted men would quickly sink and retract to a narrow circle.
    The broad, the noble, the generous would tend to disappear for want of accessible
    storage. And life would be correspondingly degraded, because the fallacious idea and
    the petty emotion would never feel the upward pull of the ideas and emotions of
    genius. Only by conceiving a society without literature can it be clearly realised
    that the function of literature is to raise the plain towards the top level of the
    peaks. Literature exists so that where one man has lived finely ten thousand may
    afterwards live finely. It is a means of life; it concerns the living essence.</p>
    <p>Of course, literature has a minor function, that of passing the time in an
    agreeable and harmless fashion, by giving momentary faint pleasure. Vast multitudes
    of people (among whom may be numbered not a few habitual readers) utilise only this
    minor function of literature; by implication they class it with golf, bridge, or
    soporifics. Literary genius, however, had no intention of <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> competing with these devices for
    fleeting the empty hours; and all such use of literature may be left out of
    account.</p>
    <p>You, O serious student of many volumes, believe that you have a sincere passion
    for reading. You hold literature in honour, and your last wish would be to debase it
    to a paltry end. You are not of those who read because the clock has just struck nine
    and one can't go to bed till eleven. You are animated by a real desire to get out of
    literature all that literature will give. And in that aim you keep on reading, year
    after year, and the grey hairs come. But amid all this steady tapping of the
    reservoir, do you ever take stock of what you have acquired? Do you ever pause to
    make a valuation, in terms of your own life, of that which you are daily absorbing,
    or imagine you are absorbing? Do you ever satisfy yourself by proof that you are
    absorbing anything at all, that the living waters, instead of vitalising you, are not
    running off you as though you were a duck in a storm? Because, if you omit this mere
    business <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>
    precaution, it may well be that you, too, without knowing it, are little by little
    joining the triflers who read only because eternity is so long. It may well be that
    even your alleged sacred passion is, after all, simply a sort of drug-habit. The
    suggestion disturbs and worries you. You dismiss it impatiently; but it returns.</p>
    <p>How (you ask, unwillingly) can a man perform a mental stocktaking? How can he put
    a value on what he gets from books? How can he effectively test, in cold blood,
    whether he is receiving from literature all that literature has to give him?</p>
    <p>The test is not so vague, nor so difficult, as might appear.</p>
    <p>If a man is not thrilled by intimate contact with nature: with the sun, with the
    earth, which is his origin and the arouser of his acutest emotions&mdash;</p>
    <p>If he is not troubled by the sight of beauty in many forms&mdash;</p>
    <p>If he is devoid of curiosity concerning his fellow-men and his
    fellow-animals&mdash;</p>
    <p>If he does not have glimpses of the nuity of all things in an orderly
    progress&mdash;</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>
    <p>If he is chronically "querulous, dejected, and envious"&mdash;</p>
    <p>If he is pessimistic&mdash;</p>
    <p>If he is of those who talk about "this age of shams," "this age without ideals,"
    "this hysterical age," and this heaven-knows-what-age&mdash;</p>
    <p>Then that man, though he reads undisputed classics for twenty hours a day, though
    he has a memory of steel, though he rivals Porson in scholarship and Sainte Beuve in
    judgment, is not receiving from literature what literature has to give. Indeed, he is
    chiefly wasting his time. Unless he can read differently, it were better for him if
    he sold all his books, gave to the poor, and played croquet. He fails because he has
    not assimilated into his existence the vital essences which genius put into the books
    that have merely passed before his eyes; because genius has offered him faith,
    courage, vision, noble passion, curiosity, love, a thirst for beauty, and he has not
    taken the gift; because genius has offered him the chance of living fully, and he is
    only half alive, for it is only in the stress of fine ideas and emotions that a man
    may <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> be truly
    said to live. This is not a moral invention, but a simple fact, which will be
    attested by all who know what that stress is.</p>
    <p>What! You talk learnedly about Shakespeare's sonnets! Have you heard Shakespeare's
    terrific shout:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen</p>
        <p class="i2">Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,</p>
        <p>Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</p>
        <p class="i2">Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>And yet, can you see the sun over the viaduct at Loughborough Junction of a
    morning, and catch its rays in the Thames off Dewar's whisky monument, and not shake
    with the joy of life? If so, you and Shakespeare are not yet in communication. What!
    You pride yourself on your beautiful edition of Casaubon's translation of <i>Marcus
    Aurelius</i>, and you savour the cadences of the famous:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This day I shall have to do with an idle, curious man, with an unthankful man, a
      railer, a crafty, false, or an envious man. All these ill qualities have happened
      unto him, through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad. But I that
      understand <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span>
      the nature of that which is good, that it only is to be desired, and of that which
      is bad, that it only is truly odious and shameful: who know, moreover, that this
      transgressor, whosoever he be, is my kinsman, not by the same blood and seed, but
      by participation of the same reason and of the same divine particle&mdash;how can I
      be hurt?...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And with these cadences in your ears you go and quarrel with a cabman!</p>
    <p>You would be ashamed of your literary self to be caught in ignorance of Whitman,
    who wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Now understand me well&mdash;it is provided in the essence of things that from
      any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth something to make a
      greater struggle necessary.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And yet, having achieved a motor-car, you lose your temper when it breaks down
    half-way up a hill!</p>
    <p>You know your Wordsworth, who has been trying to teach you about:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i4">The Upholder of the tranquil soul</p>
        <p>That tolerates the indignities of Time</p>
        <p>And, from the centre of Eternity</p>
        <p>All finite motions over-ruling, lives</p>
        <p>In glory immutable.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span> But you are
    capable of being seriously unhappy when your suburban train selects a tunnel for its
    repose!<br />
    <br />

    <p>And the A.V. of the Bible, which you now read, not as your forefathers read it,
    but with an &aelig;sthetic delight, especially in the Apocrypha! You remember:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Whatsoever is brought upon thee, take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art
      changed to a low estate. For gold is tried in the fire and acceptable men in the
      furnace of adversity.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And yet you are ready to lie down and die because a woman has scorned you! Go
    to!</p>
    <p>You think some of my instances approach the ludicrous? They do. They are meant to
    do so. But they are no more ludicrous than life itself. And they illustrate in the
    most workaday fashion how you can test whether your literature fulfils its function
    of informing and transforming your existence.</p>
    <p>I say that if daily events and scenes do not constantly recall and utilise the
    ideas and emotions contained in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
    id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> books which you have read or are reading; if the
    memory of these books does not quicken the perception of beauty, wherever you happen
    to be, does not help you to correlate the particular trifle with the universal, does
    not smooth out irritation and give dignity to sorrow&mdash;then you are, consciously
    or not, unworthy of your high vocation as a bookman. You may say that I am preaching
    a sermon. The fact is, I am. My mood is a severely moral mood. For when I reflect
    upon the difference between what books have to offer and what even relatively earnest
    readers take the trouble to accept from them, I am appalled (or should be appalled,
    did I not know that the world is moving) by the sheer inefficiency, the bland,
    complacent failure of the earnest reader. I am like yourself, the spectacle of
    inefficiency rouses my holy ire.</p>
    <p>Before you begin upon another masterpiece, set out in a row the masterpieces which
    you are proud of having read during the past year. Take the first on the list, that
    book which you perused <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg
    136]</span> in all the zeal of your New Year resolutions for systematic study.
    Examine the compartments of your mind. Search for the ideas and emotions which you
    have garnered from that book. Think, and recollect when last something from that book
    recurred to your memory apropos of your own daily commerce with humanity. Is it
    history&mdash;when did it throw a light for you on modern politics? Is it
    science&mdash;when did it show you order in apparent disorder, and help you to put
    two and two together into an inseparable four? Is it ethics&mdash;when did it
    influence your conduct in a twopenny-halfpenny affair between man and man? Is it a
    novel&mdash;when did it help you to "understand all and forgive all"? Is it
    poetry&mdash;when was it a magnifying glass to disclose beauty to you, or a fire to
    warm your cooling faith? If you can answer these questions satisfactorily, your
    stocktaking as regards the fruit of your traffic with that book may be reckoned
    satisfactory. If you cannot answer them satisfactorily, then either you chose the
    book badly or your impression that you <i>read</i> it is a mistaken one.</p>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>
    <p>When the result of this stocktaking forces you to the conclusion that your riches
    are not so vast as you thought them to be, it is necessary to look about for the
    causes of the misfortune. The causes may be several. You may have been reading
    worthless books. This, however, I should say at once, is extremely unlikely. Habitual
    and confirmed readers, unless they happen to be reviewers, seldom read worthless
    books. In the first place, they are so busy with books of proved value that they have
    only a small margin of leisure left for very modern works, and generally, before they
    can catch up with the age, Time or the critic has definitely threshed for them the
    wheat from the chaff. No! Mediocrity has not much chance of hood-winking the serious
    student.</p>
    <p>It is less improbable that the serious student has been choosing his books badly.
    He may do this in two ways&mdash;absolutely and relatively. Every reader of long
    standing has been through the singular experience of suddenly <i>seeing</i> a book
    with which his eyes have been <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
    id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span> familiar for years. He reads a book with a
    reputation and thinks: "Yes, this is a good book. This book gives me pleasure." And
    then after an interval, perhaps after half a lifetime, something mysterious happens
    to his mental sight. He picks up the book again, and sees a new and profound
    significance in every sentence, and he says: "I was perfectly blind to this book
    before." Yet he is no cleverer than he used to be. Only something has happened to
    him. Let a gold watch be discovered by a supposititious man who has never heard of
    watches. He has a sense of beauty. He admires the watch, and takes pleasure in it. He
    says: "This is a beautiful piece of bric-&agrave;-brac; I fully appreciate this
    delightful trinket." Then imagine his feelings when someone comes along with the key;
    imagine the light flooding his brain. Similar incidents occur in the eventful life of
    the constant reader. He has no key, and never suspects that there exists such a thing
    as a key. That is what I call a choice absolutely bad.</p>
    <p>The choice is relatively bad when, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
    id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span> spreading over a number of books, it pursues no
    order, and thus results in a muddle of faint impressions each blurring the rest.
    Books must be allowed to help one another; they must be skilfully called in to each
    other's aid. And that this may be accomplished some guiding principle is necessary.
    "And what," you demand, "should that guiding principle be?" How do I know? Nobody,
    fortunately, can make your principles for you. You have to make them for yourself.
    But I will venture upon this general observation: that in the mental world what
    counts is not numbers but co-ordination. As regards facts and ideas, the great
    mistake made by the average well-intentioned reader is that he is content with the
    names of things instead of occupying himself with the causes of things. He seeks
    answers to the question What? instead of to the question Why? He studies history, and
    never guesses that all history is caused by the facts of geography. He is a botanical
    expert, and can take you to where the <i>Sibthorpia europ&aelig;a</i> grows, and
    never troubles to wonder what the earth would be without <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> its cloak of plants. He wanders forth
    of starlit evenings and will name you with unction all the constellations from
    Andromeda to the Scorpion; but if you ask him why Venus can never be seen at
    midnight, he will tell you that he has not bothered with the scientific details. He
    has not learned that names are nothing, and the satisfaction of the lust of the eye a
    trifle compared to the imaginative vision of which scientific "details" are the
    indispensable basis.</p>
    <p>Most reading, I am convinced, is unphilosophical; that is to say, it lacks the
    element which more than anything else quickens the poetry of life. Unless and until a
    man has formed a scheme of knowledge, be it a mere skeleton, his reading must
    necessarily be unphilosophical. He must have attained to some notion of the
    inter-relations of the various branches of knowledge before he can properly
    comprehend the branch in which he specialises. If he has not drawn an outline map
    upon which he can fill in whatever knowledge comes to him, as it comes, and on which
    he can trace the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg
    141]</span> affinity of every part with every other part, he is assuredly frittering
    away a large percentage of his efforts. There are certain philosophical works which,
    once they are mastered, seem to have performed an operation for cataract, so that he
    who was blind, having read them, henceforward sees cause and effect working in and
    out everywhere. To use another figure, they leave stamped on the brain a chart of the
    entire province of knowledge.</p>
    <p>Such a work is Spencer's <i>First Principles</i>. I know that it is nearly useless
    to advise people to read <i>First Principles</i>. They are intimidated by the sound
    of it; and it costs as much as a dress-circle seat at the theatre. But if they would,
    what brilliant stocktakings there might be in a few years! Why, if they would only
    read such detached essays as that on "Manners and Fashion," or "The Genesis of
    Science" (in a sixpenny volume of Spencer's <i>Essays</i>, published by Watts and
    Co.), the magic illumination, the necessary power of "synthetising" things, might be
    vouch-safed to them. In any case, the lack <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
    id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> of some such disciplinary, co-ordinating measure
    will amply explain many disastrous stocktakings. The manner in which one single ray
    of light, one single precious hint, will clarify and energise the whole mental life
    of him who receives it, is among the most wonderful and heavenly of intellectual
    phenomena. Some men search for that light and never find it. But most men never
    search for it.</p>
    <p>The superlative cause of disastrous stocktakings remains, and it is much more
    simple than the one with which I have just dealt. It consists in the absence of
    meditation. People read, and read, and read, blandly unconscious of their effrontery
    in assuming that they can assimilate without any further effort the vital essence
    which the author has breathed into them. They cannot. And the proof that they do not
    is shown all the time in their lives. I say that if a man does not spend at least as
    much time in actively and definitely thinking about what he has read as he has spent
    in reading, he is simply insulting his author. If he does not submit himself <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> to intellectual
    and emotional fatigue in classifying the communicated ideas, and in emphasising on
    his spirit the imprint of the communicated emotions&mdash;then reading with him is a
    pleasant pastime and nothing else. This is a distressing fact. But it is a fact. It
    is distressing, for the reason that meditation is not a popular exercise. If a friend
    asks you what you did last night, you may answer, "I was reading," and he will be
    impressed and you will be proud. But if you answer, "I was meditating," he will have
    a tendency to smile and you will have a tendency to blush. I know this. I feel it
    myself. (I cannot offer any explanation.) But it does not shake my conviction that
    the absence of meditation is the main origin of disappointing stocktakings.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
