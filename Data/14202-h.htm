<a name="PREFACE"></a><h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<br />

<p>Here is a story about the oldest of
the three little Parlin girls, &quot;sister
Susy;&quot; though so many things are
always happening to Prudy that it is
not possible to keep her out of the
book.</p>

<p>I hope my dear little friends will
see how kind it was in God to send the
&quot;slow winter&quot; and the long nights of
pain to little Prudy.</p>

<p>If trouble should come to us, let us
grow gentle, and patient, and lovely.</p>

<p>Little friends, be sure of one thing&mdash;our
dear Father in heaven sends us
something hard to bear only because
he loves us.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_I"></a><h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>KEEPING SECRETS.</h3>
<br />

<p>We might begin this story of Susy
Parlin on a New Year's day, only it is
so hard to skip over Christmas. There
is such a charm about Christmas! It
makes you think at once of a fir tree
shining with little candles and sparkling
with toys, or of a droll Santa Claus
with a pack full of presents, or of a
waxen angel called the Christ-child.</p>

<p>And it is just as well to date from
the twenty-fifth of December, because,
as &quot;Christ was born on Christmas
day,&quot; that is really the &quot;Happy New
Year.&quot;</p>

<p>For a long while the three little
Parlin girls had been thinking and
dreaming of presents. Susy's wise
head was like a beehive, full of little
plans and little fancies, which were
flying about like bees, and buzzing in
everybody's ears.</p>

<p>But it may be as well to give you a
short description of the Parlin family.</p>

<p>Susy's eyes were of an &quot;evening
blue,&quot; the very color of the sky in a
summer night; good eyes, for they
were as clear as a well which has the
&quot;truth&quot; lying at the bottom of it. She
was almost as nimble as a squirrel, and
could face a northern snow storm
like an engineer. Her hair was dark
brown, and as smooth and straight
as pine-needles; while Prudy's fair hair
rippled like a brook running over
pebbles. Prudy's face was sunny, and
her mouth not much larger than a
button-hole.</p>

<p>The youngest sister was named
Alice, but the family usually called
her Dotty, or Dotty Dimple, for she
was about as round as a period, and
had a cunning little dimple in each
cheek. She had bright eyes, long
curls, and a very short tongue; that
is, she did not talk much. She was
two years and a half old before she
could be prevailed upon to say anything
at all. Her father declared that
Dotty thought there were people
enough in the world to do the talking,
and she would keep still; or perhaps
she was tired of hearing Prudy say so
much.</p>

<p>However, she had a way of nodding
her curly head, and shaking her plump
little forefinger; so everybody knew
very well what she meant. She had
learned the use of signs from a little
deaf and dumb boy of whom we shall
hear more by and by; but all at once,
when she was ready she began to talk
with all her might, and soon made up
for lost time.</p>

<p>The other members of the family
were only grown people: Mr. and
Mrs. Parlin, the children's excellent
parents; Mrs. Read, their kind Quaker
grandmother; and the Irish servant
girl, Norah.</p>

<p>Just now Mrs. Margaret Parlin,
their &quot;aunt Madge,&quot; was visiting them,
and the little girls felt quite easy
about Christmas, for they gave it all
up to her; and when they wanted to
know how to spend their small stock
of money, or how much this or that
pretty toy would cost, Prudy always
settled it by saying, &quot;Let's go ask
auntie: <i>she'll</i> know, for she's been
through the Rithmetic.&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy spoke these words with awe.
She thought &quot;going through the
Rithmetic&quot; was next thing to going
round the world.</p>

<p>&quot;O Auntie, I'm so glad you came,&quot;
said Susy, &quot;for I didn't see how I was
ever going to finish my Christmas
presents: I go to school, you know,
and it takes me all the rest of the time
to slide!&quot;</p>

<p>The children were busy making
wonderful things &quot;all secret;&quot; or they
would have been secret if Prudy hadn't
told.</p>

<p>For one thing, she wondered very
much what Susy could be doing with
four pins stuck in a spool. She
watched the nimble fingers as they
passed the worsted thread over the
pin-heads, making stitches as fast as
Susy could wink.</p>

<p>&quot;It looks like a tiny snake all
sticked through the hole in the spool,&quot;
said Prudy, eager with curiosity.
&quot;If you ain't a-goin' to speak, I
don't know what I <i>shall</i> do, Susy
Parlin!&quot;</p>

<p>When poor Susy could not pretend
any longer not to hear, she answered
Prudy, half vexed, half laughing, &quot;O,
dear, I s'pose you'll tease and tease till
you find out. Won't you never say a
word to anybody, <i>never</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never in my world,&quot; replied the
little one, with a solemn shake of her
head.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's a lamp-mat for auntie.
It's going to be blue, and red, and all
colors; and when it's done, mother'll
sew it into a round, and put fringe
on: won't it be splendid? But
remember, you promised not to
tell!&quot;</p>

<p>Now, the very next time Prudy sat
in her auntie's lap she whispered in
her ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't know what <i>we're</i> making
for you, <i>all secret</i>, out of worsted,
and <i>I</i> shan't tell!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mittens?&quot; said aunt Madge, kissing
Prudy's lips, which were pressed together
over her sweet little secret like
a pair of sugar-tongs clinching a lump
of sugar.</p>

<p>&quot;Mittens? No, indeed! Better'n
that! There'll be fringe all over it;
it's in a round; it's to put something
on,&mdash;to put the <i>lamp</i> on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a lamp-mat, of course?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes it is! O, there, now
you've been and guessed all in a
minute! Susy's gone an' told! I
didn't s'pose she'd tell. I wouldn't
for nothin' in my world!&quot;</p>

<p>Was it strange that Susy felt vexed
when she found that her nice little
surprise was all spoiled?</p>

<p>&quot;Try to be patient,&quot; said Mrs. Parlin,
gently. &quot;Remember how young and
thoughtless your sister is. She never
means any harm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, but, mamma,&quot; replied Susy,
&quot;she <i>keeps</i> me being patient all the
whole time, and it's hard work.&quot;</p>

<p>So Susy, in her vexation, said to
Prudy, rather sternly, &quot;You little
naughty thing, to go and tell when
you promised not to! You're almost
as bad as Dotty. &quot;What makes you
act so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Susy,&quot; said the child, looking
up through her tears, &quot;have I <i>acted</i>?
I didn't know I'd acted! If you loved
me, you wouldn't look that way to me.
You wrinkle up your face just like
Nanny when she says she'll shake the
naughty out of me, Miss Prudy.&quot;</p>

<p>Then what could Susy do but forgive
the sweet sister, who kissed her
so coaxingly, and looked as innocent
as a poor little kitty that has been
stealing cream without knowing it
is a sin?</p>

<p>It was plain that it would not do to
trust Prudy with secrets. Her brain
could not hold them, any more than
a sieve can hold water. So Mrs. Parlin
took pity upon Susy, and allowed her
and her cousin Florence Eastman to
lock themselves into her chamber at
certain hours, and work at their presents
without interruption.</p>

<p>While the little girls sat together
busily employed with book-marks and
pin-cushions, the time flew very
swiftly, and they were as happy as
bees in a honeysuckle.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin said she believed nothing
less than Christmas presents would
ever make Susy willing to use a needle
and thread; for she disliked sewing,
and declared she wished the man who
made the needles had to swallow them
all.</p>

<p>The family were to celebrate Christmas
evening; for Mr. Parlin was away,
and might not reach home in season
for Christmas eve.</p>

<p>For a wonder they were not to have
a Tree, but a Santa Claus, &quot;just for a
change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a truly Santa Claus, that
comes puffin' down the chimney,&quot;
explained Prudy, who knew very well
it would be only cousin Percy under
a mask and white wig.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="CHAPTER_II"></a><h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>BEFORE DAYLIGHT.</h3>
<br />

<p>On Christmas morning, at three
o'clock, there was a great bustle and
pattering of little feet, and buzzing of
little voices trying to speak in whispers.
Susy and Prudy were awake
and astir.</p>

<p>&quot;Where <i>do</i> you s'pose the stockings
are?&quot; buzzed Prudy, in a very loud
whisper.</p>

<p>&quot;Right by the bed-post, Prudy Parlin;
and if you don't take care we'll
wake everybody up.&mdash;'Sh! 'Sh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mine's pinned on,&quot; said Prudy;
&quot;and I've pricked my fingers. O
deary me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course you've waked 'em
all now,&quot; exclaimed Susy, indignantly:
&quot;I might have pricked my fingers to
pieces, but I wouldn't have said a
word.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Parlin, who were in
the next room, were wide awake by
this time; but they said nothing, only
listened to the whispers of the children,
which grew fainter, being smothered
and kept down by mouthfuls of candy,
lozenges, and peanuts.</p>

<p>The little girls longed for daybreak.
The sun, however, seemed to be in no
haste, and it was a long while before
there was a peep of light. Susy and
Prudy waited, wondering whether the
sun would really forget to show his
face; but all the while they waited
they were eating candy; so it was
neither dull nor lonely. As for closing
their eyes again, they would have
scorned the idea. It would be a pity
indeed to fall asleep, and lose the pleasure
of saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; to
everybody. Norah, the Irish servant,
had said she should be up very early
to attend High Mass: they must
certainly waylay her on the stairs.
How astonished she would be, when
she supposed they were both soundly
asleep!</p>

<p>&quot;Let me do it myself,&quot; said Susy:
&quot;you stay here, Prudy, for you'll be
sure to make a noise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go on my tippy toes,&quot; pleaded
Prudy, her mouth half filled with
chocolate drops.</p>

<p>So through their mother's room they
stole softly, only throwing over one
chair, and hitting Dotty's crib a little
in their haste. Dotty made a sleepy
sound of alarm, and Prudy could not
help laughing, but only &quot;in her sleeve,&quot;
that is, in her &quot;nightie&quot; sleeve, which
she put up to her mouth to smother
the noise.</p>

<p>When they had reached the back-stairs
Susy whispered, &quot;O, Norah is
up and gone down. I hear her in the
kitchen. 'Sh! 'Sh!&quot;</p>

<p>Susy thought there was no time to
be lost, and she would have rushed
down stairs, two steps at a time, but
her little sister was exactly in the
way.</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody has been and tugged
my little chair up here,&quot; said Prudy,
&quot;and I must tug it back again.&quot;</p>

<p>So in the dim light the two children
groped their way down stairs, Prudy
going first with the chair.</p>

<p>&quot;O, what a little snail! Hurry&mdash;can't
you?&quot; said Susy, impatiently;
&quot;Norah'll be gone! What's the use
of our waking up in the night if we
can't say Merry Christmas to anybody?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, <i>ain't</i> I a-hurryin' now?&quot; exclaimed
Prudy, plunging forward and
falling, chair and all, the whole length
of the stairs.</p>

<p>All the house was awake now, for
Prudy screamed lustily. Grandma
Read called out from the passage-way,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;O, little Prudence, has thee broken
thy neck?&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin rushed out, too frightened
to speak, and Mr. Parlin ran
down stairs, and took Prudy up in his
arms.</p>

<p>&quot;It was&mdash;you&mdash;did it&mdash;Susy
Parlin,&quot; sobbed the child. &quot;I shouldn't&mdash;have&mdash;fell,
if you&mdash;hadn't&mdash;have&mdash;screamed.&quot;</p>

<p>The poor little girl spoke slowly and
with difficulty, as if she dropped a
bucket into her full heart, and drew
up the words one at a time.</p>

<p>&quot;O, mother, I know it was me,&quot;
said Susy meekly; &quot;and I was careless,
and it was all in the dark. I'm sure
I hope Prudy'll forgive me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it wasn't you, neither,&quot; said
Prudy, whose good humor was restored
the moment Susy had made what she
considered due confession. &quot;You
never touched me, Susy! It was the
<i>chair</i>; and I love you just as dearly as
ever I did.&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy lay on the sofa for some
time, looking quite pale by the gas-light,
while her mother rubbed her
side, and the rest of the family
stood looking at her with anxious
faces.</p>

<p>It was quite an important occasion
for Prudy, who always liked to be the
centre of attraction.</p>

<p>&quot;O, mamma,&quot; said she, closing her
eyes languidly, &quot;when the room makes
believe whirl round, does it <i>truly</i> whirl
round?&quot;</p>

<p>The truth was, she felt faint and
dizzy, though only for a short time.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish,&quot; said she, &quot;it had been
somebody else that fell down stairs,
and not me, for I didn't go down easy!
The <i>prongs</i> of the chair pushed right
into my side.&quot;</p>

<p>But it did not appear that Prudy
was much injured, after all. In a few
minutes she was skipping about the
room almost as nimbly as ever, only
stopping to groan every now and then,
when she happened to think of it.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a wonder,&quot; said Mr. Parlin,
&quot;that more children are not lamed for
life by such accidents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have often thought of it,&quot; said
aunt Madge. &quot;Some little ones seem
to be making hair-breadth escapes
almost every day of their lives. I believe
Prudy would have been in her
grave long ago, if it had not been for
her guardian angel.&quot;</p>

<p>The long-expected Christmas had
come at last, and Prudy had stumbled
into it, as she stumbled into everything
else. But it is an ill wind which
blows no good to anybody; and it so
happened that in all this confusion
Susy was able to &quot;wish a Merry Christmas&quot;
to Norah, and to the whole
family besides.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Parlin found that the
children were too thoroughly awake to
go to sleep again that morning, she
told them they might dress themselves
in the parlor if they would
keep as quiet as possible, and let the
rest of the household take another
nap.</p>

<p>It all seemed very strange and
delightful to the little girls. It was
like another sort of life, this new
arrangement of stealing about the
house in the silent hours before daybreak.
Susy thought she should like
to sit up all night, and sleep all day,
if the mayor would only hush the
streets; it would be so odd!</p>

<p>&quot;O, how dark the clouds are!&quot;
said Prudy, peeping out of the window;
&quot;it <i>fogs</i> so I can't see a single thing.
Susy, I'm going to keep <i>at watch</i> of
the sky. Don't you s'pose, though,
'twill be Christmas all the same, if
there's a snow storm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's been snow,&quot; said Susy,
&quot;all in the night. Look down at the
pavement. Don't you wish that was
frosted cake?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, the snow came in the night, so
not to wake us up,&quot; cried Prudy, clapping
her hands; &quot;but it wouldn't
have waked us, you know, even in the
night, for it came so still.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why don't the clouds go off?&quot;
she added, sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; replied Susy; &quot;perhaps
they are waiting till the sun
comes and smiles them away.&quot;</p>

<p>Such happy children as these were,
as they sat peeping out of the window
at the dull gray sky!</p>

<p>They did not know that a great
mischief was begun that morning&mdash;a
mischief which was no larger yet
than &quot;a midge's wing.&quot; They were
watching the clouds for a snow storm;
but they never dreamed of such things
as clouds of <i>trouble</i>, which grow
darker and darker, and which even
the beautiful Christmas sun cannot
&quot;smile away.&quot;</p>

<h3>SUSY'S CHRISTMAS.</h3>
<br />

<p>It was bright and beautiful all day,
and then, when no one could possibly
wait any longer, it was Christmas
evening. The coal glowed in the
grate with a splendid blaze: all the
gas-burners were lighted, and so were
everybody's eyes. If one had listened,
one might have heard, from out of
doors, a joyful tinkling of sleigh-bells;
yet I fancy nobody could have told
whether the streets were still or noisy,
or whether the sky had a moon in it
or not; for nobody was quiet long
enough to notice.</p>

<p>But by and by, when the right time
had come, the folding-doors were
opened, just like the two covers to a
Christmas fairy book. Then, in a
second, it was so still you might have
heard a pin drop.</p>

<p>Such a funny little old gentleman
had arrived: his face alive with dimples,
and smiles, and wrinkles. His
cheeks were as red and round as winter
apples, and where there wasn't a
wrinkle there was a dimple; and no
doubt there was a dimple in his chin,
and his chin maybe was double, only
you couldn't tell, for it was hidden
ever so deep under a beard as white
as a snow-drift.</p>

<p>He walked along, tottering under
the weight of a huge pack full of
presents. He extended his small arms
towards the audience most affectionately,
and you could see that his antiquated
coat-sleeves were bristling with
toys and glistening with ornaments.
His eyes twinkled with fun, and his
mouth, which seemed nearly worn
out with laughing, grew bigger every
minute.</p>

<p>It took the dear old gentleman some
time to clear his throat; but when he
had found his voice, which at first was
as fine as a knitting-needle, and all of
a tremble, he made</p>

<p>THE SPEECH OF SANTA CLAUS.</p>

<p>&quot;How do, my darlings? How do,
all round? Bless your little hearts,
how do you all do? Did they tell ye
Santa wasn't a-comin', my dears? Did
your grandpas and grandmas say,
'Humph! there isn't any such a person.'
My love to the good old people.
I know they mean all right; but tell
them they'll have to give it up now!&quot;</p>

<p>(Here Santa Claus made a low bow.
Everybody laughed and clapped; but
Prudy whispered, &quot;O, don't he look
old all over? What has he done with
his <i>teeth</i>? O, dear, has anybody pulled
'em out?&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dears,&quot; continued the old
gentleman, encouraged by the applause,&mdash;&quot;yes,
my dears, here I am, as
jolly as ever! But bless your sweet
little hearts, I've had a terrible time
getting here! The wind has been
blowin' me up as fierce as you please,
and I've been shook round as if I
wasn't of more account than a kernel
of corn in a popper!</p>

<p>&quot;O, O, I've been ducked up to the
chin in some awful deep snow-drifts,
up there by the North Pole! This is
the very first time the storms have
come so heavy as to cover over the
end of the North Pole! But this year
they had to dig three days before they
could find it. O, ho!</p>

<p>&quot;I was a-wanderin' round all last
night; a real shivery night, too! Got
so <i>broke up</i>, there's nothing left of me
but small pieces. O, hum!</p>

<p>&quot;Such a time as I had in some of
those chimneys, you haven't any idee!
Why, if you'll believe me, over there
in Iceland somebody forgot to clear
out the chimney, and there I stuck
fast, like a fish-bone in your throat;
couldn't be picked out, couldn't be
swallowed!</p>

<p>&quot;The funniest time that was! How
I laughed! And then the children's
mother woke up, and, 'O, dear,' said
she; 'hear the wind sigh down the
chimney!' 'Only me,' says I; 'and
I've caught you napping this time!'
She helped me out, and when I had
caught my breath, I climbed out the
window; but, deary me, I shouldn't
wonder if that very woman went to
sleep again, and thought it was all a
dream! Heigh-ho! that's the way
they always treat poor Santa Claus
nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p>(Here the children laughed, and
Susy said, &quot;I guess he must have
bumped his nose against that chimney:
see what a hump!&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;O, O, don't you make sport of me,
children! My nose is big, to be sure,
but I'm going to keep it and make the
best of it! If you love Santa as he
loves you, you wouldn't mind the
looks. I <i>was</i> going to change my
coat and dickey; but then, thinks I,
I'll come just as I am! I patted myself
on the shoulder, and says I, 'Santa
Claus, don't you fret if you <i>are</i> growin'
old! You may look a little dried up,
but your heart isn't wrinkled; O no!'
You see father Adam and me was very
near of an age, but somehow I never
growed up! I always thought big
folks did very well in their place; but
for my part, give me the children.
Hurrah for the children!&quot;</p>

<p>(Great clapping and laughing.)</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you, darlings, I haven't forgot
a single one of you. My pockets
are running over. I've been preparing
presents for you ever since last fall,
when the birds broke up housekeeping.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's a tippet for the Prudy girl,
and she may have it for nothing; and
they are cheaper 'n that, if you take
'em by the quantity.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a walkin' book-case. Why,
I've brought stories and histories
enough to set up a store! I've got
more nuts than you can shake a hammer
at; but I think there's more bark
to 'em than there is bite. O, O, I find
I can't crack 'em with my teeth, as I
used to a hundred years ago!</p>

<p>&quot;But my dear, sweet, cunning little
hearers, I must be a-goin'. Queen Victoria,
said she to me, said she, 'Now,
Santa, my love, do you hurry back to
fill my children's stockings before the
clock strikes twelve.' Queen Vic is an
excellent woman, and is left a poor
widow; so I can't disappoint her, poor
soul!</p>

<p>&quot;I must be a-goin'! Would like to
hug and kiss you all round, but can't
stop. (Kisses his hand and bows.) A
Merry Christmas to you all, and a
Happy New Year.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, Santa Claus suddenly
disappeared at the hall door, dropping
his heavy pack upon the table.</p>

<p>In another minute the lively old
gentleman was in the front parlor
without any mask, and of course it
was nobody but cousin Percy &quot;with
his face off.&quot;</p>

<p>Then they all fell to work sorting
out presents. Prudy seized her fur
tippet, and put it on at once.</p>

<p>&quot;O, how pretty I look,&quot; said she;
&quot;just like a little cat! <i>Ain't</i> I cunning?&quot;</p>

<p>But nobody could pause to attend
to Prudy, though she chatted very
fast, without commas or periods, and
held up to view a large wax doll which
&quot;would be alive if it could talk.&quot;
They all had gifts as well as Prudy,
and wished to talk rather than to
listen. They asked questions without
waiting for answers, and did not mind
interrupting one another, and talking
all at once, like a party of school children.</p>

<p>All this was hardly polite, it is true;
but people are sometimes surprised
out of their good manners on Christmas
evenings, and must be forgiven
for it, as such a good time happens
but once a year.</p>

<p>Percy broke in with an old song, and
went through with a whole stanza of it,
although no one listened to a word:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Good luck unto old Christmas,<br /></span>
<span>And long life let us sing,<br /></span>
<span>For he doeth more good unto the poor<br /></span>
<span>Than many a crown&eacute;d king.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;My beautiful books!&quot; cried aunt
Madge; &quot;Russia morocco.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My writing-desk,&mdash;has any one
looked at it?&quot; said Mrs. Parlin; &quot;rose-wood,
inlaid with brass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My skates!&quot; broke in Susy, at the
top of her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; screamed cousin Percy;
&quot;won't anybody please notice my
drum? If you won't look, then look
out for a drum in each ear!&quot;</p>

<p>And as nobody would look or pay
the slightest attention, they all had to
hear &quot;Dixie&quot; pounded out in true
martial style, till they held on to their
ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Rattlety bang!&quot; went the drum.
&quot;Tweet, tweet,&quot; whistled the little
musical instruments which the children
were blowing.</p>

<p>&quot;Have pity on us!&quot; cried aunt
Madge; &quot;I am bewildered; my head
is floating like a Chinese garden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Order!&quot; shouted Mr. Parlin, laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;O, yes, sir,&quot; said Percy, seizing
Susy and whirling her round. &quot;Children,
why don't you try to preserve
order? My nerves are strung up like
violin-strings! I've got a pound of
headache to every ounce of brains.
Susy Parlin, do try to keep still!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thee needn't pretend it is all Susan,&quot;
said grandma Read, smiling.
&quot;Thee and little Prudence are the
noisiest of the whole!&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, they raised such a din, that
after a while poor grandma Read
smoothed the Quaker cap over her
smiling face, and stole off into her
own chamber, where she could &quot;settle
down into quietness.&quot; Much noise
always confused grandma Read.</p>

<p>But in a very few moments, when
the excitement began to die out, there
was a season of overwhelming gratitude.
Everybody had to thank everybody
else; and Mr. Parlin, who had a
beautiful dressing-gown to be grateful
for, nevertheless found time to tell
Susy, over and over again, how delighted
he was with her book-mark,
made, by her own fingers, of three
wide strips of velvet ribbon; on the
ends of which were fastened a cross,
a star, and an anchor, of card-board.</p>

<p>&quot;Papa, one ribbon is to keep your
place in the Old Testament,&quot; said
Susy; &quot;one is to stay in the middle,
at the births and marriages; and the
other one is for our chapter in the
New Testament, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think my lamp-mat is very pretty,&quot;
said aunt Madge, kissing Susy;
&quot;every bit as pretty as if Prudy hadn't
'been and told.'&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy had bought a shawl-pin for
her mother, a fierce little wooden soldier
for aunt Madge, and something
for everybody else but Susy. Not that
she forgot Susy. O, no! but one's
money does not always hold out, even
at Christmas time.</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Mr. Parlin, &quot;what is
this sticking fast to the sole of my
new slipper? Molasses candy, I do
believe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes sir; that's for Susy,&quot; cried
Prudy, suddenly remembering how she
had tucked it in at the last moment,
when she could not stop to find any
wrapping-paper. &quot;It isn't so big as it
was, but it's the biggest piece I had in
this world. I saved it last night.
Susy likes 'lasses candy, and I couldn't
think of nothin' else.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a wonder that Prudy's candy
had not spoiled some of the nice presents.</p>

<p>Susy received several pretty things;
and though she did not talk quite so
much as Prudy, she was just as happy.
For one thing, she had what she had
not dreamed was possible for a little
girl&mdash;a bottle of otto of rose; &quot;just
like a young lady.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a real delight to Susy: but
Prudy, sniffing at it, said, coolly, &quot;O,
ho! it smells 's if it didn't cost more'n
a cent! 'Tisn't half so sweet as pep'mint!&quot;</p>

<p>Before Dotty could be put to bed,
she had contrived to break several
toys, all of which happened to be
Susy's&mdash;a sugar temple, a glass pitcher,
and a small vase.</p>

<p>This was an evening long to be remembered;
but the most remarkable
event of all was to come.</p>

<p>&quot;Susy, my daughter,&quot; said Mr. Parlin,
&quot;have you been wondering why
you don't see a present from me?&quot;</p>

<p>Susy blushed. She had certainly
expected something handsome this
year from her father.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't forgotten you, my dear;
but the present I have chosen wouldn't
sit very well on the shoulders of such
a little fellow as Santa Claus.&quot;</p>

<p>Percy laughed. &quot;Wouldn't it have
been a load, uncle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; whispered aunt Madge;
&quot;she isn't to know till morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, papa,&quot; said Susy, her eyes
shining with excitement, &quot;why couldn't
you bring it in here now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is better off out of doors. Indeed,
to tell the truth, my child, it is
hardly suitable for the parlor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Miss Susy,&quot; said Percy, measuring
off his words on the tips of his
fingers, &quot;I'm authorized to tell you
it's something you mustn't take in
your lap, mustn't hang on a nail; if
you do, you'll lose it. I'm sure 'twill
please you, Susy, because it's a mute,
and can't speak. You&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, hush talking about dumb people!
I shouldn't think you'd make
sport of Freddy Jackson! If <i>you</i> was
a little <i>deaf-and-dumber</i> than you are
now, I'd like you better!</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear, dear!&quot; cried she, dancing
about the room; &quot;what can it be? I
can't wait!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only think; all night before I'll
know,&quot; thought she, as she touched
her pillow. &quot;O, Prudy, to-morrow
morning! Only think of to-morrow
morning I All my other presents are
just nothing at all. Anything is <i>so</i>
much nicer when you don't know
what it is!&quot;</p>

<h3>SUSY'S WINGS.</h3>
<br />

<p>Susy awoke next morning very
much surprised to find the sun so
high. Prudy was lying beside her,
talking to herself.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't feel very well,&quot; said the
child; &quot;but I'm pleasant; I mean to
be good all day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why didn't you speak to me?&quot;
cried Susy, springing out of bed,
&quot;when you knew how I couldn't wait
to see my present?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would have woke you up, Susy,
but I ain't well; I'm sick in my
knees.&quot;</p>

<p>And Prudy limped about the room
to show her sister how lame she was.
But Susy was in too great a hurry to
pay much attention to her, or to help
her dress.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, papa!&quot; she exclaimed,
the moment she entered the
parlor; &quot;now may I see the present?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you suppose you could wait till
after breakfast, Susy?&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Madge smiled as she looked
at the little eager face.</p>

<p>&quot;I see you are going on with your
lessons,&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;What lessons, auntie? Why, it is
the holidays!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lessons in patience, my dear.
Isn't something always happening
which you have to be patient about?&quot;</p>

<p>Susy thought of Prudy's habit of
disclosing secrets, Dotty's trying way
of destroying playthings; and now
this long delay about her present.
She began to think there were a great
many vexations in the world, and that
she bore them remarkably well for
such a little girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, thee must let patience have
her perfect work, Susan,&quot; said grandma
Read, after the &quot;silent blessing&quot;
had been asked at the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Mayn't I go, too?&quot; said Prudy,
when she saw her father, her auntie,
and Susy leaving the house just after
breakfast.</p>

<p>And she went, as a matter of course;
but the pavements were a little slippery
from sleet; and Prudy, who was
never a famous walker, had as much
as she could do, even with the help of
her father's hand, to keep from falling.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Prudy,&quot; said Mr. Parlin,
&quot;what ails you this morning? You
limp so much that I believe you need
crutches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sick in my knee,&quot; replied
Prudy, delighted to see that her lameness
was observed. &quot;If <i>you</i> had my
knee, and it hurt, you'd know how it
feels!&quot;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached a
livery stable; and, to Susy's surprise,
her father stopped short, and said to
a man who stood by the door, &quot;Mr.
Hill, my daughter has come to look
at her pony.&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy was in a great fright at sight
of so many horses, and needed all her
auntie's attention; but Susy had no
fear, and Mr. Parlin led her along to
a stall where stood a beautiful black
pony, as gentle-looking as a Newfoundland
dog.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you like him, Susy? Stroke
his face, and talk to him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, O, papa, you don't mean, you
can't mean, he's my very own! A
whole pony all to myself!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See what you think of his saddle,
miss,&quot; said Mr. Hill, laughing at Susy's
eagerness; and he led pony out, and
threw over his back a handsome side-saddle.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, it seems as if I could just
jump on without anybody touching
me,&quot; cried Susy.</p>

<p>&quot;Not afraid a bit?&quot; said Mr. Hill, as
Mr. Parlin seated Susy in the saddle,
and gave her the reins. &quot;Ponies
throw people, sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, but my papa would never give
me a bad pony,&quot; answered Susy, with
perfect confidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill laughed again. He was a
rough man; but he thought a child's
faith in a parent was a beautiful
thing.</p>

<p>He did not know many passages
of Scripture, but thought he had
read somewhere, &quot;And if he ask
bread, will he give him a stone?&quot;
No; fathers are glad to give their
&quot;best gifts,&quot; and the little ones trust
them.</p>

<p>&quot;It's like sailing in a boat,&quot; cried
Susy, riding back and forth about the
yard in great excitement; &quot;why, it's
just as easy as the swing in the oilnut-tree
at grandma Parlin's! O, papa,
to think I should forget to thank
you!&quot;</p>

<p>But perhaps Mr. Parlin regarded
glowing cheeks and shining eyes as
the very best of thanks.</p>

<p>Prudy thought the pony a beautiful
&quot;baby horse;&quot; wanted to ride, and
didn't want to; was afraid, and wasn't
afraid, and, as her father said, &quot;had
as many minds as some politicians
who are said to 'stand on the fence.'&quot;
By and by, after some coaxing, the
timid little thing consented to sit behind
Susy, and cling round her waist,
if her father would walk beside her to
make sure she didn't fall off. In this
way they went home.</p>

<p>&quot;I like to sit so I can hug my sister,
while she drives the horse,&quot; said
Prudy; &quot;besides, it hurts me to
walk.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin and aunt Madge smiled
at the child's speeches, but gave no
more heed to this lameness of which
she complained, than they did to any
of the rest of her little freaks.</p>

<p>Prudy liked to be pitied for every
small hurt; and when Susy had a
sore throat, and wore a compress, she
looked upon her with envy, and felt it
almost as a personal slight that <i>her</i>
throat could not be wrapped in a compress
too.</p>

<p>On their way they met &quot;lame
Jessie,&quot; a little girl with crooked spine
and very high shoulders, who hobbled
along on crutches.</p>

<p>&quot;She's lamer than me,&quot; said Prudy.
&quot;Good morning, Jessie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know what I've thought of,&quot; said
Susy, who could talk of nothing which
was not in some way connected with
her pony. &quot;I'm going to give that
girl some rides. How happy she will
be, poor little Jessie!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you get your sleigh,&quot; said
Mr. Parlin.</p>

<p>&quot;My sleigh, papa? How many
more presents are coming?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is hard to tell, Susy; one gift
makes way for another, you see.
First comes the pony; but how can
he live without a stable, and a groom
to feed him? Then what is a pony
worth without a saddle? And, as one
does not wish always to ride pony-back,
a sleigh is the next thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, papa, you know in the
summer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear, in the summer, if
we all live, there must be a light carriage
made on purpose for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is one thing more that pony
needs,&quot; said aunt Madge, stroking his
eyebrows, &quot;and that is, a name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, I never thought of that,&quot; said
Susy; &quot;help me find a name, auntie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me think. I should call him
something good and pleasant. Think
of something good and pleasant
Think of something you like very
much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, Frosted Cake,&quot; cried Prudy:
&quot;wouldn't that be pleasant? Susy
loves that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to name him for the
American Eagle,&quot; said Susy, who had
heard some patriotic speeches from
her cousin Percy; &quot;only you couldn't
pet that name, could you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might call him Don Carlos, or
Don Pedro,&quot; suggested Mr. Parlin.</p>

<p>&quot;No, papa; only think of Donny:
that is like Donkey! You haven't any
long ears, <i>have</i> you, pony? If you had,
I'd call you Little Pitcher, for 'little
pitchers have great ears.' That makes
me think of Mr. Allen, auntie. How
big his ears are, you know? <i>Is</i> it because
his teacher pulled them so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, call him 'Gustus,'&quot; cried Prudy.</p>

<p>&quot;But that would soon be Gusty,&quot;
said aunt Madge, &quot;and would sound
too much like the east wind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me,&quot; sighed Susy; &quot;who'd
ever think it was such hard work to
find names?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, look,&quot; said Prudy, as they passed
a jaded old horse; &quot;there is a pony
just exactly like this! Only it's twice
as big, you know, and not a <i>bit</i> such a
color!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there, Prudy,&quot; said Susy,
disdainfully, &quot;I thought, when you
began to speak, you was going to tell
something! Why don't you wait till
you have something to say? Please
give me a list of names, papa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's Speedwell, Lightfoot, Zephyr,
Prince, Will-o'-the-wisp&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I might call him Wispy,&quot; broke in
Susy. &quot;Zephyr is good, only it makes
you think of worsteds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, listen,&quot; said aunt Madge;
&quot;you might call him Elephant, just
for sport, because he is in reality so
very little. Or, on the other hand,
you might find the least speck of a
name, like Firefly, or Midge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't like any of those,&quot; replied
Susy, still dissatisfied.</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; said aunt Madge, laughing,
&quot;nothing will please you but a great
name. What say to Pegasus, a flying
horse, which poets are said to ride?
It might be shortened to Peggy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, auntie, you wouldn't have
this beautiful pony called Peggy;
you know you wouldn't! the one
my father bought on purpose for
me! But was there such a horse,
truly?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, no; there is an old fable, which,
as we say, is 'as true now as it ever
was,' of a glorious creature with wings,
and whoever mounts him gets a flying
ride into the clouds. But the trouble
is to catch him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, I wish my pony could fly,&quot; said
Susy, gazing dreamily at his black
mane and sleek sides. &quot;The first
place I'd go to would be the moon;
and there I'd stay till I built a castle
as big as a city. I'd come home every
night, so mother wouldn't be frightened,
and fly up in the morning, and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See here,&quot; said Prudy, who had
for some time been trying to speak;
&quot;call him <i>Wings</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I will,&quot; answered Susy, quickly,
&quot;and I'll make believe he flies in the
air like a bird. Now, auntie, what do
you think of Wings?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Odd enough, I'm sure, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, <i>I</i> like it,&quot; returned Susy,
with a positive shake of the head.
&quot;It's of no use to keep fussing so long
over a name, and I feel a great deal
easier, now I've made up my mind!
Dear little Wings, you prick up your
ears, and I know you like it, too. I
wish you had a soul, so you could be
taken to church, and christened like
a baby.&quot;</p>

<p>Just here Susy was startled by a
sudden laugh from cousin Percy, who
had for some moments been walking
behind the pony unobserved.</p>

<p>&quot;You're enough to frighten any one
to death,&quot; she screamed, &quot;creeping
about like a cat.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy had a foolish dread of being
laughed at.</p>

<p>&quot;Creeping like a cat,&quot; echoed Percy,
&quot;while you creep like a snail! What
will you take for your pony, that can
fly in the air like a bird, but can't
walk on the ground any better than
a goose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what you're talking
about,&quot; said Susy, quite excited: &quot;if
you want to see anybody ride fast, just
look here.&quot; And she started the pony
at full speed, regardless of Prudy, who
was so frightened, that she seized poor
Wings by his flowing mane, and
called out for her sister to stop. But
Susy dashed on at a flying pace, and
Percy cried after her, &quot;O, Susy, cousin
Susy, what think of your Christmas
present? Will you remember not to
eat it, and not to hang it on a nail?
Susy, Susy?&quot;</p>

<p>There was hardly a happier child
living than Susy, during those delightful
holidays. She said to herself,
sometimes, that this was such a
beautiful world, she couldn't think of
a single thing that wasn't as splendid
as it could be.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_V"></a><h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>PRUDY'S TROUBLE.</h3>
<br />

<p>The happy days flew by. The Old
Year was worn out, and the New Year
stepped in fresh and youthful. Susy
found her little sleigh a very comfortable
affair; and so, I think, did &quot;lame
Jessie.&quot; When her father found that
Susy had really chosen for her pony
the name of Wings, he ordered a beautiful
picture of the Flying Horse to
be painted on the dashboard of the
sleigh.</p>

<p>Susy was delighted with this, and
her vivid fancy took wings at once,
and flew away to the other end of the
world, where her aunt Madge told her
the fountain of Pirene was said to
gush out of a hill-side.</p>

<p>&quot;Only think,&quot; said she to Flossy;
&quot;it was a woman once, that fountain
was; but she poured her life all out
into tears, crying because her son was
killed. So the fountain is made of
tears!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bitter and salt, then,&quot; said Florence,
threading her needle.</p>

<p>&quot;No, indeed; just as sweet and nice
as any water. Pegasus loved it; and
there was a beautiful young man, his
name was Bel&mdash;Bel&mdash;well, I declare,
I've forgotten,&mdash;no, 'twas Bellerophon;
and he had a bridle, and wanted a
horse. O, do you know this horse was
white, with silvery wings, wild as a
hawk; and, once in a while, he would
fold up his wings, and trot round on
the mountain!&quot;</p>

<p>Florence yawned, and waxed her
thread.</p>

<p>&quot;O, it was a splendid bridle, this
man had, made of gold; and I forgot&mdash;the
mountain the horse trotted
round on was called Helicon. And
the man mounted him, and went up,
up, till they were nothing but specks
in the sky.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A likely story,&quot; said Florence;
&quot;there, you've told enough! I don't
want to hear any more such nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you don't want to hear
about the monster they killed, you
needn't; that's all I can say; but the
young man loved that horse; and he
kissed him, too, he was so splendid!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kiss a horse!&quot; Flossy looked very,
much disgusted.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I've kissed my pony a great
many times,&quot; said Susy, bravely,
&quot;right between his eyes; and he almost
kisses me. He wants to say, 'I
love you.' I can see it in his eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>By this time Flossy had finished her
doll's garment, and, putting it on the
little thing's shoulders, held up the
doll to be admired.</p>

<p>&quot;I think her opera cloak is very
'bewitching,' don't you, Susy? It is
trimmed with ermine, because she is
a queen, and is going to the opera.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It looks well enough,&quot; said Susy,
indifferently, &quot;but it isn't ermine; it's
only white cat's fur, with black spots
sewed on,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it isn't real ermine!&quot;
replied Florence; &quot;but I play that it
is, and it's just as well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you know all the while it's a
make-believe. She hasn't any more
sense than a stick of wood, either;
and I don't see any sport in playing
with dolls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I don't see any sense in fairy
stories,&quot; retorted Flossy. &quot;Do you
know what Percy says about you?
He says your head is as full of airy
notions as a dandelion top. I love
Queen Mab as if she was my own sister,&quot;
continued Flossy, in a pettish
tone. &quot;You know I do, Susy. I always
thought, if anything should
happen to Queen Mab, and I lost her,
I should certainly dress in mourning;
now you needn't laugh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, I can't help laughing, when
anybody makes such a fuss over a
doll,&quot; replied Susy, with a curl of the
lip. &quot;Anything that isn't alive, and
hasn't any sense, and don't care for
you! I like canary birds, and babies,
and ponies, and that's enough to
like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, now, that's so funny!&quot; said
Florence, twitching the folds of Queen
Mab's dress into place; &quot;for the very
reason I like my doll, is because she
<i>isn't</i> alive. I wouldn't have been you,
Susy Parlin, when you had your last
canary bird, and let him choke to
death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, no, Flossy, I didn't let him
choke: I forgot to put any seed in
the bottle, and he stuck his head
in so deep, that he smothered to
death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know but smothering is as
bad as choking,&quot; said Florence; &quot;and
now your new bird will be sure to
come to some bad end.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're always saying hateful
things,&quot; exclaimed Susy, a good deal
vexed. &quot;I like Grace Clifford ten
times as well, for she's a great deal
more lady-like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I suppose I can go home,&quot;
said Florence, with a rising color;
&quot;you're such a perfect lady that I
can't get along with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear,&quot; thought poor Susy, &quot;what
does ail my tongue? Here this very
morning I said in my prayer, that I
meant to be good and patient.&quot;</p>

<p>Florence began to put on her cloak.</p>

<p>&quot;Cousin Flossy,&quot; said Susy, in a
hesitating voice, &quot;I wish you wouldn't
go. I didn't mean to tell that I liked
Gracie best; but it's the real honest
truth, and if I should take it back,
'twould be a lie.&quot;</p>

<p>This was not making matters much
better. Florence put on her hood,
and tied it with a twitch.</p>

<p>&quot;But I like <i>you</i> ever so much,
Flossy; now, you know I do. You're
hateful sometimes; but so am I; and
I can't tell which is the hatefulest.&quot;</p>

<p>Here Flossy, who was as fickle as
the wind, laughed merrily, took off
her hood and cloak, and danced about
the room in high spirits.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said she, &quot;I'll stay just on
purpose to plague you!&quot;</p>

<p>But good humor had been restored
on both sides, and the little girls were
soon talking together, as freely as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Just come out in the kitchen,&quot;
said Susy, &quot;and you shall see me
wash my bird.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I thought birds washed
themselves,&quot; replied Florence, following
her cousin with some surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;They do, but Dandy won't; it's all
in the world I have against Dandy;
he isn't a cold-water bird.&quot;</p>

<p>Grandma Read stood by the kitchen
table, clear-starching one of her caps&mdash;a
piece of work which she always
performed with her own hands. She
moved one side to make room for
Susy's bird-cage, but said she did not
approve of washing canaries; she
thought it must be a dangerous experiment.</p>

<p>&quot;If he needed a bath, he would take
it himself, Susan. Little birds know
what is best for them by instinct, thee
may depend upon it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But my birdie gay ought to be
clean,&quot; persisted Susy, who was often
very positive. &quot;Mrs. Mason says so&mdash;the
lady that gave him to me. I told
her he wouldn't bathe, and she said
then I must bathe him.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy went to the range, and, dipping
some hot water from the boiler,
cooled it with fresh water, till she
found, by putting in her fingers, that
it was of a proper temperature, according
to her own judgment. Then
she plunged the timid little canary
into the bowl, in spite of his fluttering.
Such a wee young thing as he
was too! He seemed to be afraid of
the water, and struggled against it
with all his small strength.</p>

<p>&quot;O, Dandy, darling,&quot; said Susy, in
a cooing voice, as if she were talking
to a baby; &quot;be a little man, Dandy;
hold up his head, and let Susy wash
it all cleany! O, he's Susie's birdie
gay!&mdash;What makes him roll up his
eyes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take him out quick, Susan,&quot; said
grandma Read; &quot;he will strangle.&quot;</p>

<p>A few seconds more and all would
have been over with birdie gay. He
curled down very languidly on the
floor of the cage, and seemed to wish
to be let alone.</p>

<p>&quot;He acts so every morning when I
bathe him,&quot; said Susy, who would not
give up the point; &quot;but Mrs. Mason
told me to do it! Dotty always cried
when she was washed, till she was
ever so old.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think,&quot; said Mrs. Parlin, who
had just entered the kitchen, &quot;I must
ask Mrs. Mason if she is very sure it
is proper to treat little birds in that
way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But look, mamma; here he is,
shaking out his feathers, all bright
and happy again. O, you cunning
little Dandy, now we'll hang you up
in the sun to dry. See him hop on
one foot; that is just to make me
laugh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But <i>I</i> hop on one foot, too,&quot; said
little Prudy, &quot;and you don't laugh at
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a droll little head for fancies,&quot;
said Mrs. Parlin, patting Prudy's
curls, and looking at grandma Read.
&quot;Do you know, mother, that for
several days she has made believe she
was lame Jessie, and has hobbled
about whenever she could think of
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now you mustn't laugh,&quot; said
Prudy, looking up with a grieved
face; I can't never help hopping; I
<i>have</i> to hop. My knee was so sick, I
cried last night, and I was just as
<i>wide-awakeful</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ain't thee afraid the child has been
hurt in some way, my daughter?&quot;
said grandma Read.</p>

<p>&quot;O, no, mother,&quot; said Mrs. Parlin,
smiling, as Prudy limped out of the
room. &quot;I have examined her knee,
and there is nothing the matter with
it. She is only imitating that lame
child. You know Prudy has all sorts
of whims. Don't you know how she
has wanted us to call her Jessie sometimes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, no, indeed, grandma, she
isn't lame,&quot; said Susy, laughing.
&quot;Sometimes she will run about the
room as well as I do, and then, in a
few minutes, when she thinks of it,
she will limp and take hold of chairs.
Mother, isn't it just the same as a
wrong story for Prudy to act that
way? If I did so, you'd punish me;
now, wouldn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what to think about
it,&quot; said Mrs. Parlin, gravely. &quot;Sometimes
I am afraid Prudy is really
becoming naughty and deceitful. I
thought once it was only her funny
way of playing; but she is getting
old enough now to know the difference
between truth and falsehood.&quot;</p>

<p>There was an anxious look on Mrs.
Parlin's face. She was a faithful
mother, and watched her children's
conduct with the tenderest care.</p>

<p>But this lameness of which little
Prudy complained, was something
more than play; it was a sad truth,
as the family learned very soon. Instead
of walking properly when her
mother bade her do so, the poor child
cried bitterly, said it hurt her, and she
was so tired she wished they would
let her lie on the sofa, and never get
up. At times she seemed better; and
when everybody thought she was quite
well, suddenly the pain and weakness
would come again, and she could only
limp, or walk by catching hold of
chairs</p>

<p>At last her father called in a physician.</p>

<p>&quot;How long has this child been
lame?&quot; said he.</p>

<p>&quot;A month or more.&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor looked grave. &quot;Has she
ever had an injury, Mr. Parlin, such
as slipping on the ice, or falling down
stairs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; replied Mr. Parlin, &quot;I believe
not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a serious injury that I know
of,&quot; said Mrs. Parlin, passing her hand
across her forehead, and trying to remember.
&quot;No, I think Prudy has
never had a <i>bad</i> fall, though she is always
meeting with slight accidents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, mamma,&quot; said Susy, who had
begged to stay in the room, &quot;she did
have a fall: don't you know, Christmas
day, ever so long ago, how she
went rolling down stairs with her little
chair in her arms, and woke everybody
up?&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor caught at Susy's words.</p>

<p>&quot;With her little chair in her arms,
my dear? And did she cry as if she
was hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir; she said the <i>prongs</i> of
the chair stuck into her side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It hurt me dreffully,&quot; said Prudy,
who had until now forgotten all
about it. &quot;Susy spoke so quick, and
said I was a little snail; and then
I rolled over and over, and down I
went.&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor almost smiled at these
words, lisped out in such a plaintive
voice, as if Prudy could not think of
that fall even now, without pitying
herself very much.</p>

<p>&quot;Just let me see you stand up, little
daughter,&quot; said he; for Prudy was
lying on the sofa.</p>

<p>But it hurt her to bear her weight
on her feet.</p>

<p>She said, &quot;One foot, the '<i>lame-knee-foot</i>,'
came down so long, it <i>more</i> than
touched the floor.&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor looked sober. The foot
did drag indeed. The trouble was not
in her knee, but in her hip, which had
really been injured when she fell
down stairs, and the &quot;prongs&quot; of the
chair were forced against it.</p>

<p>It seemed to Mrs. Parlin strange
that Prudy had never complained of
any pain in her side; but the doctor
said it was very common for people to
suffer from hip-disease, and seem to
have only a lame knee.</p>

<p>&quot;Hip-disease!&quot; When Mrs. Parlin
heard these words, she grew so dizzy,
that it was all she could do to keep
from fainting. It came over her in a
moment, the thought of what her little
daughter would have to suffer&mdash;days
and nights of pain, and perhaps
a whole lifetime of lameness. She
had often heard of hip-disease, and
was aware that it is a very serious
thing.</p>

<p>Do you know, she would gladly have
changed places with Prudy, would
gladly have borne all the child must
suffer, if by that means she could
have saved her? This is the feeling
which mothers have when any trouble
comes upon their children; but
the little ones, with their simple minds,
cannot understand it.</p>

<a name="CHAPTER_VI"></a><h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.</h3>
<br />

<p>Prudy had enjoyed a great many
rides in Susy's beautiful sleigh; but
now the doctor forbade her going out,
except for very short distances, and
even then, he said, she must sit in her
mother's lap. He wanted her to lie
down nearly all the time, and keep
very quiet.</p>

<p>At first, Mrs. Parlin wondered how
it would be possible to keep such a
restless child quiet; but she found, as
time passed, and the disease made
progress, that poor little Prudy was
only too glad to lie still. Every motion
seemed to hurt her, and sometimes
she cried if any one even jarred the
sofa suddenly.</p>

<p>These were dark days for everybody
in the house. Susy, who was thoughtful
beyond her years, suffered terribly
from anxiety about her little sister.
More than that, she suffered from
remorse.</p>

<p>&quot;O, grandma Read,&quot; said she one
evening, as she sat looking up at the
solemn, shining stars, with overflowing
eyes&mdash;&quot;O, grandma!&quot; The words
came from the depths of a troubled
heart. &quot;I may live to be real old;
but I never shall be happy again! I
can't, for, if it hadn't been for me?
Prudy would be running round the
house as well as ever!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Read had a gentle, soothing
voice. She could comfort Susy when
anybody could. Now she tried to set
her heart at rest by saying that the
doctor gave a great deal of hope. He
could not promise a certain cure, but he
felt great faith in a new kind of splint
which he was using for Prudy's hip.</p>

<p>&quot;O, grandma, it may be, and then,
again, it may not be,&quot; sobbed poor
Susy; &quot;we can't tell what God will
think best; but anyhow, it was I that
did it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Susan, thee must think how
innocent thee was of any wrong
motive. Thee did not get angry, and
push thy little sister, thee knows thee
didn't, Susan! Thee was only in a
hurry, and rather thoughtless. The
best of us often do very foolish things,
and cause much mischief; but thee'll
find it isn't best to grieve over these
mistakes. Why, my dear little Susan,
I have lived eight years to thy one,
and if I should sit down now and drop
a tear for every blunder I have made,
I don't know but I could almost make
a fountain of myself, like that woman
thee tells about in the fairy story.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The fountain of Pirene that Pegasus
loved,&quot; said Susy; &quot;that was
the name of it. Why, grandma, I
never should have thought of your
saying such a queer thing as that!
Why, it seems as if you always did
just right, and thought it all over before
you did it. Do <i>you</i> ever do wrong?
How funny!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Read smiled sadly. She was
not an angel yet; so I suppose she did
wrong once in a while.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, grandma, I want to ask you
one question, real sober and honest.
You know it was so dark that morning
in the middle of the night, when
we were going down the back stairs?
Now, if I'd made a great deal worse
mistake than calling Prudy a snail,&mdash;if
I'd pushed her real hard, and she
had fallen faster,&mdash;O, I can't bear to
think! I mean, if the chair-prongs
had hit her head, grandma&mdash;and&mdash;killed
her! What would they have
done to <i>me</i>? I thought about it last
night, so I couldn't go to sleep for the
longest while! I heard the clock <i>strike</i>
once while I was awake there in bed!
Would they have put me in the lock-up,
grandma, and then hung me for
murder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear child, no, indeed! How
came such horrible ideas in thy tender
little brain? It is too dreadful to think
about; but, even if thy little sister <i>had</i>
died, Susan, thee would have been no
more to blame than thee is now, and
a great, great deal more to be pitied.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy sat for a long while gazing out
of the window; but the stars did not
wink so solemnly; the moon looked
friendly once more. Susy was drinking
in her grandmother's words of
comfort. The look of sadness was
disappearing from the young face, and
smiles began to play about the corners
of her mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said she, starting up briskly,
&quot;I'm glad I wasn't so very terribly
wicked! I wish I'd been somewhere
else, when I stood on those back-stairs,
in the middle of the night; but what's
the use? I'm not going to think any
more about it, grandma; for if I should
think till my head was all twisted up
in a knot, what good would it do?
It wouldn't help Prudy any; would it,
grandma?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear,&quot; said the mild, soothing
voice again; &quot;don't think, I beg of
thee; but if thee wants to know what
would do Prudence good, I will tell
thee: try thy best to amuse her. She
has to lie day after day and suffer.
It is very hard for a little girl that
loves to play, and can't read, and
doesn't know how to pass the time;
don't thee think so, Susan?&quot;</p>

<p>It was certainly hard. Prudy's
round rosy face began to grow pale;
and, instead of laughing and singing
half the time, she would now lie and
cry from pain, or because she really
did not know what else to do with
herself.</p>

<p>It was worst at night. Hour after
hour, she would lie awake, and listen
to the ticking of the clock. Susy
thought it a pitiable case, when <i>she</i>,
heard the clock strike <i>once</i>; but little
Prudy heard it strike again and again.
How strangely it pounded out the
strokes in the night! What a dreary
sound it was, pealing through the
silence! The echoes answered with
a shudder. Then, when Prudy had
counted one, two, three, four, and the
clock had no more to say at that time,
it began to tick again: &quot;Prudy's sick!
Prudy's sick! O, dear me! O, dear
me!&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy could hardly believe it was
the same clock she saw in the daytime.
She wondered if it felt lonesome
in the night, and had the blues;
or what <i>could</i> ail it! The poor little
girl wanted somebody to speak to in
these long, long hours. She did not
sleep with Susy, but in a new cot-bed
of her own, in aunt Madge's room; for,
dearly as she loved to lie close to any
one she loved, she begged now to sleep
alone, &quot;so nobody could hit her, or
move her, or joggle her.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a great comfort to have aunt
Madge so near. If it had been Susy
instead, Prudy would have had no
company but the sound of her breathing.
It was of no use to try to wake
Susy in the dead of night. Pricking
her with pins would startle her, but
she never knew anything even after
she was startled. All she could do
was to stare about her, cry, and act
very cross, and then&mdash;go to sleep
again.</p>

<p>But with aunt Madge it was quite
different. She slept like a cat, with
one eye open. Perhaps the reason she
did not sleep more soundly, was, that
she felt a care of little Prudy. No
matter when Prudy spoke to her,
aunt Madge always answered. She
did not say, &quot;O, dear, you've startled
me out of a delicious nap!&quot; She said,
&quot;Well, darling, what do you want?&quot;
Prudy generally wanted to know
when it would be morning? When
would the steamboat whistle? What
made it stay dark so long? She
wanted a drink of water, and <i>always</i>
wanted a story.</p>

<p>If aunt Madge had forgotten to provide
a glass of water, she put on her
slippers, lighted the little handled lamp,
and stole softly down stairs to the
pail, which Norah always pumped
full of well-water the last thing in
the evening.</p>

<p>Or, if Prudy fancied it would console
her to have a peep at her beautiful
doll which &quot;would be alive if it could
speak,&quot; why, down stairs went auntie
again to search out the spot where
Susy had probably left it when &quot;she
took it to show to some children.&quot;</p>

<p>The many, many times that kind
young lady crept shivering down stairs
to humor Prudy's whims! Prudy
could not have counted the times; and
you may be sure aunt Madge never
<i>would</i>.</p>

<p>Then the stories, both sensible and
silly, which Prudy teased for, and always
got! Aunt Madge poured them
forth like water into the <i>sieve</i> of
Prudy's mind, which could not hold
stories any better than secrets. No
matter how many she told, Prudy insisted
that she wanted &quot;one more,&quot;
and the &quot;same one over again.&quot;</p>

<p>It touched Susy to the heart to see
how much her little sister suffered,
and she spent a great deal of time at
first in trying to amuse her. Aunt
Madge told stories in the night; but
Susy told them in the daytime, till,
as she expressed it, her &quot;tongue
ached.&quot; She cut out paper dolls when
she wanted to read, and played go
visiting, or dressed rag babies, when
she longed to be out of doors. But
while the novelty lasted, she was quite
a Florence Nightingale.</p>

<p>Her Wednesday and Saturday after-noons
were no longer her own. Before
Prudy's lameness, Susy had used her
new skates a great deal, and could
now skim over the ice quite gracefully,
for a little girl of her age. The
reason she learned to skate so well,
was because she was fearless. Most
children tremble when they try to
stand on the ice, and for that very
reason are nearly sure to fall; but Susy
did not tremble in the face of danger:
she had a strong will of her own, and
never expected to fail in anything she
undertook.</p>

<p>She had spent half of her short life
out of doors, and almost considered it
lost time when she was obliged to stay
in the house for the rain.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin kept saying it was high
time for her eldest daughter to begin
to be womanly, and do long stints
with her needle: she could not sew
as well now as she sewed two years
ago.</p>

<p>But Mr. Parlin laughed at his wife's
anxiety, and said he loved Susy's red
cheeks; he didn't care if she grew as
brown as an Indian. She was never
rude or coarse, he thought; and she
would be womanly enough one of
these days, he was quite sure.</p>

<p>&quot;Anything,&quot; said Mr. Parlin, &quot;but
these <i>womanly</i> little girls, such as I
have seen sitting in a row, sewing
seams, without animation enough to
tear rents in their own dresses! If
Susy loves birds, and flowers, and
snowbanks, I am thankful, and perfectly
willing she should have plenty
of them for playthings.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, when Mrs. Parlin smiled mischievously,
and said, &quot;I should like to
know what sort of a wild Arab you
would make out of a little girl,&quot; Mr.
Parlin answered triumphantly,&mdash;
&quot;Look at my sister Margaret! I
brought her up my own self! I always
took her out in the woods with
me, gunning and trouting. I taught
her how to skate when she was a mere
baby. I often said she was all the
brother I had in the world! She can
remember now how I used to wrap
her in shawls, and prop her up on the
woodpile, while I chopped wood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how you hired her to drop
ears of corn for you into the corn-sheller;
and how, one day, her fingers
were so benumbed, that one of them
was clipped off before she knew it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, so it was, that is true; but
only the tip of it. Active children
will meet with accidents. She was a
regular little fly-away, and would
sooner climb a tree or a ladder any
time, than walk on solid ground. <i>Now</i>
look at her!&quot;</p>

<p>And Mr. Parlin repeated the words,
&quot;Now look at her,&quot; as if he was sure
his wife must confess that she was a
remarkable person.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin said, if Susy should ever
become half as excellent and charming
as Miss Margaret Parlin, she should
be perfectly satisfied, for her part.</p>

<p>Thus Susy was allowed to romp to
her heart's content; &quot;fairly ran wild,&quot;
as aunt Eastman declared, with a
frown of disapproval. She gathered
wild roses, and wore them in her
cheeks, the very best place in the
world for roses. She drank in sunshine
with the fresh air of heaven,
just as the flowers do, and thrived
on it.</p>

<p>But there was one objection to this
out-of-doors life: Susy did not love to
stay in the house. Eainy days and
evenings, to be sure, she made herself
very happy with reading, for she loved
to read, particularly fairy books, and
Rollo's Travels.</p>

<p>But now, just as she had learned to
skate on the basin with other little
girls and young ladies, and could drive
Wings anywhere and everywhere she
pleased, it was a sore trial to give up
these amusements for the sake of
spending more hours with poor little
Prudy. She was very self-denying at
first, but it grew to be an &quot;old story.&quot;
She found it was not only pony and
skates she must give up, but even her
precious reading, for Prudy was jealous
of books, and did not like to have
Susy touch them. She thought Susy
was lost to her when she opened a
book, and might as well not be in the
house, for she never heard a word that
anybody said.</p>

<p>Now I know just what you will
think: &quot;O, I would have given up a
great deal more than ponies and books
for <i>my</i> dear little sister! I would have
told her stories, and never have complained
that my 'tongue ached.' It
would not have wearied me to do anything
and everything for such a patient
sufferer as little Prudy!&quot;</p>

<p>But now I shall be obliged to confess
one thing, which I would have gladly
concealed.</p>

<p>Prudy was not always patient.
Some sweet little children become
almost like the angels when sickness
is laid upon them; but Prudy had
been such a healthy, active child, that
the change to perfect quiet was exceedingly
tiresome. She was young,
too,&mdash;too young to reason about the
uses of suffering. She only knew she
was dreadfully afflicted, and thought
everybody ought to amuse her.</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear me!&quot; said Susy, sometimes,
&quot;I just believe the more anybody
does for Prudy, the more she
expects.&quot;</p>

<p>Now this was really the case. When
Prudy first began to lie upon the sofa,
everybody pitied her, and tried to say
and do funny things, in order to take
up her attention. It was not possible
to keep on giving so much time to
her; but Prudy expected it. She
would lie very pleasant and happy for
hours at a time, counting the things
in the room, talking to herself, or
humming little tunes; and then,
again, everything would go wrong.
Her playthings would keep falling to
the floor, and, as she could not stoop
at all, some one must come and pick
them up that very minute, or they
&quot;didn't pity her a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Every once in a while, she declared
her knee was &quot;broken in seven new
places,&quot; and the doctor must come and
take off the splint. She didn't want
such a hard thing &quot;right on there;&quot;
she wanted it &quot;right off.&quot;</p>

<p>Her mother told her she must try
to be patient, and be one of God's little
girls. &quot;But, mamma,&quot; said Prudy,
&quot;does God love me any? I should
think, if he loved me, he'd be sorrier
I was sick, and get me well.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, sometimes, when she had
been more fretful than usual, she
would close her eyes, and her mother
would hear her say, in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;O, God, I didn't mean to. It's my
<i>knee</i> that's cross!&quot;</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I think Prudy was
as patient as most children of her age
would have been under the same trial.
Her father and mother, who had the
most care of her, did not wonder in the
least that her poor little nerves got
tired out sometimes.</p>

<p>While Susy was at school, Prudy
had a long time to think what she
wanted her to do when she should
come home. She would lie and watch
the clock, for she had learned to tell
the time quite well; and when the
hour drew near for Susy to come, she
moved her head on the pillow, and
twisted her fingers together nervously.</p>

<p>If Susy was in good season, Prudy
put up her little mouth for a kiss, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;O, how I do love you, Susy! Ain't
I your dear little sister? Well, won't
you make me a lady on the slate?&quot;</p>

<p>Susy's ladies had no necks, and
their heads were driven down on their
shoulders, as if they were going to be
packed into their chests; but, such as
they were, Prudy wanted them over
and over again.</p>

<p>But if Susy stopped to slide, or to
play by the way, she would find little
Prudy in tears, and hear her say, &quot;O,
what made you? Naughty, naughty
old Susy! I'm goin' to die, and go to
God's house, and then you'll be sorry
you didn't 'tend to your little sister.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy could never bear to hear Prudy
talk about going to God's house. Her
conscience pricked her when she saw
that the poor child was grieved; and
she resolved, every time she was late,
that she would never be late again.</p>

<p>Prudy had a great many odd fancies
now: among others, she had a
fancy that she did not like the name
of Prudy.</p>

<p>&quot;Why; only think,&quot; said she, &quot;you
keep a-calling me Prudy, and Prudy,
and Prudy. It makes my head ache,
to have you say Prudy so much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, my dear child,&quot; said Mr.
Parlin, smiling, &quot;it happens, unfortunately,
that Prudy is your name;
so I think you will have to try and
bear it as well as you can.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I can't bear it any longer,&quot;
said the child, bursting into tears.
&quot;Prudy is all lame and sick, and I
never shall walk any more while you
call me Prudy, papa.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin kissed his little daughters's
pale cheek, and said, &quot;Then we
will call you pet names; will that
do?&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy smiled with delight.</p>

<p>&quot;I've thought of a real beautiful,
splendid name,&quot; said she. &quot;It is
Rosy Frances Eastman Mary; ain't it
splendid?&quot;</p>

<p>After this announcement, Prudy
expected the family would be sure to
call her Rosy Frances Eastman Mary;
and, indeed, they were quite willing
to please her, whenever they could
remember the name. They all supposed
it was a fancy she would forget
in a day or two; but, instead of that,
she clung to it more and more fondly.
If any one offered her an orange, or
roasted apple, and said, &quot;Look, Prudy;
here is something nice for you,&quot; she
would turn her face over to one side
on the pillow, and make no reply. If
she wanted a thing very much, she
would never accept it when she was
addressed by the obnoxious name of
Prudy. Even when her father wanted
to take her in his arms to rest her,
and happened to say, &quot;Prudy, shall I
hold you a little while?&quot; she would
say, &quot;Who was you a-talkin' to, papa?
There isn't any Prudy here!&quot; Then
her father had to humble himself,
and ask to be forgiven for being so
forgetful.</p>

<p>The child had a delicate appetite,
and her mother tried to tempt it with
little niceties; but, no matter what
pains she took, Prudy relished nothing
unless it was given to her as Rosy
Frances, the little girl who was <i>not</i>
Prudy.</p>

<p>&quot;O, here is a glass of lemonade for
you, Prudy; made on purpose for
you,&quot; Susy would say; &quot;do drink it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear me, suz,&quot; cried Prudy, with
tears falling over her cheeks; &quot;O,
Susy, you plague me, and I never
done a thing to you! You called me
Prudy, and I ain't Prudy, never again!
Call me Rosy Frances Eastman Mary,
and I'll drink the lemonade.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You precious little sister,&quot; said
Susy, bending over her gently, &quot;you'll
forgive me; won't you, darling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll try to,&quot; replied Prudy, with a
look of meek forbearance, as she sipped
the lemonade.</p>

<h3>LITTLE TROUBLES.</h3>
<br />

<p>Somebody said once to Susy and
Flossy, when they were having a frolic
in &quot;Prudy's sitting-room,&quot; up stairs,
&quot;What happy little things! You
don't know what trouble is, and never
will, till you grow up!&quot;</p>

<p>The little girls preserved a respectful
silence, till the lady was out of
hearing, and then held an indignant
discussion as to the truth of what she
had said. It would have been a discussion,
I mean, if they had not both
taken the same side of the question.</p>

<p>&quot;How she sighed,&quot; said Susy, &quot;just
as if she was the <i>melancholiest</i> person
that ever was!&quot; Susy was famous
for the use she made of adjectives,
forming the superlatives just as it
happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, just the way,&quot; responded
Flossy. &quot;I'd like to know what ever
happened to <i>her</i>? Pshaw! She
laughed this afternoon, and ate apples
fast enough!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, she thinks she must make believe
have a dreadful time, because
she is grown up,&quot; said Susy, scornfully.
&quot;She's forgot she was ever a
little girl! I've had troubles; I guess
I have! And I know one thing, I
shall remember 'em when I grow up,
and not say, 'What happy little
things!' to children. It's real hateful!&quot;</p>

<p>Little folks have trouble, to be sure.
Their hearts are full of it, and running
over, sometimes; and how can the
largest heart that ever beat be <i>more</i>
than full, and running over?</p>

<p>Susy had daily trials. They were
sent to her because they were good
for her. Shadows and night-dews are
good for flowers. If the sun had
shone on Susy always, and she had
never had any shadows and night
dews, she would have <i>scorched up</i> into
a selfish girl.</p>

<p>One of her trials was Miss Dotty
Dimple. Now, she loved Dotty dearly,
and considered her funny all over,
from the crown of her head to the
soles of her little twinkling feet, which
were squeezed into a pair of gaiters.
Dotty loved those gaiters as if they
were alive. She had a great contempt
for the slippers she wore in the morning,
but it was her &quot;darlin' gaiters,&quot;
which she put on in the afternoon,
and loved next to father and mother,
and all her best friends.</p>

<p>When ladies called, she stepped very
briskly across the floor, looking down
at her feet, and tiptoeing about, till
the ladies smiled, and said, &quot;O, what
sweet little boots!&quot; and then she was
perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Susy was not very wide awake in
the morning; but Dotty was stirring
as soon as there was a peep of light,
and usually stole into Susy's bed to
have a frolic. Nothing but a story
would keep her still, and poor Susy
often wondered which was harder, to
be used as a football by Dotty, or to
tell stories with her eyes shut.</p>

<p>&quot;O, Dotty Dimple, keep still; can't
you? There's a darling,&quot; she would
plead, longing for another nap; &quot;<i>don't</i>
kill me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no; me won't kill,&quot; the little
one would reply; &quot;'tisn't <i>pooty</i> to
kill!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear, you little, cunning, darling
plague, now hush, and let me go
to sleep!&quot;</p>

<p>Then Dotty would plant both feet
firmly on Susy's chest, and say, in her
teasing little voice, as troublesome as
the hum of a mosquito,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you tell me 'tory&mdash;tell me a
'tory&mdash;tell me a 'tory, Susy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what do you want to hear?&quot;</p>

<p>Now, it was natural for Susy to feel
cross when she was sleepy. It cost
her a hard struggle to speak pleasantly,
and when she succeeded in doing
so, I set it down as one of her greatest
victories over herself. The Quaker
motto of her grandmother, &quot;Let patience
have her perfect work,&quot; helped
her sometimes, when she could wake
up enough to remember it.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell 'bout little yellow gell,&quot; said
the voice of the mosquito, over and
over again.</p>

<p>Susy roused herself after the third
request, and sleepily asked if something
else wouldn't do?</p>

<p>&quot;I had a little nobby-colt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, you <i>di'n't</i>, you <i>di'n't</i>;
grandma had the nobby! Tell yellow
gell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O,&quot; sighed Susy, &quot;how can you
want to hear that so many, many
times? Well, once when I was a
little bit of a girl&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Bout's big as me, you <i>said</i>,&quot; put in
Dotty.</p>

<p>&quot;O, yes, I did say so once, and I
suppose I must tell it so every time, or
you'll fuss! Well, I had a yellow
dress all striped off in checks&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Di'n't it go this way?&quot; said Dotty,
smoothing the sheet with her little
hand, &quot;and this way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? What?&quot; Susy roused herself
and rubbed her eyes. &quot;O, yes, it
went in checks; and I was at grandma
Parlin's, and Grace&mdash;Grace&mdash;O,
Grace and I went into the pasture
where there were a couple of cows, a
gray cow and a red cow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now you must say what <i>is</i> couple,&quot;
says Dotty.</p>

<p>&quot;Then what is couple?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gray cow,&quot; answers Dotty, very
gravely.</p>

<p>&quot;So when the cows saw us coming,
they&mdash;they&mdash;O, they threw up their
heads, and stopped eating grass&mdash;in
the air. I mean&mdash;threw&mdash;up&mdash;their
heads.&quot; Susy was nearly asleep.</p>

<p>&quot;Up in the air?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, of course, up in the air.
(There, I <i>will</i> wake up!) And the
gray cow began to run towards us,
and Grace says to me, 'O, my, she
thinks you're a pumpkin!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, me, because my dress was so
yellow. I was just as afraid of the
cow as I could be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good cow! <i>He</i> wouldn't hurt!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, the cow was good, and didn't
think I was a pumpkin, not the least
speck. But I was so afraid, that
I crept under the bars, and ran
home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To grandma's house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; and grandma laughed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, where was me?&quot; was the
next question, after a pause.</p>

<p>Then, when the duty of story-telling
was performed, Susy would gladly
have gone back to &quot;climbing the
dream-tree;&quot; but no, she must still
listen to Dotty, though she answered
her questions in an absent-minded
way, like a person &quot;hunting for a forgotten
dream.&quot;</p>

<p>One morning she was going to ride
with her cousin Percy. It had been
some time since she had seen Wings,
except in the stable, where she visited
him every day.</p>

<p>But Dotty had set her heart on a
rag-baby which Susy had promised to
dress, and Prudy was anxious that
Susy should play several games of
checkers with her.</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear,&quot; said the eldest sister, with
the perplexed air of a mother who has
disobedient little ones to manage.
&quot;I think I have about as much as I
can bear. The <i>children</i> always make
a fuss, just as sure as I want to go
out.&quot;</p>

<p>The old, impatient spirit was rising;
that spirit which it was one of the
duties of Susy's life to keep under
control.</p>

<p>She went into the bathing-room, and
drank off a glass of cold water, and
talked to herself a while, for she considered
that the safest way.</p>

<p>&quot;Have I any right to be cross? Yes,
I think I have. Here Dotty woke me
up, right in the middle of a dream, and
I'm sleepy this minute. Then Prudy
is a little babyish thing, and always
was&mdash;making a fuss if I forget to
call her Rosy Frances! Yes, I'll be
cross, and act just as I want to. It's
too hard work to keep pleasant; I
won't try.&quot;</p>

<p>She walked along to the door, but,
by that time, the better spirit was
struggling to be heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Susy Parlin,&quot; it said, &quot;you
little girl with a pony, and a pair of
skates, and feet to walk on, and everything
you want, ain't you ashamed,
when you think of that dear little
sister you pushed down stairs&mdash;no,
didn't push&mdash;that poor little lame
sister!&mdash;O, hark! there is your mother
winding up that hard splint! How
would you feel with such a thing on
your hip? Go, this minute, and comfort
Prudy!&quot;</p>

<p>The impatient feelings were gone
for that time; Susy had swallowed
them, or they had flown out of the
window.</p>

<p>&quot;Now Rosy Frances Eastman
Mary,&quot; said she, &quot;if your splint is all
fixed, I'll comb your hair.&quot;</p>

<p>The splint was made of hard,
polished wood and brass. Under it
were strips of plaster an inch wide,
which wound round and round the
poor wounded limb. These strips of
plaster became loose, and there was
a little key-hole in the splint, into
which Mrs. Parlin put a key, and
wound up and tightened the plaster
every morning. This operation did
not hurt Prudy at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Susy, after she had
combed Prudy's hair carefully, and
put a net over it, until her mother
should be ready to curl it, &quot;now we
will have a game of checkers.&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy played in high glee, for Susy
allowed her to jump all her men, and
march triumphantly into the king-row,
at the head of a victorious
army.</p>

<p>&quot;There, now, Rosy,&quot; said Susy, gently,
&quot;are you willing to let me go out
riding? I can't play any more if I
ride, for I must dress Dotty's doll, and
feed my canary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, well,&quot; said Prudy, considering
the matter, &quot;I'm sick; I tell you how
it is, I'm sick, you know; but&mdash;well,
you may go, Susy, if you'll make up a
story as long as a mile.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy really felt grateful to Prudy,
but it was her own gentle manner
which had charmed the sick child into
giving her consent.</p>

<p>Then Susy proceeded to dress Dotty's
doll in a very simple fashion, with two
holes for short sleeves, and a skirt
with a raw edge; but she looked kind
and pleasant while she was at work,
and Dotty was just as well pleased as
if it had been an elegant costume she
was preparing. And it was really
good enough for a poor deformed rag-baby,
with a head shaped like a stove-pipe.</p>

<p>Susy was delighted to find how well
a little patience served her in amusing
&quot;the children.&quot; Next, she went to
give Dandy his morning bath. Mrs.
Parlin still thought it a dangerous
practice, but had not seen Mrs. Mason,
to question her about it, and Susy was
too obstinate in her opinion to listen
to her mother.</p>

<p>&quot;I must do it,&quot; said Susy; &quot;it has
been ever so long since Dandy was
bathed, and I shouldn't take any comfort
riding, mamma, if I didn't leave
him clean.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy plunged the trembling canary
into his little bathing-bowl, in some
haste. He struggled as usual, and
begged, with his weak, piping voice,
to be spared such an infliction. But
Susy was resolute.</p>

<p>&quot;It'll do you good, Ducky Daddles;
we mustn't have any lazy, dirty birdies
in this house.&quot;</p>

<p>Ducky Daddies rolled up his little
eyes, and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>&quot;O, look, mother!&quot; cried Susy,
laughing; &quot;how funny Dandy acts!
Do you suppose it's to make me laugh?
O, is he fainting away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fainting away! My dear child,
he is dying!&quot;</p>

<p>This was the sad truth. Mrs. Parlin
fanned him, hoping to call back
the lingering breath. But it was too
late. One or two more throbs, and his
frightened little heart had ceased to
beat; his frail life had gone out as
suddenly as a spark of fire.</p>

<p>Susy was too much shocked to speak.
She stood holding the stiffening bird
in her hands, and gazing at it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin was very sorry for Susy,
and had too much kindness of feeling
to add to her distress by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You know how I warned you,
Susy.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy was already suffering for her
obstinacy and disregard of her mother's
advice; and Mrs. Parlin believed
she would lay the lesson to heart quite
as well without more words. It was
a bitter lesson. Susy loved dumb
creatures dearly, and was just becoming
very fond of Dandy.</p>

<p>In the midst of her trouble, and
while her eyes were swollen with tears,
her cousin Percy came with Wings
and the sleigh to give her the promised
ride. Susy no longer cared for going
out: it seemed to her that her heart
was almost broken.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, cousin Indigo, what is the
matter?&quot; said Percy; &quot;you look as if
this world was a howling wilderness,
and you wanted to howl too. What,
crying over that bird? Poh! I can
buy you a screech-owl any time, that
will make twice the noise he could in
his best days. Come, hurry, and put
your things on!&quot;</p>

<p>Susy buried her face in her apron.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll compose a dirge for him,&quot; said
Percy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;My bird is dead, said Susy P.,<br /></span>
<span>My bird is dead; O, deary me!<br /></span>
<span>He sang so sweet, te whee, te whee;<br /></span>
<span>He sings no more; O, deary me!<br /></span>
<span>Go hang his cage up in the tree,<br /></span>
<span>That cage I care no more to see.<br /></span>
<span>My bird is dead, cried Susy P.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These provoking words Percy
drawled out in a sing-song voice. It
was too much. Susy's eyes flashed
through her tears.</p>

<p>&quot;You've always laughed at me,
Percy Eastman, and plagued me about
Freddy Jackson, and everything, and
I've borne it like a&mdash;like a lady. But
when you go to laughing at my poor
little Dandy that's dead, and can't
speak&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Susy was about to say, &quot;Can't speak
for himself,&quot; but saw in time how
absurdly she was talking, and stopped
short.</p>

<p>Percy laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going with that
cage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Going to put it away, where I'll
never see it again,&quot; sobbed poor
Susy.</p>

<p>&quot;Give it to me,&quot; said Percy: &quot;I'll
take care of it for you.&quot;</p>

<p>If Susy's eyes had not been blinded
by tears, she would have been surprised
to see the real pity in Percy's
face.</p>

<p>He was a rollicking boy, full of
merriment and bluster, and what
tender feelings he possessed, he took
such a wonderful amount of pains to
conceal, that Susy never suspected he
had any. She would have enjoyed
her ride if she had not felt so full of
grief. The day was beautiful. There
had been a storm, and the trees looked
as if they had been snowballing one
another; but Susy had no eye for
trees, and just then hardly cared for
her pony.</p>

<p>Percy put the cage in the sleigh,
under the buffalo robes; and when
they reached his own door, he carried
the cage into the house, while Susy
drew a sigh of relief. He offered to
stuff Dandy, or have him stuffed; but
Susy rejected the idea with horror.</p>

<p>&quot;No, if Dandy was dead, he was all
dead; she didn't want to see him
sitting up stiff and cold, when he
couldn't sing a speck.&quot;</p>

<h3>ANNIE LOVEJOY.</h3>
<br />

<p>But the day was not over yet. The
bright sun and blue sky were doing
what they could to make a cheerful
time of it, but it seemed as if Susy
fell more deeply into trouble, as the
hours passed on.</p>

<p>There are such days in everybody's
life, when it rains small vexations
from morning till night, and when all
we can do is to hope for better things
to-morrow.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday; and in the
afternoon, Flossy Eastman came over
with a new game, and while the little
girls, Flossy, Susy and Prudy were
playing it, and trying their best to
keep Dotty Dimple's prying fingers
and long curls out of the way, in came
Miss Annie Lovejoy.</p>

<p>This was a little neighbor, who, as
the children sometimes privately declared,
was &quot;always 'round.&quot; Mrs.
Parlin had her own private doubts
about the advantages to be derived
from her friendship, and had sometimes
gone so far as to send her home,
when she seemed more than usually
in the way.</p>

<p>Annie's mother lived next door, but
all Mrs. Parlin knew of her, was what
she could see and hear from her own
windows; and that little was not very
agreeable. She saw that Mrs. Love
joy dressed in gaudy colors, and loaded
herself with jewelry; and she could
hear her scold her servants and children
with a loud, shrill voice.</p>

<p>The two ladies had never exchanged
calls; but Annie, it seemed, had few
playmates, and she clung to Susy
with such a show of affection, that
Mrs. Parlin could not forbid her visits,
although she watched her closely;
anxious, as a careful mother should
be, to make sure she was a proper
companion for her little daughter.
So far she had never known her to
say or do anything morally wrong,
though her manners were not exactly
those of a well-bred little girl.</p>

<p>This afternoon, when the new game
was broken up by the entrance of
Annie, the children began the play of
housekeeping, because Prudy could
join in it. Susy found she enjoyed
any amusement much more when it
pleased the little invalid.</p>

<p>&quot;I will be the lady of the house,&quot;
said Annie, promptly, &quot;because I have
rings on my fingers, and a coral necklace.
My name is Mrs. Piper. Prudy,&mdash;no,
Rosy,&mdash;you shall be Mrs. Shotwell,
come a-visiting me; because you
can't do anything else. We'll make
believe you've lost your husband in
the wars. I know a Mrs. Shotwell,
and she is always <i>taking-on</i>, and saying,
'My poor dear husband,' under
her handkerchief; just this way.&quot;</p>

<p>The children laughed at the nasal
twang which Annie gave to the words,
and Prudy imitated it to perfection,
not knowing it was wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what shall I be?&quot; said Susy,
not very well pleased that the first
characters had been taken already.</p>

<p>&quot;O, you shall be a hired girl, and
wear a handkerchief on your head,
just as our girl does; and you must
be a little deaf, and keep saying,
'What, ma'am?' when I speak to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I,&quot; said Florence, &quot;will be Mr.
Peter Piper, the head of the family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Annie, &quot;you can
put on a waterproof cloak, and you
will make quite a good-looking husband;
but I shall be the head of the
family myself, and have things about
as I please!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there,&quot; cried Flossy, slipping
her arms into the sleeves of her cloak,
&quot;I don't know about that; I don't
think it's very polite for you to treat
your husband in that way.&quot;</p>

<p>Flossy wanted to have the control
of family matters herself.</p>

<p>&quot;But I believe in 'Woman's Rights,'&quot;
said Annie, with a toss of the head,
&quot;and if there's anything I despise, it
is a <i>man</i> meddling about the house.&quot;</p>

<p>Here little Dotty began to cause a
disturbance, by sticking a fruit-knife
into the edges of the &quot;what-not,&quot; and
making a whirring noise.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't do so, Dotty,&quot; said Susy,
going up to her; &quot;it troubles us; and,
besides, I'm afraid it will break the
knife.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't allow my hired girl to interfere
with my children,&quot; said Annie,
speaking up in the character of Mrs.
Piper; &quot;I am mistress of the house,
I'd have you to know! There, little
daughter, they shan't plague her; she
shall keep on doing mischief; so she
shall!&quot;</p>

<p>Dotty needed no coaxing to keep on
doing mischief, but hit the musical
knife harder than ever, giving it a
dizzy motion, like the clapper in a
mill.</p>

<p>Prudy was quite annoyed by the
sound, but did not really know whether
to be nervous or not, and concluded to
express her vexation in groans: the
groans she was giving in memory of
the departed Mr. Shotwell, who had
died of a &quot;cannon bullet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My good Mrs. Shotwell,&quot; said Mrs.
Piper, trying to &quot;make conversation,&quot;
&quot;I think I have got something in my
eye: will you please tell me how it
looks?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O,&quot; said Prudy, peeping into it,
&quot;your eye looks very well, ma'am;
don't you '<i>xcuse</i> it; it looks well enough
for <i>me</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahem!&quot; said Mrs. Piper, laughing,
and settling her head-dress, which
was Susy's red scarf: &quot;are your feet
warm, Mrs. Shotwell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, ma'am,&quot; replied Prudy,
&quot;I don't feel 'em cold. O, dear, if your
husband was all deaded up, I guess
you'd cry, Mrs. Piper.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy and Flossy looked at each other,
and smiled. They thought Prudy
seemed more like herself than they
had known her for a long time.</p>

<p>&quot;You must go right out of the parlor,
Betsey,&quot; said Mrs. Piper, flourishing
the poker; &quot;I mean you, Susy&mdash;the
parlor isn't any place for hired girls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ma'am?&quot; said Susy, inclining her
head to one side, in order to hear better.</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear! the plague of having a
deaf girl!&quot; moaned Mrs. Piper. &quot;You
don't know how trying it is, Mrs. Shotwell!
That hired girl, Betsey, hears
with her elbows, Mrs. Shotwell; I verily
believe she does!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, no, ma'am,&quot; replied Prudy; &quot;I
guess she doesn't hear with her elbows,
does she? If she <i>heard</i> with her elbows,
she wouldn't have to ask you
over again!&quot;</p>

<p>This queer little speech set Mr. Piper
and his wife, and their servant, all to
laughing, and Betsey looked at her
elbows, to see if they were in the right
place.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you please, ma'am,&quot; said
Prudy, &quot;ask Betsey to <i>hot</i> a flatiron?
I've cried my handkerchief all up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; go right out, Betsey, and <i>hot</i>
a flatiron,&quot; said Mrs. Piper, very hospitably.
&quot;Go out, this instant, and
build a fire, Betsey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, go right out, Betsey,&quot; echoed
Mr. Piper, who could find nothing better
to do than to repeat his wife's
words; for, in spite of himself, she did
appear to be the &quot;head of the family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was my darlin' husband's handkerchief,&quot;
sobbed Prudy.</p>

<p>&quot;Rather a small one for a man,&quot;
said Mr. Piper, laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied Prudy, rather quick
for a thought, &quot;my husband had a
very small nose!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Piper tried to make more
&quot;conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, Mrs. Shotwell, you ought to be
exceeding thankful you're a widow,
and don't keep house! I think my
hired girls will carry down my gray
hairs to the grave! The last one I had
was Irish, and very Catholic.&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy groaned for sympathy, and
wiped her eyes on that corner of her
handkerchief which was supposed to
be not quite &quot;cried up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed, it was awful,&quot; continued
Mrs. Piper; &quot;for she wasalways going to masses and mass-meetings;
and there couldn't anybody
die but they must be 'waked,' you
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I didn't know they could be
waked up when they was dead,&quot; said
Prudy, opening her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;O, but they only <i>make believe</i> you
can wake 'em,&quot; said Mrs. Piper; &quot;of
course it isn't true! For my part, I
don't believe a word an Irish girl says,
any way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush, my child,&quot; she continued,
turning to Dotty, who was now
sharpening the silver knife on the
edges of the iron grate. &quot;Betsey, why
in the world don't you see to that
baby? I believe you are losing your
mind!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That makes me think,&quot; said Prudy,
suddenly breaking in with a new idea;
&quot;what do you s'pose the reason is
folks can't be waked up? What makes
'em stay in heaven all the days, and
nights, and years, and never come
down here to see anybody, not a
minute?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What an idea!&quot; said Annie. &quot;I'm
sure I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I've been a thinkin',&quot; said
Prudy, answering her own question,
&quot;that when God has sended 'em up to
the sky, they like to stay up there the
best. It's a nicer place, a great deal
nicer place, up to God's house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, yes, of course,&quot; replied Annie,
&quot;but our play&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been a thinkin',&quot; continued
Prudy, &quot;that when I go up to God's
house, I shan't wear the splint. I can
run all over the house, and he'll be
willing I should go up stairs, and down
cellar, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy sighed. Sometimes she
almost longed for &quot;God's house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let's go on with our play,&quot;
said Annie, impatiently. &quot;It's most
supper-time, Mrs. Shotwell. Come in,
Betsey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ma'am?&quot; said Betsey, appearing at
the door, and turning up one ear, very
much as if it were a dipper, in which
she expected to catch the words which
dropped from the lips of her mistress.
&quot;Betsey, have you attended to your
sister&mdash;to my little child, I mean?
Then go out and make some sassafras
cakes, and some eel-pie, and some
squirrel-soup; and set the table in five
minutes: do you hear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ma'am?&quot; said the deaf servant;
'what did you say about ginger-bread?&quot;</p>

<p>Susy did not like her part of the
game; but she played it as well as she
could, and let Annie manage everything,
because that was what pleased
Annie.</p>

<p>&quot;O, how stupid Betsey is!&quot; said Mr.
Piper, coming to the aid of his wife.
&quot;Mrs. Piper says eel-jumbles, and sassafras-pie,
and pound-cake; all made
in five minutes!&quot;</p>

<p>Here everybody laughed, and Prudy,
suddenly remembering her part,
sighed, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;O, my darlin' husband used to like
jumble-pie! I've forgot to cry for
ever so long!&quot;</p>

<p>Susy began to set the table, and
went into the nursery for some cake
and cookies, which were kept in an
old tin chest, on purpose for this play
of housekeeping, which had now been
carried on regularly every Wednesday
and Saturday afternoon, for some time.</p>

<p>Susy opened the cake-chest, and
found nothing in it but a few dry
cookies: the fruit-cake was all gone.
Who could have eaten it? Not Flossy,
for she had a singular dislike for raisins
and currants, and never so much
as tasted fruit-cake. Not Prudy, for
the poor little thing had grown so lame
by this time, that she was unable to
bear her weight on her feet, much less
to walk into the nursery. Dotty could
not be the thief. Her baby-conscience
was rather tough and elastic, and I
suppose she would have felt no more
scruples about nibbling nice things,
than an unprincipled little mouse.</p>

<p>But, then Dotty couldn't reach the
cake-chest; so she was certainly innocent.</p>

<p>Then Susy remembered in a moment
that it was Annie: Annie had run
into the house morning and night,
and had often said, &quot;I'm right hungry.
I'm going to steal a piece of our cake!&quot;</p>

<p>So it seemed that Annie had eaten
it <i>all</i>. Susy ran back to Prudy's sitting-room,
where her little guests were
seated, and said, trying not to laugh,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Please, ma'am, I just made some
eel-jumbles and things, and a dog
came in and stole them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, Betsey,&quot; said Mrs. Piper,
serenely; &quot;make some more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, make some more,&quot; echoed Mr.
Piper; and added, &quot;chain up that
dog.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But real honest true,&quot; said Susy,
&quot;the fruit-cake <i>is</i> all gone out of the
chest. You ate it up, you know,
Annie; but it's no matter: we'll cut
up some cookies, or, may be, mother'll
let us have some oyster-crackers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I</i> ate up the cake!&quot; cried Annie;
&quot;It's no such a thing; I never touched
it!&quot; Her face flushed as she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;O, but you did,&quot; persisted Susy;
&quot;I suppose you've forgotten! You
went to the cake-chest this morning,
and last night, and yesterday noon,
and ever so many more times.&quot;</p>

<p>Annie was too angry to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;But it's just as well,&quot; added Susy,
politely; &quot;you could have it as well
as not, and perfectly welcome!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; cried
Annie, indignantly; for she thought
she saw a look of surprise and contempt
on Flossy's face, and fancied
that Flossy despised her because she
had a weakness for fruit-cake.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if you take me for a pig,
Susy Parlin! I heard what your
mother said about that cake! She
said it was too dry for her company,
but it was too rich for little girls, and
we must only eat a <i>teeny</i> speck at a
time. I told my mamma, and she
laughed, to think such mean dried-up
cake was too rich for little girls!&quot;</p>

<p>Susy felt her temper rising, but her
desire to be polite did not desert her.</p>

<p>&quot;It <i>was</i> rich, nice cake, Annie; but
mother said the slices had been cut
a great while, and it was drying up.
Let's not talk any more about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, but I <i>shall</i> talk more about it,&quot;
cried Annie, still more irritated; &quot;you
keep hinting that I tell wrong stories
and steal cake; yes, you do! and then
you ain't willing to let me speak!&quot;</p>

<p>All this sounded like righteous indignation,
but was only anger. Annie
was entirely in the wrong, and knew
it; therefore she lost her temper.</p>

<p>Susy had an unusual amount of
self-control at this time, merely because
she had the truth on her side.
But her dignified composure only
vexed Annie the more.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't stay here to be imposed
upon, and told that I'm a liar and a
thief; so I won't! I'll go right home
this very minute, and tell my mother
just how you treat your company!&quot;</p>

<p>And, in spite of all Susy could say,
Annie threw on her hood and cloak,
and flounced out of the room; forgetting,
in her wrath, to take off
Susy's red scarf, which was still festooned
about her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm glad she's gone,&quot; said
Flossy, coolly, as the door closed with
a slam. &quot;She's a bold thing, and my
mother wouldn't like me to play with
her, if she knew how she acts! She
said 'victuals' for food, and that isn't
<i>elegant</i>, mother says. What right had
she to set up and say she'd be Mrs.
Piper? So forward!&quot;</p>

<p>After all, this was the grievous part
of the whole to Flossy,&mdash;that she had
to take an inferior part in the play.</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm <i>sorry</i> she's gone,&quot; said
Susy, uneasily. &quot;I don't like to have
her go and tell that I wasn't polite.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You <i>was</i> polite,&quot; chimed in little
Prudy, from the sofa; &quot;a great deal
politer'n she was! I wouldn't care, if
I would be you, Susy. I don't wish
Annie was dead, but I wish she was a
duck a-sailin' on the water!&quot;</p>

<p>The children went back to the game
they had been playing before Annie
came; but the interest was quite gone.
Their quick-tempered little guest had
been a &quot;<i>kill-joy</i>&quot; in spite of her name.</p>

<p>But the afternoon was not over yet.
What happened next, I will tell you in
another chapter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="CHAPTER_IX"></a><h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>MORAL COURAGE.</h3>
<br />

<p>Annie Lovejoy had not been gone
fifteen minutes, when there was a
sharp ringing of Mrs. Parlin's doorbell,
and a little boy gave Norah the
red scarf of Susy's, and a note for Mrs.
Parlin.</p>

<p>Norah suspected they both came
from Mrs. Lovejoy, and she could see
that lady from the opposite window,
looking toward the house with a very
defiant expression.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin opened the note with
some surprise, for she had been engaged
with visitors in the parlor, and
did not know what had been going on
up stairs.</p>

<p>Whatever Mrs. Lovejoy's other
accomplishments might be, she could
not write very elegantly. The ink
was hardly dry, and the words were
badly blotted, as well as incorrectly
spelled.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Mrs. Parlin.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&quot;Madam: If my own <i>doughter</i> is a
<i>theif</i> and a <i>lier</i>, I beg to be informed.
She has no <i>knowlidg</i> of the cake,
<i>whitch</i> was so <i>dryed</i> up, a <i>begar woold</i>
not touch it. Will Miss Susan Parlin
come over here, and take back her
words?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&quot;SERENA LOVEJOY.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Parlin was at a loss to understand
this, for she had quite forgotten
the fact, that the children had any
cake to use at their play of housekeeping.
She supposed that Susy must
have accused Annie of prying into the
china-closet, where the cakes and
jellies were kept. She sent for Susy
at once.</p>

<p>&quot;My daughter,&quot; said she, in her
usual quiet tones, &quot;did you ever have
any reason to suppose that Annie
Lovejoy went about meddling with
our things, and peeping into the
closets?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, no, mother,&quot; replied Susy,
much surprised; &quot;she never saw the
closets, that I know of. Why, mother,
what do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never ate cake, did she, without
leave?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, now I know what you mean,
mother! Yes'm, she ate some of that
fruit-cake you gave us to play with;
and when I told her of it, she got
angry, and said she was going right
home, and would tell her mother how
I treated my company; but I don't
see how you found that out!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind yet how I found it
out, my dear. I want to know if you
are sure that Annie ate the cake?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, mother: just as certain sure
as I can be! You know Dotty can't
reach that high shelf in the nursery-closet,
and I can't, without getting
into a chair; and Prudy can't walk
a step; and Flossy despises cake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; said Mrs. Parlin, smiling, &quot;I
don't see that you have proved Annie
to be the guilty one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guilty? O, I don't know as she is
<i>guilty</i>, mamma; but she ate the cake!
She ate it right before my face and
eyes; but I told her it was just as
well, she was perfectly welcome, and
tried to be as polite as if she was a
grown-up lady, mother. But, O, dear,
it didn't make a speck of difference
how much I said; for the more I said,
the more angry she grew, and I
couldn't make her believe I didn't
think she was a thief and a liar!
Only think, a thief and a liar! But
I never said those words at all,
mother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, my dear; I am sure
you did not. It is a great comfort to
me, Susy, that I can always rely on
your word. You have done nothing
wrong, and need not be unhappy;
but Mrs. Lovejoy sends for you to go
over and tell her just what you mean
about the cake; are you willing to
go?&quot;</p>

<p>Susy was not willing; indeed, she
was very much frightened, and begged
her mother to excuse her in some way
to Mrs. Lovejoy, or, if that would not
do, to go herself and explain the matter
for her.</p>

<p>But, as it was Susy's own affair,
Mrs. Parlin wished to have as little to
do with it as possible. Besides, she
considered it a good opportunity to
teach Susy a lesson in moral courage.</p>

<p>Susy started very reluctantly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid Mrs. Lovejoy will scold
real sharp,&quot; said she. &quot; What shall I
do? O, mother, I didn't see Annie eat
<i>all</i> the cake; I didn't watch. How do
I know but she gave some crumbs to
the cat? Can't I&mdash;can't I say, I <i>guess</i>
the cat ate it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Susy!&quot; said Mrs. Parlin, sternly,
&quot;are you more afraid of displeasing
Mrs. Lovejoy than you are of displeasing
God? All that is required of you
is the simple truth. Merely say to
Annie's mother just what you have
said to me; that you saw Annie eating
cake several times, though there
was no harm in it, and you did <i>not</i>
call her either a thief or a liar. Speak
respectfully, but decidedly; and when
you have said all that is necessary,
leave her politely, and come home.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy called up all her courage when
she entered Mrs. Lovejoy's house, and
saw that lady sitting very erect on a
sofa, with a bleak face, which looked
somehow as if a north-east wind had
blown over it, and frozen it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, little girl,&quot; said she, without
waiting for ceremony, &quot;so you call
my Annie all the bad names you can
think of, it seems. Is that the way
you are brought up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't call her names, ma'am;
she ate the cake, but I was willing,&quot;
replied Susy, calmly and respectfully,
though she trembled from head to
foot. There was one thought which
sustained Susy; she was telling the
truth, and that was just what God
wanted her to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Lovejoy, &quot;I must
say you're a dignified little piece! Do
you know you've done the same thing
as to tell me I lie?&quot;</p>

<p>This was just the way <i>Annie</i> had
spoken; warping innocent words, and
making them the occasion of a quarrel.</p>

<p>Susy could think of nothing which
seemed exactly right to say to Mrs.
Lovejoy in reply; so she wisely held
her peace.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, miss, you've insulted my
child, and, as if that were not enough,
you come over here, deliberately, and
insult <i>me</i>, in my own house!&quot;</p>

<p>Tears sprang to Susy's eyes, but she
resolutely crushed them back. There
was, in her childish mind, a certain
sense of self-respect, which made her
unwilling to cry in the presence of
such a person as Mrs. Lovejoy. She
felt instinctively that the woman was
not a lady. Susy was too young to
reason about the matter; but she was
quite sure her own mother was a
model of good manners; and never,
never had she known her mother to
raise her voice to such a high key, or
speak such angry words!</p>

<p>Mrs. Lovejoy said a great many
things which were both severe and
unjust; but Susy managed to keep
up a respectful manner, as her mother
had directed. Mrs. Lovejoy was disappointed.
She had expected Susy
would quail before her presence
and make the most humble confessions.</p>

<p>&quot;I always knew,&quot; cried Mrs. Lovejoy,
becoming more and more exasperated,&mdash;&quot;I
always knew Mrs. Parlin
held her head pretty high! She is a
proud, stuck-up woman, your mother
is; she has taught you to look down
on my little girl! O, yes, I understand
the whole story! You're a
beautiful family for neighbors!&quot;</p>

<p>Poor Susy was fairly bewildered.</p>

<p>&quot;Now you may go home as straight
as you can go! But remember one
thing: never, while we live in this
city, shall my daughter Annie darken
your doors again!&quot;</p>

<p>Susy walked home with downcast
head and overflowing eyes. Her heart
was very heavy, for she felt she had
been disgraced for life, and could
never be respected any more. Here
was a trial so terrible that it caused
the death of little Dandy to seem
almost a trifle by comparison.</p>

<p>It was strange, Susy thought, how
people could live through such severe
troubles as had fallen to her lot to-day.
She was a little girl of quick and
sensitive feelings, and a sharp word
always wounded her more than a
blow. How that angry woman had
talked about her mother!</p>

<p>Susy decided, upon the whole, that
this was the sting&mdash;this was the &quot;pin
in the lash,&quot; which had hurt her more
than the lash. How <i>dared</i> Mrs. Lovejoy
say a word about her own mother,
who was certainly the best woman
that ever lived, always excepting the
good people in the Bible!</p>

<p>By the time she entered the house,
her indignation had risen like a blaze,
and burned away all her tears. But
should she tell her mother what Mrs.
Lovejoy had said about her ownself,
about her being &quot;stuck up,&quot; and holding
her head pretty high? Susy could
not decide whether she ought to tell
her, and risk the danger of almost
breaking her heart! But before she
had time to decide, she had poured out
the whole story in a torrent.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Mrs. Parlin listened
with perfect calmness, and even said,
when Susy had finished,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, my dear; now you
may go and hang up your hood and
cloak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, mother,&quot; said Susy, rushing
up stairs again, quite out of breath,
&quot;now I've taken care of my things;
but did you understand what I said,
mother? Annie will never come into
this house, never again! Her mother
forbids it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is quite fortunate for me,
Susy, as it saves me the trouble of forbidding
it myself!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, mother, you wouldn't do
such a thing as that! Why, mother,
I never heard of your doing such a
thing in my life!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should regret the necessity very
much, my child; but wouldn't it be
better, on the whole, to have a little
moral courage, and put an end to all
intercourse between the two families,
than to live in a constant broil?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes, mother, I suppose so.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy was beginning to feel more
composed. She saw that her mother
understood the whole story, yet her
heart was far from being broken!</p>

<p>&quot;What is moral courage, mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The courage to do right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I have moral courage when I
told Mrs. Lovejoy the truth?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear. It was hard for you,
wasn't it? If it had been easy, there
would have been no moral courage
about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad I had moral courage!&quot;
said Susy with animation. &quot;I knew I
did something <i>right</i>, but I didn't know
what you called it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; continued Mrs. Parlin, &quot;I
have this very day been talking with
a lady, who once lived next door to
Mrs. Lovejoy; and she tells me enough
about her to convince me that she is
not a person I wish for a neighbor.
And I have heard enough about Annie,
too, to feel very sure she is not a safe
companion for my little daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, mother,&quot; said Susy, &quot;you are
not&mdash;you don't feel 'stuck up' above
Mrs. Lovejoy?&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;That is not a very proper expression,
Susy; but I think I do not feel
<i>stuck-up</i> above her in the least. I am
only anxious that my little daughter
may not be injured by bad examples.
I don't know what sort of a little girl
Annie might be with proper influences,
but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, mamma, I don't want to
say anything improper,&quot; said Susy,
earnestly; &quot;but wouldn't it be the
<i>piousest</i> for me to play with Annie,
and try to make her go to Sabbath
school, and be better?&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin did not answer at once.
She was thinking of what she had
said to Susy about people who are
&quot;home missionaries,&quot; and do a great
deal of good by a beautiful example.</p>

<p>&quot;If you were older, dear, it would
be quite different. But, instead of
improving Annie, who is a self-willed
child, I fear you would only grow
worse yourself. She is bold, and you
are rather timid. She wants to lead,
and not to follow. I fear she will set
you bad examples.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know, mamma; but I
thought I was almost old enough to
set my <i>own</i> examples! I'm the oldest
of the family.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy said no more about becoming
a home-missionary to Annie; for,
although she could not quite see the
force of her mother's reasoning, she
believed her mother was always right.</p>

<p>&quot;But what does she mean by calling
me <i>timid</i>? She has blamed me a
great deal for being <i>bold</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, bold Susy certainly was, when
there was a fence to climb, a pony to
ride, or a storm to be faced; but she
was, nevertheless, a little faint-hearted
when people laughed at her. But
Susy was learning every day, and this
time it had been a lesson in moral
courage. She did not fully understand
her mother, however, as you
will see by and by.</p>

<h3>RUTHIE TURNER.</h3>

<div class="pmidd">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&quot;The darkest day,<br /></span>
<span>Wait till to-morrow, will have passed away.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<br />

<p>The next morning, Susy woke with
a faint recollection that something
unpleasant had occurred, though she
could not at first remember what it
was.</p>

<p>&quot;But I didn't do anything wrong,&quot;
was her second thought. &quot;Now, after
I say my prayers, the next thing I'll
feed&mdash;O, Dandy is dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See here, Susy,&quot; said Percy, coming
into the dining-room, just after breakfast;
&quot;did you ever see this cage before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Percy! When you know I
want it out of my sight!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, in the next breath, &quot;Why,
Percy Eastman, if here isn't your
beautiful mocking-bird in the cage!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Susy; and if you'll keep him,
and be good to him, you'll do me a
great favor.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a long while before Susy
could be persuaded that this rare bird
was to be her &quot;ownest own.&quot; It was
a wonderfully gifted little creature.
Susy could but own that he was just
as good as a canary, only a great deal
better. &quot;The greater included the
less.&quot; He had as sweet a voice, and a
vast deal more compass. His powers
of mimicry were very amusing to poor
little Prudy, who was never tired of
hearing him mew like a kitten, quack
like a duck, or whistle like a schoolboy.</p>

<p>Susy was still more delighted than
Prudy. It was so comforting, too,
to know that she was doing Percy
&quot;a great favor,&quot; by accepting his
beautiful present. She wondered in
her own mind how he <i>could</i> be tired
of such an interesting pet, and asked
her to take it, just to get rid of it!</p>

<p>About this time, Mr. Parlin bought
for Prudy a little armed-chair, which
rolled about the floor on wheels. This
Prudy herself could propel with only
the outlay of a very little strength;
but there were days when she did not
care to sit in it at all. Prudy seemed to
grow worse. The doctor was hopeful,
very hopeful; but Mrs. Parlin was
not.</p>

<p>Prudy's dimpled hands had grown
so thin, that you could trace the winding
path of every blue vein quite
distinctly. Her eyes were large and
mournful, and seemed to be always
asking for pity. She grew quiet
and patient&mdash;&quot;painfully patient,&quot; her
father said. Indeed, Mr. Parlin, as
well as his wife, feared the little
sufferer was ripening for heaven.</p>

<p>&quot;Mamma,&quot; said she, one day,
&quot;mamma, you never snip my fingers
any nowadays do you? When I'm
just as naughty, you never snip my
fingers!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin turned her face away.
There were tears in her eyes, and she
did not like to look at those little
white fingers, which she was almost
afraid would never have the natural,
childish naughtiness in them any
more.</p>

<p>&quot;I think sick and patient little girls
don't need punishing,&quot; said she, after
a while. &quot;Do you remember how
you used to think I snipped your
hands to 'get the naughty out?' You
thought the naughty was all in your
little hands!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it wasn't, mamma,&quot; said
Prudy, slowly and solemnly. &quot;I
know where it was: it was in my
<i>heart</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who can take the naughty out
of our hearts, dear? Do you ever
think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our Father in heaven. No one
else can. <i>He</i> knows how to snip our
hearts, and get the naughty out.
Sometimes he sends the earache and
the toothache to Susy, and the&mdash;the&mdash;lameness
to me. O, he has a great
many ways of snipping!&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy was showing the angel-side
of her nature now. Suffering was
&quot;making her perfect.&quot; She had a
firm belief that God knew all about it,
and that somehow or other it was
&quot;all right.&quot; Her mother took a great
deal of pains to teach her this. She
knew that no one can bear affliction
with real cheerfulness who does not
trust in God.</p>

<p>But there was now and then a
bright day when Prudy felt quite
buoyant, and wanted to play. Susy
left everything then, and tried to
amuse her. If this lameness was
refining little Prudy, it was also making
Susy more patient. She could
not look at her little sister's pale face,
and not be touched with pity.</p>

<p>One afternoon, Flossy Eastman and
Ruthie Turner came to see Susy; and,
as it was one of Prudy's best days,
Mrs. Parlin said they might play
in Prudy's sitting-room. Ruthie was
what Susy called an &quot;old-fashioned
little girl.&quot; She lived with a widowed
mother, and had no brothers and sisters,
so that she appeared much older
than she really was. She liked to
talk with grown people upon wise subjects,
as if she were at least twenty-five
years old. Susy knew that this
was not good manners, and she longed
to say so to Ruthie.</p>

<p>Aunt Madge was in Prudy's sitting-room
when Ruthie entered. Ruthie
went up to her and shook hands at
once.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it is Susy's aunt Madge,&quot;
said she. &quot;I am delighted to see you,
for Susy says you love little girls, and
know lots of games.&quot;</p>

<p>There was such a quiet composure
in Ruth's manner, and she seemed to
feel so perfectly at home in addressing
a young lady she had never seen before,
that Miss Parlin was quite astonished,
as well as a little inclined to
smile.</p>

<p>Then Ruthie went on to talk about
the war. Susy listened in mute despair,
for she did not know anything
about politics. Aunt Madge looked at
Susy's face, and felt amused, for <i>Ruthie</i>
knew nothing about politics either:
she was as ignorant as Susy. She
had only heard her mother and other
ladies talking together. Ruthie answered
all the purpose of a parrot
hung up in a cage, for she caught and
echoed everything that was said, not
having much idea what it meant.</p>

<p>When aunt Madge heard Ruth laboring
away at long sentences, with
hard words in them, she thought of
little Dotty, as she had seen her, that
morning, trying to tug Percy's huge
dog up stairs in her arms.</p>

<p>&quot;It is too much for her,&quot; thought
aunt Madge: &quot;the dog got the upper-hand
of Dotty, and I think the big
words are more than a match for
Ruth.&quot;</p>

<p>But Ruth did not seem to know it,
for she persevered. She gravely asked
aunt Madge if she approved of the
&quot;<i>Mancimation</i> of <i>Proclapation</i>.&quot; Then
she said she and her mamma were
very much &quot;<i>perplexed&quot;</i> when news
came of the last defeat. She would
have said &quot;<i>surprised</i>&quot; only <i>surprised</i>
was an every-day word, and not up to
standard of elegant English.</p>

<p>Ruth was not so very silly, after all.
It was only when she tried to talk of
matters too old for her that she made
herself ridiculous. She was very quiet
and industrious, and had knit several
pairs of socks for the soldiers.</p>

<p>As soon as Miss Parlin could disentangle
herself from her conversation
with Ruthie, she left the children to
themselves.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's keep school,&quot; said Prudy.
&quot;I'll be teacher, if you want me to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Susy, &quot;we'll let
her; won't we, girls? she is such a
darling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Prudy, with a look of
immense satisfaction, &quot;please go, Susy,
and ask grandma if I may have one
of those shiny, white handkerchiefs
she wears on her neck, and a cap, and
play Quaker.&quot;</p>

<p>Grandma was very glad that Prudy
felt well enough to play Quaker, and
lent her as much &quot;costume&quot; as she
needed, as well as a pair of spectacles
without eyes, which the children often
borrowed for their plays, fancying
that they added to the dignity of the
wearer.</p>

<p>When Prudy was fairly equipped,
she was a droll little Quakeress, surely,
and grandma had to be called up from
the kitchen to behold her with her
own eyes. The little soft face, almost
lost in the folds of the expansive cap,
was every bit as solemn as if she had
been, as aunt Madge said, &quot;a hundred
years old, and very old for her age.&quot;</p>

<p>She was really a sweet little likeness
of grandma Read in miniature.</p>

<p>&quot;And their names are alike, too,&quot;
said Susy: &quot;grandma's name is Prudence,
and so is Prudy's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Used to be,&quot; said Prudy, gravely.</p>

<p>&quot;Rosy Frances&quot; was now lifted most
carefully into her little wheeled chair
and no queen ever held a court with
more dignity than she assumed as she
smoothed into place the folds of her
grandma's snowy kerchief, which she
wore about her neck.</p>

<p>&quot;What shall we do first?&quot; said
Flossy and Susy.</p>

<p>&quot;Thee? thee?&quot; Prudy considered
&quot;thee&quot; the most important word of
all. &quot;Why, <i>thee</i> may behave; I mean,
behave <i>thyselves</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>The new teacher had not collected
her ideas yet.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's get our books together,&quot; said
Susy, &quot;and then we'll all sit on the
sofa and study.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me, me,&quot; chimed in Dotty Dimple,
dropping the little carriage in which
she was wheeling her kitty; &quot;me,
too!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you must, you must;
snuggle in here between Flossy and
me,&quot; said Susy, who was determined
that to-day everything should go on
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Sixteenth class in joggerphy,&quot; said
Miss Rosy Frances, peeping severely
over her spectacles. &quot;Be spry quick!&quot;</p>

<p>The three pupils stood up in a row,
holding their books close to their
faces.</p>

<p>&quot;Thee may hold out your hands
now, and I shall ferule thee&mdash;the
whole school,&quot; was the stern remark
of the young teacher, as she took off
her spectacles to wipe the holes.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Why, we haven't been doing anything,&quot;
said Ruthie, affecting to cry.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I know it; but thee'd <i>ought</i>
to have been doing something; thee'd
ought to have studied thy lessons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, teacher, we didn't have time,&quot;
pleaded Flossy; &quot;you called us out so
quick! Won't you forgive us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; said Rosy Frances,
gently; &quot;I will, if thee'll speak up
<i>'xtremely</i> loud, and fix <i>thine</i> eyes on
thy teacher.&quot;</p>

<p>The pupils replied, &quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; at
the top of their voices.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Rosy Frances, appearing
to read from the book, &quot;where is
the Isthmus of <i>Susy?</i>&quot;</p>

<p>The scholars all laughed, and answered
at random. They did not
know that their teacher was trying to
say the &quot;Isthmus of Suez.&quot;</p>

<p>The next question took them by surprise:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there any man in the moon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a queer idea, Rosy,&quot; said
Susy; &quot;what made you ask that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Cause I wanted to know,&quot; replied
the Quaker damsel. &quot;They said he
came down when the other man was
eatin' porridge. I should think, if he
went back up there, and didn't have
any wife and children, he'd be real
lonesome!&quot;</p>

<p>This idea of Prudy's set the whole
school to romancing, although it was
in the midst of a recitation. Flossy
said if there was a man in the moon,
he must be a giant, or he never could
get round over the mountains, which
she had heard were very steep.</p>

<p>Ruthie asked if there was anything
said about his wife! Susy, who had
read considerable poetry was sure she
had heard something of a woman up
there, named &quot;Cynthia;&quot; but she supposed
it was all &quot;moonshine,&quot; or
&quot;made up,&quot; as she expressed it. She
said she meant to ask her aunt Madge
to write a fairy story about it.</p>

<p>Here their progress in useful knowledge
was cut short by the disappearance
of Dotty. Looking out of the
window, they saw the little rogue
driving ducks with a broomstick.
These ducks had a home not far from
Mrs. Parlin's, and if Dotty Dimple
had one temptation stronger than all
others, it was the sight of those waddling
fowls, with their velvet heads,
beads of eyes, and spotted feathers.
When she saw them &quot;marshin' along,&quot;
she was instantly seized with a desire
either to head the company or to
march in the rear, and set them to
quacking. She was bareheaded, and
Susy ran down stairs to bring her into
the house; and that was an end of
the school for that day. Dotty Dimple
was something like the kettle of molasses
which Norah was boiling, very
sweet, but very apt to <i>boil over</i>: she
needed watching.</p>

<p>When Norah's candy was brought up
stairs, the little girls pronounced it
excellent.</p>

<p>&quot;O, dear,&quot; said Flossy, &quot;I wish our
girl was half as good as Norah! I
don't see why Electa and Norah ain't
more alike when they are own sisters!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What dreadful girls your mother
always has!&quot; said Susy; &quot;it's too
bad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know of a girl,&quot; said Prudy,
&quot;one you'd like ever'n, ever so much,
Flossy; only you can't have her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; said Flossy; &quot;my
mother would go hundreds of leagues
to get a good girl. Why can't she
have her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, 'cause, she's <i>dead!</i> It's Norah's
cousin over to Ireland.&quot;</p>

<p>They next played the little game of
guessing &quot;something in this room,&quot;
that begins with a certain letter.
Ruthie puzzled them a long while on
the initial S. At last she said she
meant &quot;scrutau&quot; (escritoire or scrutoire),
pointing towards the article
with her finger.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, that's a <i>writing-desk</i>,&quot; said
Susy. &quot;I don't see where you learn
so many big worns, Ruthie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, I take notice, and remember
them,&quot; replied Ruthie, looking quite
pleased. She thought Susy was praising
her.</p>

<p>&quot;Now let <i>me</i> tell some letters,&quot; said
Prudy.</p>

<p>&quot;L.R. She lives at your house,
Flossy.&quot;</p>

<p>Nobody could guess.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I should think <i>that</i> was
easy enough,&quot; said Prudy: &quot;it's that
girl that lives there; she takes off the
covers of your stove with a clothes-pin:
it's 'Lecta Rosbornd.'&quot;</p>

<p>The little girls explained to Prudy
that the true initials of Electa Osborne
would be E. O., instead of L. R.
But Prudy did not know much about
spelling. She <i>had</i> known most of her
letters; but it was some time ago,
and they had nearly all slipped out of
her head.</p>

<p>She said, often, she wished she
could &quot;only, only read;&quot; and Susy
offered to teach her, but Mrs. Parlin
said it would never do till Prudy felt
stronger.</p>

<p>I will tell you now why I think
Susy did not understand her mother
when she said Annie was not a suitable
playmate. In the evening, after
Ruthie and Flossy were gone, Susy
said to her mother,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel real cross with Ruthie,
mamma: I think she puts herself forward.
She goes into a room, and no
matter how old the people are that
are talking, she speaks up, and says,
'O, yes, I know all about it.' I
never saw such an old-fashioned little
girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Mrs. Parlin; &quot;if
<i>she</i> is rude, take care that the same
fault does not appear in yourself,
Susy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, mother,&quot; said Susy, suddenly
veering about and speaking in Ruth's
favor, &quot;I don't know but it's proper
to do as Ruthy does. If you know
something, and other people don't,
ain't it right to speak up and say
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is never right for little girls to
<i>monopolize</i> conversation, Susy; that
is, to take the lead in it, and so
prevent older people from talking.
Neither is it proper to pretend to
know more than we do, and talk of
things beyond our knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew you would say so, mother.
I just asked to hear what you would
say. I know Ruthie is ill-mannered:
do you think I ought to play with her
any more?&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Parlin looked at Susy in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you know, mother, you
wouldn't let me play with Annie
Lovejoy. You said, 'evil communications
corrupted good manners.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But can't you see any difference
in the cases, Susy? What a muddy
little head you must wear on your
shoulders!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not much of any,&quot; said Susy,
trying to think; &quot;they're both <i>bold</i>;
that's what you don't like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything else, Susy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, yes, mother; Ruthie's good, and
Annie isn't. It was queer for me to
forget that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should think it was, Susy, since
it is the only thing of much importance,
after all. Now, it seems to me
you are very ready to cast off your
friends when their manners offend
you. How would you like it to be
treated in the same way? Suppose
Mrs. Turner and Ruthie should be
talking together this very minute.
Ruthie says, 'That Susy Parlin keeps
her drawers in a perfect tumble; she
isn't orderly a bit. Susy Parlin never
knit a stitch for the soldiers in her
life. Mother, mayn't I stop playing
with Susy Parlin?'&quot;</p>

<p>Susy laughed, and looked a little
ashamed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, mother,&quot; said she, twisting
the corner of her handkerchief, &quot;I
guess I can't say anything about
Ruthie Turner; she's a great deal
better girl than I am, any way.&quot;</p>

<h3>SUSY'S BIRTHDAY.</h3>
<br />

<p>Days and weeks passed. The snowflakes,
which had fallen from time to
time, and kept themselves busy making
a patchwork quilt for mother
Earth, now melted away, and the
white quilt was torn into shreds. The
bare ground was all there was to be
seen, except now and then a dot of
the white coverlet. It was Spring,
and everything began to wake up.
The sun wasn't half so sleepy, and
didn't walk off over the western hills
in the middle of the afternoon to take
a nap.</p>

<p>The sleighing was gone long ago.
The roads were dismal swamps.
&quot;Wings&quot; would have a rest till &quot;settled
going.&quot; Susy's skates were hung
up in a green baize bag, to dream
away the summer.</p>

<p>The mocking-bird performed his
daily duties of entertaining the family,
besides learning a great many new
songs. Susy said she tried not to set
her heart on that bird.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll not give him a name,&quot; she
added, &quot;for then he'll be sure to die!
My first canary was Bertie, and I
named the others Berties, as fast as
they died off. The last one was so
yellow that I couldn't help calling him
Dandelion; but I wish I hadn't, for
then, perhaps, he'd have lived.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy had caught some whimsical
notions about &quot;signs and wonders.&quot;
It is strange how some intelligent
children will believe in superstitious
stories! But as soon as Susy's parents
discovered that her young head
had been stored with such worse than
foolish ideas, they were not slow to
teach her better.</p>

<p>She had a great fright, about this
time, concerning Freddy Jackson. He
was one of the few children who were
allowed to play in &quot;Prudy's sitting-room.&quot;
He did not distract the tired
nerves of &quot;Rosy Frances,&quot; as her cousin
Percy and other boys did, by sudden
shouts and loud laughing. Prudy
had a vague feeling that he was one
of the little ones that God thought
best to punish by &quot;snipping his heart.&quot;
She knew what it was to have <i>her</i>
heart snipped, and had a sympathy
with little Freddy.</p>

<p>Susy loved Freddy, too. Perhaps
Percy was right, when he said that
Susy loved everything that was dumb;
and I am not sure but her tender heart
would have warmed to him all the
more if he had been stone-blind, as
well as deaf.</p>

<p>Freddy had a drunken father, and a
sad home; but, for all that, he was not
entirely miserable. It is only the
wicked who are miserable. The kind
Father in heaven has so planned it
that there is something pleasant in
everybody's life.</p>

<p>Freddy had no more idea what <i>sound</i>
is than we have of the angels in
heaven; but he could see, and there
is so much to be seen! Here is a
great, round world, full of beauty and
wonder. It stands ready to be looked
at. Freddy's ears must be forever shut
out from pleasant sound; but his
bright eyes were wide open, seeing all
that was made to be seen.</p>

<p>He loved to go to Mrs. Parlin's,
for there he was sure to be greeted
pleasantly; and he understood the
language of smiles as well as anybody.</p>

<p>When grandma Read saw him coming
she would say,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Susan, thee'd better lay aside
thy book, for most likely the poor little
fellow will want to <i>talk</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>And Susy did lay aside her book.
She had learned so many lessons this
winter in self-denial!</p>

<p>These &quot;silent talks&quot; were quite droll.
Little Dotty almost understood something
about them; that is, when they
used the signs: the alphabet was more
than she could manage. When Freddy
wanted to talk about Dotty, he made
a sign for a dimple in each cheek. He
smoothed his hair when he meant
Susy, and made a waving motion over
his head for Prudy, whose hair was
full of ripples.</p>

<p>Prudy said she had wrinkled hair,
and she knew it; but the wrinkles
&quot;wouldn't come out.&quot;</p>

<p>Grandma Read sat one evening by
the coal-grate, holding a letter in her
hand, and looking into the glowing
fire with a thoughtful expression. Susy
came and sat near her, resting one arm
on her grandma's lap, and trying in
various ways to attract her attention.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, grandma,&quot; said she, &quot;I've
spoken to you three times; but I can't
get you to answer or look at me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does thee want, my dear? I
will try to attend to thee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, grandma, there are ever so
many things I want to say, now
mother is out of the room, and father
hasn't got home. I must tell somebody,
or my heart will break; and you
know, grandma dear, I can talk to you
so easy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can thee? Then go on, Susy; what
would thee like to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, two or three things. Have you
noticed, grandma, that I've been just
as sober as can be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For how long, Susan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, all day; I've felt as if I couldn't
but just live!&quot;</p>

<p>Grandma Read did not smile at this.
She knew very well that such a child
as Susy is capable of intense suffering.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Susan, is it about thy sister
Prudence?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O, no, grandma! she's getting;
better; isn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are thy lessons at school too hard
for thee, Susan?&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Read saw that Susy was very
reluctant about opening her heart, although
she had said she could talk to
her grandmother &quot;so easy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, indeed, grandma; my lessons
are not too hard. I'm a real good
scholar&mdash;one of the best in school for
my age.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a fact. Some people would
have chidden Susy for it; but Mrs.
Read reflected that the child was only
telling the simple truth, and had no
idea of boasting. She was not a little
girl who would intrude such remarks
about herself upon strangers. But
when she and her grandma were talking
together confidentially, she thought
it made all the difference in the world;
as indeed it did.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a great deal to trouble me,&quot;
said Susy, and the &quot;evening-blue&quot; of
her eyes clouded over, till there were
signs of a shower. &quot;I thought my
pony would make me happy as long
as I lived; but it hasn't. One thing
that I feel bad about is&mdash;well, it's
turning over a new leaf. When New
Year's comes, I'm going to do it, and
don't; so I wait till my birthday, and
then I don't. It seems as if I'd tried
about a thousand New Years and
birthdays to turn over that leaf.&quot;</p>

<p>Grandma smiled, but did not interrupt
Susy.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I should be real good,&quot; continued
the child, &quot;if it wasn't such
hard work. I can't be orderly, grandma&mdash;not
much; and then Dotty upsets
everything. Sometimes I have to
hold my breath to keep patient.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, grandma, my birthday comes
to-morrow, the 8th of April. I like it
well enough; only there's one reason
why I don't like it at all, and that is a
Bible reason. It's so dreadful that I
can't bear to say it to you,&quot; said Susy,
shuddering, and lowering her voice to
a whisper; &quot;I don't want to grow up,
for I shall have to marry Freddy Jackson.&quot;</p>

<p>Grandma tried to look serious.</p>

<p>&quot;Who put such a foolish idea into
thy head, child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cousin Percy told me last night,&quot;
answered Susy, solemnly. &quot;How can
you laugh when it's all in the Bible,
grandma? I never told anybody before.
Wait; I'll show you the verse.
I've put a mark at the place.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy brought her Bible to her grandmother,
and, opening it at the thirty-first
chapter of Proverbs, pointed, with
a trembling finger, to the eighth verse,
which Mrs. Read read aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Open thy mouth for the dumb in
the cause of all such as are appointed
to destruction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now Percy says that's a sure sign!
I told him, O, dear! Freddy ought to
marry a dumb woman; that would
be <i>properest</i>; but Percy says no&mdash;anything
has got to 'come to pass' when
it's <i>foreordinationed</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And could thee really believe such
foolishness, my sensible little Susan?
Does thee suppose the good Lord ever
meant that we should read his Bible
as if it were a wicked dream-book?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you don't think I shall have
to marry Freddy Jackson,&quot; cried Susy,
immensely relieved. &quot;I'm so glad I
told you! I felt so sober all day, only
nobody noticed it, and I was ashamed
to tell!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a good thing for thee to tell
thy little troubles to thy older friends,
Susan: thee'll almost always find it
so,&quot; said grandma Read, stroking
Susy's hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, my child, I have a piece of
news for thee, if thee is ready to hear
it: thy cousin, Grace Clifford, has a
little sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A baby sister? A real sister?
Does mother know it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, thy mother knows it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how <i>could</i> you keep it to yourself
so long?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thee thinks good news is hard to
keep, does thee? Well, thee shall be
the first to tell thy father when he
comes home.&quot;</p>

<p>Susy heard steps on the door-stone,
and rushed out, with the joyful story
on her lips. It proved to be not her
father, but callers, who were just ringing
the bell; and they heard Susy's
exclamation,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;O, have you heard? Grace has a
new sister, a baby sister, as true as
you live!&quot; with the most provoking
coolness.</p>

<p>But when Mr. Parlin came, he was
sufficiently interested in the news to
satisfy even Susy.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<a name="CHAPTER_XII"></a><h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>FAREWELL.</h3>
<br />

<p>Prudy was really getting better.
Mrs. Parlin said she should trust a
physician more next time. The doctor
declared that all the severe pain
Prudy had suffered was really necessary.</p>

<p>&quot;Believe me, my dear madam,&quot; said
he, &quot;when the poor child has complained
most, she has in fact been
making most progress towards health.
When the sinews are 'knitting together,'
as we call it, then the agony
is greatest.&quot;</p>

<p>This was very comforting to Mrs.
Parlin, who thought she would not be
discouraged so easily again; she would
always believe that it is &quot;darkest just
before day.&quot;</p>

<p>There was really everything to hope
for Prudy. The doctor thought that
by the end of three months she would
walk as well as ever. He said she
might make the effort now, every day,
to bear her weight on her feet. She
tried this experiment first with her
father and mother on each side to support
her; but it was not many days
before she could stand firmly on her
right foot, and bear a little weight on
her left one, which did not now, as
formerly, drag, or, as she had said,
&quot;<i>more</i> than touch the floor.&quot; By and
by she began to scramble about on the
carpet on all fours, partly creeping,
partly pushing herself along.</p>

<p>It was surprising how much pleasure
Prudy took in going back to these
ways of babyhood.</p>

<p>Faint blush roses began to bloom in
her cheeks as soon as she could take
a little exercise and go out of doors.
Her father bought a little carriage
just suitable for the pony, and in this
she rode every morning, her mother
or Percy driving; for Mrs. Parlin
thought it hardly safe to trust Susy
with such a precious encumbrance as
this dear little sister.</p>

<p>She had been willing that Susy
should manage Wings in a sleigh, but
in a carriage the case was quite different;
for, though in a sleigh there
might be even more danger of overturning,
there was not as much danger
of getting hurt. Indeed, Susy's
sleigh had tipped over once or twice
in turning too sharp a corner, and
Susy had fallen out, but had instantly
jumped up again, laughing.</p>

<p>She would have driven in her new
carriage to Yarmouth and back again,
or perhaps to Bath, if she had been
permitted. She was a reckless little
horsewoman, afraid of nothing, and
for that very reason could not be
trusted alone.</p>

<p>But there was no difficulty in finding
companions. Percy pretended to
study book-keeping, but was always
ready for a ride. Flossy was not
steady enough to be trusted with the
reins, but Ruth Turner was as careful
a driver as need be; though Susy
laughed because she held the reins in
both hands, and looked so terrified.</p>

<p>She said it did no good to talk with
Ruth when she was driving; she never
heard a word, for she was always
watching to see if a carriage was coming,
and talking to herself, to make
sure she remembered which was her
right hand, so she could &quot;turn to the
right, as the law directs.&quot;</p>

<p>Prudy enjoyed the out-of-doors world
once more, and felt like a bird let out
of a cage. And so did Susy, for she
thought she had had a dull season of
it, and fully agreed with Prudy, who
spoke of it as the &quot;slow winter.&quot;</p>

<p>But now it was the quick spring,
the live spring. The brooks began to
gossip; the birds poured out their
hearts in song, and the dumb trees
expressed their joy in leaves</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The bobolink, on the mullein-stalk,<br /></span>
<span>Would rattle away like a sweet girl's talk.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The frogs took severe colds, but gave
concerts a little way out of the city
every evening. The little flowers
peeped up from their beds, as Norah
said, &quot;like babies asking to be took;&quot;
and Susy took them; whenever she
could find them, you may be sure, and
looked joyfully into their faces. She
could almost say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And 'tis my faith that every flower<br /></span>
<span>Enjoys the air it breathes.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She said, &quot;I don't suppose they know
much, but <i>perhaps</i> they know enough
to have a good time: who knows?&quot;</p>

<p>Susy took long walks to Westbrook,
and farther, coming home tired out,
but loaded with precious flowers.
There were plenty of friends to give
them to her from their early gardens:
broad-faced crocuses, jonquils, and
lilies of the valley, and by and by lilacs,
with &quot;purple spikes.&quot;</p>

<p>She gathered snowdrops, &quot;the first
pale blossoms of the unripened year,&quot;
and May-flowers, pink and white, like
sea-shells, or like &quot;cream-candy,&quot; as
Prudy said. These soft little blossoms
blushed so sweetly on the same leaf
with such old experienced leaves!
Susy said, &quot;it made her think of little
bits of children who hadn't any mother,
and lived with their grandparents.&quot;</p>

<p>Dotty was almost crazy with delight
when she had a &quot;new pair o' boots,
and a pair o' shaker,&quot; and was allowed
to toddle about on the pavement in
the sunshine. She had a green twig
or a switch to flourish, and could now
cry, &quot;Hullelo!&quot; to those waddling
ducks, and hear them reply, &quot;Quack!
quack!&quot; without having such a
trembling fear that some stern Norah,
or firm mamma, would rush out bareheaded,
and drag her into the house,
like a little culprit.</p>

<p>It was good times for Dotty Dimple,
and good times for the whole family.
Spring had come, and Prudy was getting
well. There was a great deal to
thank God for!</p>

<p>It is an evening in the last of May.
A bit of a moon, called &quot;the new
moon,&quot; is peeping in at the window.
It shines over Susy's right shoulder,
she says. Susy is reading, Prudy is
walking slowly across the floor, and
Dotty Dimple is whispering to her
kitty, telling her to go down cellar,
and catch the naughty rats while
they are asleep. When kitty winks,
Dotty thinks it the same as if she
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I hear you, little Miss Dotty: I'm
going.&quot;</p>

<p>I think perhaps this is a good time
to bid the three little girls good-by, or,
as dear grandma Read would say,
&quot;Farewell!&quot;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
