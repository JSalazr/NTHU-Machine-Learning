<p>The true story of the life of Michael Drayton might be told to,
vindicate the poetic traditions of the olden time. A child-poet
wandering in fay-haunted Arden, or listening to the harper that
frequented the fireside of Polesworth Hall where the boy was a petted
page, later the honoured almoner of the bounty of many patrons, one who
&quot;not unworthily,&quot; as Tofte said, &quot;beareth the name of the chiefest
archangel, singing after this soule-ravishing manner,&quot; yet leaving but
&quot;five pounds lying by him at his death, which was <i>satis viatici ad
c&oelig;lum</i>&quot;&mdash;is not this the panorama of a poetic career? But above all,
to complete the picture of the ideal poet, he worshipped, and
hopelessly, from youth to age the image of one, woman. He never married,
and while many patronesses were honoured with his poetic addresses,
there was one fair dame to whom he never offered dedicatory sonnet, a
silence that is full of meaning. Yet the praises of Idea, his poetic
name for the lady of his admiration and love, are written all over the
pages of his voluminous lyrical and chorographical and historical poems,
and her very name is quaintly revealed to us. Anne Goodere was the
younger daughter in the noble family where Drayton was bred and
educated; and one may picture the fair child standing &quot;gravely merry&quot; by
the little page to listen to &quot;John Hews his lyre,&quot; at that ancestral
fireside. &quot;Where I love, I love for years,&quot; said Drayton in 1621. As
late as 1627, but four years before his death, he writes an elegy of his
lady's not coming to London, in which he complains that he has been
starved for her short letters and has had to read last year's over
again. About the same time he is writing that immortal sonnet, the
sixty-first, the one that Rossetti, with perhaps something too much of
partiality, has declared to be almost, if not quite, the best in the
language. The tragedy of a whole life is concentrated in that sonnet,
and the heart-pang in it is unmistakable. But Drayton had stood as
witness to the will of Anne's father, by which &pound;1500 was set down for
her marriage portion. She was an heiress, he a penniless poet, and what
was to be done?</p>

<p>About 1590, when Drayton was twenty-eight, and Anne was probably
twenty-one years old, Drayton left Polesworth Hall and came to London.
Perhaps the very parting was the means of revealing his heart to
himself, for it is from near this time that, as he confesses later, he
dates the first consciousness of his love. He soon publishes <i>Idea, the
Shepherd's Garland, Rowland's Sacrifice to the Nine Muses</i>, where we
first see our poet, in his pastoral-poetic character, carving his &quot;rime
of love's idolatry,&quot; upon a beechen tree. Thirteen stanzas of these
pastoral eclogues do not exhaust the catalogue of her beauties; and when
he praises the proportion of her shape and carriage, we know that it was
not the poet's frenzied eye alone that saw these graces, for Dr. John
Hall, of Stratford, who attended her professionally, records in his
case-book that she was &quot;beautiful and of gallant structure of body.&quot;
Anne was married about 1595 to Sir Henry Rainsford, who became Drayton's
friend, host and patron. It is likely that Lady Rainsford deserved a
goodly portion of the praises bestowed upon her beauty. And she need not
have been ashamed of the devotion of her knight of poesy; for Michael
Drayton was, like Constable and Daniel and Fletcher, a man good and
true, and the chorus of contemporaries that praise his character and his
verse is led by pious Meres himself, and echoed by Jonson.</p>

<p><i>Idea's Mirrour, Amours in Quatorzains</i>, formed the title under which
the sonnet-cycle appeared in 1594. <i>Idea</i> was reprinted eight times
before 1637, the edition of 1619 being the chief and serving for the
foundation of our text. Many changes and additions were made by the
author in the successive editions; in fact only twenty of the fifty-one
&quot;amours&quot; in <i>Idea's Mirrour</i> escaped the winnowing, while the famous
sixty-first appears for the first time in 1619. There is a distinct
progress manifest in the subdual of language and form to artistic
finish, and while the cycle in its unevenness represents the early and
late stages of poetic progress, the more delicate examples of his work
show him worthy of the praise bestowed by his latest admirer and critic,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Faith, Michael Drayton bears the bell<br /></span>
<span class="i10">For numbers airy.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will be noted that, while many rhyme-arrangements are experimented
upon, the Shakespearean or quatrain-and-couplet form predominates. In
the less praiseworthy sonnets he is found to lack grammatical clamping
and to allow frequent faults in rhythm, and he toys with the glittering
and soulless conceit as much as any; but where his individuality has
fullest sway, as in the picturesque Arden memory of the fifty-third, the
personal reminiscences of the Ankor sonnets, and the vivid theatre theme
of the forty-seventh, in what Main calls that &quot;magical realisation of
the spirit of evening&quot; in the thirty-seventh, and above all in the na&iuml;ve
and passionate sixty-first, there is a rude strength that pierces
beneath the formalities and touches and moves the heart. Drayton, like
Sidney and Daniel and Shakespeare, draws freely upon the general
thought-storehouse of the Italianate sonneteers: time and the
transitoriness of beauty, the lover's extremes, the Platonic ideas of
soul-functions and of love-madness, the phoenix and Icarus and all the
classic gods, engage his fancy first or last; and no sonnet trifler has
been more attracted by the great theme of immortality in verse than he.
When honouring Idea in the favourite mode he cries</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Queens hereafter shall be glad to live<br /></span>
<span>Upon the alms of thy superfluous praise.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A late writer holds that years have falsified this prophecy. It is true
that Lamb valued Drayton chiefly as the panegyrist of his native earth,
and we would hardly venture to predict the future of our sonneteer; but
the fact remains that now three hundred years after his time, his
lifelong devotion to the prototype of Idea constitutes, as he
conventionally asserted it would, his most valid claim to interest, and
that the sonnets where this love has found most potent expression mount
the nearest to the true note of immortality.</p>

<span>Into these loves who but for passion looks,<br /></span>
<span>At this first sight here let him lay them by,<br /></span>
<span>And seek elsewhere in turning other books,<br /></span>
<span>Which better may his labour satisfy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No far-fetched sigh shall ever wound my breast;<br /></span>
<span>Love from mine eye a tear shall never wring;<br /></span>
<span>Nor in &quot;Ah me's!&quot; my whining sonnets drest,<br /></span>
<span>A libertine fantasticly I sing.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My verse is the true image of my mind,<br /></span>
<span>Ever in motion, still desiring change;<br /></span>
<span>To choice of all variety inclined,<br /></span>
<span>And in all humours sportively I range.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My muse is rightly of the English strain,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Proceeding from the port whence he put forth,<br /></span>
<span>Shows by his compass how his course he steered,<br /></span>
<span>When east, when west, when south, and when by north,<br /></span>
<span>As how the pole to every place was reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What capes he doubled, of what continent,<br /></span>
<span>The gulfs and straits that strangely he had past,<br /></span>
<span>Where most becalmed, where with foul weather spent,<br /></span>
<span>And on what rocks in peril to be cast:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus in my love, time calls me to relate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My tedious travels and oft-varying fate.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">It slew itself; the verdict on the view<br /></span>
<span>Do quit the dead, and me not accessary.<br /></span>
<span>Well, well, I fear it will be proved by you,<br /></span>
<span>The evidence so great a proof doth carry.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But O see, see, we need inquire no further!<br /></span>
<span>Upon your lips the scarlet drops are found,<br /></span>

<span>Your cheeks yet pale since first he gave the wound!<br /></span>

<h2>FIDESSA</h2>

<h2>MORE CHASTE THAN KIND</h2>

<h3>BY</h3>

<h2>B. GRIFFIN, GENT.
</h2>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="BARTHOLOMEW_GRIFFIN" id="BARTHOLOMEW_GRIFFIN"></a>BARTHOLOMEW GRIFFIN</h2>


<p>The author of <i>Fidessa</i> has gained undeserved notice from the fact that
the piratical printer W. Jaggard, included a transcript of one of his
sonnets in a volume that he put forth in 1599, under the name of
Shakespeare. It would be easy to believe, in spite of the doubtful rimes
characteristic of <i>Fidessa</i>, that sonnet three was not Griffin's, for no
singer in the Elizabethan choir was more skilful in turning his voice to
other people's melodies than was he. He has been called &quot;a gross
plagiary;&quot; yet it must be realised that the sonneteers of that time felt
they had a right, almost a duty, to take up the poetic themes used by
their models. Griffin shows great ingenuity in the manipulation of the
stock-themes, and the lover of Petrarch and all the young
Abraham-Slenders of the day must have been delighted with the familiar
&quot;designs&quot; as they re-appeared in <i>Fidessa</i>.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Griffin was buried in Coventry in 1602. In 1596 he
dedicated his &quot;slender work&quot; <i>Fidessa</i> to William Essex of Lamebourne in
Berkshire. He adds an address to the Gentlemen of the Inns of Court,
whom he begs to &quot;censure mildly as protectors of a poor stranger&quot; and
&quot;judge the best as encouragers of a young beginner.&quot; Of the poet little
further is known. From the sonnets themselves we learn that Fidessa was
&quot;of high regard,&quot; the child of a beautiful mother and of a renowned
father; she sprang in fact from the same root with the poet himself, who
writes &quot;Gent.&quot; after his name on the title-page. She had been kind to
him in sickness and had &quot;yielded to each look of his a sweet reply.&quot;
After giving these slight hints, he pushes forth from the moorings of
realism and sets sail on the ocean of the sonneteer's fancy, meeting the
usual adventures. His sonnets, while showing versatility and ingenuity,
lack spontaneous feeling and have serious defects in form; yet these
defects are in part offset by their conversational ease and dramatic
vividness.</p>

<h2>CHLORIS</h2>

<h2>OR, THE COMPLAINT OF THE PASSIONATE DESPISED SHEPHERD</h2>


<h3>BY</h3>

<h2>WILLIAM SMITH</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="WILLIAM_SMITH" id="WILLIAM_SMITH"></a>WILLIAM SMITH</h2>


<p>The sub-title of <i>Chloris</i> arouses an expectation that is gratified in
the pastoral modishness of the sonnets. Corin sits under the &quot;lofty
pines, co-partners of his woe,&quot; with oaten reed at his lips, and calls
on sylvans, lambkins and all Parnassans to testify to the beauty and
cruelty of Chloris. The attitude is a self-conscious one, yet the poem
reveals little of the personality of the author beyond the facts of his
youthfulness and of his devotion to &quot;the most excellent and learned
Shepheard, Colin Cloute.&quot; It was in 1595, but one year before the
publication of <i>Chloris</i>, that Spenser had sung his own sonnets of true
love, and it is perhaps on this account that William Smith finds him in
a mood favourable to the defence of a young aspirant. At any rate, the
language of the dedication rings with something more than mere desire
for distinguished patronage. The youth looks with a beautiful humility
upward toward the greater but &quot;dear and most entire beloved&quot; poet. His
own sonnets, he says, are &quot;of my study the budding springs&quot;; they are
but &quot;young-hatched orphan things.&quot; He nowhere boasts that they will give
immortal renown to the scornful beauty, but modestly promises that if
her cruel disdain does not ruin him, the time shall come when he &quot;more
large&quot; her &quot;praises forth shall pen.&quot; Chloris had once been favourable,
as sonnet forty-eight distinctly shows, but the cycle does not bring any
happy conclusion to the story. Corin is left weeping but faithful, and
the picture of Chloris is composed of such faint outlines only as the
sonneteer's conventions can delineate. Beyond this no certain
information in regard to poet or honoured lady has yet been unearthed.</p>

<p>For all its formality, however, the sonnet-cycle is not wanting in
touches of real feeling and lines of musical sweetness; the writer shows
considerable skill in the management of rime, and in structure he
adopts the form preferred by Shakespeare, whose &quot;sugared sonnets&quot; may by
this date have passed beneath his eye. The melodies piped by other
sonnet-shepherds re-echo with a great deal of distinctness in Covin's
strains; nevertheless he has himself taken a draught from the true
Elizabethan fount of lyric inspiration, and the nymph Chloris with her
heart-robbing eye well deserves a place on the snow-soft downs where the
sonneteering shepherds were wont to assemble.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
