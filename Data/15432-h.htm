<h3>THE TRAVELLER<br />
TO<br />
THE READER</h3>




<p>The traveller who presents himself in this
little book feels how tedious a person he may
prove to be. Most travellers, that he ever
heard of, were the happy possessors of audacity
and rigour, a zeal for facts, a zeal for Science,
a vivid faith in powder and gold. Who, then,
will bear for a moment with an ignorant,
pacific adventurer, without even a gun?</p>

<p>He may, however, seem even more than
bold in one thing, and that is in describing
regions where the wise and the imaginative
and the immortal have been before him.
For that he never can be contrite enough.
And yet, in spite of the renown of these
regions, he can present neither map nor chart
of them, latitude nor longitude: can affirm
only that their frontier stretches just this
side of Dream; that they border Impossibility;
lie parallel with Peace.</p>

<p>But since it is his, and only his, journey
and experiences, his wonder and delight in
these lands that he tells of&mdash;a mere microcosm,
as it were&mdash;he entreats forgiveness of
all who love them and their people as much
as he loves them&mdash;scarce &quot;on this side
idolatry.&quot;</p>

<span><i>Oh, what land is the Land of Dream?</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;WILLIAM BLAKE.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>I lived, then, in the great world once, in
an old, roomy house beside a little wood of
larches, with an aunt of the name of Sophia.
My father and mother died a few days
before my fourth birthday, so that I can
conjure up only fleeting glimpses of their
faces by which to remember what love was
then lost to me. Both were youthful at death,
but my Aunt Sophia was ever elderly. She
was keen, and just, seldom less than kind;
but a child was to her something of a little
animal, and it was nothing more. In consequence,
well fed, warmly clad, and in
freedom, I grew up almost in solitude between
my angels, hearkening with how
simple a curiosity to that everlasting warfare
of persuasion and compulsion, terror
and delight.</p>

<p>Which of them it was that guided me,
before even I could read, to the little room
dark with holly trees that had been of
old my uncle's library, I know not. Perhaps
at the instant it chanced there had
fallen a breathless truce between them, and
I being solitary, my own instinct took me.
But having once found that pictured haven,
I had found somewhat of content.</p>

<p>I think half my youthful days passed in
that low, book-walled chamber. The candles
I burned through those long years of evening
would deck Alps' hugest fir; the dust I
disturbed would very easily fill again the
measure that some day shall contain my
own; and the small studious thumbmarks
that paced, as if my footprints, leaf by leaf
of that long journey, might be the history
of life's experience in little,&mdash;from clearer, to
clear, to faint&mdash;how very faint at last!</p>

<p>I do not remember ever to have been
discovered in this retreat. I was (by nature)
prompt at meals, and wary to be in bed at
my hour, however transitory its occupation
might be. Indeed, I very well recollect
dawn painting the page my eyes dwelt on,
surprising me with its mystery and stealth
in a house as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>Thus entertained then by insubstantial
society I grew up, and began to be old,
before I had yet learned age is disastrous.
And it was there, in that cold, bright
chamber, one snowy twilight, first suddenly
awoke in me an imperative desire for
distant lands.</p>

<p>Even while little else than a child I had
begun to cast my mind to travel. I doubt
if ever Columbus suffered such vexation
from an itch to be gone.</p>

<p>But whither?</p>

<p>Now, it seemed clear to me after long
brooding and musing that however beautiful
were these regions of which I never wearied
to read, and however wild and faithful and
strange and lovely the people of the books,
somewhere the former must remain yet,
somewhere, in immortality serene, dwell they
whom so many had spent life in dreaming
of, and writing about.</p>

<p>In fact, take it for all in all, what could
these authors have been at, if they laboured
from dawn to midnight, from laborious
midnight to dawn, merely to tell of what
never was, and never by any chance could
be? It was heaven-clear to me, solitary
and a dreamer; let me but gain the key,
I would soon unlock that Eden garden-door.
Somewhere yet, I was sure, Imogen's
mountains lift their chill summits into
heaven; over haunted sea-sands Ariel flits;
at his webbed casement next the stars
Faust covets youth, till the last trump shall
ring him out of dream.</p>

<p>It was on a blue March morning, with
all the trees of my aunt's woods in a pale-green
tumult of wind, that, quite unwittingly,
I set out on a journey that has not yet
come to an end.</p>

<p>There was a hint in the air at my waking,
I fancied, not quite of mere earth, the perfume
of the banners of Flora, of the mould
where in melting snow the crocus blows. I
looked from my window, and the western
clouds drew gravely and loftily in the illimitable
air towards the whistling house.
Strange trumpets pealed in the wind. Even
my poor, aged Aunt Sophia had changed
with the universal change; her great,
solitary face reminded me of some long-forgotten
April.</p>

<p>And a little before eleven I saddled my
uncle's old mare Rosinante (poor female
jade to bear a name so glorious!), and rode
out (as for how many fruitless seasons I
had ridden out!), down the stony, nettle-narrowed
path that led for a secret mile or
more, beneath lindens, towards the hills.</p>

<span><i>Still thou art blest compared wi' me!</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;ROBERT BURNS.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>It is to be wondered at that in so bleak a
wind I could possibly fall into reverie. But
the habit was rooted deep in me; Rosinante
was prosaic and trustworthy; the country
for miles around familiar to me as the palm
of my hand. Yet so deeply was I involved,
and so steadily had we journeyed on, that
when at last I lifted my eyes with a great
sigh that was almost a sob, I found myself
in a place utterly unknown to me.</p>

<p>But more inexplicable yet, not only was
the place strange, but, by some incredible
wizardry, Rosinante seemed to have carried
me out of a March morning, blue and
tumultuous and bleak, into the grey, sweet
mist of a midsummer dawn.</p>

<p>I found that we were ambling languidly
on across a green and level moor. Far
away, whether of clouds or hills I could not
yet tell, rose cold towers and pinnacles into
the last darkness of night. Above us in the
twilight invisible larks climbed among the
daybeams, singing as they flew. A thick dew
lay in beads on stick and stalk. We were
alone with the fresh wind of morning and the
clear pillars of the East.</p>

<p>On I went, heedless, curious, marvelling;
my only desire to press forward to the goal
whereto destiny was directing me. I suppose
after this we had journeyed about an hour,
and the risen sun was on the extreme verge
of the gilded horizon, when I espied betwixt
me and the deep woods that lay in the
distance a little child walking.</p>

<p>She, at any rate, was not a stranger to this
moorland. Indeed, something in her carriage,
in the grey cloak she wore, in her light, insistent
step, in the old lantern she carried, in
the shrill little song she or the wind seemed
singing, for a moment half impelled me to
turn aside. Even Rosinante pricked forward
her ears, and stooped her gentle face to view
more closely this light traveller. And she
pawed the ground with her great shoe, and
gnawed her bit when I drew rein and leaned
forward in the saddle to speak to the child.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there any path here, little girl, that I
may follow?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;No path at all,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;But how then do strangers find their way
across the moor?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>She debated with herself a moment. &quot;Some
by the stars, and some by the moon,&quot; she
answered.</p>

<p>&quot;By the moon!&quot; I cried. &quot;But at day,
what then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, then, sir,&quot; she said, &quot;they can
see.&quot;</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at her demure
little answers. &quot;Why!&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;what
a worldly little woman! And what is your
name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They call me Lucy Gray,&quot; she said,
looking up into my face. I think my heart
almost ceased to beat.</p>

<p>&quot;Lucy Gray!&quot; I repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said most seriously, as if to
herself, &quot;in all this snow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Snow,'&quot; I said&mdash;&quot;this is dewdrops shining,
not snow.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at me without flinching. &quot;How
else can mother see how I am lost?&quot; she
said.</p>

<p>&quot;Why!&quot; said I, &quot;how else?&quot; not knowing
how to reach her bright belief. &quot;And what
are those thick woods called over there?&quot;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &quot;There is no name,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p>&quot;But you have a name&mdash;Lucy Gray; and
you started out&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;one
winter's day at dusk, and wandered on and
on, on and on, the snow falling in the dark,
till&mdash;Do you remember?&quot;</p>

<p>She stood quite still, her small, serious
face full to the east, striving with far-off
dreams. And a merry little smile passed
over her lips. &quot;That will be a long time
since,&quot; she said, &quot;and I must be off home.&quot;
And as if it had been but an apparition of
my eyes that had beset and deluded me, she
was gone; and I found myself sitting astride
in the full brightness of the sun's first beams,
alone.</p>

<p>What omen was this, then, that I should
meet first a phantom on my journey? One
thing only was clear: Rosinante could trust
to her five wits better than I to mine. So
leaving her to take what way she pleased,
I rode on, till at length we approached the
woods I had descried. Presently we were
jogging gently down into a deep and misty
valley flanked by bracken and pines, from
which issued into the crisp air of morning
a most delicious aromatic smell, that seemed
at least to prove this valley not far remote
from Araby.</p>

<p>I do not think I was disturbed, though I
confess to having been a little amazed to see
how profound this valley was into which we
were descending, yet how swiftly climbed the
sun, as if to pace with us so that we should
not be in shadow, howsoever fast we journeyed.
I was astonished to see flowers of other
seasons than summer by the wayside, and to
hear in June, for no other month could bear
such green abundance, the thrush sing with
a February voice. Here too, almost at my
right hand, perched a score or more of robins,
bright-dyed, warbling elvishly in chorus as if
the may-boughs whereon they sat were white
with hoarfrost and not buds. Birds also
unknown to me in voice and feather I saw,
and little creatures in fur, timid yet not wild;
fruits, even, dangled from the trees, as if, like
the bramble, blossom and seed could live here
together and prosper.</p>

<p>Yet why should I be distracted by these
things, thought I. I remembered Maundeville
and Hithlodaye, Sindbad and Gulliver, and
many another citizen of Thule, and was reassured.
A man must either believe what
he sees, or see what he believes; I know no
other course. Why, too, should I mistrust
the bounty of the present merely for the
scarcity of the past? Not I!</p>

<p>I rode on, and it seemed had advanced
but a few miles before the sun stood overhead,
and it was noon. We were growing
weary, I think, of sheer delight: Rosinante,
with her mild face beneath its dark forelock
gazing this side, that side, at the uncustomary
landscape; and I ever peering forward beneath
my hat in eagerness to descry some living
creature a little bigger than these conies and
squirrels, to prove me yet in lands inhabited.
But the sun was wheeling headlong, and the
stillness of late afternoon on the woods, when,
dusty and parched and heavy, we came to a
break in the thick foliage, and presently to
a green gate embowered in box.</p>

<p>I dismounted and, with the nose of my
beast in my bosom, stood awhile gazing, in
the half-dream weariness brings, across the
valley at the dense forests that covered the
hills. And while thus standing, doubtful
whether to knock at the little gate or to
ride on, it began to open, and a great particoloured
dog looked out on us. There was
certainly something unusual in the aspect of
this animal, for though he lifted on us grave
and sagacious eyes, he scarcely seemed to
see us, manifested neither pleasure nor disapproval,
neither wagged his tail to give us
welcome nor yawned to display his armament.
He seemed a kind of dream-dog,
a dog one sees without zeal, and sees again
partly with the eye, but most in recollection.</p>

<p>Thus however we stood, stranger, horse,
and dog, till a morose voice called somewhere
from beyond, &quot;Pilot, sir, come here,
Pilot.&quot; Semi-dog or no, he knew his master.
Whereupon, tying up my dejected Rosinante
to a ring in the gateway, I followed boldly
after &quot;Pilot&quot; into that sequestered garden.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, he had disappeared&mdash;down
a thick green alley to the left, I
supposed. So I went forward by a clearer
path, and when I had advanced a few paces,
met face to face a lady whose dark eyes
seemed strangely familiar to me.</p>

<p>She was evidently a little disquieted at
meeting a stranger so unceremoniously, but
stood her ground like a small, black, fearless
note of interrogation.</p>

<p>I explained at once, therefore, as best I
could, how I came to be there: described
my journey, my bewilderment, and how
that I knew not into what country nor
company fate had beguiled me, except that
the one was beautiful, and the other in
some delightful way familiar, and I begged
her to tell me where I really was, and how
far from home, and of whom I was now
beseeching forgiveness.</p>

<p>Her thoughts followed my every word,
passing upon her face like shadows on the
sea. I have never seen a listener so completely
still and so completely engrossed in
listening. And when I had finished, she
looked aside with a transient, half-sly smile,
and glanced at me again covertly, so that I
could not see herself for seeing her eyes;
and she laughed lightly.</p>

<p>&quot;It is indeed a strange journey,&quot; she replied.
&quot;But I fear I cannot in the least
direct you. I have never ventured my own
self beyond the woods, lest&mdash;I should penetrate
too far. But you are tired and hungry.
Will you please walk on a few steps till
you come to a stone seat? My name is
Rochester&mdash;Jane Rochester&quot;&mdash;she glanced up
between the hollies with a sigh that was all
but laughter&mdash;&quot;Jane Eyre, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>I went on as she had bidden, and seated
myself before an old, white, many-windowed
house, squatting, like an owl at noon, beneath
its green covert. In a few minutes
the great dog with dripping jowl passed
almost like reality, and after him his mistress,
and on her arm her master, Mr.
Rochester.</p>

<p>There seemed a night of darkness in that
scarred face, and stars unearthly bright.
He peered dimly at me, leaning heavily on
Jane's arm, his left hand plunged into the
bosom of his coat. And when he was come
near, he lifted his hat to me with a kind
of Spanish gravity.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this the gentleman, Jane?&quot; he enquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's young!&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p>&quot;For otherwise he would not be here,&quot;
she replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Was the gate bolted, then?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Rochester desires to know if you
had the audacity, sir, to scale his garden
wall,&quot; Jane said, turning sharply on me.
&quot;Shall I count the strawberries, sir?&quot; she
added over her shoulder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jane, Jane!&quot; he exclaimed testily. &quot;I
have no wish to be uncivil, sir. We are
not of the world&mdash;a mere dark satellite. I
am dim; and suspicious of strangers, as this
one treacherous eye should manifest. I'll
but ask your name, sir,&mdash;there are yet a
few names left, once pleasing to my ear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Brocken, sir&mdash;Henry Brocken,&quot;
I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;And&mdash;did you walk? Pah! there's the
mystery! God knows how else you could
have come, unless you are a modern Ganymede.
Where then's your aquiline steed,
sir? We have no neighbours here&mdash;none
to stare, and pry, and prate, and slander.&quot;</p>

<p>I informed him that I was as ignorant as
he what power had spirited me to his house,
but that so far as obvious means went, my
old horse was probably by this time fast
asleep beside the green gate at which I had
entered. Jane stood on tip-toe and whispered
in his ear, and, nodding imperiously
at him, withdrew into the house.</p>

<p>Complete silence fell between us after
her departure. The woods stood dark and
motionless in the yellow evening light.
There was no sound of wind or water,
no sound of voices or footsteps; only far
away the clear, scarce-audible warbling of a
sleepy bird.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; Mr. Rochester said suddenly,
&quot;I am bidden invite you to pass the night
here. There are stranger inhabitants than
Mr. and Mrs. Rochester in these regions
you have by some means strayed into&mdash;wilder
denizens, by much; for youth's
seraphic finding. Not for mine, sir, I vow.
Depart again in the morning, if you will:
we shall neither of us be displeased by then
to say farewell, I dare say. I do not seek
company. My obscure shell is enough.&quot;
I rose. &quot;Sit down&mdash;sit down again, my dear
sir; there's no mischief in the truth between
two men of any world, I suppose, assuredly
not of this. My wife will see to your comfort.
There! hushie now, here he floats;
sit still, sit still&mdash;I hear his wings. It is my
'Four Evangels,' sir!&quot;</p>

<p>It was a sleek blackbird that had alighted
and now set to singing on the topmost twig
of a lofty pear-tree near by; and with his
first note Jane reappeared. And while we
listened, unstirring, to that rich, undaunted
voice, I had good opportunity to observe
her, and not, I think, without her knowledge,
not even without her approval.</p>

<p>This, then, was the face that had returned
wrath for wrath, remorse for remorse, passion
for passion to that dark egotist Jane in the
looking-glass. Yet who, thought I, could be
else than beautiful with eyes that seemed to
hide in fleeting cloud a flame as pure as
amber? The arch simplicity of her gown,
her small, narrow hands, the exquisite cleverness
of mouth and chin, the lovely courage
and sincerity of that yet-childish brow&mdash;it
seemed even Mr. Rochester's &quot;Four Evangels&quot;
out of his urgent rhetoric was summoning
with reiterated persuasions, &quot;Jane Eyre, Jane
Eyre, Jane Eyre, Ja ... ne!&quot;</p>

<p>Light faded from the woods; a faint
wind blew cold upon our faces. Jane took
Mr. Rochester's hand and looked into his
face.</p>

<p>She turned to me. &quot;Will you come in,
Mr. Brocken? I have seen that your horse
is made quite easy. He was fast asleep,
poor fellow, as you surmised; and, I think,
dreaming; for when I proffered him a lump
of sugar, he thrust his nose into my face
and breathed as if I were a peck of corn.
The candles are lit, sir; supper is ready.&quot;</p>

<p>We went in slowly, and Jane bolted the
door. &quot;But who it is that can be bolted
out,&quot; she said, &quot;I know not; though there's
much to bolt in. I have stood here, Mr.
Brocken, on darker nights as still as this,
and have heard what seemed to be the sea
breaking, far away, leagues upon leagues
beyond the forests&mdash;the gush forward, the
protracted, heavy retreat,&mdash;listened till I
could have wept to think that it was only
my own poor furious heart beating. You
may imagine, then, I push the bolts home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why, Jane&mdash;why?&quot; cried Mr.
Rochester incredulously. &quot;Violent fancies,
child!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, sir, it was, I say, not the sea I
heard, but a trickling tide one icy tap
might stay, if it found but entry there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You talk wildly, Jane&mdash;wildly, wildly;
the air's afloat with listeners; so it seems,
so it seems. Had I but one clear lamp
in this dark face!&quot;</p>

<p>We sat down in the candle-lit twilight
to supper. It was to me like the supper
of a child, taken at peace in the clear
beams, ere he descend into the shadow of
sleep.</p>

<p>They sat, try as I would not to observe
them, hand touching hand throughout the
meal. But to me it was as if one might
sit to eat before a great mountain ruffled
with pines, and perpetually clamorous with
torrents. All that Mr. Rochester said, every
gesture, these were but the ghosts of words
and movements. Behind them, gloomy, imperturbable,
withdrawn, slumbered a strange,
smouldering power. I began to see how
very hotly Jane must love him, she who
loved above all things storm, the winds of
the equinox, the illimitable night-sky.</p>

<p>She begged him to take a little wine with
me, and filled his glass till it burned like
a ruby between their hands.</p>

<p>&quot;It paints both our hands!&quot; she cried
glancing up at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Janet,&quot; he answered; &quot;but where
is yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what goal will you make for when
you leave us,&quot; she enquired of me. &quot;<i>Is</i>
there anywhere else?&quot; she added, lifting
her slim eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall put trust in Chance,&quot; I replied,
&quot;which at least is steadfast in change. So
long as it does not guide me back, I care
not how far forward I go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are right,&quot; she answered; &quot;that is
a puissant battlecry, here and hereafter.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Rochester rose hastily from his chair.
&quot;The candles irk me, Jane. I would like to
be alone. Excuse me, sir.&quot; He left the room.</p>

<p>Jane lifted a dark curtain and beckoned
me to bring the lights. She sat down
before a little piano and desired me to sit
beside her. And while she played, I know
not what, but only it seemed old, well-remembered
airs her mood suggested, she
asked me many questions.</p>

<p>&quot;And am I indeed only like that poor
mad thing you thought Jane Eyre?&quot; she
said, &quot;or did you read between?&quot;</p>

<p>I answered that it was not her words,
not even her thoughts, not even her poetry
that was to me Jane Eyre.</p>

<p>&quot;What then is left of me?&quot; she enquired,
stooping her eyes over the keys and smiling
darkly. &quot;Am I indeed so evanescent, a
wintry wraith?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;Jane Eyre is left.&quot;</p>

<p>She pressed her lips together. &quot;I see,&quot; she
said brightly. &quot;But then, was I not detestable
too? so stubborn, so wilful, so demented,
so&mdash;vain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were vain,&quot; I answered, &quot;because&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; she said, and the melody died
out, and the lower voices of her music
complained softly on.</p>

<p>&quot;For a barrier,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;A barrier?&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes,&quot; I said, &quot;a barrier against
cant, and flummery, and coldness, and
pride, and against&mdash;why, against your own
vanity too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's really very clever&mdash;penetrating,&quot;
she said; &quot;and I really desired to know, not
because I did not know already, but to know
I knew all. You are a perspicacious observer,
Mr. Brocken; and to be that is to be alive
in a world of the moribund. But then
too how high one must soar at times; for
one must ever condescend in order to observe
faithfully. At any rate, to observe all one
must range at an altitude above all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so,&quot; I said, &quot;you have taken your
praise from me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you are a man, and I a woman:
we look with differing eyes, each sex to the
other, and perceive by contrast. Else&mdash;why,
how else could you forgive my presumption?
He sees me as an eagle sees the creeping
tortoise. I see him as the moon the sun,
never weary of gazing. I borrow his radiance
to observe him by. But I weary you with
my garrulous tongue.... Have you no plan
at all in your journey? 'Tis not the dangers,
but to me the endless restlessness of such a
venture&mdash;that 'Oh, where shall wisdom be
found?'... Will you not pause?&mdash;stay with
us a few days to consider again this rash
journey? To each his world: it is surely
perilous to transgress its fixed boundaries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; I cried, rather arrogantly
perhaps. &quot;The sorcery that lured me hither
may carry me as lightly back. But I have
tasted honey and covet the hive.&quot;</p>

<p>She glanced sidelong at me with that
stealthy gravity that lay under all her lightness.</p>

<p>&quot;That delicious Rosinante!&quot; she exclaimed
softly.... &quot;And I really believe too <i>I</i> must
be the honey&mdash;or is it Mr. Rochester? Ah!
Mr. Brocken, they call it wasp-honey when
it is so bitter that it blisters the lips.&quot; She
talked on gaily, as if she had forgotten I was
but a stranger until now. Yet none the less
she perceived presently my eyes ever and
again fixed upon the little brooch of faintest
gold hair at her throat, and flinched and
paled, playing on in silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Take the whole past,&quot; she continued
abruptly, &quot;spread it out before you, with all
its just defeats, all its broken faith, and overweening
hopes, its beauty, and fear, and love,
and its loss&mdash;its loss; then turn and say: this,
this only, this duller heart, these duller eyes,
this contumacious spirit is all that is left&mdash;myself.
Oh! who could wish to one so dear
a destiny so dark?&quot; She rose hastily from
the piano. &quot;Did I hear Mr. Rochester's step
by the window?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>I crossed the room and looked out into
the night. The brightening moon hung
golden in the dark clearness of the sky.
Mr. Rochester stood motionless, Napoleon-wise,
beneath the black, unstirring foliage.
And before I could turn, Jane had begun to
sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Jane's was not a rich voice, nor very sweet,
and yet I fancied no other voice than this
could plead and argue quite so clearly and
with such nimble insistency&mdash;neither of bird,
nor child, nor brook; because, I suppose, it
was the voice of Jane Eyre, and all that was
Jane's seemed Jane's only.</p>

<p>The music ceased, the accompaniment died
away; but Mr. Rochester stood immobile
yet&mdash;a little darker night in that much
deeper. When I turned, Jane was gone
from the room. I sat down, my face towards
the still candles, as one who is awake,
yet dreams on. The faint scent of the earth
through the open window; the heavy, sombre
furniture; the daintiness and the alertness in
the many flowers and few womanly gew-gaws:
these too I shall remember in a
tranquillity that cannot change.</p>

<p>A sudden, trembling glimmer at the window
lit the garden and, instantaneously, the
distant hills; lit also the figures of Jane and
Mr. Rochester beneath the trees. They
entered the house, and once more Jane drew
the bolts against that phantom fear. A tinge
of scarlet stood in her cheeks, an added
lustre in her eyes. They were strange lovers,
these two&mdash;like frost upon a cypress tree;
yet summer lay all around us.</p>

<p>I bade them good night and ascended to
the little room prepared for me. There was
a great pincushion on the sprigged and portly
toilet table, and I laboured till the constellations
had changed beyond my window, in
printing from a box of tiny pins upon that
lavendered mound, &quot;Ave, Ave, atque Vale!&quot;</p>

<p>Far in the night a dreadful sound woke
me. I rose and looked out of the window,
and heard again, deep and reverberating,
Pilot baying I know not what light minions
of the moon. The Great Bear wheeled
faintly clear in the dark zenith, but the
borders of the east were grey as glass; and
far away a fierce hound was answering from
his echo-place in the gloom, as if the dread
dog of Acheron kept post upon the hills.</p>

<p>A light tap woke me in the sunlight, and
a lighter voice. Mr. Rochester took breakfast
with us in a gloomy old dressing-room,
moody and taciturn, unpacified by sleep.
But Jane, whimsical and deft, had tied a
yellow ribbon in the darkness of her hair.</p>

<p>Rosinante awaited me at the little green
gate, eyeing forlornly the steep valley at her
feet. And I rode on. The gate was shut
on me; and Mr. Rochester again, perhaps,
at his black ease.</p>

<p>I had jogged on, with that peculiar gravity
age brings to equine hoofs, about a mile,
when the buttress of a thick wall came into
view abutting on the lane, and perched
thereon what at first I deemed a coloured
figment of the mist that festooned the
branches and clung along the turf. But
when I drew near I saw it was indeed
a child, pink and gold and palest blue.
And she raised changeling hands at me, and
laughed and danced and chattered like the
drops upon a waterfall; and clear as if a
tiny bell had jingled I heard her cry.</p>

<p>And my heart smote me heavily since I
had of my own courtesy not remembered
Ad&egrave;le.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;THOMAS NASH.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>It was yet early, and refreshing in the
chequered shade. We plodded earnestly after
our gaunt shadow in the dust, and ever downward,
till at last we drew so near to the
opposite steep that I could well nigh count
its pines.</p>

<p>It was about the hour when birds seek
shade and leave but few among their fellows
to sing, that at a stone's throw from the
foot of the hill I came to where a faint
bridle-path diverged. And since it was
smooth with moss, and Rosinante haply
tired of pebbles; since any but the direct
road seems ever the more delectable, I too
turned aside, and broke into the woods
through which this path meandered.</p>

<p>Maybe it is because all woods are enchanted
that the path seemed more than many miles
long. Often too we loitered, or stood, head
by head, to listen, or to watch what might be
after all only wings, mere sunbeams. Shall
I say, then, that it began to be thorny, and,
where the thorns were, pale with roses, when
at length the knitted boughs gradually drew
asunder, and I looked down between twitching,
hairy ears upon a glade so green and
tranquil, I deemed it must be the Garden of
the Hesperides?</p>

<p>And because there ran a very welcome
brook of water through this glade, I left
Rosinante to follow whithersoever a sweet
tooth might dictate, and climbed down into
the weedy coolness at the waterbrink.</p>

<p>I confess I laughed to see so puckered a
face as mine in the clear blue of the flowing
water. But I dipped my hands and my
head into the cold shallows none the less
pleasantly, and was casting about for a deeper
pool where I might bathe unscorned of the
noonday, when I heard a light laughter behind
me, and, turning cautiously, perceived under
the further shadow of the glade three ladies
sitting.</p>

<p>Not even vanity could persuade me that
they were laughing at anything more grotesque
than myself, so, putting a bold face
on matters so humiliating, I sauntered as
carelessly and loftily as I dared in their
direction. My courage seemed to abash
them a little; they gathered back their petticoats
like birds about to fly. But at hint
of a titter, they all three began gaily laughing
again till their eyes sparkled brighter than
ever, and their cheeks seemed shadows of
the roses above their heads.</p>

<p>&quot;Ladies,&quot; I began gravely, &quot;I have left my
horse, that is very old and very thirsty, above
in the wood. Is there any path I may discover
by which she may reach the water
without offence?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is she very old?&quot; said one.</p>

<p>&quot;She is very old,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;But is she very thirsty?&quot; said another.</p>

<p>&quot;She is perhaps very thirsty,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps!&quot; cried they all.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, ladies,&quot; I replied, &quot;being by
nature of a timid tongue, and compelled to
say something, and having nothing apt to
say, I remembered my old Rosinante above
in the wood.&quot;</p>

<p>They glanced each at each, and glanced
again at me.</p>

<p>&quot;But there is no path down that is not
steep,&quot; said the fairest of the three.</p>

<p>&quot;There never was a path, not even, we
fear, for a traveller on foot,&quot; continued the
second.</p>

<p>I waited in silence a moment. &quot;Forgive
me, then,&quot; I said; &quot;I will offend no longer.&quot;</p>

<p>But this seemed far from their design.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, being come,&quot; began the fairest
again, &quot;Julia thinks Fortune must have
brought you. Are we not all between Fortune's
finger and thumb?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If pinching is to prove anything,&quot; said
the other.</p>

<p>&quot;And Fortune is fickle, too,&quot; added Julia&mdash;&quot;that's
early wisdom; but not quite so fickle
as you would wish to show her. Here we
have sat in these mortal glades ever since our
poor Herrick died. And here it seems we
are like to sit till he rises again. It is all so&mdash;dubious.
But since Electra has invited you
to rest awhile, will you not really rest? There
is shade as deep, and fruit to refresh you, in
a little arbour yonder. Perhaps even Anthea
will dip out of her weeping awhile if she hears
that ... a poor old thirsty horse is tethered in
the woods.&quot;</p>

<p>They rose up together with a prolonged
rustling as of a peacock displaying his plumes;
and I found myself irretrievably their captive.</p>

<p>Moreover, even if they were but sylphs
and fantasies of the morning, they were
fantasies lovely as even their master had
portrayed; while the dells through which they
led me were green and deep and white and
golden with buds.</p>

<p>It was now, I suppose, about the middle of
the morning, yet though the sun was high,
his heat was that of dawn. Dawn lingered
in the shadows, as snow when winter is over
and gone, and dwelt among the sunbeams.
Dew lay heavy on the grass, as the dainty
heels of my captresses testified, yet they trod
lightly upon daisies wide-open to the blue
sky, while daffadowndillies stooped in a silence
broken only by their laughter.</p>

<p>We came presently to a little stone summerhouse
or arbour, enclustered with leaves
and flowers of ivy and convolvulus, wherein
two great dishes of cherries stood and bowls
of honeycomb and sillabub.</p>

<p>There we sat down; but they kept me
close too in the midst of the arbour, where
perhaps I was not so ill-content to be as I
should like to profess. How then could I else
than bob for cherries as often as I dared, and
prove my wit to conceal my hunger?</p>

<p>&quot;And now, Sir Traveller,&quot; said she of the
sparkling eyes, named Dianeme, &quot;since we
have got you safe, tell us of all we have never
heard or seen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And oh! are we forgot?&quot; cried Electra,
laying a lip upon a cherry.</p>

<p>&quot;There's not a poet in his teens but warbles
of you morn, noon, and night,&quot; I answered.
&quot;There's not a lover mad, young, true, and
tender, but borrows your azure, and your
rubies, and your roses, and your stars, to
deck his sweetheart's name with.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Boys perhaps,&quot; cried Julia softly, &quot;but
<i>men</i> soon forget.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Youth never,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Why 'Youth'?&quot; said Dianeme. &quot;Herrick
was not always young.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but all men once were young, please
God,&quot; I said, &quot;and youth is the only 'once'
that's worth remembrance. Youth with the
heart of youth adores you, ladies; because,
when dreams come thick upon them, they
catch your flying laughter in the woods.
When the sun is sunk, and the stars kindle in
the sky, then your eyes haunt the twilight.
You come in dreams, and mock the waking.
You the mystery; you the bravery and
danger; you the long-sought; you the never-won;
memories, hopes, songs ere the earth
is mute. You will always be loved, believe
me, O bright ladies, till youth fades, turns,
and loves no more.&quot; And I gazed amazed
on cherries of such potency as these.</p>

<p>&quot;But once, sir,&quot; said Julia timidly, &quot;we
were not only loved but <i>told</i> we were loved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the pleasure else?&quot; cried
Dianeme.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides,&quot; said Electra, &quot;Anthea says if
we might but find where Styx flows one
draught&mdash;my mere palmful&mdash;would be
sweeter than all the poetry ever writ, save
some.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is idle,&quot; cried Dianeme; &quot;Herrick
himself admired us most on paper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And ink makes a cross even of a kiss,
that is very well known,&quot; said Julia.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said I, &quot;all men have eyes; few
see. Most men have tongues: there is but
one Robin Herrick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell you a secret,&quot; said Dianeme.</p>

<p>And as if a bird of the air had carried
her voice, it seemed a hush fell on sky and
greenery.</p>

<p>&quot;We are but fairy-money all,&quot; she said,
&quot;an envy to see. Take us!&mdash;'tis all dry
leaves in the hand. Herrick stole the
honey, and the bees he killed. Blow never
so softly on the tinder, it flames&mdash;and dies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard once,&quot; said Electra, with but a
thought of pride, &quot;that had I lived a little,
little earlier, I might have been the Duchess
of Malfi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I too, Flatterer,&quot; cried Julia, &quot;I
too&mdash;Desdemona slain by a blackamoor. To
some it is the cold hills and the valleys
'green and sad,' and the sea-birds' wailing,&quot;
she continued in a low, strange voice, &quot;and
to some the glens of heather, and the
mountain-brooks, and the rowans. But,
come to an end, what are we all? This
man's eyes will tell ye! I would give
white and red, nectar and snow and roses,
and all the similes that ever were for&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; said I.</p>

<p>&quot;I think, for Robin Herrick,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>It was a lamentable confession, for that
said, gravity fled away; and Electra fetched
out a lute from a low cupboard in the
arbour, and while she played Julia sang to
a sober little melody I seemed to know of
old:</p>

Wherefore I heard, far away as it were,
the plucking of the strings, and a voice
betwixt dream and wake sing:</p>

<p>For then, so insidious was the music,
and not quite of this earth the voice, my
senses altogether forsook me, and I fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Would that I could remember much else!
But I confess it is the heart remembers,
not the poor, pestered brain that has so
many thoughts and but one troubled thinker.
Indeed, were I now to be asked&mdash;Were
the fingers cold of these bright ladies?
Were their eyes blue, or hazel, or brown?
or, haply, were Dianeme's that incomparable,
dark, sparkling grey? Wore Julia azure,
and Electra white? And was that our
poet wrote our poet's only, or truly theirs,
and so even more lovely?&mdash;I fear I could
not tell.</p>

<p>I fell asleep; and when I awoke no lute
was sounding. I was alone; and the arbour
a little house of gloom on the borders
of evening. I caught up yet one more
handful of cherries, and stumbled out, heavy
and dim, into a pale-green firmanent of
buds and glow-worms, to seek the poor
Rosinante I had so heedlessly deserted.</p>

<p>But I was gone but a little way when I
was brought suddenly to a standstill by
another sound that in the hush of the garden,
in the bright languor after sleep, went to my
heart: it was as if a child were crying.</p>

<p>I pushed through a thick and aromatic
clump of myrtles, and peering between the
narrow leaves, perceived the cold, bright face
of a little marble god beneath willows; and,
seated upon a starry bank near by, one whom
by the serpentry of her hair and the shadow
of her lips I knew to be Anthea.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you weeping?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;I was imitating a little brook,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;It is late; the bat is up; yet you are
alone,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Pan will protect me,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;And nought else?&quot;</p>

<p>She turned her face away. &quot;None,&quot; she
said. &quot;I live among shadows. There was
a world, I dreamed, where autumn follows
summer, and after autumn, winter. Here it
is always June, despite us both.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, then, would you have?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ask him,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>But the little god looking sidelong was
mute in his grey regard.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you not run away? What keeps
you here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ask many questions, stranger! Who
can escape? To live is to remember. To
die&mdash;oh, who would forget! Even had I been
weeping, and not merely mocking time away,
would my tears be of Lethe at my mouth's
corners? No,&quot; said Anthea, &quot;why feign
and lie? All I am is but a memory lovely
with regret.&quot;</p>

<p>She rose, and the myrtles concealed her
from me. And I, in the midst of the dusk
where the tiny torches burned sadly&mdash;I turned
to the sightless eyes of that smiling god.</p>

<p>What he knew, being blind, yet smiling, I
seemed to know then. But that also I have
forgotten.</p>

<p>I whistled softly and clearly into the air,
and a querulous voice answered me from afar&mdash;the
voice of a grasshopper&mdash;Rosinante's.</p>

<p>But even then she was difficult finding, so
cunningly had ivy and blackberry and bindweed
woven snares for the trespasser's foot.</p>

<p>But at last&mdash;not far from where we had
parted&mdash;I found her, a pillar of smoke in the
first shining of the moon. She turned large,
smouldering eyes on me, her mane in elf
locks, her flanks heaving and wet, her forelock
frizzed like a colt's. Yet she showed
only pleasure at seeing me, and so evident
a desire to unburden the day's history, that
I almost wished I might be Balaam awhile,
and she&mdash;Dapple!</p>

<p>It would be idle to attempt to ride through
these thick, glimmering brakes. The darkness
was astir. And as the moon above the
valley brightened, casting pale beams upon
the folded roses and drooping branches, if
populous dream did not deceive me, a tiny
multitude was afoot in the undergrowth&mdash;small
horns winding, wee tapers burning.</p>

<p>Presently as with Rosinante's nose at my
shoulder we pushed slowly forward, a nightingale
burst close against my ear into so
passionate a descant I thought I should be
gooseflesh to the end of my days.</p>

<p>The heedless tumult of her song seemed
to give courage to sounds and voices much
fainter. Soon a lovelit rival in some distant
thicket broke into song, and far and near their
voices echoed above the elfin din of timbrel and
fife and hunting-horn. I began to wish the
moon away that dazzled my eyes, yet could
not muffle my ears.</p>

<p>In the heavy-laden boughs dim lanterns
burned. There, indeed, when we dipped
into the deeper umbrage of some loftier tree,
I espied the pattering hosts&mdash;creatures my
Dianeme might have threaded for a bangle,
yet breeched and armed and fiercely martial.</p>

<p>Down, too, in a watery dell of harts-tongue,
around the root of a swelling
fungus, a lovely company floated of an insubstantiality
subtile as taper-smoke, and of a
beauty as remote as the babes in children's
eyes.</p>

<p>We passed unheeded. Four bearded hoofs
rose and fell upon the moss with all the
circumspection snorting Rosinante could compass.
But one might as well go snaring
moonbeams as dream to crush such airy
beings. Ever and again a gossamer company
would soar like a spider on his magic thread,
and float with a whisper of remotest music
past my ear; or some bolder pigmy, out
of the leaves we brushed in passing, skip
suddenly across the rusty amphitheatre of
my saddle into the further covert.</p>

<p>So we wandered on, baffled and confused,
through a hundred pathless glens and dells till
already gold had begun to dim the swelling
moon's bright silver, and by the freshness
and added sweetness of the air it seemed dawn
must be near, when, on a sudden, a harsh,
preposterous voice broke on my ear, and such
a see-saw peal of laughter as I have never
tittered in sheer fellowship with before, or
since. We stood listening, and the voice
broke out again.</p>

<p>&quot;Tittany&mdash;nay, Tittany, you'll crack my
sides with laughing. Have again at you! love
your master and you'll wax nimble. Bottom
will learn you all. Trust Time and Bottom;
though in sooth your weeny Majesty is
something less than natural. Drive thy
straw deeper, Mounsieur Mustardseed! there
squats a pestilent sweet notion in that
chamber could spellican but set him capering.
Prithee your mousemilk hand on this
smooth brow, mistress! Your nectar throbbeth
like a blacksmith's anvil. Master Moth,
draw you these bristling lashes down, they
mirk the stars and call yon nothing Quince
to mind&mdash;a vain, official knave, in and out,
to and fro, play or pleasure; and old Sam
Snout, the wanton! Lad's days and all&mdash;'twas
life, Tittany; and I was ever foremost.
They'd bob and crook to me like spaniels at
a trencher. Mine was the prettiest conceit,
this way, that way, past all unravelling
till envy stretched mine ears. Now I'm old
dreams. Gone all men's joy, your worships,
since Bully Bottom took to moonshine.
Where floats your babe's-hand now, Dame
Lovepip?&quot;</p>

<p>There he lolled, immortal Bottom, propped
on a bed of asphodel and moly that seemed
to curd the moonshine; and at his side,
Titania slim and scarlet, and shimmering
like a bride-cake. The sky was dark above
the tapering trees, but here in the secret
woods light seemed to cling in flake and
scarf. And it so chanced as our two
noses leaned forward into his retreat that
Bottom's head lolled back upon its pillow,
and his bright, simple eyes stared deep into
our own.</p>

<p>&quot;Save me, ye shapes of nought,&quot; he bellowed,
&quot;no more, no more, for love's sake.
I begin to see what men call red Beelzebub,
and that's an end to all true fellowship.
Whiffle your tufted bee's wing, Signior Cobweb,
I beseech you&mdash;a little fiery devil with
four eyes floats in my brain, and flame's
a frisky bedfellow. Avaunt! avaunt ye!
Would now my true friend Bottom the
weaver were at my side. His was a courage
to make princes great. Prithee, Queen
Tittany, no more such cozening possets!&quot;</p>

<p>I drew Rosinante back into the leaves.</p>

<p>&quot;Droop now thy honeyed lids, my dearest
love!&quot; I heard a clear voice answer. &quot;There's
nought can harm thee in these silvered woods:
no bird that pipes but love incites his throat,
and never a dewdrop wells but whispers
peace!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, ay, 'tis very well, you have a gift, you
have a gift, Tittany's for twisting words to
sugarsticks. But la, there, what wots your
trickling whey of that coal-piffling Prince of
Flies! I'm Bottom the weaver, I am. He
knows not his mother's ring-finger that knows
not Nick Bottom. Back, back, ye jigging
dreams! 'Tis Puckling nods. Ha' done, ha'
done&mdash;there's no sweet sanity in an asshead
more if I quaff their elvish ... Out now ... Ha'
done, I say!&quot;</p>

<p>Then indeed he slumbered truly, this engarlanded
weaver, his lids concealing all bright
speculation, his jowl of vanity (foe of the
Philistine) at peace: and I might gaze unperceived.
The moon filled his mossy cubicle
with her untrembling beams, streamed upon
blossoms sweet and heavy as Absalom's hair,
while tiny plumes wafted into the night the
scent of thyme and meadow-sweet.</p>

<p>I know not how long they would have kept
me prisoner with their illusive music. I dared
not move, scarce wink; for much as immortality
may mollify hairiness, I had no wish to
live too frank.</p>

<p>How, also, would this weaver who slumbered
so cacophonously welcome a rival to his
realms. I say I sat still, like Echo in the
woods when none is calling; like too, I grant,
one who ached not a little after jolts and jars
and the phantasmal mists of this engendering
air. But none stirred, nor went, nor came.
So resting my hands cautiously on a little
witch's guild of toadstools that squatted cold
in shade, I lifted myself softly and stood alert.</p>

<p>And in a while out of that numerous company
stepped one whom by his primrose face
and mien I took to be Mounsieur Mustardseed,
and I followed after him.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Away with a blink of his queer green
eye over his shoulder he sauntered by a
devious path out of the dell. Forgetful of
thorn and brier, trickery and wantonness,
we clambered down after him, out of the
moonlight, into a dark, clear alley, soundless
and solitary amid these enchanted woods.</p>

<p>As I have said already, another air than
that of night was abroad in the green-grey
shadows of the woods. Yet between the
lofty and heavy-hooded pines scarce a beam
of dawn pierced downward.</p>

<p>Wider swept the avenue, but ever dusky
and utterly silent. Deeper moss couched
here; unfallen moondrops glistened; mistletoe
palely sprouted from the gnarled boughs.
Nor could I discern, though I searched
close enough, elder or ash tree or bitter rue.
We journeyed softly on till I lost all count
of time, lost, too, all guidance; for as a
flower falls had vanished Mustardseed.</p>

<p>Far away and ever increasing in volume
I heard the trembling crash of some great
water falling. What narrow isles of sky
were visible between the branches lay sunless
and still. Yet already, on a mantled
pool we journeyed softly by, the waterlily
was unfolding, the swan afloat in beauty.</p>

<p>In a dim, still light we at last slowly
descended out of the darker glade into a
garden of grey terraces and flowerless walks.
Even Rosinante seemed perturbed by the
stillness and solitude of this wild garden.
She trod with cautious foot and peering
eye the green, rainworn paths, that led us
down presently to where beneath the vault
of its trees a river flowed.</p>

<p>Surely I could not be mistaken that
here a voice was singing as if out of the
black water-deeps, so clear and hollow were
the notes. I burst through the knotted
stalks of the ivy, and stooping like some
poor travesty of Narcissus, with shaded face
pierced down deep&mdash;deep into eyes not
my own, but violet and unendurable and
strange&mdash;eyes of the living water-sprite
drawing my wits from me, stilling my
heart, till I was very near plunging into
that crystal oblivion, to be fishes evermore.</p>

<p>But my fingers still grasped my friend's
kind elf-locks, and her goose-nose brooded
beside mine upon that water of undivulged
delight. Out of the restless silence of the
stream floated this long-drawn singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Pilgrim forget; in this dark tide<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Nods the wild ivy on her stem;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span>The sad wind sleeps no more to rove;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>I cannot think how one so meekened
with hunger as I, resisted that water-troubled
hair, eyes that yet haunt me, that
heart-alluring voice.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; I said faintly, and the words of
Anthea came unbidden to mind, &quot;to sleep&mdash;oh!
who would forget? You plead merely
with some old dream of me&mdash;not <i>all</i> me, you
know. Gold is but witchcraft. And as for
sorrow&mdash;spread me a magical table in this
nettle-garden, I'll leave all melancholy!&quot;</p>

<p>I must indeed have been exhausted to
chop logic with a water-witch. As well
argue with minnows, entreat the rustling
of ivy-leaves. It was Rosinante, wearying,
I suppose, of the reflection of her own
mild countenance, that drew me back from
dream and disaster. She turned with arched
neck seeking a more wholesome pasture than
these deep mosses.</p>

<p>Leaving her then to her own devices,
and yet hearkening after the voice of the
charmer, I came out again into the garden,
and perceived before me a dark palace
with one lofty tower.</p>

<p>It seemed strange I had not seen the
tower at my first coming into this wilderness.
It stood with clustered summit and
stooping gargoyles, appealing as it were to
fear, in utter silence.</p>

<p>Though I knew it must be day, there
was scarcely more than a green twilight
around me, ever deepening, until at last I
could but dimly discern the upper windows
of the palace, and all sound waned but the
roar of distant falling water.</p>

<p>Then it was I found that I was not
alone in the garden. Two little leaden
children stood in an attitude of listening
on either side of the carved porch of the
palace, and between them a figure that
seemed to be watching me intently.</p>

<p>I looked and looked again&mdash;saw the
green-grey folds, the tawny locks, the
mistletoe, the unearthly eyes of this unstirring
figure, yet, when I advanced but
one strenuous pace, saw nought&mdash;only the
little leaden boys and the porch between
them.</p>

<p>These childish listeners, the straggling
briers, the impenetrable thickets, the
emerald gloaming, the marble stillness of
the lofty lichenous tower: I took courage.
Could such things be in else than Elfland?
And she who out of beauty and being
vanishes and eludes, what else could she
be than one of Elfland's denizens from
whom a light and credulous heart need
fear nothing.</p>

<p>I trod like a shadow where the phantom
had stood and opened the unused door. I
was about to pass into the deeper gloom of
the house when a hound appeared and stood
regarding me with shining eyes in the faint
gloaming. He was presently joined by one
as light-footed, but milk-white and slimmer,
and both turned their heads as if in question
of their master, who had followed close
behind them.</p>

<p>This personage, because of the gloom, or
the better to observe the intruder on his
solitude, carried a lantern whose beams were
reflected upon himself, attired as he was
from head to foot in the palest primrose,
but with a countenance yet paler.</p>

<p>There was no hint of enmity or alarm or
astonishment in the colourless eyes that were
fixed composedly on mine, nothing but
courtesy in his low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Back, Safte!&mdash;back, Sallow!&quot; he cried softly
to his hounds; &quot;is this your civility? Indeed,
sir,&quot; he continued to me, &quot;it was all I could
do to dissuade the creatures from giving
tongue when you first appeared on the terrace
of my solitary gardens. I heard too the
water-sprite: she only sings when footsteps
stray upon the banks.&quot; He smiled wanly,
and his nose seemed even sharper in his pale
face, and his yellow hair leaner about his
shoulders. &quot;I feared her voice might prove
too persuasive, and deprive me of the first
strange face I have seen these many decades
gone.&quot;</p>

<p>I bowed and murmured an apology for
my intrusion, just as I might perhaps to
some apparition of nightmare that over-stayed
its welcome.</p>

<p>&quot;I beseech you, sir,&quot; he replied, &quot;say no
more! It may be I deemed you at first a
visitor perchance even more welcome&mdash;if it
be possible,... yet I know not that either.
My name is Ennui,&quot;&mdash;he smiled again&mdash;&quot;Prince
Ennui. You have, perchance, heard
somewhere our sad story. This is the perpetual
silence wherein lies that once-happy
princess, my dear sister, Sleeping Beauty.&quot;</p>

<p>His voice seemed but an echo amongst
the walls and arches of this old house, and
he spoke with a suave enunciation as if in
an unfamiliar tongue.</p>

<p>I replied that I had read the ever-lovely
story of Sleeping Beauty, indeed knew it by
heart, and assured him modestly that I had
not the least doubt of a happy ending&mdash;&quot;that
is, if the author be the least authority.&quot;</p>

<p>He narrowed his lids. &quot;It is a tradition,&quot;
he replied; &quot;meanwhile, the thickets broaden.&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon I begged him to explain how
it chanced that among that festive and
animated company I had read of, he alone
had resisted the wicked godmother's spell.</p>

<p>He smiled distantly, and bowed me into
the garden.</p>

<p>&quot;That is a simple thing,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Yet for the life of me I could not but
doubt all he told me. He who could pass
spring on to spring, summer on to summer,
in the company of beasts so sly and silent,
so alert and fleet as these hounds of his,
could not be quite the amiable prince he
feigned to be. I began to wish myself in
homelier places.</p>

<p>It seems that on the morning of the fatal
spindle, he had gone coursing, with this Safte
and Sallow and his horse named &quot;Twilight,&quot;
and after wearying and heating himself at
the sport, a little after noon, leaving his
attendants, had set out to return to the palace
alone. But allured by the cool seclusion of a
&quot;lattice-arbour&quot; in his path, he had gone in,
and then and there, &quot;Twilight&quot; beneath
the willows, his hounds at his feet, had fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>Undisturbed, dreamless, &quot;the unseemly
hours sped light of foot.&quot; He awoke again,
between sunset and dark; the owl astir;
&quot;the silver gnats yet netting the shadows,&quot;
and so returned to the palace.</p>

<p>But the spell had fallen&mdash;king and courtier,
queen and lady and page and scullion, hawk
and hound, slept a sleep past waking&mdash;&quot;while
I, roamed and roam yet in a solitary
watch beyond all sleeping. Wherefore, sir,
I only of the most hospitable house in these
lands am awake to bid you welcome. But
as for that, a few dwindling and harsh fruits
in my orchards, and the cold river water
that my dogs lap with me, are all that
is left to offer you. For I who never
sleep am never hungry, and they who never
wake&mdash;I presume&mdash;never thirst. Would,
sir, it were otherwise! After such long
silence, then, conceive how strangely falls
your voice on ears that have heard only
wings fluttering, dismal water-songs, and the
yelp and quarrel and night-voice of unseen
hosts in the forests.&quot;</p>

<p>He glanced at me with a mild austerity
and again lowered his eyes. I cannot now
but wonder how the rhythm of a voice so
soft, so monotonous, could give such pleasure
to the ear. I almost doubted my own eyes
when I looked upon his yellow, on that
unmoved, sad, mad, pale face.</p>

<p>I had no doubt of his dogs, however, and
walked scarcely at ease beside him, while they,
shadow-footed, closely followed us at heel.</p>

<p>&quot;Prince Ennui&quot; conducted me with shining
lantern into a dense orchard thickly under-grown,
marvellously green, with a small, hard
fruit upon its branches, shaped like a medlar,
of a crisp, sweet odour and, despite its hardness,
a delicious taste. The interwoven twigs
of the stooping trees were thickly nested; a
veritable wilderness of moonlike and starry
flowers ran all to seed amid the nettles and
nightshade of this green silence. And while
I ate&mdash;for I was hungry enough&mdash;Prince
Ennui stood, his hand on Sallow's muzzle,
lightly thridding the dusky labyrinths of the
orchard with his faint green eyes.</p>

<p>Mine, too, were not less busy, but rather
with its lord than with his orchard. And the
strange thought entered my mind, Was he
in very deed the incarnation of this solitude,
this silence, this lawless abundance? Somewhere,
in the green heats of summer, had he
come forth, taken shape, exalted himself?
What but vegetable ichor coursed through
veins transparent as his? What but the
swarming mysteries of these thick woods
lurked in his brain? As for his hounds, theirs
was the same stealth, the same symmetry, the
same cold, secret unhumanity as his. Creatures
begotten of moonlight on silence they seemed
to me, with instincts past my workaday wits
to conceive.</p>

<p>And Rosinante! I laughed softly to think
of her staid bones beside the phantom
creature this prince had called up to me at
mention of &quot;Twilight.&quot;</p>

<p>I ate because I was ravenously hungry, but
also because, while eating, I was better at my
ease.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the stillness, like an arrow,
Safte was gone; and far away beneath the
motionless leaves a faint voice rang dwindling
into silence. I shuddered at my probable
fate.</p>

<p>Prince Ennui glanced lightly. &quot;When the
magic horn at last resounds,&quot; he said, &quot;how
strange a flight it will be! These thorny
briers encroach ever nearer on my palace walls.
I am a captive ever less at ease. Summer by
summer the sun rises shorn yet closer of his
beams, and now the lingering transit of the
moon is but from one wood by a narrow
crystal arch to another. They will have me
yet, sir. How weary will the sleepy ones be
of my uneasy footfall!&quot;</p>

<p>And even as Safte slipped softly back to his
watching mate, the patter and shrill menace
of voices behind him hinted not all was
concord between these hidden multitudes and
their unseemly prince.</p>

<p>The master-stars shone earlier here; already
sparkling above the tower was a canopy of
clearest darkness spread, while the leafy fringes
of the sky glowed yet with changing fires.</p>

<p>We returned to the lawns before the palace
porch, and, with his lantern in his hand, the
Prince signed to me to go in. I was not a
little curious to view that enchanted household
of which I had read so often and with so
much delight as a child.</p>

<p>In the banqueting-hall only the matted
windows were visible in the lofty walls.
Prince Ennui held his lantern on high, and by
its flame, and the faint light that flowed in
from above, I could presently see, distinct in
gloom, as many sleepers as even Night could
desire.</p>

<p>Here they reclined just as sorcerous sleep
had overtaken them. But how dimmed, how
fallen! For Time that could not change the
sleeper had changed with quiet skill all else.
Tarnished, dusty, withered, overtaken, yellowed,
and confounded lay banquet and cloth-of-gold,
flagon, cup, fine linen, table, and stool.
But in all the ruin, like buds of springtime in
a bare wood, or jewels in ashes, slumbered
youth and beauty and bravery and delight.</p>

<p>I lifted my eyes to the King. The gold of
his divinity was fallen, his splendour quenched;
but life's dark scrutiny from his face was gone.
He made no stir at our light, slumbered untreasoned
on. The lids of his Queen were
lightlier sealed, only withheld beauty as a
cloud the sky it hides. His courtiers flattered
more elusively, being sincerely mute, and only
a little red dust was all the wine left.</p>

<p>I seemed to hear their laughter clearer now
that the jest was forgotten, and to admire
better the pomp, and the mirth, and the grace,
and the vanity, now that time had so far
travelled from this little tumult once their
triumph.</p>

<p>In a kind of furtive bravado, I paced the
length of the long, thronged tables. Here
sat a little prince that captivated me, dipping
his fingers into his cup with a sidelong
glance at his mother. There a high officer,
I know not how magnificent and urgent
when awake, slumbered with eyes wide open
above his discouraged moustaches.</p>

<p>Simply for vanity of being awake in such
a sleepy company, I strutted conceitedly to
and fro. I bent deftly and pilfered a little
cockled cherry from between the very fingertips
of her whose heart was doubtless like
its&mdash;quite hard. And the bright lips never
said a word. I sat down, rather clownishly I
felt, beside an aged and simpering chancellor
that once had seemed wise, but now seemed
innocent, nibbling a biscuit crisp as scandal.
For after all the horn <i>would</i> sound. Childhood
had been quite sure of that&mdash;needed not
even the author's testimony. They were alert
to rise, scattering all dust, victors over Time
and outrageous Fortune.</p>

<p>Almost with a cry of apprehension I perceived
again the solitary Prince. But he
merely smiled faintly. &quot;You see, sir,&quot; he said,
&quot;how weary must a guardianship be of them
who never tire. The snow falls, and the
bright light falls on all these faces; yet not
even my Lady Melancholy stirs a dark lid.
And all these dog-days&mdash;&quot; He glanced at
his motionless hounds. They raised languidly
their narrow heads, whimpering softly, as if
beseeching of their master that long-delayed
supper&mdash;haplessly me. &quot;No, no, sirs,&quot; said
the Prince, as if he had read their desire
as easily as he whom it so much concerned.
&quot;Guard, guard, and hearken. This gentleman
is not the Prince we await, Sallow;
not the Prince, Safte! And now, sir,&quot;&mdash;he
turned again to me&mdash;&quot;there is yet one
other sleeper&mdash;she who hath brought so much
quietude on a festive house.&quot;</p>

<p>We climbed the staircase where dim light
lay so invitingly, and came presently to a
little darker chamber. Green, blunt things
had pushed and burst through the casement.
The air smelled faintly-sour of brier, and
was as still as boughs of snow. There the
not-unhappy Princess reclined before a
looking-glass, whither I suppose she had
run to view her own alarm when the sharp
needle pierced her thumb. All alarm was
stilled now on her face. She, one might
think, of all that company of the sleepy,
was the only one that dreamed. Her youthful
lips lay a little asunder; the heavy
beauty of her hair was parted on her forehead;
her childish hands sidled together like
leverets in her lap. &quot;Why!&quot; I cried aloud,
almost involuntarily, &quot;she breathes!&quot;</p>

<p>And at sound of my voice the hounds
leapt back; and, on a traveller's oath, I
verily believe, once, and how swiftly, and
how fearfully and brightly, those childish
lids unsealed their light as of lilac that lay
behind, glanced briefly, fleetingly, on one
who had ventured so far, and fell again to
rest.</p>

<p>&quot;And when,&quot; I cried harshly, &quot;when
will that laggard burst through this agelong
silence? Here's dust enough for all to see.
And all this ruin, this inhospitable peace!&quot;</p>

<p>Prince Ennui glanced strangely at me.</p>

<p>&quot;I assure you, O suddenly enkindled,&quot;
he said in his suave, monotonous voice, &quot;it
is not for <i>my</i> indifference he does not come.
I would willingly sleep; these&mdash;my dear
sister, all these old fineries and love-jinglers
would as fain wake.&quot; He turned away his
treacherous eyes from me. &quot;Maybe the
Lorelei hath snared him!...&quot; he said,
smiling.</p>

<p>I relished not at all the thought of sleeping
in this mansion of sleep. Yet it seemed
politic to refrain from giving offence to
fangs apparently so eager to take it.
Accordingly I followed this Ennui to a
loftier chamber yet that he suggested for
me.</p>

<p>Once there, however, and his soft footfall
passed away, I looked about me, first to
find a means for keeping trespassers from
coming in, and next to find a means for
getting myself out.</p>

<p>It was a long and arduous, but not a
perilous, descent from the window by the
thick-grown greenery that cumbered the
walls. But I determined to wait awhile
before venturing,&mdash;wait, too, till I could see
plainly where Rosinante had made her
night-quarters. By good fortune I discovered
her beneath the greenish moon
that hung amid mist above the forest,
stretching a disconsolate neck at the waterside
as if in search of the Lorelei.</p>

<p>When, as it seemed to me, it must be
nearing dawn, though how the hours flitted
so swiftly passed my comprehension, I very
cautiously climbed out of my narrow window
and descended slowly to the lawns
beneath. My foot had scarcely touched
ground when ringing and menacing from
some dark gallery of the palace above me
broke out a distant baying.</p>

<p>Nothing shall persuade me to tell how
fast I ran; how feverishly I haled poor
Rosinante out of sleep, and pushed her
down into the deeps of that coal-black
stream; with what agility I clambered into
the saddle.</p>

<p>Yet I could not help commiserating the
while the faithful soul who floated beneath
me. The stream was swift but noiseless, the
water rather rare than cold, yet, despite all
the philosophy beaming out of her maidenly
eyes across the smooth surface of the tide,
Rosinante must have preferred from the
bottom of her heart dry land.</p>

<p>I, too, momentarily, when I discovered
that we were speedily approaching the
roaring fall whose reverberations I had
heard long since.</p>

<p>Out of the emerald twilight we floated
from beneath the overarching thickets. Pale
beams were striking from the risen sun upon
the gliding surface, and dwelt in splendour
where danger sat charioted beneath a palely
gorgeous bow. Yet I doubt if ever mortal
man swept on to defeat at last so rapturously
as I.</p>

<p>The gloomier trees had now withdrawn
from the banks of the river. A pale morning
sky over-canopied the shimmering forests.
Here rose the solitary tower where Echo
tarried for the Hornblower. And straight
before us, across that level floor, beyond
a tremulous cloud of foam and light and
colour, lurked the unseen, the unimaginable,
the ever-dreamed-of, Death.</p>

<p>Heedless of Lorelei, heedless of all save
the beauty and terror and glory in which
they rode, down swept snorting ship and
master to doom.</p>

<p>The crystal water jargoned past my
saddle. Sky, earth, and tower, like the
panorama of a dream, wheeled around me.
Light blinded me; clamour deafened me;
foam and the pure wave and cold darkness
whelmed over me. We surged, paused,
gazed, nodded, crashed:&mdash;and so an end to
Ennui.</p>

<p>How long my body was the sport of that
foaming water I cannot tell. But when I
again opened my eyes, I found, first, that the
sun was shining dazzling clear high above
me, and, next, that the delightful noise of
running water babbled close against my ear.
I lay upon a strip of warm sward by the river's
brink. Near by me grew some rank-smelling
waterside plant, and overhead the air seemed
peopled with larks.</p>

<p>I crawled, confused and aching, to the
water, and dipped my head and hands into the
cold rills. This soon refreshed me, for the
sun had, it would seem, long been dwelling on
that passive corse of mine by the waterside
and had parched it to the skin.</p>

<p>But it was some little while yet before my
mind returned fully to what had passed, and
so to my loss.</p>

<p>I sat looking at the grey, noisy water,
almost incredulous that Rosinante could be
gone. It might be that the same hand as
must have drawn myself from drowning had
snatched her bridle also out of Fate's grasp.
Perhaps even now she was seeking her master
by the greener pasture of the wide plains
around me. Perhaps the far-off sea was her
green sepulchre. But many waters cannot
quench love. I faced, friendless and discomfited,
a region as strange to me as the
farther side of the moon.</p>

<p>Without more ado I rose, shook myself,
and sadly began to go forward. But I had
taken only a few steps along the banks of
the stream&mdash;for here was fresh water, at
least&mdash;when a sound like distant thunder
rolled over these flat, green lands towards
me, increasing steadily in volume.</p>

<p>I stood, lost in wonder, and presently, at the
distance, perhaps, of a little less than a mile,
descried an innumerable herd of horses streaming
across these level pastures, and at the
extremity, it seemed, of a wide ellipse, that
had brought them near, and now was galloping
them away.</p>

<p>My heart beat a little faster at this extraordinary
spectacle. And while I stood in
uncertainty gazing after the retreating concourse,
I perceived a figure running towards
me, lifting his hands and crying out in a voice
sonorous and inhuman. He was of a stature
much above my own, yet so gross in shape
and immense of head he seemed at first almost
dwarfish. He came to a stand twenty paces
or so from me, on the ridge of a gentle
inclination, and gazed down on me with wild,
bright eyes. Even at this distance I could
perceive the almost colourless lustre of his
eyes beneath his thick locks of yellow hair.
When he had taken his fill of me, he lifted
his head again and cried out to me a few
words of what certainly might be English,
but was neither intelligible nor reassuring.</p>

<p>I stood my ground and stared him in the
face, till I could see nothing but wind-blown
yellow, and strange, brutal eyes. Then he
advanced a little nearer. Whereupon I also
raised my hand with a gesture like his own,
and demanded loudly where I was, what was
this place, and who was he. His very ears
pricked forward, he listened so intently. He
came nearer yet, then stayed, tossed his head
into the air, whirled the long leather thong
he carried above his head, and, signing to me
to follow, set off with so swift and easy a
stride as would soon have carried him out of
sight, had he not turned and perceived how
slowly I could follow him.</p>

<p>He slackened his pace then, and, thus
running, we came in sight at length of what
appeared to be a vast wooden shed, or barn,
with one rude chimney, and surrounded by
a thick fence, or stockade, many feet high
and apparently of immense strength and
stability.</p>

<p>In the gateway of this fence stood the
master of these solitudes, his eyes fixed
strangely on my coming with an intense, I
had almost said incredulous, interest. Nor
did he cease so to regard me, while the
creature that had conducted me thither, told,
I suppose, where he had found me, and poured
out with childish zeal his own amazement and
delight. By this time, too, his voice had
begun to lose its first strangeness, and to take
a meaning for me. And I was presently
fully persuaded he spoke a kind of English,
and that not unpleasingly, with a liquid, shrill,
voluminous ease. His master listened patiently
awhile, but at last bade his servant be silent,
and himself addressed me.</p>

<p>&quot;I am informed, Yahoo,&quot; he said with peculiar
deliberation, &quot;that you have been borne
down into my meadows by the river, and
fetched out thence by my servant. Be aware,
then, that all these lands from horizon to
horizon are mine and my people's. I desire
no tidings of what follies may be beyond my
boundaries, no aid, and no amity. I admit no
trespasser here and will bear with none. It
appears, however, that your life has passed
beyond your own keeping: I may not, therefore,
refuse you shelter and food, and to have
you conducted in safety beyond my borders.
Have the courtesy, then, to keep within
shelter of these walls till the night be over.
Else&quot;&mdash;he gazed out across the verdant
undulations&mdash;&quot;else, Yahoo, I have no power
to protect you.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned once more, and regarded me
with a lofty yet tender recognition, as if, little
though his speech might profess it, he very
keenly desired my safety.</p>

<p>He then stepped aside and bade me rather
sharply enter the gate before him. I tried to
show none of the mistrust I felt at passing out
of these open lands into this repellent yard.
I glanced at the shock-haired creature, alert,
half-human, beside me; across the limitless
savannah around me, echoing yet, it seemed,
with the rumour of innumerable hoofs; and
bowing, as it were, to odds, I went in.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I felt my host had been
frank with me. If this was indeed the same
Lemuel Gulliver whose repute my infancy had
prized so well, I need have no fear of blood
and treachery at his hands, however primitive
and disgusting his household, or distorted his
intellect might be. He who had proved
no tyrant in Lilliput, nor quailed before the
enormities of Brobdingnag, might abhor the
sight of me; he would not play me false.</p>

<p>His servant, or whatsoever else he might
be, I considered not quite so calmly. Yet
even in <i>his</i> broad countenance dwelt a something
like bright honesty, less malice than
simplicity.</p>

<p>Wherefore, I say, I ordered down my
cowardice, and, looking both of them as
squarely in the face as I knew how, passed
out of the open into the appalling yard of
this wooden house.</p>

<p>I say &quot;appalling,&quot; but without much
reason. Perhaps it was the unseemly hugeness
of its balks, the foul piles of skins,
the mounds of refuse that lay about within;
perhaps the all-pervading beastly stench, the
bareness and filthiness under so glassy-clear
and fierce a sun that revolted me. All
man's seemliness and affection for the natural
things of earth were absent. Here was
only a brutal and bald order, as of an
intelligence like that of the yellow-locked,
swift-footed creature behind me. Perhaps
also it was the mere unfamiliarity of much
I saw there that estranged me. All lay
in neglect, cracked and marred with rough
usage,&mdash;coarse strands of a kind of rope,
strips of hide, gaping tubs, a huge and
rusty brazier, and in one corner a great
cage, many feet square and surmounted
with an iron ring.</p>

<p>I know not. I almost desired Sallow at
my side, and would to heaven Rosinante's
nose lay in my palm.</p>

<p>Within the house a wood-fire burned in
the sun, its smoke ascending to the roof,
and flowing thence through a rude chimney.
A pot steamed over the fire, burdening the
air with a savour at first somewhat faint
and disgusting,&mdash;perhaps because it was
merely strange to me. The walls of this
lofty room were of rough, substantial timber,
bare and weatherproof; the floor was of the
colour of earth, seemingly earth itself. A
few rude stools, a bench, and a four-legged
table stood beside the unshuttered window.
And from this stretched the beauteous
green of the grass-land or prairie beyond the
stockade.</p>

<p>The house, then, was built on the summit
of a gentle mound, and doubtless commanded
from its upper window the extreme
reaches of this sea of verdure.</p>

<p>I sat down where Mr. Gulliver directed
me, and was not displeased with the warmth
of the fire, despite the sun. I was cold
after that long, watery lullaby, and cold too
with exhaustion after running so far at the
heels of the creature who had found me.
And I dwelt in a kind of dream on the
transparent flames, and watched vacantly the
seething pot, and smelt till slowly appetite
returned the smoke of the stuff that bubbled
beneath its lid.</p>

<p>Mr. Gulliver himself brought me my
platter of this pottage, and though it tasted
of nothing in my experience&mdash;a kind of
sweet, cloying meat&mdash;I was so tired of the
fruits to which enterprise had as yet condemned
me, I ate of it hungrily and
heartily. Yet not so fast as that the
young &quot;Gulliver&quot; had not finished his
before me, and sat at length watching every
mouthful I took from beneath his sun-enticing
thatch of hair. Ever and again
he would toss up his chin with a shrill
guffaw, or stoop his head till his eyeballs
were almost hidden beneath their thick
lashes, so regarding me for minutes together
with a delightful simulation of intelligence,
yet with that peculiar wistful affection his
master had himself exhibited at first sight
of me.</p>

<p>But when our meal was done, Mr.
Gulliver ordered him about his business.
Without a murmur, with one last, long,
brotherly glance at me, he withdrew. And
presently after I heard from afar his high,
melancholy &quot;cooee,&quot; and the crack of his
thong in the afternoon air as he hastened
out to his charges.</p>

<p>My companion did not stir. Only the
flames waved silently along the logs. The
beam of sunlight drew across the floor.
The crisp air of the pasture flowed through
the window. What wonder, then, that,
sitting on my stool, I fell asleep!</p>

<span>&mdash;OLD BALLAD.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>I was awoke by a sustained sound as of
an orator speaking in an unknown tongue,
and found myself in a sunny-shadowy loft,
whither I suppose I must have been carried
in my sleep. In a delicious languor between
sleeping and waking I listened with
imperturbable curiosity awhile to that voice
of the unknown. Indeed, I was dozing
again when a different sound, enormous,
protracted, abruptly aroused me. I got up,
hot and trembling, not yet quite my own
master, to discover its cause.</p>

<p>Through a narrow slit between the timbers
I could view the country beneath me, far
and wide. I saw near at hand the cumbrous
gate of the stockade ajar, and at a little
distance on the farther side Mr. Gulliver
and his half-human servant standing. In
front of them was an empty space&mdash;a narrow
semicircle of which Gulliver was the centre.
And beyond&mdash;wild-eyed, dishevelled, stretching
their necks as if to see, inclining their
heads as if to hearken, ranging in multitude
almost to the sky's verge&mdash;stood assembled,
it seemed to me, all the horses of the
universe.</p>

<p>Even in my first sensation of fear admiration
irresistibly stirred. The superb freedom
of their unbridled heads, the sun-nurtured
arrogance of their eyes, the tumultuous, sea-like
tossing of crest and tail, their keenness
and ardour and might, and also in simple
truth their numbers&mdash;how could one marvel
if this solitary fanatic dreamed they heard
him and understood?</p>

<p>Unarmed, bareheaded, he faced the brutal
discontent of his people. Words I could not
distinguish; but there was little chance of
misapprehending the haughty anguish with
which he threatened, pleaded, cajoled. Clear
and unfaltering his voice rose and fell. He
dealt out fearlessly, foolishly, to that long-snouted,
little-brained, wild-eyed multitude,
reason beyond their instinct, persuasion beyond
their savagery, love beyond their heed.</p>

<p>But even while I listened, one thing I
knew those sleek malcontents heard too&mdash;the
Spirit of man in that small voice of his&mdash;perplexed,
perhaps, and perverted, and out of
tether; but none the less unconquerable and
sublime.</p>

<p>What less, thought I, than power unearthly
could long maintain that stern, impassable
barrier of green vacancy between their hoofs
and him? And I suppose for the very reason
that these were beasts of a long-sharpened
sagacity, wild-hearted, rebellious, yet not the
slaves of impulse, he yet kept himself their
king who was, in fact, their captive.</p>

<p>&quot;Houyhnhnms?&quot; I heard him cry; &quot;pah&mdash;Yahoos!&quot;
His voice fell; he stood confronting
in silence that vast circumference
of restless beauty. And again broke out
inhuman, inarticulate, immeasurable revolt.
Far across over the tossing host, rearing,
leaping, craning dishevelled heads, went pealing
and eddying that hostile, brutal voice.</p>

<p>Gulliver lifted his hand, and a tempestuous
silence fell once more. &quot;Yahoos! Yahoos!&quot;
he bawled again. Then he turned, and passed
back into his hideous garden. The gate was
barred and bolted behind him.</p>

<p>Thus loosed and unrestrained, surged as if
the wind drove them, that concourse upon the
stockade. Heavy though its timbers were,
they seemed to stoop at the impact. A kind
of fury rose in me. I lusted to go down and
face the mutiny of the brutes; bit, and saddle,
and scourge into obedience man's serfs of the
centuries. I watched, on fire, the flame of
the declining sun upon those sleek, vehement
creatures of the dust. And then, I know not
by what subtle irony, my zeal turned back&mdash;turned
back and faded away into simple longing
for my lost friend, my peaceful beast-of-evening,
Rosinante. I sat down again in the
litter of my bed and earnestly wished myself
home; wished, indeed, if I must confess it,
for the familiar face of my Aunt Sophia, my
books, my bed. If these were this land's horses,
I thought, what men might here be met! The
unsavouriness, the solitude, the neighing and
tumult and prancing induced in me nothing
but dulness at last and disgust.</p>

<p>But at length, dismissing all such folly, at
least from my face, I lifted the trap-door and
descended the steep ladder into the room
beneath.</p>

<p>Mr. Gulliver sat where I had left him.
Defeat stared from his eyes. Lines of insane
thought disfigured his face. Yet he sat,
stubborn and upright, heedless of the uproar,
heedless even that the late beams of the sun
had found him out in his last desolation. So
I too sat down without speech, and waited
till he should come up out of his gloom,
and find a friend in a stranger.</p>

<p>But day waned; the sunlight went out
of the great wooden room; the tumult
diminished; and finally silence and evening
shadow descended on the beleaguered house.
And I was looking out of the darkened
window at a star that had risen and stood
shining in the sky, when I was startled by a
voice so low and so different from any I had
yet heard that I turned to convince myself it
was indeed Mr. Gulliver's.</p>

<p>&quot;And the people of the Yahoos, Traveller,&quot;
he said, &quot;do they still lie, and flatter, and
bribe, and spill blood, and lust, and covet?
Are there yet in the country whence you
come the breadless bellies, the sores and rags
and lamentations of the poor? Ay, Yahoo,
and do vicious men rule, and attain riches;
and impious women pomp and flattery?&mdash;hypocrites,
pandars, envious, treacherous,
proud?&quot; He stared with desolate sorrow
and wrath into my eyes.</p>

<p>Words in disorder flocked to my tongue. I
grew hot and eager, yet by some instinct held
my peace. The fluttering of the dying flames,
the starry darkness, silence itself; what were
we who sat together? Transient shadows both,
phantom, unfathomable, mysterious as these.</p>

<p>I fancied he might speak again. Once he
started, raised his arm, and cried out as if
acting again in dream some frenzy of the past.
And once he wheeled on me extraordinary
eyes, as if he half-recognised some idol of
the irrevocable in my face. These were
momentary, however. Gloom returned to his
forehead, vacancy to his eyes.</p>

<p>I heard the outer gate flung open, and a
light, strange footfall. So we seated ourselves,
all three, for a while round the smouldering
fire. Mr. Gulliver's servant scarcely took his
eyes from my face. And, a little to my confusion,
his first astonishment of me had now
passed away, and in its stead had fallen such a
gentleness and humour as I should not have
supposed possible in his wild countenance.
He busied himself over his strips of skin, but
if he caught my eye upon his own he would
smile out broadly, and nod his great, hairy
head at me, till I fancied myself a child again
and he some vast sweetheart of my nurse.</p>

<p>When we had supped (sitting together in
the great room), I climbed the ladder into
the loft and was soon fast asleep. But from
dreams distracted with confusion I awoke
at the first shafts of dawn. I stood beside the
narrow window in the wall of the loft and
watched the distant river change to silver,
the bright green of the grass appear.</p>

<p>This seemed a place of few and timorous
birds, and of fewer trees. But all across the
dews of the grasses lay a tinge of powdered
gold, as if yellow flowers were blooming in
abundance there. I saw no horses, no sign of
life; heard no sound but the cadent wail of
the ash-grey birds in their flights. And when
I turned my eyes nearer home, and compared
the distant beauty of the forests and their
radiant clouds with the nakedness and desolation
here, I gave up looking from the window
with a determination to be gone as soon as
possible from a country so uncongenial.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mr. Gulliver, it appeared, had
returned during the night to his first mistrust
of my company. He made no sign he saw
me, and left his uncouth servant to attend
on me. For him, indeed, I began to feel a
kind of affection springing up; he seemed
so eager to befriend me. And whose is
the heart quite hardened against a simple
admiration? I rose very gladly when, after
having stuffed a wallet with food, he signed
to me to follow him. I turned to Mr.
Gulliver and held out my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish, sir, I might induce you to accompany
me,&quot; I said. &quot;Some day we would
win our way back to the country we have
abandoned. I have known and loved your
name, sir, since first I browsed on pictures&mdash;Being
measured for your first coat in Lilliput
by the little tailors:&mdash;Straddling the pinnacled
city. Ay, sir, and when the farmers picked
you up 'twixt finger and thumb from among
their cornstalks....&quot;</p>

<p>I had talked on in hope to see his face
relax; but he made no sign he saw or heard
me. I very speedily dropped my hand and
went out. But when my guide and I had
advanced about thirty yards from the stockade,
I cast a glance over my shoulder towards the
house that had given me shelter. It rose,
sad-coloured and solitary, between the green
and blue. But, if it was not fancy, Mr.
Gulliver stood looking down on me from the
very window whence I had looked down on
him. And there I do not doubt he stayed
till his fellow-yahoo had passed across his
inhospitable lands out of his sight for ever.</p>

<p>I was glad to be gone, and did not, at first,
realise that the least danger lay before us.
But soon, observing the extraordinary vigilance
and caution my companion showed, I began
to watch and hearken, too. Evidently our
departure had not passed unseen. Far away
to left and to right of us I descried at whiles
now a few, now many, swift-moving shapes.
But whether they were advancing with us, or
gathering behind us, in hope to catch their
tyrant alone and unaware, I could not properly
distinguish.</p>

<p>Once, for a cause not apparent to me, my
guide raised himself to his full height, and,
thrusting back his head, uttered a most
piercing cry. After that, however, we saw no
more for a while of the beasts that haunted
our journey.</p>

<p>All morning, till the sun was high, and the
air athrob with heat and stretched like a great
fiddlestring to a continuous, shrill vibration,
we went steadily forward. And when at last
I was faint with heat and thirst, my companion
lifted me up like a child on to his
back and set off again at his great, easy
stride. It was useless to protest. I merely
buried my hands in his yellow hair to keep
my balance in such a camel-like motion.</p>

<p>A little after noon we stayed to rest by
a shallow brook, beneath a cluster of trees
scented, though not in blossom, like an
English hawthorn. There we ate our meal,
or rather I ate and my companion watched,
running out ever and again for a wider
survey, and returning to me like a faithful
dog, to shout snatches of his inconceivable
language at me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I seemed to catch his meaning,
bidding me take courage, have no fear, he
would protect me. And once he shaded his
eyes and pointed afar with extreme perturbation,
whining or murmuring while he stared.</p>

<p>Again we set off from beneath the sweet-scented
shade, and now no doubt remained
that I was the object of very hostile evolutions.
Sometimes these smooth-hooved battalions
would advance, cloudlike, to within fifty yards
of us, and, snorting, ruffle their manes and
wheel swiftly away; only once more in turn
to advance, and stand, with heads exalted,
gazing wildly on us till we were passed on a
little. But my guide gave them very little
heed. Did they pause a moment too long
in our path, or gallop down on us but a
stretch or two beyond the limit his instinct
had set for my safety, he whirled his thong
above his head, and his yell resounded, and
like a shadow upon wheat the furious companies
melted away.</p>

<p>Evidently these were not the foes he looked
for, but a subtler, a more indomitable. It
was at last, I conjectured, at scent, or sight,
or rumour of these that he suddenly swept me
on to his shoulders again, and with a great
sneeze or bellow leapt off at a speed he
had, as yet, given me no hint of.</p>

<p>Looking back as best I could, I began to
discern somewhat to the left of us a numerous
herd in pursuit, sorrel in colour, and of a
more magnificent aspect than those forming
the other bands. It was obvious, too, despite
their plunging and rearing, that they were
gaining on us&mdash;drew, indeed, so near at last
that I could count the foremost of them, and
mark (not quite callously) their power and
fleetness and symmetry, even the sun's gold
upon their reddish skins.</p>

<p>Then in a flash my captor set me down,
toppled me over (in plain words) into the
thick herbage, and, turning, rushed bellowing,
undeviating towards their leaders, till it
seemed he must inevitably be borne down
beneath their brute weight, and so&mdash;farewell
to summer. But almost at the impact, the
baffled creatures reared, neighing fearfully in
consort, and at the gibberish hurled back on
them by their flamed-eyed master, broke in
rout, and fled.</p>

<p>Whereupon, unpausing, he ran back to me,
only just in time to rescue me from the nearer
thunder yet of those who had seized the
very acme of their opportunity to beat out
my brains.</p>

<p>It was a long and arduous and unequal
contest. I wished very heartily I could bear
a rather less passive part. But this fearless
creature scarcely heeded me; used me like
a helpless child, half tenderly, half roughly,
displaying ever and again over his shoulder
only a fleeting glance of the shallow glories of
his eyes, as if to reassure me of his power
and my safety.</p>

<p>But the latter, those distant savannahs
will bear witness, seemed forlorn enough.
My eyes swam with weariness of these crested,
earth-disdaining battalions. I sickened of the
heat of the sun, the incessant sidelong jolting,
the amazing green. But on we went, fleet
and stubborn, into ever-thickening danger.
How feeble a quarry amid so many hunters!</p>

<p>Two things grew clearer to me each
instant. First, that every movement and
feint of our pursuers was of design. Not a
beast that wheeled but wheeled to purpose;
while the main body never swerved, thundered
superbly on toward the inevitable end. And
next I perceived with even keener assurance
that my guide knew his country and his
enemy and his own power and aim as perfectly
and consummately; knew, too&mdash;this was the
end.</p>

<p>Far distant in front of us there appeared
to be a break in the level green, a fringe of
bushes, rougher ground. For this refuge he
was making, and from this our mutinous
Houyhnhnms meant to keep us.</p>

<p>There was no pausing now, not a glance
behind. His every effort was bent on speed.
Speed indeed it was. The wind roared in
my ears. Yet above its surge I heard the
neighing and squealing, the ever-approaching
shudder of hoofs. My eyes distorted all they
looked on. I seemed now floating twenty
feet in air; now skimming within touch of
ground. Now that sorrel squadron behind me
swelled and nodded; now dwindled to an
extreme minuteness of motion.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, a last, shrill paean rose
high; the hosts of our pursuers paused, billow-like,
reared, and scattered&mdash;my poor Yahoo
leapt clear.</p>

<p>For an instant once again in this wild
journey I was poised, as it were, in space,
then fell with a crash, still clutched, sure
and whole, to the broad shoulders of my
rescuer.</p>

<p>When my first confusion had passed away,
I found that I was lying in a dense green glen
at the foot of a cliff. For some moments I
could think of nothing but my extraordinary
escape from destruction. Within reach of my
hand lay the creature who had carried me,
huddled and motionless; and to left and to
right of me, and one a little nearer the base of
the cliff, five of those sorrel horses that had
been chief of our pursuers. One only of them
was alive, and he, also, broken and unable to
rise&mdash;unable to do else than watch with
fierce, untamed, glazing eyes (a bloody froth
at his muzzle,) every movement and sign of
life I made.</p>

<p>I myself, though bruised and bleeding, had
received no serious injury. But my Yahoo
would rise no more. His master was left
alone amidst his people. I stooped over him
and bathed his brow and cheeks with the
water that trickled from the cliffs close at
hand. I pushed back the thick strands of
matted yellow hair from his eyes. He made
no sign. Even while I watched him the
life of the poor beast near at hand welled
away: he whinnied softly, and dropped his
head upon the bracken. I was alone in the
unbroken silence.</p>

<p>It seemed a graceless thing to leave the
carcasses of these brave creatures uncovered
there. So I stripped off branches of the
trees, and gathered bundles of fern and
bracken, with which to conceal awhile their
bones from wolf and fowl. And him whom I
had begun to love I covered last, desiring he
might but return, if only for a moment, to
bid me his strange farewell.</p>

<p>This done, I pushed through the undergrowth
from the foot of the sunny cliffs, and
after wandering in the woods, came late in the
afternoon, tired out, to a ruinous hut. Here
I rested, refreshing myself with the unripe
berries that grew near by.</p>

<p>I remained quite still in this mouldering
hut looking out on the glens where fell the
sunlight. Some homely bird warbled endlessly
on in her retreat, lifted her small voice
till every hollow resounded with her content.
Silvery butterflies wavered across the sun's
pale beams, sipped, and flew in wreaths away.
The infinite hordes of the dust raised their
universal voice till, listening, it seemed to me
their tiny Babel was after all my own old,
far-off English, sweet of the husk.</p>

<p>Fate leads a man through danger to his
delight. Me she had led among woods. Nameless
though many of the cups and stars and
odours of the flowers were to me, unfamiliar
the little shapes that gamboled in fur and
feather before my face, here dwelt, mummy
of all earth's summers, some old ghost of me,
sipper of sap, coucher in moss, quieter than
dust.</p>

<p>So sitting, so rhapsodising, I began to
hear presently another sound&mdash;the rich, juicy
munch-munch of jaws, a little blunted maybe,
which yet, it seemed, could never cry Enough!
to these sweet, succulent grasses. I made no
sign, waited with eyes towards the sound,
and pulses beating as if for a sweetheart.
And soon, placid, unsurprised, at her extreme
ease, loomed into sight who but my ox-headed
Rosinante in these dells, cropping her
delightful way along in search of her drowned
master.</p>

<p>I could but whistle and receive the slow,
soft scrutiny of her familiar eyes. I fancied
even her bland face smiled, as might elderliness
on youth. She climbed near with
bridle broken and trailing, thrust out her nose
to me, and so was mine again.</p>

<p>Sunlight left the woods. Wind passed
through the upper branches. So, with rain in
the air, I went forward once more; not quite
so headily, perhaps, yet, I hope, with undiminished
courage, like all earth's travellers
before me, who have deemed truth potent as
modesty, and themselves worth scanning print
after.</p>

<span>&mdash;GEORGE HERBERT.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>A little before darkness fell we struck
into a narrow road traversing the wood.
This, though apparently not much frequented,
would at least lead me into lands inhabited,
so turning my face to the West, that I
might have light to survey as long as any
gleamed in the sky, I trudged on. But I
went slow enough: Rosinante was lame;
I like a stranger to my body, it was so
bruised and tumbled.</p>

<p>The night was black, and a thin rain
falling when at last I emerged from the
interminable maze of lanes into which the
wood-road had led me. And glad I was
to descry what seemed by the many lights
shining from its windows to be a populous
village. A gay village also, for song
came wafted on the night air, rustic and
convivial.</p>

<p>Hereabouts I overtook a figure on foot,
who, when I addressed him, turned on me
as sharply as if he supposed the elms above
him were thick with robbers, or that mine
was a voice out of the unearthly hailing
him.</p>

<p>I asked him the name of the village we
were approaching. With small dark eyes
searching my face in the black shadow of
night, he answered in a voice so strange
and guttural that I failed to understand a
word. He shook his fingers in the air;
pointed with the cudgel he carried under
his arm now to the gloom behind us, now
to the homely galaxy before us, and gabbled
on so fast and so earnestly that I began to
suppose he was a little crazed.</p>

<p>One word, however, I caught at last from
all this jargon, and that often repeated
with a little bow to me, and an uneasy
smile on his white face&mdash;&quot;Mishrush, Mishrush!&quot;
But whether by this he meant to
convey to me his habitual mood, or his
own name, I did not learn till afterwards.
I stopped in the heavy road and raised
my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;An inn,&quot; I cried in his ear, &quot;I want
lodging, supper&mdash;a tavern, an inn!&quot; as if
addressing a child or a natural.</p>

<p>He began gesticulating again, evidently
vain of having fully understood me. Indeed,
he twisted his little head upon his shoulders
to observe Rosinante gauntly labouring on.
&quot;'Ame!&mdash;'ame!&quot; he cried with a great effort.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he cried piteously.</p>

<p>He led me, after a few minutes' journey,
into the cobbled yard of a bright-painted
inn, on whose signboard a rising sun glimmered
faintly gold, and these letters standing
close above it&mdash;&quot;The World's End.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. &quot;Mishrush&quot; seemed not a little
relieved at nearing company after his
lonely walk; triumphant, too, at having
guided me hither so cunningly. He lifted
his nimble cudgel in the air and waved it
conceitedly to and fro in time to the song
that rose beyond the window. &quot;Fau'ow
er Wur'!&mdash;Fau'ow er Wur'!&quot; he cried
delightedly again and again in my ear,
eager apparently for my approval. So we
stood, then, beneath the starless sky, listening
to the rich <i>choragium</i> of the &quot;World's
End.&quot; They sang in unison, sang with a
kind of forlorn heat and enthusiasm. And
when the song was ended, and the roar of
applause over, Night, like a darkened water
whelmed silently in, engulfed it to the echo:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Follow the World&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>She bursts the grape,<br /></span>
<span>And dandles man<br /></span>
<span>In her green lap;<br /></span>
<span>She moulds her Creature<br /></span>
<span>From the clay,<br /></span>
<span>And crumbles him<br /></span>
<span>To dust away:<br /></span>

<span>Death can but snatch<br /></span>
<span>What ne'er was thine:<br /></span>
<span>Follow the World!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It died away, I say, and an ostler softly
appeared out of the shadow. Into his
charge, then, I surrendered Rosinante, and
followed my inarticulate acquaintance into
the noise and heat and lustre of the Inn.</p>

<p>It was a numerous company there
assembled. But their voices fell to a
man on the entry of a stranger. They
scrutinised me, not uncivilly, but closely,
seeking my badge, as it were by which to
recognise and judge me ever after.</p>

<p>Mr. Mistrust, as I presently discovered
my guide's name indeed to be, was volubly
explaining how I came into his company.
They listened intently to what, so far as
I could gather, might be Houyhnhnmish or
Double-Dutch. And then, as if to show
me to my place forthwith, a great fleshy
fellow that sat close beside the hearth this
summer evening continued in a loud voice
the conversation I had interrupted.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Mistrust with no little
confidence commended me in dumb show
to the landlady of the Inn, a Mrs. Nature,
if I understood him aright. This person
was still comely, though of uncertain age,
wore cherry ribbons, smiled rather vacantly
from vague, wonderful, indescribable eyes
that seemed to change colour, like the
chameleon, according to that they dwelt on.</p>

<p>I am afraid, as much to my amusement
as wonder, I discovered that this landlady
of so much apparent <i>bonhomie</i> was a deaf-mute.
If victuals, or drink, or bed were
required, one must chalk it down on a little
slate she carried at her girdle for the purpose.
Indeed, the absence of two of her
three chief senses had marvellously sharpened
the remaining one. Her eyes were on all,
vaguely dwelling, lightly gone, inscrutable,
strangely fascinating. She moved easily and
soundlessly (as fat women may), and I
doubt if ever mug or pot of any of that
talkative throng remained long empty, except
at the tippler's reiterated request.</p>

<p>She laid before me an excellent supper
on a little table somewhat removed beside
a curtained window. And while I ate I
watched, and listened, not at all displeased
with my entertainment.</p>

<p>The room in which we sat was low-ceiled
and cheerful, but rather close after the
rainy night-air. Gay pictures beautified the
walls. Here a bottle, a cheese, grapes, a
hare, a goblet&mdash;in a clear brown light that
made the guest's mouth water to admire.
Here a fine gentleman toasting a simpering
chambermaid. Above the chimney-piece a
bloated old man in vineleaves that might
be Silenus. And over against the door of
the parlour what I took to be a picture
of Potiphar's wife, she looked out of the
paint so bold and beauteous and craftily.
Birds and fishes in cases stared glassily,&mdash;owl
and kestrel, jack and eel and gudgeon.
All was clean and comfortable as a hospitable
inn can be.</p>

<p>But they who frequented it interested me
much more&mdash;as various and animated a
gathering as any I have seen. Yet in some
peculiar manner they seemed one and all
not to the last tittle quite of this world.
They were, so to speak, more earthy, too
definite, too true to the mould, like figures
in a bleak, bright light viewed out of darkness.
Certainly not one of them was at
first blush prepossessing. Yet who finds
much amiss with the fox at last, though all
he seems to have be cunning?</p>

<p>Near beside me, however, sat retired a
man a little younger and more at his ease
than most of the many there, and as busy
with his eyes and ears as I. His name, I
learned presently, was Reverie; and from
him I gathered not a little information regarding
the persons who talked and sipped
around us.</p>

<p>He told me at whiles that his house was
not in the village, but in a valley some
few miles distant across the meadows; that
he sat out these bouts of argument and
slander for the sheer delight he had in
gathering the myriad strands of that strange
rope Opinion; that he lived (heart, soul, and
hope) well-nigh alone; that he deeply mistrusted
this place, and the company we
were in, yet not for its mistress's sake,
who was at least faithful to her instincts,
candid to the candid, made no favourites,
and, eventually, compelled order. He told
me also that if friends he had, he deemed
it wiser not to name them, since the least
sibilant of the sound of the voice incites to
treachery; and in conclusion, that of all men
he was acquainted with, one at least never
failed to right his humour; and that one
was yonder flabby, pallid fellow with the
velvet collar to his coat, and the rings on
his fingers, and the gold hair, named Pliable,
who sat beside Mr. Stubborn on the settle
by the fire.</p>

<p>When, then, I had finished my supper, I
drew in my chair a little closer to Mr.
Reverie's and, having scribbled my wants on
the Landlady's slate, turned my attention to
the talk.</p>

<p>At the moment when I first began to listen
attentively they seemed to be in heated
dispute concerning the personal property of
a certain Mr. Christian, who was either
dead or had inexplicably disappeared. Mr.
Obstinate, I gathered, had taken as his right
this Christian's &quot;easy-chair&quot;; a gentleman
named Smoothman most of his other goods
for a debt; while a Parson Decorum had
appropriated as heretical his books and various
peculiar MSS.</p>

<p>But there now remained in question a
trifling sum of money which a Mr. Liar
loudly demanded in payment of an &quot;affair of
honour.&quot; This, however, he seemed little
likely to obtain, seeing that an elderly uncle
by marriage of Christian's, whose name was
Office, was as eager and affable and frank
about the sum as he was bent on keeping
it; and rattled the contents of his breeches'
pocket in sheer bravado of his means to go
to law for it.</p>

<p>&quot;He left a bare pittance, the merest pittance,&quot;
he said. &quot;What could there be of
any account? Christian despised money,
professed to despise it. That alone would
prove my wretched nephew queer in the
head&mdash;despised <i>money</i>!</p>

<p>&quot;Tush, friend!&quot; cried Obstinate from his
corner. &quot;Whether the money is yours, or
neighbour Liar's&mdash;and it is as likely as not
neither's&mdash;that talk about despising money's
what but a silly lie? 'Twas all sour grapes&mdash;sour
grapes. He had cunning enough for
envy, and pride enough for shame; and at last
there was naught but cunning left wherewith
to patch up a clout for him and his shame to
be gone in. I watched him set out on his
pestilent pilgrimage, crazed and stubborn, and
not a groat to call his own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet I have heard say he came of a
moneyed stock,&quot; said Pliable. &quot;The Sects
of Privy Opinion were rare wealthy people,
and they, so 'tis said, were his kinsmen. Truth
is, for aught I know, Christian must have
been in some degree a very liberal rascal, with
all his faults.&quot; He tittered.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! he was liberal enough,&quot; said Mr.
Malice suavely: &quot;why, even on setting out,
he emptied his wife's purse into a blind
beggar's hat!&mdash;his that used to bleat, 'Cast
thy bread&mdash;cast thy bread upon the waters!'
whensoever he spied Christian stepping along
the street. They say,&quot; he added, burying
his clever face in his mug, &quot;the Heavenly
Jerusalem lieth down by the weir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we must not contemn a man for his
poverty, neighbours,&quot; said Liar, gravely composing
his hairless face. &quot;Christian's was a
character of beautiful simplicity&mdash;beautiful!
<i>How</i> many rickety children did he leave
behind him?&quot;</p>

<p>A shrill voice called somewhat I could not
quite distinguish, for at that moment a youth
rose abruptly near by, and went hastily out.</p>

<p>Obstinate stared roundly. &quot;Thou hast a
piercing voice, friend Liar!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did but seek the truth,&quot; said Liar.</p>

<p>&quot;But whether or no, Christian believed in
it&mdash;verily he seemed to believe in it. Was
it not so, neighbour Obstinate?&quot; enquired
Pliable, stroking his leg.</p>

<p>&quot;Believed in what, my friend?&quot; said
Obstinate, in a dull voice.</p>

<p>&quot;About Mount Zion, and the Crowns of
Glory, and the Harps of Gold, and such like,&quot;
said Pliable uneasily&mdash;&quot;at least, it is said so;
so 'tis said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Believed!&quot; retorted a smooth young man
who seemed to feel the heat, and sat by the
staircase door. &quot;That's an easy task&mdash;to
believe, sir. Ask any pretty minikin!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I'd make bold to enquire of yonder
Liveloose,&quot; said a thick, monotonous voice (a
Mr. Dull's, so Reverie informed me), &quot;if
mebbe he be referring to one of his own, or
that fellow Sloth's devilish fairy tales? I
know one yet he'll eat again some day.&quot;</p>

<p>At which remark all laughed consumedly,
save Dull.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, one thing Christian had, and none
can deny it,&quot; said Pliable, a little hotly, &quot;and
that was Imagination? <i>I</i> shan't forget the
tales he was wont to tell: what say you,
Superstition?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Superstition lifted dark, rather vacant
eyes on Pliable. &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he said:
&quot;Flame, and sigh, and lamentation. My
God, my God, gentlemen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oo-ay, Oo-ay,&quot; yelped the voice of Mistrust,
startled out of silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Oo-ay,&quot; whistled Malice, under his breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Tush, tush!&quot; broke in Obstinate again, and
snapped his fingers in the air. &quot;And what is
this precious Imagination? Whither doth it
conduct a man, but to beggary, infamy, and
the mad-house? Look ye to it, friend Pliable!
'Tis a devouring flame; give it but wind and
leisure, the fairest house is ashes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ashes; ashes!&quot; mocked one called Cruelty,
who had more than once taken my attention
with his peculiar contortions&mdash;&quot;talking of
ashes, what of Love-the-log Faithful, Master
Tongue-stump? What of Love-the-log
Faithful?&quot;</p>

<p>At which Liveloose was so extremely
amused, the tears stood in his eyes for
laughing.</p>

<p>I looked round for Mistrust, and easily
recognised my friend by his hare-like face,
and the rage in his little active eyes. But
unfortunately, as I turned to enquire somewhat
of Reverie, Liveloose suddenly paused
in his merriment with open mouth; and the
whole company heard my question, &quot;But who
was Love-the-log Faithful?&quot;</p>

<p>I was at once again the centre of attention,
and Mr. Obstinate rose very laboriously from
his settle and held out a great hand to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm pleased to meet thee,&quot; he said, with
a heavy bow. &quot;There's a dear heart with
my good neighbour Superstition yonder who
will present a very fair account of that misguided
young man. Madam Wanton, here's
a young gentleman that never heard tell of
our old friend Love-the-log.&quot;</p>

<p>A shrill peal of laughter greeted this sally.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Faithful was a young gentleman,
sir,&quot; explained the woman civilly enough,
&quot;who preferred his supper hot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Madam Wanton, my dear, my dear!&quot;
cried a long-nosed woman nearly helpless with
amusement.</p>

<p>I saw Superstition gazing darkly at me.
He shook his head as I was about to reply,
so I changed my retort. &quot;Who, then, was
Mr. Christian?&quot; I enquired simply.</p>

<p>At that the house shook with the roar of
laughter that went up.</p>

<span>&mdash;RICHARD CRASHAW.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>&quot;Believe me, neighbours,&quot; said Malice
softly, when this uproar was a little abated,
&quot;there is nought so strange in the question.
It meaneth only that this young gentleman
hath not enjoyed the pleasure of your company
before. Will it amaze you to learn, my
friends, that Christian is like to be immortal
only because you <i>talk</i> him out of the grave?
One brief epitaph, gentlemen, would let him
rot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, but I'll tell the gentleman who
Christian was, and with pleasure,&quot; cried a
lucid, rather sallow little man that had sat
quietly smiling and listening. &quot;My name, let
me tell you, is Atheist, sir; and Christian was
formerly a very near neighbour of an old
friend of my family's&mdash;Mr. Sceptic. They
lived, sir&mdash;at least in those days&mdash;opposite
to one another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is a great talker,&quot; whispered Reverie in
my ear. But the company evidently found
his talk to their taste. They sat as still and
attentive around him, as though before an
extemporary preacher.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; continued Atheist, &quot;being, in a
sense, neighbours, Christian in his youth would
often confide in my friend; though, assuredly,
Sceptic never sought his confidences. And
it seemeth he began to be perturbed and
troubled over the discovery that it is impossible&mdash;at
least in this plain world&mdash;to eat
your cake, yet have it. And by some ill
chance he happened at this time on a mouldy
old folio in my friend's house that had been
the property of his maternal grandmother&mdash;the
subtlest old tome you ever set eyes on,
though somewhat too dark and extravagant
and heady for a sober man of the world like
me. 'Twas called the Bible, sir&mdash;a collection
of legends and fables of all times, tongues, and
countries threaded together, mighty ingeniously
I grant, and in as plausible a style as
any I know, if a little lax and flowery in
parts.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Christian borroweth the book of my
friend&mdash;never to return it. And being feeble
and credulous, partly by reason of his simple
wits, and partly by reason of the sad condition a
froward youth had reduced him to, he accepts
the whole book&mdash;from Apple to Vials&mdash;for
truth. In fact, 'he ate the little book,' as one
of the legendary kings it celebrates had done
before him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; broke in Cruelty wildly, &quot;and has
ever since gotten the gripes.&quot;</p>

<p>Atheist inclined his head. &quot;Putting it
coarsely, gentlemen, such was the case,&quot; he
said. &quot;And away at his wit's end he hasteneth,
waning and shivering, to a great bog or
quagmire&mdash;that my friend Pliable will answer
to&mdash;and plungeth in. 'Tis the same story
repeated. He could be temperate in nought.
<i>I</i> knew the bog well; but I knew the stepping-stones
better. Believe me, I have traversed
the narrow way this same Christian took,
seeking the harps and pearls and the <i>elixir vit&aelig;</i>,
these many years past. The book inciteth
ye to it. It sets a man's heart on fire&mdash;that's
weak enough to read it&mdash;with its pomp, and
rhetoric, and far-away promises, and lofty
counsels. Oh, fine words, who is not their
puppet! I climbed 'Difficulty.' I snapped
my fingers at the grinning Lions. I passed
cautiously through the 'Valley of the Shadow'&mdash;wild
scenery, sir! I visited that prince of
bubbles also, Giant Despair, in his draughty
castle. And&mdash;though boasting be far from
me!&mdash;fetched Liveloose's half-brother out of
a certain charnel-house near by.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Thus far</i>, sir, I went. But I have not
yet found the world so barren of literature
as to write a book about it. I have not yet
found the world so barren of ingratitude as
to seek happiness by stabbing in the back
every friend I ever had. I have not yet
forsaken wife and children; neighbours and
kinsmen; home, ease, and tenderness, for a
whim, a dream, a passing qualm. No, sir;
'tis this Christian's ignorant hardness-of-heart
that is his bane. Knowing little, he prateth
much. He would pinch and contract the
Universe to his own fantastical pattern. He
is tedious, he is pragmatical, and&mdash;I affirm it
in all sympathy and sorrow&mdash;he is crazed.
Malice, haply, is a little sharp at times. And
neighbour Obstinate dealeth full weight with
his opinions. But this Christian Flown-to-Glory,
as the urchins say, pinks with a
bludgeon. He cannot endure an honest doubt.
He distorteth a mere difference of opinion
into a roaring Tophet. And because he is
helpless, solitary, despised in the world;
because he is impotent to refute, and too
stubborn to hear and suffer people a little
higher and weightier, a leetle wiser than he&mdash;why,
beyond the grave he must set his hope
in vengeance. Beyond the grave&mdash;bliss for his
own shade; fire and brimstone, eternal woe
for theirs. Ay, and 'tis not but for a season
will he vex us, but for ever, and for ever,
and for ever&mdash;if he knoweth in the least
what he meaneth by the phrase. And this
he calls 'Charity.'</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sirs, beyond the grave he would
condemn us, beyond the grave&mdash;a place of
peace whereto I deem there are not many
here but will be content at length to come;
and I not least content, when my duty is
done, my children provided for, and my last
suspicion of fear and folly suppressed.</p>

<p>&quot;To conclude, sir&mdash;and beshrew me, gentlemen,
how time doth fly in talk!&mdash;this
Christian goeth his way. We, each in accord
with his caprice and conscience, go ours. We
envy him not his vapours, his terrors, or his
shameless greed of reward. Why, then, doth
he envy us our wealth, our success, our gaiety,
our content? He raves. He is haunted.
What is man but as grass, and the flower of
grass? Come the sickle, he is clean gone.
I can but repeat it, sir, our poor neighbour
was crazed: 'tis Christian in a word.&quot;</p>

<p>A sigh, a murmur of satisfaction and relief,
rose from the company, as if one and all had
escaped by Mr. Atheist's lucidity out of a
very real peril.</p>

<p>I thanked him for his courtesy, and in
some confusion turned to Reverie with the
remark that I thought I now recollected to
have heard Christian's name, but understood
he had indeed arrived, at last, at the Celestial
City for which he had set out.</p>

<p>&quot;Celestial twaddle, sir!&quot; cried Mr. Obstinate
hoarsely. &quot;He went stark, staring mad, and
now is dust, as we shall soon all be, that's
certain.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Cruelty rose out of his chair and
elbowed his way to the door. He opened it
and looked out.</p>

<p>&quot;I would,&quot; he said, &quot;I had known of this
Christian before he started. Step you down
to Vanity Fair, Sir Stranger, if the mood take
you; and we'll show you as pretty a persuasion
against pilgrimage as ever you saw.&quot;
He opened his mouth where he stood between
me and the stars. &quot;... There's many more!&quot;
he added with difficulty, as if his rage was too
much for him. He spat into the air and
went out.</p>

<p>Presently after Liveloose rose up, smiling
softly, and groped after him.</p>

<p>A little silence followed their departure.</p>

<p>&quot;You must tell your friend, Mr. Reverie,&quot;
said Atheist good-humouredly, &quot;that Mr.
Cruelty says more than he means. To my
mind he is mistaken&mdash;too energetic; but
his intentions are good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a staunch, dependable fellow,&quot; said
Obstinate, patting down the wide cuffs he
wore.</p>

<p>But even at that moment a stranger softly
entered the inn out of the night. His face
was of the grey of ashes, and he looked once
round on us all with a still, appalling
glance that silenced the words on my lips.</p>

<p>We sat without speech&mdash;Obstinate yawning,
Atheist smiling lightly, Superstition
nibbling his nails, Reverie with chin drawn
a little back, Pliable bolt upright, like a
green and white wand, Mistrust blinking
his little thin lids; but all with eyes fixed
on this stranger, who deemed himself, it
seemed, among friends.</p>

<p>He turned his back on us and sipped his
drink under the heedless, deep, untroubled
gaze of Mrs. Nature, and passed out softly
and harmlessly as he had come in.</p>

<p>Reverie stood up like a man surprised
and ill at ease. He turned to me. &quot;I
know him only by repute, by hearsay,&quot; he
said with an effort. &quot;He is a stranger to
us all, indeed, sir&mdash;to all.&quot;</p>

<p>Obstinate, with a very flushed face, thrust
his hand into his breeches' pocket. &quot;Nay,
sir,&quot; he said, &quot;my purse is yet here. What
more would you have?&quot;</p>

<p>At which Pliable laughed, turning to the
women.</p>

<p>I put on my hat and followed Reverie to
the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; I said, &quot;but I have no
desire to stay in this house over-night.
And if you would kindly direct me to the
nearest way out of the village, I will have
my horse saddled now and be off.&quot;</p>

<p>And then I noticed that Superstition stood
in the light of the doorway looking down
on us.</p>

<p>&quot;There's Christian's way,&quot; he said, as if
involuntarily....</p>

<p>&quot;Lodge with me to-night,&quot; Reverie answered,
&quot;and in the morning you shall
choose which way to go you will.&quot;</p>

<p>I thanked him heartily and turned in to
find Rosinante.</p>

<p>The night was now fine, but moist and
sultry, and misty in the distance. It was
late, too, for few candles gleamed beneath
the moonlight from the windows round
about the smooth village-green. Even as we
set out, I leading Rosinante by her bridle,
and Superstition on my left hand, out of
heavenly Leo a bright star wheeled, fading
as it fell. And soon high hedges hid utterly
the &quot;World's End&quot; behind us, out of sight
and sound.</p>

<p>I observed when the trees had laid their
burdened branches overhead, and the thick-flowered
bushes begun to straiten our way,
that this Mr. Superstition who had desired
to accompany us was of a very different
courage from that his manner at the inn
seemed to profess.</p>

<p>He walked with almost as much caution
and ungainliness as Mistrust, his deep and
shining eyes busily searching the gloom to
left and right of him. Indeed, those same
dark eyes of his reminded me not a little
of Mrs. Nature's, they were so full of what
they could not tell.</p>

<p>He was on foot; my new friend Reverie,
like myself, led his horse, a pale, lovely
creature with delicate nostrils and deep-smouldering
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;You must think me very bold to force
my company on you,&quot; said Superstition
awkwardly, turning to Reverie, &quot;but my
house is never so mute with horror as in
these moody summer nights when thunder
is in the air. See there!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p>As if the distant sky had opened, the
large, bright, harmless lightning quivered
and was gone, revealing on the opposing
hills forest above forest unutterably dark
and still.</p>

<p>&quot;Surely,&quot; I said, &quot;that is not the way
Christian took?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They say,&quot; Reverie answered, &quot;the
Valley of the Shadow of Death lies between
those hills.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Atheist,&quot; I said, &quot;<i>that</i> acid little
man, did he indeed walk there alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard,&quot; muttered Superstition,
putting out his hand, &quot;'tis fear only that
maketh afraid. Atheist has no fear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what of Cruelty,&quot; I said, &quot;and
Liveloose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; answered Superstition, &quot;Cruelty
works cunningest when he is afraid; and
Liveloose never talks about himself. None
the less there's not a tree but casts a shadow.
I met once an earnest yet very popular
young gentleman of the name of Science,
who explained almost everything on earth
to me so clearly, and patiently, and fatherly,
I thought I should evermore sleep in peace.
But we met at noon. Believe me, sir, I
would have followed Christian and his friend
Hopeful very willingly long since; for as
for Cruelty and Obstinate and all that
clumsy rabble, I heed them not. Indeed
my cousin Mistrust <i>did</i> go, and as you see
returned with a caution; and a poor young
school-fellow of mine, Jack Ignorance, came
to an awful end. But it is because I owe
partly to Christian and not all to myself
this horrible solitude in which I walk that
I dare not risk a deeper. It would be, I
feel sure. And so I very willingly beheld
Faithful burned; it restored my confidence.
And here, sir,&quot; he added, almost with gaiety,
&quot;lives my friend Mrs. Simple, a widow.
She enjoys my company and my old fables,
and we keep the blinds down against these
mountains, and candles burning against the
brighter lightnings.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, Superstition bade us good-night
and passed down a little by-lane on
our left towards a country cottage, like a
dreaming bower of roses beneath the moon.</p>

<p>But Reverie and I continued on as if the
moon herself as patiently pursued us. And
by-and-by we came to a house called
Gloom, whose gardens slope down with
plashing fountains and glimmering banks of
flowers into the shadow and stillness of a
broad valley, named beneath the hills of
Silence, Peace.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Even as we entered the gates of Mr. Reverie's
house beneath embowering chestnuts, there
advanced across the moonlit spaces to meet
us a figure on foot like ourselves, leading his
horse. He was in armour, yet unarmed.
His steel glittered cold and blue; his fingers
hung ungauntleted; and on his pale face dwelt
a look never happy warrior wore yet. He
seemed a man Mars lends to Venus out of
war to unhappy idleness. The disillusionment
of age was in his face: yet he was youthful,
I suppose; scarce older than Mercutio, and
once, perhaps, as light of wit.</p>

<p>He took my hand in a grasp cold and
listless, and smiled from mirthless eyes.</p>

<p>Yet there was something strangely taking
in this solitary knight-at-arms. She for whom
he does not fight, I thought, must have somewhat
of the immortals to grace her warrior
with. And if it were only shadows that beset
him and obscured his finer heart, shadows
they were of myrtle and rhododendron, with
voices shrill and small as the sparrows', and
eyes of the next-to-morning stars.</p>

<p>Indeed, these gardens whispered, and the
wind at play in the air seemed to bear far-away
music, dying and falling.</p>

<p>We entered the house and sat down to
supper in a low room open to the night.
Reverie recounted our evening's talk. &quot;I
wish,&quot; he said, turning to his friend, &quot;you
would accompany Mr. Brocken and me one
night to the 'World's End' to hear these
fellows talk. Such arrogance, such assurance,
such bigotry and blindness and foxiness!&mdash;yet,
on my word, a kind of gravity with it all, as
if the scarecrows had some real interest in the
devil's tares they guard. Come now, let it be
a bargain between us, and leave this endless
search awhile.&quot;</p>

<p>But the solitary knight shook his head.
&quot;They would jeer me out of knowledge,&quot; he
said. &quot;Why, Reverie, the children cease their
play when I pass, and draw their tops and
marbles out of the dust, and gaze till I am
hid from sight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is fancy, only fancy,&quot; replied Reverie;
&quot;children stare at all things new to them in
the world. How else could they recognise
and learn again&mdash;how else forget? But as for
this rabble's mockery, there is a she-bear left
called Oblivion which is their mistress, and
will some day silence every jeer.&quot;</p>

<p>The solitary knight shook his head again,
eyeing me solemnly as if in hope to discern
in my face the sorcery that held himself in
thrall.</p>

<p>The few wax tapers gave but light enough
to find the way from goblet to mouth. As
for Reverie's wine, I ask no other, for it had
the poppy's scarlet, and overcame weariness
so subtly I almost forgot these were the
hours of sleep we spent in waking; forgot,
too, as if of the lotus, all thought of effort
and hope.</p>

<p>After all, thought I as I sipped, effort is the
flaw that proves men mortal; while as for
hope, who would seek a seed that floats on
every wind and smothers the world with weeds
that bear no fruit? It was, in fact, fare very
different from the ale and cheese of the
&quot;World's End.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you yourself,&quot; I said to Mr. Reverie
presently; &quot;in all the talk at the inn you kept
a very scrupulous silence&mdash;discreet enough, I
own. But now, what truly <i>was</i> this Christian
of whom we heard so much? and why, may
I ask, do his neighbours slander the dead?
You yourselves, did you ever meet with
him?&quot; I turned from one to the other of
my companions as they glanced uneasily each
at each.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Reverie rather deliberately,
&quot;I have met him and talked with him. I
often think of him, in spite of myself. Yet he
was a man of little charm. He certainly had
a remarkable gift for estranging his friends.
He was a foe to the most innocent compromise.
For myself, I found not much
humour in him, no eye for grace or art, and
a limited imagination that was yet his absolute
master. Nevertheless, as you hint, these
fellows, no more than I, can forget him. Nor
you?&quot; He turned to the other.</p>

<p>&quot;Christian,&quot; he replied, &quot;I remember him.
We were friends a little while. Faithful I
knew also. Faithful was to the last my friend.
Ah! Reverie, then&mdash;how many years ago!&mdash;there
was a child we loved, all three: do you
remember? I see the low, green wall, cool
from how many a summer's shadows, the
clusters of green apples on the bough. And
in the early morning we would go, carrying
torn-off branches, and shouting our songs
through the fields, till we came to the shadow
and the hush of the woods. Ay, Reverie,
and we would burst in on silence, each his
heart beating, and play there. And perhaps
it was Hopeful who would steal away from
us, and the others play on; or perhaps you
into the sunlight that maddened the sheltered
bird to flit and sing in the orchard where
the little child we loved played&mdash;not yet
sad, but how much beloved; not yet weary
of passing shadows, and simple creatures, and
boy's rough gifts and cold hands. But I&mdash;with
me it was ever evening, when the
blackbird bursts harshly away. Then it was
so still in the orchard, and in the curved
bough so solitary, that the nightingale,
cowering, would almost for fear begin to sing,
and stoop to the bending of the bough, her
sidelong eyes in shade; while the stars began
to stand in the stations above us, ever bright,
and all the night was peace. Then would I
dream on&mdash;dream of the face I loved, Innocence,
O Innocence!&quot;</p>

<p>It was a strange outburst. His voice rose
almost to a chant, full of a forlorn music.
But even as he ceased, we heard in the
following silence, above the plashing of the
restless fountains, beyond, far and faint, a wild
and stranger music welling. And I saw from
the porch that looks out from the house called
Gloom, &quot;La belle Dame sans Merci&quot; pass
riding with her train, who rides in beauty
beneath the huntress, heedless of disguise.
Across from far away, like leaves of autumn,
skirred the dappled deer. The music grew,
timbrel and pipe and tabor, as beneath the
glances of the moon the little company sped,
transient as a rainbow, elusive as a dream.
I saw her maidens bound and sandalled, with
all their everlasting flowers; and advancing
soundless, unreal, the silver wheels of that
unearthly chariot amid the Fauns. On, on
they gamboled, hoof in yielding turf, blowing
reed melodies, mocking water, their lips laid
sidelong, their eyes aleer along the smoothness
of their flutes.</p>

<p>And when I turned again to my companions,
with I know not what old folly in
my eyes, I know not what unanswerable cry in
my heart, Reverie alone was at my side. I
seemed to see the long fringes of the lake,
the sedge withered, the grey waters restless in
the bonds of the wind, tuneless and chill; all
these happy gardens swept bare and flowerless;
and the far hills silent in the unattainable dawn.</p>

<p>&quot;She pipes, he follows,&quot; said Reverie; &quot;she
sets the tune, he dances. Yet, sir, on my
soul, I believe it is the childish face of that
same Innocence we kept tryst with long ago
he pursues on and on, through what sad
labyrinths we, who dream not so wildly,
cannot by taking thought come to guess.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next two days passed serenely and
quietly at Reverie's. We read together,
rode, walked, and talked together, and
listened in the evening to music. For a
sister of Reverie's lived not far distant, who
visited him while I was there, and took
supper with us, delighting us with her wit
and spirit and her youthful voice.</p>

<p>But though Reverie more than once
suggested it, I could not bring myself to
return to the &quot;World's End&quot; and its
garrulous company. Whether it was the
moist, grey face of Mr. Cruelty I most
abhorred, or Stubborn's slug-like eye, or
the tongue-stump of my afflicted guide, I
cannot say.</p>

<p>Moreover, I had begun to feel a very
keen curiosity to see the way that had
lured Christian on with such graceless
obstinacy. They had spoken of remorse,
poverty, pride, world-failure, even insanity,
even vice: but these appeared to me only
such things as might fret a man to set
violently out on, not to persist in such
a course; or likelier yet, to abandon hope,
to turn back from heights that trouble
or confusion set so far, and made seem
dreams.</p>

<p>How could I help, too, being amused to
think how vastly strange these fellows considered
a man's venturing whither his star
beckoned; though that star were only power,
only fame, only beauty, only peace? What
wonder they were many?</p>

<p>Not far from this place, Reverie informed
me, were pitched the booths of Vanity Fair.
This, by his account, was a place one ought
to visit, if only for the satisfaction of leaving
it behind. But I have heard more animated
accounts of it elsewhere.</p>

<p>As for Reverie himself, he seemed only
desirous to contemplate; never to taste, to
win, or to handle. He needed but refuse
reality to what shocked or teased him, to
find it harmless and entertaining. He was
a dreamer whom the heat and shout of
battle could not offend.</p>

<p>Perhaps he perceived my restlessness to be
gone, for he himself suggested that I should
stay till the next morning, and then, if I
so pleased, he would see me a mile or two
on my way.</p>

<p>&quot;For the Pitiless Lady,&quot; he said, smiling,
&quot;takes many disguises, sometimes of the sun,
sometimes of evening, sometimes of night;
and I would at least save you from the fate
that has made my poor friend a phantom
before he is a shade.&quot;</p>

</div></div>


<p>So Reverie, as he had promised, rode out
with me a few miles to see me on my way.
Above the gloom and stillness of the valley
the scene began to change again. I was
glad as I could be to view once more the
tossing cornfields and the wind at play with
shadow. Near and far, woods and pastures
smoked beneath the sun. I know not
through how many arches of the elms and
green folds of the meadows I kept watch
on the chimneys of a farmhouse above its
trees.</p>

<p>But Reverie, the further we journeyed,
the less he said. I almost chafed to see his
heedless eyes turned upon some inward
dream, while here, like life itself, stood cloud
and oak, warbled bird and brook beneath
the burning sun. I saw again in memory
the silver twilight of the moon, and the
crazy face of Love's Warrior, haunter of
shade. Let him but venture into the open,
I thought, hear again the distant lowing of
the oxen, the rooks cawing in the elms,
see again the flocks upon the hillside!</p>

<p>I suppose this was her home my heart
had turned to. This was my dust; night's
was his. For me the wild rose and the
fields of harvest; for him closed petals, the
chantry of the night wind, phantom lutes
and voices. And, as if he had overheard
my thoughts, Reverie turned at the cross-ways.</p>

<p>&quot;You will come back again,&quot; he said.
&quot;They tell me in distant lands men worship
Time, set up a shrine to him in every
street, and treasure his emblem next their
hearts. There, they say, even the lover
babbles of hours, and the dreamer measures
sleep with a pendulum. Well, my house is
secluded, and the world is far; and to me
Time is naught. Return, sir, then, when it
pleases you. Besides,&quot; he added, smiling
faintly, &quot;there is always company at the
World's End.&quot;</p>

<p>The crisp sunbeams rained upon his pale
and delicate horse, its equal-plaited mane,
on the darkness of his cloak, that dream-delighted
face. Here smouldered gold, here
flushed crimson, and here the curved
damaskening of his bridle glistened and
gleamed. He was a strange visitant to the
open day, between the green hedges, beneath
the enormous branching of the elms. And
there I bade him farewell.</p>

<p>Some day, perhaps, I shall return as he
has foretold, for it is ever easy to find again
the house of Reverie&mdash;to them who have
learned the way.</p>

<p>On I journeyed, then, following as I had
been directed the main road to Vanity Fair.
But whether it is that the Fair is more
difficult to arrive at than to depart from,
or is really a hard day's journey even from
the gay parlour of the World's End, it
already began to be evening, and yet no
sign of bunting or booth or clamour or
smoke.</p>

<p>And it was at length to a noiseless Fair,
far from all vanity, that I came at sunset&mdash;the
cypresses of a solitary graveyard. I was
tired out and desired only rest; so dismounting
and leading Rosinante, I turned
aside willingly into its peace.</p>

<p>It seemed I had entered a new earth.
The lane above had wandered on in the
gloaming of its hedges and over-arching
trees. Here, all the clouds of sunset stood,
caught up in burning gold. Even as I
paused, dazzled a moment by the sudden
radiance, from height to height the wild
bright rose of evening ran. Not a tottering
stone, black, well-nigh shapeless with age,
not a green bush, but seemed to dwell unconsumed
in its own fire above this desolate
ground. The trees that grew around me&mdash;willow
and yew, thorn and poplar&mdash;were
but flaming cages for the wild birds that
perched in their branches.</p>

<p>Above these sound-dulled mansions trod
lightly, as if of thought, Rosinante's gilded
shoes. I wandered on in a strange elation
of mind, filled with a desperate desire ever
to remember how flamed this rose between
earth and sky, how throbbed this jargon of
delight. And turning as if in hope to share
my enthusiasm, a childish peal of laughter
showed me I was not alone.</p>

<p>Beneath a canopy of holly branches and
yew two children sat playing. The nearer
child's hair was golden, glistening round his
face of roses, and he it was who had laughed,
tumbling on the sward. But the face of
the further child was white almost as crystal,
and the dark hair that encircled his head
with its curved lines seemed as it were the
shadow of the gold it showed beside. These
children, it was plain, had been running and
playing across the tombs; but now they
were stooping together at some earnest
sport. To me, even if they had seen me,
they as yet paid no heed.</p>

<p>I passed slowly towards them, deeming
them at first of solitude's creation, my eyes
dazzled so with the sun. But as I approached,
so the branches beneath which
they played gradually disparted, and I saw
not far distant from them one sitting
who evidently had these jocund boys in
charge.</p>

<p>I could not but hesitate awhile as I surveyed
them. These were no mortal children
playing naked amid the rose of evening:
nor she who sat veiled and beautiful
beneath the ruinous tombs. I turned with
sudden dismay to depart from their presence
unobserved as I had entered; but the
children had now espied me, and came
running, filled with wonder of Rosinante and
the stranger beside her.</p>

<p>They stayed at a little distance from us
with dwelling eyes and parted lips. Then
the fairer and, as it seemed to me, elder of
the brothers stooped and plucked a few
blades of grass and proffered them, half
fearfully, to the beast that amazed him.
But the other gave less heed to Rosinante,
fixed the filmy lustre of his eyes on me,
his wonderful young face veiled with that
wisdom which is in all children, and of an
immutable gravity.</p>

<p>But by this time, she who it seemed had
the charge of these children had followed
them with her eyes. To her then, leaving
Rosinante in an ecstasy of timidity before
such god-like boys, I addressed myself.</p>

<p>So might a traveller lost beneath strange
stars address unanswering Night. She, however,
raised a compassionate face to me
and listened with happy seriousness as to a
child returned in safety at evening from
some foolhardy venture. Yet there seemed
only a deeper youthfulness in her face for
all its eternity of brooding on her beauteous
children. Narrow leaves of olive formed her
chaplet. The darker wine-colours of the sea
changed in her eyes. There was no sense
of gloom or sorrowfulness in her company.
I began to see how the same still breast
might bear celestial children so diverse as
these, whose names, she told me presently,
were Sleep and Death.</p>

<p>I looked at the two children at play,
&quot;Ah! now,&quot; I said, almost involuntarily
&quot;the golden boy who has caught my horse's
bridle in his hand, is not he Sleep? and he
who considers his brother's boldness&mdash;that
one is Death?&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled with lovely vanity, and told
me how strange of heart young children
are. How they will alter and vary, never
the same for long together, but led by
indiscoverable caprices and obedient to some
further will. She smiled and said how that
sometimes, when the birds hush suddenly
from song, Sleep would creep tenderly and
sadly to her knees, and Death clasp her
roguishly, as if in some secret with the
beams of morning. So would they change,
one to the likeness of the other. But Sleep
was, perhaps, of the gentler disposition; a
little obstinate and headstrong; at times,
indeed, beyond all cajolery; yet very sweet
of impulse and ardent to make amends.
But Death's caprices baffled even her. He
seemed now so pitiless and unlovely of
heart; and now, as if possessed, passionate
and swift; and now would break away
burning from her arms in an infinite
tenderness.</p>

<p>But best she loved them when there came
a transient peace to both; and looking upon
them laid embraced in the shadow-casting
moonbeam, not even she could undoubtingly
touch the brow of each beneath their likened
hair, and say this is the elder, and this the
dreamless younger of the boys.</p>

<p>Seeing, too, my eyes cast upon the
undecipherable letters of the tomb by which
we sat, she told me how that once, near
before dawn, she had awoke in the twilight
to find their places empty where the children
had lain at her side, and had sought on, at
last to find them even here, weeping and
quarrelling, and red with anger. Little by
little, and with many tears, she had gleaned
the cause of their quarrel&mdash;how that, like
very children, they had run a race at
cockcrow, and all these stones and the
slender bones and ashes beneath to be the
prize; and how that, running, both had
come together to the goal set, and both
had claimed the victory.</p>

<p>&quot;Yet both seem happy now to share it,&quot;
I said, &quot;or how else were they comforted?&quot;
Nor did I consider before she told me
that they will run again when they be
grown men, Sleep and Death, in just such
a thick darkness before dawn; and one
called Love will then run with them, who
is very vehement and fleet of foot, and
never turns aside, nor falters. He who then
shall win may ask a different prize. For
truth to tell, she said, only children can find
delight for long in dust and ruin.</p>

<p>At that moment Death himself came
hastening to his mother, and, taking her
hand, turned to the enormous picture of
the skies as if in some faint apprehension.
But Sleep saw nothing amiss, lay at full
length among the &quot;cool-rooted flowers,&quot;
while Rosinante grazed beside him.</p>

<p>I told her also, in turn, of my journey;
and that although transient, or everlasting,
solace of all restlessness and sorrow and too-wild
happiness may be found in them, yet
men think not often on these divine children.</p>

<p>&quot;As for this one,&quot; I said, looking down
into the pathless beauty of Death's grey
eyes, &quot;some fear, some mock, some despise
him; some violently, some without complaint
pursue; most men would altogether
dismiss, and forget him. He is but a
child, no older than the sea, no stranger
than the mountains, pure and cold as the
water-springs. Yet to the bolster of fever
his vision flits; and pain drags a heavy
net to snare him; and silence is his echoing
gallery; and the gold of Sleep his final veil.
They shall play on; and see, lady, flame has
left the clouds; the birds are at rest. The
earth breathes in, and it is day; and exhales
her breath, and it is night. Let them then
play secret and innocent between her breasts,
comfort her with silence above the tempest
of her heart.... But I!&mdash;what am I?&mdash;a
traveller, footsore and far.&quot;</p>

<p>And then it was that I became conscious
of a warm, sly, youthful hand in mine, and
turned, half in dread, to see only happy
Sleep laughing under his glistening hair into
my eyes. I strove in vain against his
sorcery; rolled foolish orbs on that pure,
starry face; and then I smelled as it were
rain, and heard as it were tempestuous
forest-trees&mdash;fell asleep among the tombs.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Surely some hueless poppy blossomed in
the darkness of those ruins, or the soulless
ashes of the dead breathe out a drowsy
influence. Never have I slept so heavily,
yet never perhaps beneath so cold a tester.
Sunbeams streaming between the crests of
the cypresses awoke me. I leapt up as if a
hundred sentinels had shouted&mdash;where none
kept visible watch.</p>

<p>An odour of a languid sweetness pervaded
the air. There was no wind to stir the
dew-besprinkled trees. The old, scarred
gravestones stood in a thick sunshine, afloat
with bees. But Rosinante had preferred to
survey sunshine out of shade. In lush grass
I found her, the picture of age, foot crook'd,
and head dejected.</p>

<p>Yet she followed me uncomplaining along
these narrow avenues of silence, and without
more ado turned her trivial tail on Death
and his dim flocks, and well-nigh scampered
me off into the vivid morning. Soon afterwards,
with Hunger in the saddle, we began
to climb a road almost precipitous, and
stony in the extreme. Often enough we
breathed ourselves as best we could in the
still, sultry air, and rested on the sun-dappled
slopes. But at length we came out
upon the crest, and surveyed in the first
splendour of day a region of extraordinary
grandeur.</p>

<p>Beneath a clear sky to the east stood a
range of mountains, cold and changeless
beneath their snows. At my feet a great
river flowed, broken here and there with
isles in the bright flood. The dark champaign
that flanked its shores was of an unusual
verdure. Mystery and peril brooded on
those distant ravines, the vapours of their
far-descending cataracts. In such abysmal
fastnesses as these the Hyrcan tiger might
hide his surly generations. This was an air
for the sun-disdaining eagle, a country of
transcendent brightness, its flowers strangely
pure and perfect, its waters more limpid, its
grazing herds, its birds, its cedar trees, the
masters of their kind.</p>

<p>Yet not on these nearer glories my eyes
found rest. But, with a kind of heartache,
I gazed, as it were towards home, upon the
distant waters of the sea. Here, on the
crest of this green hill, was silence. There,
too, was profounder silence on the sea's
untrampled floor. Whence comes that angel
out of nought whispering into the ear strange
syllables? I know not; but so seemed I to
stand&mdash;a shattered instrument in the world,
past all true music, o'er which none the less
the invisible lute-master stooped. Could I
but catch, could I but in words express the
music his bent fingers intended, the mystery,
the peace&mdash;well; then I should indeed
journey solitary on the face of the earth,
a changeling in its cities.</p>

<p>I half feared to descend into a country
so diverse from any I had yet seen.
Hitherto at least I had encountered little
else than friendliness. But here&mdash;doves in
eyries! I stood, twisting my fingers in
Rosinante's mane, debating and debating.
And she turned her face to me, and looked
with age into my eyes: and I know not
how woke courage in me again.</p>

<p>&quot;On then?&quot; I said, on the height. And
the gentle beast leaned forward and coughed
into the valley what might indeed be
&quot;Yea!&quot;</p>

<p>So we began to descend. Down we went,
alone, yet not unhappy, until in a while
I discovered, about a hundred yards in
advance of me, another traveller on the
road, ambling easily along at an equal pace
with mine. I know not how far I followed
in his track debating whether to overtake
and to accost him, or to follow on till a
more favourable chance offered.</p>

<p>But Chance&mdash;avenger of all shilly-shally&mdash;settled
the matter offhand. For my traveller,
after casting one comprehensive glance
towards the skies, suddenly whisked off at a
canter that quickly carried him out of sight.</p>

<p>A chill wind had begun to blow, lifting
in gusts dust into the air and whitening
the tree-tops. As suddenly, calm succeeded.
A cloud of flies droned fretfully about my
ears. And I watched advancing, league-high,
transfigured with sunbeams, the
enormous gloom of storm. The sun smote
from a silvery haze upon its peaks and
gorges. Wind, far above the earth, moaned,
and fell; only to sound once more in the
distance in a mournful trumpeting. Lightnings
played along the desolate hills. The
sun was darkened. A vast flight of snowy,
arrow-winged birds streamed voiceless beneath
his place. And day withdrew its boundaries,
spread to the nearer forests a bright
amphitheatre, fitful with light, whereof it
seemed to me Rosinante with her poor
burden was the centre and the butt. I
confess I began to dread lest even my
mere surmise of danger should engage the
piercing lightnings; as if in the mystery of
life storm and a timorous thought might
yet be of a kin.</p>

<p>We hastened on at the most pathetic of
gallops. Nor seemed indeed the beauteous
lightning to regard at all that restless mote
upon the cirque of its entranced fairness.
In an instantaneous silence I heard a tiny
beat of hoofs; in instantaneous gloom
recognised almost with astonishment my
own shape bowed upon the saddle. It
was a majestic entry into a kingdom so
far-famed.</p>

<p>The storm showed no abatement when at
last I found shelter. From far away I had
espied in the immeasurable glare a country
barn beneath trees. Arrived there, I almost
fell off my horse into as incongruous and
lighthearted a company as ever was seen.</p>

<p>In the midst of the floor of the barn,
upon a heap of hay, sat a fool in
motley blowing with all his wind into a
pipe. It was a cunning tune he played
too, rich and heady. And so seemed the
company to find it, dancers&mdash;some thirty or
more&mdash;capering round him with all the
abandon heart can feel and heel can
answer to. As for pose, he whose horse
now stood smoking beside my own first
drew my attention&mdash;a smooth, small-bearded,
solemn man, a little beyond his prime. He
lifted his toes with such inimitable agility,
postured his fingers so daintily, conducted
his melon-belly with so much elegance, and
exhaled such a warm joy in the sport that
I could look at nothing else at first for
delight in him.</p>

<p>But there were slim maids too among the
plumper and ruddier, like crocuses, like
lilac, like whey, with all their fragrance
and freshness and lightness. Such eyes
adazzle dancing with mine, such nimble and
discreet ankles, such gimp English middles,
and such a gay delight in the mere grace
of the lilting and tripping beneath rafters
ringing loud with thunder, that Pan himself
might skip across a hundred furrows for
sheer envy to witness.</p>

<p>As for the jolly rustics that were jogging
their wits away with such delightful gravity,
but little time was given me to admire
them ere I also was snatched into the ring,
and found brown eyes dwelling with mine,
and a hand like lettuces in the dog-days.
Round and about we skipped in the golden
straw, amidst treasuries of hay, puffing and
spinning. And the quiet lightnings quivered
between the beams, and the monstrous
&quot;Ah!&quot; of the thunder submerged the pipe's
sweetness. Till at last all began to gasp
and blow indeed, and the nodding Fool to
sip, and sip, as if <i>in extremis</i> over his
mouthpiece. Then we rested awhile, with
a medley of shrill laughter and guffaws,
while the rain streamed lightning-lit upon
the trees and tore the clouds to tatters.</p>

<p>With some little circumstance my
traveller picked his way to me, and with
a grave civility bowed me a sort of general
welcome. Whereupon ensued such wit and
banter as made me thankful when the
opening impudence of a kind of jig set
the heels and the petticoats of the company
tossing once more. We danced the lightning
out, and piped the thunder from the
skies. And by then I was so faint with
fasting, and so deep in love with at least
five young country faces, that I scarcely
knew head from heels; still less, when a
long draught of a kind of thin, sweet ale
had mounted to its sphere.</p>

<p>Away we all trooped over the flashing
fields, noisy as jays in the fresh, sweet air,
some to their mowing, some to their milking,
but more, indeed, I truly suspect, to that
exquisite <i>Nirvana</i> from which the tempest's
travail had aroused them. I waved my
hand, striving in vain to keep my eyes on
one blest, beguiling face of all that glanced
behind them. But, she gone, I turned
into the rainy lane once more with my new
acquaintance, discreeter, but not less giddy,
it seemed, than I.</p>

<p>We had not far to go&mdash;past a meadow
or two, a low green wall, a black fish-pool&mdash;and
soon the tumbledown gables of
a house came into view. My companion
waved his open fingers at the crooked
casements and peered into my face.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, &quot;we will talk, we will
talk, you and I: I view it in your eye,
sir&mdash;clear and full and profound&mdash;such ever
goes with eloquence. 'Tis my delight.
What are we else than beasts?&mdash;beasts that
perish? I never tire; I never weary;&mdash;give
me to dance and to sing, but ever to talk:
then am I at ease. Heaven is just. Enter,
sir&mdash;enter!&quot;</p>

<p>He led me by a shady alley into his
orchard, and thence to a stable, where we
left Rosinante at hob-a-nob with his mare
over a friendly bottle of hay. And we ourselves
passed into the house, and ascended
a staircase into an upper chamber. This
chamber was raftered, its walls hung with
an obscure tapestry, its floor strewn with
sand, and its lozenged casement partly
shuttered against the blaze of sunshine that
flowed across the forests far away to the west.</p>

<p>My friend eyed me brightly and busily as
a starling. &quot;You danced fine, sir,&quot; he said.
&quot;Oh! it is a <i>pleasure</i> to me. Ay, and now
I come to consider it, methought I did
hear hoofs behind me that might yet be
echo. No, but I did <i>not</i> think: 'twas but
my ear cried to his dreaming master. Ever
dreaming; God help at last the awakening!
But well met, well met, I say again. I am
cheered. And you but just in time! Nay,
I would not have missed him for a ransom.
So&mdash;so&mdash;this leg, that leg; up now&mdash;hands
over down we go! Lackaday, I am old
bones for such freaks. Once!... '<i>Memento
mori</i>!' say I, and smell the shower the
sweeter for it. Be seated, sir, bench or
stool, wheresoever you'd be. You're looking
peaked. That burden rings in my skull
like a bagpipe. Toot-a-tootie, toot-a-toot!
Och, sad days!&quot;</p>

<p>We devoured our meal of cold meats
and pickled fish, fruit and junket and a kind
of harsh cheese, as if in contest for a wager.
And copious was the thin spicy wine with
which we swam it home. Ever and again
my host would desist, to whistle, or croon
(with a packed mouth) in the dismallest of
tenors, a stave or two of the tune we had
danced to, bobbing head and foot in sternest
time. Then a great vacancy would overspread
his face turned to the window, as
suddenly to gather to a cheerful smile, and
light, irradiated, once more on me. Then
down would drop his chin over his plate,
and away go finger and spoon among his
victuals in a dance as brisk and whole-hearted
as the other.</p>

<p>He took me out again into his garden
after supper, and we walked beneath the
trees.</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis bliss to be a bachelor, sir,&quot; he said,
gazing on the resinous trunk of an old
damson tree. &quot;I gorge, I guzzle; I am
merry, am melancholy; studious, harmonical,
drowsy,&mdash;and none to scold or deny me.
For the rest, why, youth is vain: yet youth
had pleasure&mdash;innocence and delight. I
chew the cud of many a peaceful acre.
Ay, I have nibbled roses in my time. But
now, what now? I have lived so long
far from courts and courtesy, grace and
fashion, and am so much my own close
and indifferent friend&mdash;Why! he is happy
who has solitude for housemate, company for
guest. I say it, I say it; I marry daily
wives of memory's fashioning, and dream at
peace.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed an old bone he picked with
Destiny.</p>

<p>&quot;There's much to be said,&quot; I replied as
profoundly as I could.</p>

<p>The air he now lulled youth asleep with
was a very cheerless threnody, but he
brightened once more at praise of his delightful
orchard.</p>

<p>&quot;You like it, sir? You speak kindly, sir.
It is my all; root and branch: how many
a summer's moons have I seen shine hereon!
I know it&mdash;there is bliss to come;&mdash;miraculous
Paradise for men even dull
as I. Yet 'twill be strange to me&mdash;without
my house and orchard. Age tends
to earth, sir, till even an odour may awake
the dead&mdash;a branch in the air call with its
fluttering a face beyond Time to vanquish
dear. 'Soul, soul,' I cry, 'forget thy dust,
forget thy vaunting ashes!'&mdash;and speak in
vain. So's life!&quot;</p>

<p>And when we had gone in again, and
candles had been lit in his fresh and narrow
chamber, seeing a viol upon a chest, I
begged a little music.</p>

<p>He quite eagerly, with a boyish peal of
laughter, complied; and sat down with a
very solemn face, his brows uplifted, and
sang between the candles to a pathetic air
this doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<p>And that finished with another burst of
laughter, he set very adroitly to the mimicry
of beasts and birds upon his frets. Never
have I seen a face so consummately the
action's. His every fibre answered to the
call; his eyebrows twitched like an orator's;
his very nose was plastic.</p>

<p>&quot;Hst!&quot; he cried softly; &quot;hither struts
chanticleer!&quot; &quot;Cock-a-diddle-doo!&quot; crowed
the wire. &quot;Now, prithee, Dame Partlett!&quot;
and down bustled a hen from an egg like
cinnamon. A cat with kittens mewed along
the string, anxious and tender.</p>

<p>&quot;A woodpecker,&quot; he cried, directing
momentarily a sedulous, clear eye on me.
And lo, &quot;inviolable quietness&quot; and the
smooth beech-boughs! &quot;And thus,&quot; he said,
sitting closer, &quot;the martlets were wont to
whimper about the walls of the castle of
Inverness, the castle of Macbeth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Macbeth!&quot; I repeated&mdash;&quot;Macbeth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he said, &quot;it was his seat while yet
a simple soldier&mdash;flocks and flocks of them,
wheeling hither, thither, in the evening air,
crying and calling.&quot;</p>

<p>I listened in a kind of confusion. &quot;... And
Duncan,&quot; I said....</p>

<p>He eyed me with immense pleasure, and
nodded with brilliant eyes on mine.</p>

<p>&quot;What looking man was he?&quot; I said at
last as carelessly as I dared. &quot;... The
King, you mean,&mdash;of Scotland.&quot;</p>

<p>He magnanimously ignored my confusion,
and paused to build his sentence.</p>

<p>&quot;'Duncan'?&quot; he said. &quot;The question
calls him straight to mind. A lean-locked,
womanish countenance; sickly, yet never
sick; timid, yet most obdurate; more sly
than politic. An <i>ignis fatuus</i>, sir, in a
world of soldiers.&quot; His eye wandered....
&quot;'Twas a marvellous sanative air, crisp and
pure; but for him, one draught and outer
darkness. I myself viewed his royal entry
from the gallery&mdash;pacing urbane to slaughter;
and I uttered a sigh to see him. 'Why,
sir, do you sigh to see the king?' cried one
softly that stood by. 'I sigh, my lord,' I
answered to the instant, 'at sight of a
monarch even Duncan's match!'&quot;</p>

<p>He looked his wildest astonishment at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Not, I'd have you remember&mdash;not that
'twas blood I did foresee.... To kill in
blood a man, and he a king, so near to
natural death ... foul, foul!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Macbeth?&quot; I said presently&mdash;&quot;Macbeth...?&quot;</p>

<p>He laid down his viol with prolonged care.</p>

<p>&quot;His was a soul, sir, nobler than his fate.
I followed him not without love from boyhood&mdash;a
youth almost too fine of spirit;
shrinking from all violence, over-nicely;
eloquent, yet chary of speech, and of a dark
profundity of thought. The questions he
would patter!&mdash;unanswerable, searching earth
and heaven through.... And who now
was it told me the traitor Judas's hair was
red?&mdash;yet not red his, but of a reddish
chestnut, fine and bushy. Children have
played their harmless hands at hide-and-seek
therein. O sea of many winds!</p>

<p>&quot;For come gloom on the hills, floods,
discolouring mist; breathe but some grandam's
tale of darkness and blood and
doubleness in his hearing: all changed.
Flame kindled; a fevered unrest drove him
out; and Ambition, that spotted hound of
hell, strained at the leash towards the Pit.</p>

<p>&quot;So runs the world&mdash;the ardent and the
lofty. We are beyond earth's story as 'tis
told, sir. All's shallower than the heart of
man.... Indeed, 'twas one more shattered
altar to Hymen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Hymen!'&quot; I said.</p>

<p>He brooded long and silently, clipping his
small beard. And while he was so brooding,
a mouse, a moth, dust&mdash;I know not what,
stirred the listening strings of his viol to
sound, and woke him with a start.</p>

<p>&quot;I vowed, sir, then, to dismiss all memory
of such unhappy deeds from mind&mdash;never
to speak again that broken lady's name.
Oh! I have seen sad ends&mdash;pride abased,
splendour dismantled, courage to terror
come, guilt to a crying guilelessness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Guilelessness?'&quot; I said. &quot;Lady Macbeth
at least was past all changing.&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor stood up and cast a deep
scrutiny on me, which yet, perhaps, was
partly on himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Perceive, sir,&quot; he said, &quot;this table&mdash;broader,
longer, splendidly burdened; and all
adown both sides the board, thanes and their
ladies, lords, and gentlemen, guests bidden
to a royal banquet. 'Twas then in that
bleak and dismal country&mdash;the Palace of
Forres. Torches flared in the hall; to every
man a servant or two: we sat in pomp.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused again, and gravely withdrew
behind the tapestry.</p>

<p>&quot;And presently,&quot; he cried therefrom,
suiting his action to the word, &quot;to the blast
of hautboys enters the king in state thus,
with his attendant lords. And with all
that rich and familiar courtesy of which
he was master in his easier moods he
passed from one to another, greeting with
supple dignity on his way, till he came at
last softly to the place prepared for him
at table. And suddenly&mdash;shall I ever
forget, it, sir?&mdash;it seemed silence ran like a
flame from mouth to mouth as there he
stood, thus, marble-still, his eyes fixed in
a leaden glare. And he raised his face and
looked once round on us all with a forlorn
astonishment and wrath, like one with a
death-wound&mdash;I never saw the like of such
a face.</p>

<p>&quot;Whereat, beseeching us to be calm, and
pay no heed, the queen laid her hand on
his and called him. And his orbs rolled
down once more upon the empty place, and
stuck as if at grapple with some horror seen
within. He muttered aloud in peevish
altercation&mdash;once more to heave up his
frame, to sigh and shake himself, and lo!&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The viol-strings rang to his &quot;lo!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lo, sir, the Unseen had conquered. His
lip sagged into his beard, he babbled with
open mouth, and leaned on his lady with
such an impotent and slavish regard as I
hope never to see again man pay to
woman.... We thought no more of supper
after that....</p>

<p>&quot;But what do I&mdash;?&quot; The doctor laid
a cautioning finger on his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;The company was dispersed, the palace
gloomy with night (and they were black
nights at Forres!), and on the walls I heard
the sentinel's replying.... In the wood's last
glow I entered and stood in his self-same
station before the empty stool. And even
as I stood thus, my hair creeping, my will
concentred, gazing with every cord at
stretch, fell a light, light footfall behind
me.&quot; He glanced whitely over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, it was the queen come softly out of
slumber on my own unquiet errand.&quot;</p>

<p>The doctor strode to the door, and peered
out like a man suspicious or guilty of
treachery. It was indeed a house of broken
silences. And there, in the doorway, he
seemed to be addressing his own saddened
conscience.</p>

<p>&quot;With all my skill, and all a leal man's
gentleness, I solaced and persuaded, and
made an oath, and conducted her back to
her own chamber unperceived. How weak
is sleep!... It was a habit, sir, contracted
in childhood, long dormant, that Evil
had woke again. The Past awaits us all.
So run Time's sands, till mercy's globe is
empty and ...&quot;</p>

<p>He stooped and whispered it across to
me: &quot;... A child, a comparative child,
shrunk to an anatomy, her beauty changed,
ghostly of youth and all its sadness, baffled
by a word, slave to a doctor's nod! None
knew but I, and, at the last, one of her
ladies&mdash;a gentle, faithful, and fearful creature.
Nor she till far beyond all mischief....</p>

<p>&quot;Wild deeds are done. But to have blood
on the hands, a cry in the ears, and one
same glassy face eye to eye, that nothing
can dim, nor even slumber pacify&mdash;dreams,
dreams, intangible, enorm! Forefend them,
God, from me!&quot;</p>

<p>He stood a moment as if he were
listening; then turned, smiling irresolutely,
and eyed me aimlessly. He seemed afraid
of his own house, askance at his own
furniture. Yet, though I scarce know why,
I felt he had not told me the whole truth.
Something fidelity had yet withheld from
vanity. I longed to enquire further. I put
aside how many burning questions awhile!</p>

<p>By and by less anxious talk soothed him.
Indeed it was he who suggested one last
bright draught of air beneath his trees before
retiring. Down we went again with some
unnecessary clatter. And here were stars
between the fruited boughs, silvery Capella
and the Twins, and low on the sky's moonlit
border Venus excellently bright.</p>

<p>He asked me whither I proposed going, if
I needs must go; besought there and then in
the ambrosial night-air the history of my
wanderings&mdash;a mere nine days' wonder; and
told me how he himself much feared and
hated the sea.</p>

<p>He questioned me also with not a little
subtilty (and double-dealing too, I fancied,)
regarding my own country, and of things
present, and things real. In fact nothing,
I think, so much flattered his vanity&mdash;unless
it was my wonder at Dame Partlett's
clucking on his viol-strings&mdash;as to learn himself
was famous even so far as to ages yet
unborn. He gazed on the simple moon
with limpid, amiable eyes, and caught my
fingers in his.</p>

<p>How, then, could I even so much as hint
to enquire which century indeed was his,
who had no need of any? How could I
abash that kindly vanity of his by adding
also that, however famous, he must needs
be to all eternity&mdash;nameless?</p>

<p>We conversed long and earnestly in the
coolness. He very frankly counselled me not
to venture unconducted further into this
country. The land of Tragedy was broad.
And though on this side it lay adjacent
to the na&iuml;ve and civil people of Comedy;
on the further, in the shadow of those
bleak, unfooted mountains, lurked unnatural
horror and desolation, and cruelty beyond all
telling.</p>

<p>He very kindly offered me too, if I was
indeed bent on seeking the sea, an old boat,
still seaworthy, that lay in a creek in the river
near by, from which he was wont to fish.
As for Rosinante, he supposed a rest would
be by no means unwelcome to so faithful a
friend. He himself rode little, being indolent,
and a happier host than guest; and when I
returned here, she should be stuffed with
dainties awaiting me.</p>

<p>To this I cordially and gratefully agreed;
and also even more cordially to remain with
him the next day; and the next night after
that to take my watery departure.</p>

<p>So it was. And a courteous, versatile, and
vivacious companion I found him. Rare tales
he told me, too, of better days than these,
and rarest of his own never-more-returning
youth. He loved his childhood, talked on
of it with an artless zeal, his eyes a nest of
singing-birds. How contrite he was for spirit
lost, and daring withheld, and hope discomfited!
How simple and urbane concerning
his present lowly demands on life, on love,
and on futurity! All this, too, with such
packed winks and mirth and mourning, that I
truly said good-night for the second time to
him with a rather melancholy warmth, since
to-morrow ... who can face unmoved that
viewless sphinx? Moreover, the sea is wide,
has fishes in plenty, but never too many
coraled grottoes once poor mariners.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&mdash;JOHN WEBSTER.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>On the stroke of two next morning the
doctor conducted me down to the creek in
the river-bank where he kept his boat. There
was little light but of the stars in the sky;
nothing stirring. She floated dim and monstrous
on the softly-running water, a navy
in germ, and could have sat without danger
thirty men like me. We stood on the bank,
side by side, eyeing her vacancy. And (I can
answer for myself) night-thoughts rose up in
us at sight of her. Was it indeed only wind
in the reeds that sighed around us? only
the restless water insistently whispering and
calling? only of darkness were these forbidding
shadows?</p>

<p>I looked up sharply at the doctor from
such pensive embroidery, and found him as
far away as I. He nodded and smiled, and
we shook hands on the bank in the thick
mist.</p>

<p>&quot;There's biscuits and a little meat, wine,
and fruit,&quot; he said in an undertone. &quot;God be
with you, sir! I sadly mistrust the future.
... 'Tis ever my way, at parting.&quot;</p>

<p>We said good-bye again, to the dream-cry
of some little fluttering creature of the rushes.
And well before dawn I was floating midstream,
my friend a memory, Rosinante in
clover, and my travels, so far as this brief
narrative will tell, nearly ended.</p>

<p>I saw nothing but a few long-haired,
grazing cattle on my voyage, that eyed me but
cursorily. I passed unmolested among the
waterfowl, between the never-silent rushes,
beneath a sky refreshed and sweetened with
storm. The boat was enormously heavy and
made slow progress. When too the tide
began to flow I must needs push close in to
the bank and await the ebb. But towards
evening of the third day I began to approach
the sea.</p>

<p>I listened to the wailing of its long-winged
gulls; snuffed with how broad-nostrilled a
gusto that savour not even pinewoods can
match, nor any wild flower disguise; and heard
at last the sound that stirs beneath all music&mdash;the
deep's loud-falling billow.</p>

<p>I pushed ashore, climbed the sandy bank,
and moored my boat to an ash tree at the
waterside. And after scrambling some little
distance over dunes yet warm with the sun,
I came out at length, and stood like a Greek
before the sea.</p>

<p>Here my bright river disembogued in noise
and foam. Far to either side of me stretched
the faint gold horns of a bay; and beyond
me, almost violet in the shadow of its waves,
the shipless sea.</p>

<p>I looked on the breaking water with a
divided heart. Its light, salt airs, its solitary
beauty, its illimitable reaches seemed tidings
of a region I could remember only as one
who, remembering that he has dreamed,
remembers nothing more. Larks rose, singing,
behind me. In a calm, golden light my eager
river quarrelled with its peace. Here indeed
was solitude!</p>

<p>It was in searching sea and cliff for the
least sign of life that I thought I descried
on the furthest extremity of the nearer of
the horns of the bay the spires and
smouldering domes of a little city. If I
gazed intently, they seemed to vanish away,
yet still to shine above the azure if, raising
my eyes, I looked again.</p>

<p>So, caring not how far I must go so long
as my path lay beside these breaking waters,
I set out on the firm, white sands to prove
this city the mirage I deemed it.</p>

<p>What wonder, then, my senses fell asleep
in that vast lullaby! And out of a daydream
almost as deep as that in which I
first set out, I was suddenly aroused by a
light tapping sound, distinct and regular
between the roaring breakers.</p>

<p>I lifted my eyes to find the city I was
seeking evanished away indeed. But nearer
at hand a child was playing upon the beach,
whose spade among the pebbles had caused
the birdlike noise I had heard.</p>

<p>So engrossed was she with her building
in the sand that she had not heard me approaching.
She laboured on at the margin
of the cliff's shadow where the sea-birds
cried, answering Echo in the rocks. So
solitary and yet so intent, so sedate and
yet so eager a little figure she seemed in
the long motionlessness of the shore, by the
dark heedlessness of the sea, I hesitated to
disturb her.</p>

<p>Who of all Time's children could this be
playing uncompanioned by the sea? And
at a little distance betwixt me and her in
the softly-mounded sand her spade had
already scrawled in large, ungainly capitals,
the answer&mdash;&quot;Annabel Lee.&quot; The little
flounced black frock, the tresses of black
hair, the small, beautiful dark face&mdash;this then
was Annabel Lee; and that bright, phantom
city I had seen&mdash;that was the vanishing
mockery of her kingdom.</p>

<p>I called her from where I stood&mdash;&quot;Annabel
Lee!&quot; She lifted her head and
shook back her hair, and gazed at me
startled and intent. I went nearer.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a very lonely little girl,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;I am building in the sand,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;A castle?&quot;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;It was in dreams,&quot; she said, flushing
darkly.</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of dream was it in then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! I often dream it; and I build it in
the sand. But there's never time: the sea
comes back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was the tide quite high when you
began?&quot; I asked; for now it was low.</p>

<p>&quot;Just that much from the stones,&quot; she
said; &quot;I waited for it ever so long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It has a long way to come yet,&quot; I said;
&quot;you will finish it <i>this</i> time, I dare say.&quot;</p>

<p>She shook her head and lifted her spade.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no; it is much bigger, more than
twice. And I haven't the seaweed, or
the shells, and it comes back very, very
quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But where is the little boy you play
with down here by the sea?&quot;</p>

<p>She glanced at me swiftly and surely;
and shook her head again.</p>

<p>&quot;He would help you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He didn't in my dream,&quot; she said
doubtfully. She raised long, stealthy eyes
to mine, and spoke softly and deliberately.
&quot;Besides, there isn't any little boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None, Annabel Lee?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; she answered, &quot;I have played
here years and years and years, and there are
only the gulls and terns and cormorants, and
that!&quot; She pointed with her spade towards
the broken water.</p>

<p>&quot;You know all their names then?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Some I know,&quot; she answered with a little
frown, and looked far out to sea. Then,
turning her eyes, she gazed long at me,
searchingly, forlornly on a stranger. &quot;I am
going home now,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>I looked at the house of sand and smiled.
But she shook her head once more.</p>

<p>&quot;It never <i>could</i> be finished,&quot; she said firmly,
&quot;though I tried and tried, unless the sea
would keep quite still just once all day,
without going to and fro. And then,&quot; she
added with a flash of anger&mdash;&quot;then I
would not build.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;when it is nearly finished,
and the water washes up, and up, and
washes it away, here is a flower that came
from Fairyland. And that, dear heart, is
none so far away.&quot;</p>

<p>She took the purple flower I had plucked
in Ennui's garden in her slim, cold hand.</p>

<p>&quot;It's amaranth,&quot; she said; and I have
never seen so old a little look in a child's
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;And all the flowers' names too?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>She frowned again. &quot;It's amaranth,&quot; she
said, and ran off lightly and so deftly
among the rocks and in the shadow that
was advancing now even upon the foam of
the sea, that she had vanished before I had
time to deter, or to pursue her. I sought
her awhile, until the dark rack of sunset
obscured the light, and the sea's voice
changed; then I desisted.</p>

<p>It was useless to remain longer beneath
the looming caves, among the stones of so
inhospitable a shore. I was a stranger to
the tides. And it was clear high-water
would submerge the narrow sands whereon
I stood.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot describe how loth I was to
leave to night's desolation the shapeless
house of a child. What fate was this that
had set her to such profitless labour on the
uttermost shores of &quot;Tragedy&quot;? What
history lay behind, past, or, as it were,
never to come? What gladness too high
for earth had nearly once been hers? Her
sea-mound took strange shapes in the gloom&mdash;light
foliage of stone, dark heaviness of
granite, wherein rumour played of all that
restless rustling; small cries, vast murmurings
from those green meadows, old as
night.</p>

<p>I turned, even ran away, at last. I found
my boat in the gloaming where I had left
her, safe and sound, except that all the
doctor's good things had been nosed and
tumbled by some hungry beast in my
absence. I stood and thought vacantly of
Crusoe, and pig, and guns. But what use
to delay? I got in.</p>

<p>If it were true, as the excellent doctor had
informed me, that seamen reported islands
not far distant from these shores, chance
might bear me blissfully to one of these.
And if not true ... I turned a rather
startled face to the water, and made haste
not to think. Fortune pierces deep, and
baits her hooks with sceptics. Away I
went, bobbing mightily over the waves that
leapt and wrestled where sea and river met.
These safely navigated, I rowed the great
creature straight forward across the sea, my
face towards dwindling land, my prow to
Scorpio.</p>

<span><i>Art thou pale for weariness.</i><br /></span>

<span>&mdash;PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The constellations of summer wheeled above
me; and thus between water and starry
sky I tossed solitary in my boat. The faint
lustre of the sultry night hung like a mist
from heaven to earth. Far away above the
countries I had left perhaps for ever, the
quiet lightnings played innocently in the
heights.</p>

<p>I rowed steadily on, guiding myself by
some much ruddier star on the horizon.
The pale phosphorescence on the wave, the
simple sounds as of fish stirring in the
water&mdash;the beauty and wonder of Night's
dwelling-place seemed beyond content of
mortality.</p>

<p>I leaned on my oars in the midst of the
deep sea, and seemed to hear, as it were,
the mighty shout of Space. Faint and
enormous beams of light trembled through
the sky. And once I surprised a shadow
as of wings sweeping darkly across, star on
to glittering star, shaking the air, stilling
the sea with the cold dews of night.</p>

<p>So rowing, so resting, I passed the mark
of midnight. Weariness began to steal over
me. Between sleep and wake I heard
strange cries across the deep. The thin
silver of the old moon ebbed into the east.
A chill mist welled out of the water and
shrouded me in faintest gloom. Wherefore,
battling no more against such influences, I
shipped my oars, made my prayer in the
midst of this dark womb of Life, and
screening myself as best I could from the
airs that soon would be moving before
dawn, I lay down in the bottom of the
boat and fell asleep.</p>

<p>I slept apparently without dream, and
woke as it seemed to the sound of voices
singing some old music of the sea. A scent
of a fragrance unknown to me was eddying
in the wind. I raised my head, and saw
with eyes half-dazed with light an island of
cypress and poplar, green and still above
the pure glass of its encircling waters.
Straight before me, beyond green-bearded
rocks dripping with foam, a little stone
house, or temple, with columns and balconies
of marble, stood hushed upon the cliff by
the waterside.</p>

<p>All now was soundless. They that sang,
whether Nereids or Sirens, had descended to
dimmer courts. The seamews floated on the
water; the white dove strutted on the ledge;
only the nightingales sang on in the thick
arbours.</p>

<p>I pushed my boat between the rocks
towards the island. Bright and burning
though the beams of the sun were, here
seemed everlasting shadow. And though at
my gradual intrusion, at splash or grating of
keel, the startled cormorant cried in the air,
and with one cry woke many, yet here too
seemed perpetual stillness.</p>

<p>How could I know what eyes might not
be regarding me from bowers as thick and
secluded as these? Yet this seemed an isle
in some vague fashion familiar to me. To
these same watery steps of stone, to this
same mooring-ring surely I had voyaged
before in dream or other life? I glanced
into the water and saw my own fantastic
image beneath the reflected gloom of
cypresses, and knew at least, though I a
shadow might be, this also was an island in
a sea of shadows. Far from all land its
marbles might be reared, yet they were
warm to my touch, and these were nightingales,
and those strutting doves beneath the
little arches.</p>

<p>So very gradually, and glancing to and
fro into these unstirring groves, I came
presently to the entrance court of the
solitary villa on the cliff-side. Here a
thread-like fountain plashed in its basin,
the one thing astir in this cool retreat.
Here, too, grew orange trees, with their
unripe fruit upon them.</p>

<p>But I continued, and venturing out upon
the terrace overlooking the sea, saw again
with a kind of astonishment the doctor's
green, unwieldy boat beneath me and the
emerald of the nearer waters tossing above
the yellow sands.</p>

<p>Here I had sat awhile lost in ease when
I heard a footstep approaching and the
rhythmical rustling of drapery, and knew
eyes were now regarding me that I feared,
yet much desired to meet.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh me!&quot; said a clear yet almost languid
voice. &quot;How comes any man so softly?&quot;</p>

<p>Turning, I looked in the face of one
how long a shade!</p>

<p>I strove in vain to hide my confusion.
This lady only smiled the deeper out of her
baffling eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;If you could guess,&quot; she said presently,
&quot;how my heart leapt in me, as if, poor
creature, any oars of earth could bring it
ease, you would think me indeed as
desolate as I am. To hear the bird scream,
Traveller! I hastened from the gardens as
if the black ships of the Greeks were come
to take me. But such is long ago. Tell
me, now, is the world yet harsh with men
and sad with women? Burns yet that
madness mirth calls Life? or truly does the
puny, busy-tongued race sleep at last, nodding
no more at me?&quot;</p>

<p>I told as best I could how chance had
fetched me; told, too, that earth was yet
pestered with men, and heavenly with
women. &quot;And the madness mirth calls Life
flickers yet,&quot; I said; &quot;and the little race
tosses on in nightmare.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; she replied, &quot;so ever run travellers'
tales. I too once trusted to seem indifferent.
But you, if shadow deceives me not, may
yet return: I, only to the shades whence
earth draws me. Meanwhile,&quot; she said,
looking softly at the fountain playing in the
clear gloom beyond, &quot;rest and grow weary
again, for there flock more questions to my
tongue than spines on the blackthorn. The
gardens are green with flowers, Traveller; let
us talk where rosemary blows.&quot;</p>

<p>Following her, I thought of the mysterious
beauty of her eyes, her pallor, her slimness,
and that faint smile which hovered between
ecstasy and indifference, and away went my
mind to one whom the shrewdest and tenderest
of my own countrymen called once Criseyde.</p>

<p>She led me into a garden all of faint-hued
flowers. There bloomed no scarlet
here, nor blue, nor yellow; but white and
lavender and purest purple. Here, also,
like torches of the sun, stood poplars each
by each in the windless air, and the
impenetrable darkness of cypresses beneath
them.</p>

<p>Here too was a fountain whose waters
leapt no more, mossy and time-worn. I
could not but think of those other gardens
of my journey&mdash;Jane's, Ennui's, Dianeme's;
and yet none like this for the shingley
murmur of the sea, and the calmness of
morning.</p>

<p>&quot;But, surely,&quot; I said, &quot;this must be very
far from Troy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Far indeed,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Far also from the hollow ships.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Far also from the hollow ships,&quot; she
replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Yet,&quot; said I, &quot;in the country whence I
come is a saying: Where the treasure is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alack! <i>there</i> gloats the miser!&quot; said
Criseyde; &quot;but I, Traveller, have no
treasure, only a patchwork memory, and
that's a great grief.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, forget! Why try in vain?&quot;
I said.</p>

<p>She smiled and seated herself, leaning a
little forward, looking upon the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Soothfastness <i>must</i>,&quot;' she said very
gravely, raising her long black eyebrows;
&quot;yet truly it must be a forlorn thing to
be remembered by one who so lightly forgets.
So then I say, to teach myself to be
true&mdash;'Look now, Criseyde, yonder fine,
many-hearted poplar&mdash;that is Paris; and all
that bank of marriage-ivy&mdash;that is marriageable
Helen, green and cold; and the waterless
fountain&mdash;that truly is Diomed; and the
faded flower that nods in shadow, why, that
must be me, even me, Criseyde!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And this thick rosemary-bush that smells
of exile, who, then, is that?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>She looked deep into the shadow of the
cypresses. &quot;That,&quot; she said, &quot;I think I
have forgot again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; I said, &quot;Diomed, now, was he quite
so silent&mdash;not one trickle of persuasion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; she said, &quot;I think 'twas the
fountain was Diomed: I know not. And
as for persuasion; he was a man forked,
vain, and absolute as all. Let the waterless
stone be sudden Diomed&mdash;you will confuse
my wits, Mariner; where, then, were I?&quot;
She smiled, stooping lower. &quot;You have
voyaged far?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;From childhood to this side regret,&quot; I
answered rather sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis a sad end to a sweet tale,&quot; she said,
&quot;were it but truly told. But yet, and yet,
and yet&mdash;you may return, and life heals
every, every wound. <i>I</i> must look on the
ground and make amends. 'Tis this same
making amends men now call 'Purgatory,'
they tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Amends,'&quot; I said; &quot;to whom? for
what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Welaway,&quot; said she, with a narrow fork
between her brows; &quot;to most men and to
all women, for being that Criseyde.&quot; She
gazed half solemnly at some picture of
reverie.</p>

<p>&quot;But which Criseyde?&quot; I said. &quot;She
who was every wind's, or but one perfect
summer's?&quot;</p>

<p>She glanced strangely at me. &quot;Ask of
the night that burns so many stars,&quot; she
said. &quot;All's done; all passes. Yet my poor
busy Uncle Pandar had no such changes,
nor Hector, nor ... Men change not:
they love and love again&mdash;one same tune
of a myriad verses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>She tossed lightly a little dust from her
hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay&mdash;all,&quot; she replied; &quot;but what is that
to me? Mine only to see Charon on the
wave pass light over and return. Man of
the green world, prithee die not yet awhile!
'Tis dull being a shade. See these cold
palms! Yet my heart beats on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>Criseyde folded her hands and leaned her
cheek sidelong upon the stone.</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; I repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;For what but idle questions?&quot; she said;
&quot;for a traveller's vanity that deems looking
love-boys into a woman's eyes her sweeter
entertainment than all the heroes of Troy.
Oh, for a house of nought to be at peace
in! Oh, gooseish swan! Oh, brittle vows!
Tell me, Voyager, is it not so?&mdash;that men
are merely angry boys with beards; and
women&mdash;repeat not, ye who know! Never
yet set I these steadfast eyes on a man that
would not steal the moon for taper&mdash;would
she but come down.&quot; She turned an arch
face to me: &quot;And what is to be faithful?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I?&quot; said I&mdash;&quot;'to be faithful?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is,&quot; she said, &quot;to rise and never set,
O sun of utter weariness! It is to kindle
and never be quenched, O fretting fire of
midsummer! It is to be snared and always
sing, O shrilling bird of dulness! It is to
come, not go; smile, not sigh; wake, never
sleep. Couldst <i>thou</i> love so many nots to
a silk string?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, then, is to change,... to be
fickle?&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! to be fickle,&quot; she said, &quot;is showers
after drought, seas after sand; to cry,
unechoed; to be thirsty, the pitcher broken.
And&mdash;ask now this pitiless darkness of the
eyes!&mdash;to be remembered though Lethe
flows between. Nay, you shall watch even
hope away ere another comes like me to
mope and sigh, and play at swords with
Memory.&quot;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and drew her hands
across her face, and smiling, sighed deeply.
And I saw how inscrutable and lovely she
must ever seem to eyes scornful of mean
men's idolatries.</p>

<p>&quot;And you will embark again,&quot; she said
softly; &quot;and in how small a ship on seas so
mighty! And whither next will fate entice
you, to what new sorrows?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; I said. &quot;And to what
further peace?&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed lightly. &quot;Speak not of
mockeries,&quot; she said, and fell silent.</p>

<p>She seemed to be thinking quickly and
deeply; for even though I did not turn to
her, I could see in imagination the restless
sparkling of her eyes, the stillness of her
ringless hands. Then suddenly she turned.</p>

<p>&quot;Stranger,&quot; she said, drawing her finger
softly along the cold stone of the bench,
&quot;there yet remain a few bright hours to
morning. Who knows, seeing that felicity
is with the bold, did I cast off into the
sea&mdash;who knows whereto I'd come! 'Tis
but a little way to being happy&mdash;a touch
of the hand, a lifting of the brows, a
shuddering silence. Had I but man's
courage! Yet this is a solitary place, and
the gods are revengeful.&quot;</p>

<p>I cannot say how artlessly ran that voice
in this still garden, by some strange power
persuading me on, turning all doubt aside,
calming all suspicion.</p>

<p>&quot;There is honeycomb here, and the fruit
is plenteous. Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;and all
travellers are violent men&mdash;catch and kill
meat&mdash;that I know, however doleful. 'Tis
but a little sigh from day to day in these
cool gardens; and rest is welcome when the
heart pines not. Listen, now; I will go
down and you shall show me&mdash;did one have
the wit to learn, and courage to remember&mdash;show
me how sails your wonderful little
ship; tell me, too, where on the sea's
horizon to one in exile earth lies, with all
its pleasant things&mdash;yet thinks so bitterly of
a woman!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; I said; &quot;tell me but one
thing of a thousand. Whom would <i>you</i>
seek, did a traveller direct you, and a boat
were at your need?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at me, pondering, weaving her
webs about me, lulling doubt, and banishing
fear.</p>

<p>&quot;One could not miss&mdash;a hero!&quot; she said,
flaming.</p>

<p>&quot;That, then, shall be our bargain,&quot; I
replied with wrath at my own folly. &quot;Tell
me this precious hero's name, and though
all the dogs of the underworld come to
course me, you shall take my boat, and
leave me here&mdash;only this hero's name, a
pedlar's bargain!&quot;</p>

<p>She lowered her lids. &quot;It must be
Diomed,&quot; she said with the least sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;It must be,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, then, Antenor, or truly Thersites,&quot;
she said happily, &quot;the silver-tongued!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye, then,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she replied very gently.
&quot;Why, how could there be a vow between
us? I go, and return. You await me&mdash;me,
Criseyde, Traveller, the lonely-hearted. That
is the little all, O much-surrendering
Stranger! Would that long-ago were now&mdash;before
all chaffering!&quot;</p>

<p>Again a thousand questions rose to my
tongue. She looked sidelong at the dry
fountain, and one and all fell silent.</p>

<p>&quot;It is harsh, endless labour beneath the
burning sun; storms and whirlwinds go
about the sea, and the deep heaves with
monsters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sweet danger!&quot; she said, mocking me.</p>

<p>I turned from her without a word, like
an angry child, and made my way to the
steps into the sea, pulled round my boat
into a little haven beside them, and shewed
her oars and tackle and tiller; all the toil,
and peril, the wild chances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; she cried, while I was yet full
of the theme, &quot;I will go then at once, and
to-morrow Troy will come.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked long at her in silence; her slim
beauty, the answerless riddle of her eyes, the
age-long subtilty of her mouth, and gave
no more thought to all life else.</p>

<p>Day was already waning. I filled the
water-keg with fresh water, put fruit and
honeycomb and a pillow of leaves into the
boat, proffered a trembling hand, and led her
down.</p>

<p>The sun's beams slanted on the foamless
sea, glowed in a flame of crimson on marble
and rock and cypress. The birds sang
endlessly on of evening, endlessly, too, it
seemed to me, of dangers my heart had no
surmise of.</p>

<p>Criseyde turned from the dark green waves.
&quot;Truly, it is a solitary country; pathless,&quot;
she said, &quot;to one unpiloted;&quot; and stood
listening to the hollow voices of the water.
And suddenly, as if at the consummation
of her thoughts, she lifted her eyes on me,
darkly, with unimaginable entreaty.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you seek else?&quot; I cried in a
voice I scarcely recognised. &quot;Oh, you speak
in riddles!&quot;</p>

<p>I sprang into the boat and seized the
heavy oars. Something like laughter, or, as
it were, the clapper of a scarer of birds,
echoed among the rocks at the rattling of
the rowlocks. As if invisible hands withdrew
it from me, the island floated back.</p>

<p>I turned my prow towards the last
splendour of the sun. A chill breeze played
over the sea: a shadow crossed my eyes.</p>

<p>Buoyant was my boat; how light her
cargo!&mdash;an oozing honeycomb, ashy fruits, a
few branches of drooping leaves, closing
flowers; and solitary on the thwart the
wraith of life's unquiet dream.</p>

<p>So fell night once more, and made all
dim. And only the cold light of the
firmament lit thoughts in me restless as the
sea on which I tossed, whose moon was
dark, yet walked in heaven beneath the
distant stars.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
