<h1>EVERY STEP IN</h1>
<h1>CANNING</h1>
<h1>THE COLD-PACK METHOD</h1>
<h3>BY</h3>
<h2>GRACE VIALL GRAY, PH.B., ED.B</h2>

of Home Economics, Iowa State College</i></b></p>

<br>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>It was six years ago that I first heard of the One Period,
Cold-Pack Method of canning. A little circular was put in my hand
one day at a federated club meeting announcing the fact that in a
few weeks there would be a cold-pack demonstration about fifty
miles away. Immediately I announced that I was going to the
demonstrations. So leaving my small daughter with my mother, I went
to the Normal School at DeKalb, Illinois, and heard and saw for the
first time cold-pack canning.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to say that those three days were so crowded
full of interest and new messages on the gospel of canning that I
felt amply repaid for going fifty miles. As a result of that trip,
the first story ever published on cold-pack canning appeared in
<i>The Country Gentleman</i> and I had the pleasure of writing it.
So enthused was I over this new, efficient and easy way to can not
only fruits but hard vegetables, such as peas, corn and beans, that
I wanted to carry the good news into the kitchen of other busy
housewives and mothers.</p>
<p>My mother had insisted that I take with me my younger sister,
just from college, but with no domestic science tendencies. So,
much against her wishes, preferring rather to do some settlement
work, my sister went with me. The canning was so interesting that
for the first time in her life, my sister became enthusiastic over
one phase of cooking. My mother was so pleased at this zeal that
when she received my sister's letter written from DeKalb, saying,
"Mother, I am enthused about this canning and want to can
everything in sight this summer," she hastily washed all available
glass jars and tops and had everything in readiness for young
daughter's return. And we canned. We were not content to can alone
but invited all the neighbors in and taught them how to can. Our
community canned more things and more unusual things, including the
hard vegetables, that year than they had ever attempted before.</p>
<p>Do not think for one minute it was all easy sailing, for there
were doubting Thomases, but it only took time and <i>results</i> to
convert even the most skeptical ones. And here I must make a
confession. It was much easier for my sister, unversed in any phase
of canning, to master this new method than it was for me with my
four years' training course and my five years of teaching canning
behind me. And this is the reason. She had nothing to "unlearn,"
she knew no other method whereas I had to "unlearn" all my previous
methods.</p>
<p>The one period, cold-pack method is so entirely different from
the old hot pack or open kettle method that to be successful you
must forget all you ever knew and be willing to be taught anew. And
right here is where many women "fall down"&mdash;they are not
willing to admit that they know nothing about it and so do not get
accurate information about it. They are so afraid of appearing
ignorant. This false feeling is the greatest obstacle in woman's
way.</p>
<p>I still go into small towns on my lecture trips and women will
say, "Oh, that cold-pack canning isn't new to me. I have used it
for thirty years." And when I show my surprise, they further
enlighten me with, "and my mother used it before me, too." With a
little <b>tactful</b> questioning I usually get these answers: "Of
course, I do not hot dip and cold dip. I never heard of that
before. I pack the products into the cold jars and for all
vegetables I use a preserving powder because there is no way on
earth to keep corn and peas and such things unless you put
something into them to keep them. Fruit will keep all right. Then I
cook them in my wash boiler until they are done." And when I ask,
"How do you know when they are done," I invariably get the answer,
"Oh, I take out a jar once in a while and try it." It seems like
such a hopeless task to change all these old-fashioned, out-of-date
methods of cooking but with a great amount of patience and much
actual canning it can usually be done. Not always, of course, for
there are some women who seem to delight in sticking to the old
rather than try the new.</p>
<p>The present book is therefore designed for all interested in
greater efficiency in the home, including not only students of home
economics but all persons who have charge of homes and are
interested in learning new, efficient, time and labor saving
methods.</p>
<p>In the preparation of this book I have received much help from
Mr. O.H. Benson, Agriculturist in charge of the government Boys'
and Girls' Club Work, and my first instructor in Cold-Pack Canning.
I also wish to acknowledge my appreciation to those who have helped
to make this book possible by contributing information, advice and
encouragement.</p>

<h1>EVERY STEP IN CANNING</h1>

<a name='CHAPTER_I' id="CHAPTER_I"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>GETTING READY TO CAN</h3>
<br>
<p>Before the World War, housewives had lost the good habit of
canning, preserving and pickling. It was easier to buy California
fruits by the case and canned vegetables by the dozen or half dozen
cans, according to the size of the family. There is no doubt it was
cheaper and decidedly easier to purchase canned fruits, vegetables,
greens, soups and meats than to take time and strength in the very
hottest season of the year to do our own canning.</p>
<p>But what was true then is not true now. The war taught us
thrift. The crime of wasting even a few tomatoes or berries has
sunk into our minds to stay forever; scientific canning methods
have been adopted by the modern woman. Women who had never canned
in days before the war had to can during war days. Food was so
scarce and so high in price that to buy fancy or even plain canned
products was a severe strain on the average housewife's purse. The
American woman, as was to be expected, came quickly and eagerly to
the front with the solution and the slogan: "More gardens and more
canning and preserving at home."</p>
<p>A great garden and canning movement swept the whole country. As
I have just said, women who had never canned before became vitally
interested in putting up not merely a few jars of this and that,
but jars upon jars of canned fruits, vegetables and greens; and so
great was their delight in the finished products that again and
again I heard them say: "Never again shall we depend upon the
grocery to supply us with canned goods."</p>
<p>If these women had been obliged to use the same methods that
their grandmothers used before them, they would have canned just
the same, because it was their patriotic duty to do so; but they
would have canned without the enthusiasm and zeal that was so
apparent during the summers of 1917 and 1918. This enthusiasm was a
result of new canning methods, methods unknown to our grandmothers.
The women of to-day were forced into a new field and learned how
satisfying and well worth while the results were. It is safe to
guarantee that every home-canning recruit will become a
home-canning veteran.</p>
<p>The fascination of doing one's own canning after one has learned
how simple and economical it is will be lasting. No one need fear
that home canning is going to suffer because the war ended the
immediate necessity for it. Home canning has come into its own
because of the war, and it has come to stay because of its many
merits.</p>
<p>There are four methods of canning that are employed by women all
over the United States. They are the "open-kettle," the
"intermittent," the "cold-water" and the "cold-pack" methods.</p>
<br>
<p><b>DRAWBACKS OF THE OLD METHODS</b></p>
<p>The "open-kettle," or "hot-pack," method is the oldest. It was
largely used in the pre-war days. The food is completely cooked in
the preserving kettle, and is then packed into hot, sterilized
jars, after which the jars are sealed. As the packing into the jar
is done after the sterilization has been completed, there is always
a possibility of bacteria and spores entering the jar with the
cooked food and the air. Fruits can be handled successfully in this
way, but this method cannot be used for vegetables, greens and
meats. It is a very laborious, hot and hard way to can. Modern
housewives are discarding it more and more every year and are
beginning to place their trust in the newer and far more scientific
methods of canning.</p>
<p>The "intermittent," or fractional sterilization, method is still
beloved by some people who cling to the sure and hate to venture
into the new. Vegetables can be handled by this method as can all
fruits and meats. It is used rather extensively in the South, where
they say the conditions do not favor "cold-pack." The great
objection to this method of canning is that it requires three
periods of sterilization on three different days and three liftings
of jars in and out of the sterilizer.</p>
<p>What is sometimes called the "cold-water" method of canning
should not be confused with the "cold-pack" method. The
"cold-water" is often used in connection with the canning of
rhubarb, green gooseberries and a comparatively few other sour
berry fruits. If the "cold-water" method is used we would suggest
that the product be thoroughly washed, placed in a strainer,
scalding water poured over it, and the product then packed at once,
in practically a fresh state, in the jars, and clean, cold water
applied until the jars are filled. If these steps are taken
carefully and quickly the method in most cases will be successful
with such acid products as I mentioned. As the products will have
to be cooked before they can be used many housewives do not
consider it any saving of time or labor to follow this method.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE COLD-PACK METHOD</b></p>
<p>The method of to-day that came into its own during the war is
known as the "cold-pack" method of canning. It fought a long fight
to prove that it was a very efficient, economical and satisfactory
process for busy housewives to can everything that grows.</p>
<p>This is the method that I shall mostly refer to in this book,
and if I should omit the phrase "cold-pack" you will know that I am
referring to it. "Cold-pack" simply means that the products are
packed cold in their fresh and natural state in the glass jars or
containers. To the fruits hot sirup is applied; to the vegetables
hot water and a little salt are added. The sterilization is done in
the glass jars or tin containers after they are partly or entirely
sealed, making it practically impossible for bacteria or spores to
enter after the product has once been carefully sterilized or
cooked. In following this method vegetables should first be
blanched in boiling water or live steam, then quickly plunged into
cold water and the skins removed. The products are then packed in
containers and sterilized according to the instructions and recipes
given later.</p>
<p>When we use the term sterilizing we simply mean cooking the
product for a certain period of time after the jar has been filled
with food. It is sometimes called processing. Sterilizing,
processing, boiling and cooking are all interchangeable terms and
mean one and the same thing.</p>
<p>By this "cold-pack," or cold-fill, method of canning, all food
products, including fruits, vegetables and meats, can be
successfully sterilized in a single period with but one handling of
the product in and out of the canner.</p>
<p>All the flavor is retained, the product is not cooked to a mushy
pulp, and the labor and time needed for the canning are less than
in any other method. The housewife's canning enemy, mold, is
eliminated and all bacteria and bacterial spores which cause
vegetables and meat to spoil are destroyed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EXPENSIVE OUTFITS NOT ESSENTIAL</b></p>
<p>For this "cold-pack" method you can use whatever equipment you
have in the kitchen. Complicated equipment is not essential. Many
of us have purchased commercial outfits, for we know we can turn
out more at the end of a day and have found it well worth while to
invest a few dollars in equipment that enabled us to be more
efficient. But if you are a beginner and do not care to put any
money in an unknown venture use the available things at hand, just
to prove to yourself and others that it can be done.</p>
<p>Every type of glass jar manufactured can be used except those
which are sealed with wax. So dig into your storerooms, attics and
basements and bring forth all your old jars. If a top is in good
condition and will make a perfect seal when adjusted with a good
rubber you can use that jar.</p>
<p>If the tops cannot be restored to good condition it is poor
economy to use them. Imperfectly sealed jars are probably
responsible for more spoiled canned goods than any other cause.
Good tops and good rubbers are requisites for good canning.</p>
<p>For your canner, or sterilizer, you may use a wash boiler or a
galvanized bucket, such as is used for a garbage pail&mdash;a new
one, of course. Either is excellent where the family is small and
the canning is accordingly light. Some use the reservoir of the
cookstove while others employ a large vat. If you should have to
buy the wash boiler or pail see that it has a tight-fitting cover
and be sure the pail does not leak. Then all you have to do is to
secure what we call a false bottom, something that will keep the
jars of fruit from touching the direct bottom of the boiler or
pail. This false bottom, remember, is absolutely necessary, for
without it the jars will break during the boiling.</p>
<p>For this false bottom use a wire netting of half-inch mesh and
cut it to fit the bottom of the sterilizer, whether boiler, pail or
bucket. If you haven't any netting and do not care to purchase it a
wooden bottom can be made to fit the sterilizer, or if that is not
available put thin pieces of wood in the bottom&mdash;anything to
keep the jars from coming in direct contact with the bottom of the
sterilizer.</p>
<p>If you have only a small quantity of berries or fruit to can use
a deep saucepan with a tight-fitting cover and a few slats of wood.
This rack is absolutely necessary to keep the contents of the jars
from becoming overheated. Even if they should not break there is a
tendency for part of the contents to escape under the cover and be
lost. Do not use hay, old clothes, newspapers or excelsior for a
false bottom; they are unsatisfactory because they do not allow
proper circulation of water.</p>
<p>Individual jar holders are very convenient and are preferred by
many women to the racks. Inexpensive racks with handles are on the
market and are worth what they cost in saved nerves and unburned
fingers. Some hold eight jars, others hold twelve. So it just lies
with you, individual housekeeper, whether you want a rack that will
hold all your jars or a set of individual holders that handles them
separately.</p>
<p>To return to the subject of the canner, let me add that no
matter what kind you use, it must be at least three inches deeper
than the tallest jar. This will give room for the rack and an extra
inch or two so that the water will not boil over.</p>
<p>Besides the canners, the jars, the rubber rings and the rack you
will need one kettle for boiling water, into which the product may
be put for scalding or blanching; another kettle for water&mdash;if
you haven't running water&mdash;for the "cold dip."</p>
<p>If you use a homemade rack without handles you should have a jar
lifter of some kind for placing in and removing jars from the
canner. If individual holders are used this is not necessary, as
they contain an upright bail. Some women use a wire potato masher
for lifting the jars out of the canners. Other kitchen equipment,
such as scales, knives, spoons, wire basket or a piece of
cheesecloth or muslin for blanching or scalding the product, and
the kitchen clock play their part in canning.</p>
<p>No canning powder or any preservative is needed. If the product
is cooked in closed jars in the hot-water bath as directed the food
will be sterilized so that it will keep indefinitely. If it is
desired to add salt, sugar, sirup, vinegar or other flavor this may
be done when the product is packed in the jar.</p>
<p>A great many people have been led to believe through advertising
matter that it is both safe and practical to use canning compounds
for the preserving of vegetables which have proved hard to keep
under the commonly known methods of canning. The first argument
against the use of a canning compound is that it is unnecessary. It
is possible to sterilize any fruit or vegetable which grows on
tree, vine, shrub or in the ground by this cold-pack, single-period
method of canning, without the use of a compound. The second
argument against it is that many of the canning compounds are
positively harmful to health. Some of them contain as high as
ninety-five per cent of boric acid. Directors of county and state
fairs should exclude from entry all fruits and vegetables that have
been preserved in any canning compound. Perfect fruit can be
produced without any chemical preservative. The third argument is
that they are expensive.</p>
<p>There are many modifications of the original wash boiler and
garbage pail cookers. These are all known as the hot-water-bath
outfits. In these outfits the products are all cooked in boiling
water.</p>
<p>There are condensed-steam cookers under various names, where the
product is cooked in condensed steam. These steamers are generally
used for everyday cookery.</p>
<p>The water-seal outfit, the steam-pressure outfit and the
aluminum pressure cooker follow in order of efficiency as regards
the time required to sterilize food.</p>
<p>Following the hot-water canner in simplicity of construction and
manipulation is the water-seal cooker. The temperature of the
hot-water-seal outfit is a little higher than the homemade or
hot-water-bath outfit; so time is saved in the sterilizing.</p>
<p>The steam-pressure and the pressure cookers are more complicated
but more efficient. Some prefer the aluminum pressure cooker
because it can be used for everyday cooking in the home.</p>
<p>Pressure cookers are expensive, but they are worth their price,
as they are used daily and not just during the canning season.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how they rank as to time required: In a
hot-water-bath outfit soft fruits must be sterilized sixteen
minutes; in a steamer, sixteen minutes; in a water-seal outfit,
twelve minutes; in a steam-pressure-outfit under five pounds of
steam, ten minutes; in an aluminum pressure cooker outfit with ten
pounds of steam, five minutes.</p>
<p>It takes longest to can with a homemade or hot-water-bath
outfit; the shortest and quickest method is with the pressure
cooker that has a pressure of ten pounds or more. Each housewife
has different financial problems, different hours of working and
different ways of working. Where quick work is desired and expense
is no item the pressure cooker is advisable; where money is scarce
and time is no object the homemade outfit answers. Each one must
decide which outfit is best for her own particular case. It matters
not which outfit you have&mdash;they have all been thoroughly
tested and approved by experts. Each one does the work.</p>
<p>This equipment for canning should be in all kitchens: four-quart
kettle for blanching; steamer for steaming greens; colander; quart
measure; funnel; good rubber rings; sharp paring knives; jar
opener; wire basket and a piece of cheesecloth one yard square for
blanching; pineapple scissors; one large preserving spoon; one
tablespoon; one teaspoon; one set of measuring spoons; measuring
cup; jar lifter; either a rack for several jars or individual jar
holders; and a clock.</p>
<p>The manufacturers, realizing that boys and girls must be kept
busy during the vacation months, have made some wonderful devices
for outdoor canning. Would it not be a good plan to buy one for the
young people of your family and give them something definite and
worth while to do in summer? You know little brains and hands must
be kept busy&mdash;if not usefully employed they are often inclined
to mischief. This type of cooker furnishes its own heat; so it can
be used in the back yard, in the orchard or under the trees in the
front yard.</p>
<p>Remember that the higher the altitude the lower the degree of
heat required to boil water. Time-tables given in instructions for
canning are usually based upon the requirements of an altitude of
500 feet above sea level. Generally speaking, for every 4000-foot
increase in altitude it will be well to add twenty per cent to the
time required as given in recipes or time schedules for the canning
of all kinds of fruits, vegetables, greens and meats.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SOFT FRUITS AND BERRIES</h3>
<br>
<p>Having decided on your canning outfit, whether you are going to
can in boiling water, in a condensed steam cooker, or in steam
under pressure; having gathered together the necessary tools, such
as spoons, knives and a funnel; having raided the storeroom and
collected some jars, you are now ready for the actual work of
canning.</p>
<p>It is rather unfortunate that strawberries should be one of the
very hardest products to can with good results. The canning itself
is simple&mdash;all berries are quickly and easily canned&mdash;but
strawberries always shrink, are apt to turn a little brown, and,
what distresses us most of all, they float to the top of the
jar.</p>
<p>The berry's tendency to shrink is responsible for loss of color
as well as its floating qualities. However, if you will be
exceedingly careful to remove the berries from the canner the
minute the clock says the sterilizing period is over, you will have
a fairly good product. Two minutes too long will produce a very
dark, shrunken berry. So be careful of the cooking time. Another
thing that makes a good-looking jar is to pack a quart of
berries&mdash;all kinds of berries, not merely
strawberries&mdash;into a pint jar. If you will get that many in
you will have a much better-looking jar, with very little liquid at
the bottom. It does not hurt the berries at all to gently press
down on them with a silver spoon while you are packing them into
the jar.</p>
<p>We know we are going to get a quart of berries into every pint
jar, so we know just how many quarts of berries we will need to
fill the necessary jars for the next winter's use.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to test each jar to see that there are
no cracks, no rough edges to cut the rubber, and to see whether the
cover and clamp fit tightly, if a clamp type of jar is used. The
bail that clamps down the glass tops should go down with a good
spring. If it does not, remove the bail and bend it into shape by
taking it in both hands and pressing down in the middle with both
thumbs. Do not bend it too hard, for if it goes down with too much
of a snap it will break the jar. This testing of the bails should
be done every year. The bails on new jars are sometimes too tight,
in which case remove the bail and spread it out. After the bail has
been readjusted, test it again. The chances are it will be just
right. Of course all this testing takes time, but it pays.</p>
<p>If you are using some old Mason jars put a rubber on each jar,
fill the jar with hot water, and then put the cover on tight and
invert. This is a sure test for leakage. Never use a Mason cap
twice unless the cover and collar are separate so that both can be
completely sterilized. Fortunately the old-fashioned Mason jar
metal cover to which a porcelain cap is fastened is going out of
style.</p>
<p>If you still have some of these old covers it will be economy to
throw them away. You will be money ahead in the end. After these
tops have been used once it is impossible to make a fastening
between the porcelain and the metal so tight that it is not
possible for the liquid to seep through and cause the contents to
spoil. This accounts for many failures when old tops are used. For
this reason never use the old-fashioned, zinc-topped covers.</p>
<p>The new and safe Mason jar covers consist of two parts, the
metal collar and the porcelain cap. They are for sale at all
grocery or hardware stores.</p>
<p>If you are using the vacuum-seal jars which have a composition
attached to the lacquered tops, carefully examine this rubber
composition to see that it is perfect. This composition should go
entirely round the top and should not be cut or broken in any
place. If it is the top must be discarded for a perfect one.</p>
<p>Of course with this type of jar no rubber rings are necessary,
as the rubber composition on the lacquered top does the
sealing.</p>
<p>It is a wise plan to go round the tops and over the inside of
all new glass jars with a heavy and dull knife to scrape off any
slivers of glass or bursted blisters that may be still clinging to
the jars. Those on the tops cut through the rubber and cause
leakage. Those in the jars may get into the product. I often find
these splinters, particularly on new straight-sided jars.</p>
<p>It matters not what type of jar you use. Use what you have at
hand, but if you are buying new jars consider the following things
before making your selections: No metal, unless it is enameled or
lacquered, should come in contact with the food. The jars should be
of smooth, well-finished glass. The color of the jar does not
affect the keeping qualities of the food. The top or part of the
top that comes in contact with the contents should be all in one
piece, so as not to offer a place for the accumulation of organisms
and dirt. The jars which have nearly straight sides and a wide
mouth or opening are easier to wash and facilitate better, quicker
and easier packing of the product.</p>
<p>Wash the jars in soap and water. Rinse in boiling water. Some
people temper new jars so they will stand the shock of hot water or
hot sirup without breaking. If you wish to take this extra
precaution put the jars in a dishpan or kettle of cold water after
they have been washed in soapy water; bring the water slowly to a
boil and let it boil fifteen minutes. After the jars are ready test
the rubber rings. This may seem a useless precaution, but it is a
necessary one, for there is no one detail in the business of
canning that is more important. Even in the best boxes of rubbers
there is occasionally a black sheep, and one black sheep may cause
the loss of a jar.</p>
<p>Test each rubber before you use it by pressing it firmly between
the thumbs and forefingers, stretching it very slightly. If it
seems soft and spongy discard it. All rubbers fit for canning
should be firm, elastic, and should endure a stretching pull
without breaking. A good rubber ring will return promptly to place
without changing the inside diameter.</p>
<p>A great many women are laboring under the wrong impression that
color affects the quality of a ring. Some women insist on red, and
others on white. Color is given to rings by adding coloring matter
during the manufacturing process. The color of the ring is no index
to its usefulness in home canning.</p>
<p>Use only fresh, sound strawberries or other berries. There is a
little knack about preparing the strawberries that few housewives
know. Hull the berries by <i>twisting the berries off the hull</i>,
instead of pulling the hull from the berry as most women do. You
will have a better-looking berry if you will be careful about this.
Place the berries in a strainer and pour cold water over them to
cleanse them.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO ADJUST THE COVERS</b></p>
<p>Never allow the berries or any fruit to stand in water, as the
flavor and color are destroyed by water-soaking. Pack in glass
jars, pressing the berries down tightly, but without crushing them.
Put the rubber on the jar if you are using a jar requiring a
rubber. Pour hot sirup over the berries. Put the top of the jar in
place, but only partially tighten it.</p>
<p>If using the screw-top jars, such as the Mason, screw down with
the thumb and little finger, not using force but stopping when the
cover catches.</p>
<p>If using vacuum-seal jars put the cover on and the spring in
place. The spring will give enough to allow the steam to
escape.</p>
<p>In using glass-top jars with the patent wire snap, put the cover
in place, the wire over the top and leave the clamp up.</p>
<p>The cover on a glass jar must not be tight while the product is
cooking, because the air will expand when heated, and if the cover
is not loose enough to allow the steam to escape the pressure may
blow the rubber out or break the jar.</p>
<p>The product is now ready for the canner.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STERILIZING</b></p>
<p>If you are using the homemade outfit, such as wash-boiler or
garbage pail, all berries and soft fruits are sterilized sixteen
minutes; in all commercial hot-water-bath outfits and in condensed
steam, sixteen minutes; in the water-seal, twelve minutes; in the
steam pressure under five pounds of steam, ten minutes; and in the
pressure cooker under ten pounds of steam, five minutes. Do not
allow the pressure to run above ten pounds for soft fruits; fifteen
pounds makes them mushy.</p>
<p>If you use any type of hot-water-bath outfit be sure the water
is boiling when the fruit is lowered into the canner, and <i>keep
it boiling</i> vigorously for the entire sixteen minutes. At the
end of the sterilizing time, <i>immediately</i> remove the jars
from the canner.</p>
<p>In taking canned goods from boiling water care is needed to see
that they are protected from drafts. If necessary close the windows
and doors while lifting the jars out, as a sudden draft might break
them.</p>
<p>Examine rubbers to see that they are in place. Sometimes if a
cover is screwed down too tight the pressure of the steam from the
inside causes the rubber to bulge out. Simply loosen the cover a
thread or two, push the rubber back into place and then
tighten.</p>
<p>In case the rubber does not seem to fit well or seems to be a
poor rubber it should be replaced by a new one, and the jar
returned to the cooker for five minutes.</p>
<p>The jars should be sealed tight&mdash;covers screwed down,
clamps put in place&mdash;immediately after they are removed from
the cooker.</p>
<p>Invert the jar to test the joint, then let it cool. If the seal
is not perfect correct the fault and return the jar to the cooker
for five minutes if hot, ten minutes if the jar is cold.</p>
<p>Do not invert vacuum-seal jars. These should be allowed to cool,
and then be tested by removing the spring or clamp and lifting the
jars by the cover only. Lift the jar only half an inch, holding it
over the table, so that in case the lid does not hold the jar and
contents will not be damaged. Or, better still, tap round the edge
of the cover with a rule. An imperfect seal will give a hollow
sound.</p>
<p>As light injures delicately colored fruits and vegetables, it is
wise to store them in dark places, such as cupboards, or basement
or attic shelves protected from the light. Black cambric tacked to
the top shelf and suspended over the other shelves is a sufficient
protection from light. A discarded window shade can be rolled down
over the shelves and easily pulled up when you desire to take a jar
from the shelves.</p>
<p>Canned goods are best kept at a temperature below seventy
degrees Fahrenheit, where that is at all possible.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEPS IN CANNING SOFT FRUITS AND BERRIES</b></p>
<p>It might be well to enumerate the steps in berry and soft-fruit
canning, or do what we called in our schooldays "review it":</p>
<p>1. Get the canner and all its accessories ready.</p>
<p>2. Test and wash jars and tops and put in water to
sterilize.</p>
<p>3. Test rubber rings.</p>
<p>4. Make sirup and put in double boiler to keep hot</p>
<p>5. Prepare the product&mdash;hull, seed, stem.</p>
<p>6. Place berries or fruit in strainer or colander.</p>
<p>7. Rinse by pouring cold water over product.</p>
<p>8. Pack from strainer into hot jar.</p>
<p>9. Use big spoon to get a firm pack.</p>
<p>10. Dip rubber in hot water to cleanse it and put it in place on
the jar.</p>
<p>11. Pour the hot sirup over the fruit at once.</p>
<p>12. Put top of jar on, but not tight.</p>
<p>13. Ready for canner.</p>
<p>14. Sterilize for the necessary length of time, according to the
outfit you are using:</p>

<p>15. Remove from canner.</p>
<p>16. Tighten cover, except vacuum-seal jar, which seals
automatically.</p>
<p>17. Test joint.</p>
<p>18. Three or four days later, if perfectly air-tight, label and
store in a dark place.</p>
<p>These steps are followed for strawberries, blackberries,
blueberries, dewberries, huckleberries, gooseberries, raspberries,
and for all soft fruits, such as cherries, currants, grapes and
figs.</p>
<p>The other soft fruits, such as peaches and apricots, which have
a skin, are scalded or "hot dipped" for one to two minutes in
boiling water or steam and are then plunged into cold water. These
two steps of hot-dipping and cold dipping make the removal of skins
a very simple operation. After the skins are removed the fruit is
put into the hot jars and the process continued from Step 8, as
with strawberries.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SIRUPS</b></p>
<p>Of course you are wondering about the sirups for the different
fruits. There is no set rule for making sirup. It is not necessary
to use sirup in canning fruits. The amount of sugar used in the
sirup will depend upon the individual taste. In a first-class
product there should be enough sirup to improve its flavor, but not
enough to make it take the place in the diet of a sweet preserve
rather than a fresh fruit.</p>
<p>The sirups are made either with varying proportions of sugar and
water or with the same proportions boiled different lengths of
time. What is known as the California sirup is made with three
parts of sugar to two parts of water, boiled gently to different
concentrations.</p>
<p><b>Thin Sirup</b>. For a thin sirup take three cups of sugar and
two cups of water. Mix sugar and heat until the sugar is dissolved.
This is used for all sweet fruits not too delicate in texture and
color, as apples, cherries, pears, or for fruits in which more
sugar will be added in preparation for the table.</p>
<p><b>Medium Thin Sirup</b>. The sugar and water should be boiled
about four minutes, or until it begins to be sirupy. This is used
for raspberries, peaches, blackberries, currants, etc.</p>
<p><b>Medium Thick Sirup</b>. Boil the sugar and water until it
will pile up over the edge of the spoon when it is tipped. This is
used for sour or acid fruits, as plums, gooseberries, apricots,
sour apples, and some of the delicately colored fruits, as
strawberries.</p>
<p><b>Thick Sirup</b>. The sugar and water are boiled until it will
form a ball in the spoon and cannot be poured from the spoon. This
is used for preserves.</p>
<p>It is possible to get more, sometimes almost twice as much,
sirup into a quart jar containing large fruits, as apples and
pears, than into a quart jar containing small fruits, as currants
or blackberries.</p>
<p>There is a little knack worth knowing about combining the sugar
and water for the sirup. If the sugar is sifted into the boiling
water just as fine-grained cereals are sifted into water, there
will be no scum formed. This is a saving of sugar.</p>
<p>If you wish to can strawberries for the market or to win a prize
at the county or state fairs, can them as follows:</p>
<p>Canned by this recipe, strawberries will not rise to the top of
the sirup. Use only fresh, ripe, firm and sound berries. Prepare
them, and add eight ounces of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of water
to each quart of berries. Boil slowly for fifteen minutes in an
enameled or acid-proof kettle. Allow the berries to cool and remain
several hours or over-night in the covered kettle. Pack the cold
berries in hot glass jars. Put rubbers and caps of jars in
position, not tight. Sterilize for the length of time given below
for the type of outfit used:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>HARD FRUITS</h3>
<br>
<p><b>PINEAPPLES</b></p>
<p>The object of canning citrus fruits is, first, to save the
surplus and by-products; second, to furnish wholesome fruits at
reasonable cost to more of our people; third, to help the producer
to transform by-products into net profits.</p>
<p>Almost every one likes canned pineapple, but some housewives
stopped canning this fruit because they found that when cooked in
sirup it seemed to get tough and less palatable. Vegetable and
fruit fibers are toughened when cooked with sugar for any length of
time, so in all cases where you desire to keep the product as
Nature grew it avoid this form of cooking.</p>
<p>When the product is put into the jars with a sirup and cooked in
the jar you will have a product superior to the one that is cooked
over the direct fire in the kettle with the sirup.</p>
<p>But pineapple slices or pieces are so hard they cannot be put
directly into the jars as berries are. Pineapples must undergo a
preliminary process to make them palatable and soft. This
preliminary process is known in canning as "blanching."</p>
<p>After the pineapple has been prepared by paring and removing the
eyes, it can be left in slices or cut into cubes. In cutting hold
the pineapple at the top and use a sharp knife. It is then placed
in a wire basket or a piece of cheesecloth for the blanching.
Blanching means to immerse the product in boiling water for a
certain length of time to reduce its bulk and soften it.</p>
<p>Pineapples are blanched for five minutes. We scald peaches and
apricots, which are soft fruits; but we blanch pineapples, apples
and quinces, the hard fruits.</p>
<p>Scalding means to immerse the product in boiling water for a
very short time&mdash;just long enough to loosen the skins.
Blanching is just a longer period of scalding.</p>
<p>When you blanch pineapples use only enough water to cover them.
This same blanching water can be used for making the sirup. It
contains much of the pineapple flavor and there is no reason for
discarding it. But this is absolutely the only blanching water that
is ever used. All other blanching water, particularly that in which
vegetables are blanched, is full of objectionable acids that we
want to get rid of, so under no circumstances must it be used. But
with pineapples the object of blanching is primarily to soften the
hard fiber, so there is no objection to using the blanching
water.</p>
<p>After the pineapple has been in the covered kettle of boiling
water for five minutes, it is held under cold water until cool
enough to handle. Never let it soak in cold water, as that will
impair its delicate flavor. After this it is packed into hot
sterilized jars. Rubber rings are put on the jars, the covers are
put in place&mdash;not tight&mdash;and the jars are put in the
canner.</p>
<p>Pineapple is sterilized for thirty minutes in a hot-water-bath
outfit; thirty minutes in a condensed steam outfit; twenty-five
minutes in the water-seal; twenty-five minutes in the steam
pressure under five pounds of steam, and eighteen minutes in the
pressure cooker under ten pounds of pressure. At the end of the
sterilizing period the jars are removed, the covers completely
tightened and the joints carefully tested for leakage.</p>
<p>A thin or medium-thin sirup is best for pineapples. Measure the
blanching water and to every two cups of it add three cups of
sugar. If you wish the sirup thin heat until the sugar is
dissolved. If medium-thin sirup is desired, boil it about four
minutes or until it begins to be sirupy.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEPS IN CANNING PINEAPPLE</b></p>
<p>1. Cut the pineapple into slices of desired thickness.</p>
<p>2. Pare the slices. It is easier to pare the slices than to pare
the whole pineapple.</p>
<p>3. Remove the eyes, using pineapple scissors to facilitate the
work.</p>
<p>4. Blanch pineapple for five minutes in a small amount of
boiling water, using a wire basket or cheesecloth.</p>
<p>5. Cold-dip the pineapple.</p>
<p>6. Make a sirup, using the blanching water. Make a thin or
medium-thin sirup.</p>
<p>7. Pack the pineapple into hot sterilized jars, with good
rubbers on them.</p>
<p>8. Pour the sirup over the pineapple.</p>
<p>9. Put the tops of the jars on&mdash;not tight.</p>
<p>10. Sterilize for 30 minutes in hot-water-bath outfit, 30
minutes in condensed-steam outfit, 25 minutes in water-seal outfit,
25 minutes in steam pressure (5 pounds), 18 minutes in pressure
cooker (10 pounds).</p>
<p>11. Remove from canner, tighten covers and inspect rubber and
joints.</p>
<br>
<p><b>APPLES</b></p>
<p>Here are six ways in which canned apples may be used: as a
breakfast dish, with cream and sugar; baked like fresh apples; in
apple salad, often served for lunch or supper; as a relish with
roast pork&mdash;the apples may be fried in the pork fat or the
cores may be cooked with roast pork for flavoring; and for apple
dumplings, deep apple pie and other desserts in which whole apples
are desirable. The sirup of canned whole apples can be used for
pudding sauces or fruit drinks.</p>
<p>Apples are another hard fruit which require blanching, as it
greatly improves their texture and appearance.</p>
<p>Apples and some other fruits, such as pears and quinces, have a
tendency to turn brown when allowed to stand after they are cut. To
prevent their discoloring the pieces may be dropped into mild salt
water as they are pared and sliced. Let them stand for five
minutes, then wash them in clear water and pack. Use a thin sirup
for canning apples.</p>
<p>Summer apples are not firm enough to keep well when canned. They
cook up and lose flavor. They may, however, be canned to be used in
a short time. Windfall apples may be pared, cored and sliced, using
water, and only a small quantity of that, instead of sirup, and
canned for pies.</p>
<p>To be able to can windfall and cull apples and thus have them
for home use through the entire year is a great advantage to all
farmers who grow them. They can be sold on the market canned when
they would not bring a cent in the fresh state.</p>
<p>The windfall and cull apples may be divided into two grades. The
first grade would include the whole reasonably sound fruit; the
second grade the worm-eaten, partially decayed and injured fruit.
Do not can any injured or decayed part nor allow apples to become
overripe before canning.</p>
<p><b>Canning Whole Reasonably Firm Apples</b>. Wash the apples.
Remove cores and blemishes. Place whole apples in blanching tray or
blanching cloth and blanch in boiling hot water for one or two
minutes. Remove and plunge quickly into cold water. Pack in large
glass jars. Pour over the product a hot thin sirup. Place rubber
and top in position. Seal partially&mdash;not tight.</p>
<p>Sterilize jars twenty minutes in hot-water-bath outfit and in
condensed steam, fifteen minutes in water-seal, ten minutes in
steam-pressure outfit with five pounds of steam pressure, five
minutes in aluminum pressure-cooker outfit, under ten pounds of
steam pressure. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert to cool and
test joints.</p>
<p>Firm and tart apples may be cored and peeled first, then canned
by the above recipe.</p>
<p><b>Canning Apples for Pie Filling</b>. Use second grade of
windfalls or culls. Wash, core, pare and remove all decayed spots.
Slice apple quickly into a basin containing slightly salted cold
water&mdash;about one tablespoon of salt per gallon&mdash;to
prevent discoloring. Pack fresh cold product in glass jars. Add one
cupful of hot thin sirup to each quart of fruit. Put on the rubbers
and screw on tops, but do not seal completely. Sterilize twelve
minutes in hot-water bath or condensed-steam outfit; ten minutes in
water-seal outfit; six minutes under five pounds of steam pressure;
four minutes in aluminum pressure cooker. Remove jars, tighten
covers, invert to cool and test joint. Store.</p>
<p>This filling can be used for making apple pies in the same way
that fresh apples would be used, with the exception that the sirup
must be poured off and less sugar should be used. Since the apples
have already been cooked, only enough heat is needed to cook the
crust and to warm the apples through. Pies may be baked in seven
minutes. The apple pies made with these apples are, in the opinion
of many housekeepers, as good as those made with fresh fruit, and
they can be made in less time and are less expensive.</p>
<p>The only difference between canning apples for pies and salads
or whole is that when wanted for pies the apples should be sliced
immediately after placing in cold slightly salted water.</p>
<p><b>Canning Quartered Apples for Fruit Salads.</b> Select
best-grade culls of firm and rather tart varieties. Core, pare and
quarter. Drop into basin containing slightly salted cold water.
Pack these quartered pieces tightly in jars. Add a cup of hot thin
sirup to each quart. Place rubber and top in position, partially
seal&mdash;not tight. Sterilize twelve minutes in hot-water bath
and condensed-steam outfits; ten minutes in water-seal outfit; six
minutes under five pounds of steam pressure; four minutes in
aluminum pressure cooker. Remove jars, tighten covers, invert to
cool and test joints. Store.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ORANGES</b></p>
<p><b>Canning Whole Oranges and Other Citrus Fruits.</b> Select
windfall or packing-plant culls. Use no unsound or decayed fruit.
Remove skin and white fiber on surface. Blanch fruit in boiling
water one and a half minutes. Dip quickly in cold water. Pack
containers full. Add boiling hot thin sirup. Place rubber and cap
in position and partially seal&mdash;not tight.</p>
<p>Sterilize twelve minutes in hot-water-bath and condensed-steam
outfits; eight minutes in water-seal outfit; six minutes in
steam-pressure outfit under five pounds of steam; four minutes in
aluminum pressure-cooker outfit. Remove jars, tighten covers,
invert to cool and test joints. Wrap glass jars with paper to
prevent bleaching, and store.</p>
<p><b>Canning Sliced Oranges for Salad Purposes</b>. The oranges
may be divided into their natural sections or sliced with a knife.
Pack jars or containers full. Pour over product hot thin sirup.
Place rubber and cap in position. Partially seal&mdash;not tight.
Sterilize ten minutes in hot-water-bath and condensed-steam
outfits; six minutes in water-seal outfit; five minutes in
steam-pressure outfit with five pounds of steam; four minutes in
aluminum pressure-cooker outfit under ten pounds of steam. Remove
jars, tighten covers, invert to cool and test the joints. Wrap jars
with paper to prevent bleaching, and store.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PEARS, QUINCES AND RHUBARB</b></p>
<p>Pears are prepared and canned just as the whole firm apples are,
being blanched a minute and a half, cold-dipped and sterilized for
the same length of time as apples.</p>
<p>Quinces are so very hard they must be blanched like pineapples,
but for a longer time. Six minutes' blanching is usually sufficient
for quinces. The sterilizing period can be determined by looking at
the chart.</p>
<p>If skins are left on rhubarb it keeps its pink color. The hot
dip is not necessary and may be omitted. It removes some of the
excessive acid in the rhubarb which makes it objectionable to some
people. Be very careful not to hot-dip the rhubarb more than one
minute, for it gets mushy. An advantage of the hot dip is that more
rhubarb can be packed in a jar after it has been hot-dipped.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHAT A BUSHEL OF FRUIT WILL YIELD</b></p>
<p>A great many women have no conception of how many jars of fruit
they will get from a bushel or half bushel of produce. It is wise
to have a little knowledge along this line, for it aids in planning
the winter's supply of canned goods as well as at marketing
time.</p>
<p>From one bushel of the various fruits you will get on the
average the following:</p>

<p><b>CANNING WITHOUT SUGAR</b></p>
<p>Though all instructions indicate that sugar is necessary for the
canning of all kinds of fruits, it is not necessary for their
proper sterilization and preservation. Any fruit may be
successfully sterilized by simply adding boiling water instead of
the hot sirup. It is a well-known fact, however, that most fruits
canned in water will not retain so well their natural flavor,
texture and color as fruit canned in sirup. When the product is to
be used for pies, salads, and so on it is not necessary to can in
sirup. When fruits canned in water are to be used for sauces, the
products should be sweetened before use. In many instances it
requires more sugar to sweeten a sauce after canning than it does
when the product is canned in the hot sirup.</p>
<p>However, during the World War we had a good chance to test the
fruits which we canned without sugar, when that commodity was
scarce and, in fact, impossible to get in very large quantities. We
used our fruits just as they were and considered them very good.
This all goes to show that we can easily adjust ourselves to
prevailing conditions. In canning without the sugar sirup, you
would follow these directions:</p>
<p>Cull, stem or seed, and clean fruit by placing in a strainer and
pouring water over it until clean. Pack product thoroughly in glass
jars until full; use table knife or tablespoon for packing
purposes. Pour over the fruit boiling water from kettle, place
rubbers and caps in position, partially seal glass jars and place
produce in canner.</p>
<p>If using hot-water-bath outfit sterilize from twenty to thirty
minutes. After sterilizing remove packs, seal glass jars, wrap in
paper to prevent bleaching, and store in a dry cool place.</p>
<p>When using a steam-pressure canner instead of the hot-water bath
sterilize for ten minutes with five pounds of steam pressure. Never
allow the pressure to go over ten pounds when you are canning soft
fruits.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WHEN TO CAN</b></p>
<p>Inexperienced canners may not know when certain fruits are in
season and at their prime for canning. The list below is
necessarily subject to change, as seasons vary from year to year;
but in normal years this table would hold true for the Northern
States.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>
<br>
<p>It is practical to can all vegetables, even such difficult ones
as corn, peas and beans, by the cold-pack method of canning without
using any preservatives, if you will follow all directions,
instructions and the time-table accurately. Vegetable canning is a
little more complicated than fruit canning.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATOES</b></p>
<p>Every one likes canned tomatoes. In many homes more tomatoes are
canned than any other product. The housewife uses them for soups,
for sauces and for seasoning many meat dishes. Some women say: "I
can preserve everything but tomatoes. They always spoil. What do I
do wrong?" If the following directions are followed tomatoes will
not spoil.</p>
<p>Tomatoes really are the easiest vegetable to can, because the
period of sterilization is short, and many jars may be canned in a
day, or if one is very busy a few jars may be canned daily without
the expenditure of a great deal of time.</p>
<p>The best tomatoes for canning are those of moderate size, smooth
and uniformly ripe. When a tomato ripens unevenly or when it is
misshapen, it is difficult to peel, and the percentage of waste is
high. Tomatoes should not be picked when they are green or partly
ripe, for the flavor will not be so good as when they are allowed
to remain upon the vines until fully ripe. Care should be taken,
however, not to allow them to become overripe before canning.</p>
<p>In no instance should a tomato with a rotten spot be canned,
even though the spot is cut out, for the occasional spoiled jar
resulting from this attempted saving will cost more than the partly
spoiled tomatoes are worth. If the housewife will can only
uniformly ripe, sound tomatoes, saving the small, uneven but sound
fruit for tomato <i>pur&eacute;e</i>, she will have a much
better-looking pack and greater food value at the close of the
season. Yellow tomatoes may be canned in the same manner as are the
more common red varieties, except that it is not necessary to
remove the cores.</p>
<p>First of all, grade for ripeness, size and quality; this is to
insure a high-grade product. We could, of course, can different
sizes and shades together, but uniform products are more pleasing
to the eye and will sterilize much more evenly. If the products are
of the same ripeness and quality, the entire pack will receive the
proper degree of cooking.</p>
<p>Wash the tomatoes. Have ready a kettle of boiling water. Put the
tomatoes in a wire basket, or lay them on a piece of cheesecloth or
a towel, twist the ends together to form a sack, and let this down
into the kettle. It is a good plan to slip a rubber band round the
neck of this sack to hold the ends in place. The ends should be
long enough to stand up out of the water and so avoid danger of
burning the fingers when removing the product.</p>
<p>Have the water boiling hard. Lower the tomatoes into the boiling
water. This is called scalding the tomatoes. We scald the tomatoes
to loosen the skin. If the tomatoes are very ripe, one minute
scalding will be sufficient. The average length of time for
tomatoes, just perfect for canning, is one and a half minutes. Do
not leave the tomatoes in the hot water until the skins break, as
this gives them a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The scalding kettle always should be covered, to keep in all the
heat possible. Begin to time from the minute the product is
immersed in the boiling water. If you wait until the water comes
back to a boil, you will scald the product too long and have mushy
tomatoes.</p>
<p>Lift the tomatoes out of the hot water and plunge them
immediately into cold water, or hold them under the cold-water
faucet. The cold-dip makes them easier to handle, separates the
skin from the pulp, firms the texture, and coagulates the coloring
matter so it stays near the surface, giving them a rich, red color.
Then the shock due to the sudden change from hot to cold and back
to hot again seems to help kill the spores. Do not let the product
stand in the cold-dip. The water becomes lukewarm, softens the
product and allows bacteria to develop.</p>
<p>Take the tomato in the left hand and with a sharp knife cut out
the core. Be careful not to cut into the fleshy portion or seed
cells, for this will scatter the seeds and pulp through the liquid,
injuring the appearance of the product. Cut out the core before
removing the skin, for the skin will protect the pulp and there
will be less danger of breaking the tomato. If the tomatoes are
ripe and have been scalded properly, the skin can be slipped off
with the fingers.</p>
<p>The jars, rubbers and tops should be ready. Glass jars should be
hot, so there will be no danger of breakage in setting them in the
hot water, and so they will not cool the water in the cooker below
the boiling point.</p>
<p>Pack the tomatoes whole, pressing and shaking them well down
together, but not using force enough to crush them.</p>
<p>Now we come to a point where tomatoes are different from most
vegetables. Beans, carrots, peas, and so on, have hot water added
to them. But as a large part of the tomato is water, no more is
needed. Another exception where no water is needed is with the
"greens family." So with tomatoes we add no water, but add one
teaspoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of sugar, just for
seasoning, to every quart jar. I think that tomatoes always are
improved by the addition of a little sugar, but this is not
necessary and can be omitted, as also can be the salt.</p>
<p>The salt in canning does not act as a preservative, but as
seasoning; so if for any reason you forget the salt, do not be
alarmed. Your products will keep perfectly without the salt.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE WAY TO SEAL</b></p>
<p>The products are in the hot jars now. The jars do not need to be
full in order to keep. If you were canning by the "open-kettle"
method, the air in the partly filled jar would not have been
sterilized, and might contain the bacteria which cause the product
to ferment or mold. But by the cold pack, the air in the can is
sterilized while the product is being sterilized; and if the can is
closed immediately after cooking, a single spoonful may be canned
in a two-quart jar and the product will keep indefinitely.</p>
<p><b>Place Rubber and Cover on Jar.</b> Fit the rubber. Use good
rubbers and see that they lie flat and fit close up to the can. Put
the covers in place.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Seal Glass Jars Tight.</b> If using screw-top jars
screw each cover down until it catches, then turn a quarter of a
round back; or screw down with the thumb and little finger, not
using force but stopping when the cover catches.</p>
<p>If using vacuum-seal jars put the cover on and the spring in
place. The spring will give enough to allow the steam to
escape.</p>
<p>If using glass-top jars, with the patent wire snap, put the
cover in place, the wire over the top and the clamp up.</p>
<p>The cover on a glass jar must not be tight while processing,
because the air will expand when heated, and if the cover is not
loose enough to allow the steam to escape, the pressure may blow
the rubber out or break the jar.</p>
<p>When canning in tin we cap and tip the cans at once. The tin
will bulge out, but is strong enough to withstand the pressure, and
when the contents cool the can will come back into shape.</p>
<p>The jars are now ready for the canner. Tomatoes sterilized under
boiling water require twenty-two minutes; in condensed-steam
cooker, twenty-two minutes; in water-seal, eighteen minutes; in
steam-pressure, with five pounds, fifteen minutes, and in the
pressure cooker, at ten or fifteen pounds, ten minutes.</p>
<p>If you use the homemade outfit or any water-bath outfit be sure
the water is boiling when the jars of tomatoes are lowered into the
canner. Time lost in bringing the contents to the point of
sterilization softens the tomatoes and results in inferior goods.
Use the ordinary good sense with which you have been endowed in
handling the jars and you will have no breakage. At the end of the
sterilizing period, remove the jars.</p>
<p>In taking canned goods from boiling hot water, care is needed to
see that they are protected from drafts. If necessary close the
windows and doors while lifting the jars out, for a sudden draft
might break them.</p>
<p>Examine rubbers to see that they are in place. Sometimes, if the
covers are screwed down too tight, the pressure of the steam from
the inside causes the rubber to bulge out. Simply loosen the cover
a thread or two, push the rubber back into place and then tighten.
In case the rubber does not seem to fit well or seems to be a poor
rubber, it should be replaced by a new one and the jar returned to
the cooker for five minutes.</p>
<p>The jars should be sealed tight&mdash;covers screwed down,
clamps put in place&mdash;immediately after they are removed from
the cooker.</p>
<p>Invert to test the joint and cool. If the seal is not perfect,
correct the fault, and return the jar to the cooker for five
minutes if hot, ten minutes if jar is cold.</p>
<p>Do not invert vacuum-seal jars. These should be allowed to cool
and then tested by removing the spring or clamp and lifting the
jars by the cover only. Lift the jar only a half inch, holding it
over the table so that, in case the lid does not hold, the jar and
contents will not be damaged. Or, better still, tap round the edge
of the cover with a ruler. An imperfect seal will cause a hollow
sound.</p>
<p><b>Tomato Pur&eacute;e.</b> Small, misshapen, unevenly ripened
tomatoes may be converted into tomato <i>pur&eacute;e</i>. The
tomatoes should be washed, run through a colander to remove skins
and cores, concentrated by cooking to about half the original
volume, and packed in the jars. Rubbers and tops should then be
placed in position and the product sterilized for the same length
of time as for canned tomatoes. <i>Pur&eacute;e</i> even may be
kept in bottles sealed with sterilized corks and dipped several
times in paraffin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW OTHER VEGETABLES ARE CANNED</b></p>
<p>All other vegetables are canned exactly like tomatoes, with two
exceptions. Tomatoes are scalded. All other vegetables are
blanched. We scald tomatoes to loosen the skins and to start the
flow of the coloring matter, which is later arrested or coagulated
by the cold-dip.</p>
<p>Blanching is scalding, only for a longer time. Scalding is never
for more than two minutes. Blanching covers from three to thirty
minutes.</p>
<p>We blanch beans, peas, corn, cabbage, carrots, beets, turnips,
and so on, for three to ten minutes. We blanch these vegetables to
eliminate any objectionable acids or bitter flavors which may be
present, and thus improve the flavor; to reduce the bulk so we can
pack closer; to start the flow of the coloring matter; to improve
the texture of the vegetables by making them more tender, and to
improve the appearance by helping to make clear the liquid in the
jar. Blanching is what makes for success in the cold-pack method of
canning. Blanching is <i>very</i> important and must be carefully
and accurately done.</p>
<p>Let me repeat about blanching: Have the kettle of blanching
water <i>boiling vigorously, completely immerse</i> the product in
the boiling water, cover the kettle <i>immediately</i> and begin to
time the product. Do not stand with the cover in hand and wait for
the water to come back to the boil, for, of course, it stopped
boiling for a second when you lowered into it the cold product. If
you cover the kettle the water will quickly reboil. Do not keep
wondering if it is boiling and take off the cover to see. All these
may seem foolish precautions, but it is necessary to follow
directions accurately.</p>
<p>And remember, all things that are scalded or blanched must be
followed immediately by a cold plunge or "cold-dip." The scalding
or blanching is the "hot-dip," and this must be followed by the
"cold-dip." You may be asking, what is the point of this
"cold-dip"? It is a very logical question.</p>
<p>We "cold-dip" a product to harden the pulp under the skin and
thus permit the removal of the skin without injury to the pulp; to
coagulate the coloring matter and make it harder to dissolve during
the sterilization period and to make it easier to handle the
products in packing, and to subject the product to a sudden shock
by quick change in temperature.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEPS IN CANNING VEGETABLES</b></p>
<p>If you will follow these steps for all vegetable canning you
cannot help but be successful:</p>
<p>1. Clean jars and test rubbers. If rubbers do not return to
normal shape after stretching, do not use.</p>
<p>2. Prepare material to be canned, according to directions given
on chart.</p>
<p>3. Hot-dip&mdash;blanch or scald&mdash;the prepared food. This
process consists of immersing the prepared product in boiling water
for different lengths of time, according to the material to be
canned. See chart. Hot-dipping shrinks the product and enables one
to pack more material in a jar.</p>
<p>4. Cold-dip the material. This process consists of plunging the
blanched or scalded food into cold water, which makes it more
easily handled. Be sure the water is cold; the colder the
better.</p>
<p>Take the product out immediately and let it drain. <i>Don't let
any food soak in the cold water.</i></p>
<p>From this point on, speed is highly important. The blanched
vegetables which are slightly warm must not be allowed to remain
out of the jars a moment longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>Remove skins when required, and as each article is pared cut it
into pieces of proper size and</p>
<p>5. Pack directly into the clean, scalded cans or jars. Pack as
solidly as possible, being careful not to bruise or mash soft
products. Pack the product to within three-eighths of an inch of
the top. Lima beans, navy beans, peas, corn, pumpkin and sweet
potatoes swell, so pack them within only one inch of the top of the
jar.</p>
<p>6. Add seasoning. One teaspoonful salt to every quart jar of
vegetables, and an equal amount of sugar to tomatoes, corn and peas
if desired.</p>
<p>7. Add boiling water to within a quarter inch of top to all
vegetables, except tomatoes and greens. Tomatoes contain
ninety-four per cent water, so none should be added. Tomato juice
can be used if desired. Greens are canned in just the water that
clings to the leaves after the cold-dip.</p>
<p>8. Adjust rubber rings and the covers of the jars; partially
seal.</p>
<p>9. Sterilize&mdash;see time-table on pages following.</p>
<p>10. Remove from canner and completely seal. Test for leaks. Cool
jars as rapidly as possible, without drafts striking them.</p>
<p>Rapid cooling of the product prevents overcooking, clarifies the
liquid and preserves the shape and texture of the product.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR VARIOUS VEGETABLES</b></p>
<p><b>Greens.</b> No water is added to greens. Ninety percent of greens is
water. They are high in mineral matter and we must preserve
that.</p>
<p><b>Asparagus.</b> Remove string before packing in jar. Can or dry tough
ends for soup. If asparagus is packed in jars as whole stalks, pack
with the tips up.</p>
<p><b>Tomatoes.</b> Remove skins before packing. Tomatoes may be canned
whole or in pieces. Skin, cook and strain imperfect tomatoes. Use
this for liquid; as 94 per cent of the tomato is water, no water is
needed.</p>
<p><b>Eggplants.</b> Make slices about &frac12; to &frac34; of an inch
thick. Do not add salt, as it causes eggplants to turn dark.</p>
<p><b>Pumpkin and squash.</b> If you do not wish to scrape out of the
shells you can remove seeds, pare and cut into small blocks of
uniform size. Then blanch.</p>
<p><b>Sweet corn.</b> Corn expands a little in processing, and for this
reason jars should not be filled quite full. Corn that has reached
the dough stage before being packed will have a cheesy appearance
after canning. Corn should never be allowed to remain in the
cold-dip water.</p>
<p><b>Field corn.</b> This product is commonly known as corn-club
breakfast food. The corn should be selected between the milk and
the dough stage. Wide-mouthed glass jars or tin cans should be used
for canning this product. Avoid packing container too full, as the
product swells during the sterilization period. The corn should be
canned the same day it is picked from the field if possible. After
this product has been sterilized and cooked and stored away it will
form a solid, butter-like mass which may be cut into convenient
slices for toasting, frying and baking purposes.</p>
<p><b>Mushrooms.</b> Do not fail to blanch and cold dip. After opening
containers remove the mushrooms immediately and use them as quickly
as possible.</p>
<p><b>Sweet peppers.</b> Place the peppers in the oven and bake them until
the skins separate from the meat. Remove the skin. Pack in hot
jars. Add 1 teaspoonful of salt to a quart. Add boiling water.</p>
<p><b>Lima beans.</b> Lima beans can be either blanched or steamed. If
blanched allow 5 minutes; if in live steam allow 10.</p>
<p><b>Wax or string beans.</b> Beans can be canned whole or cut into
uniform pieces.</p>
<p><b>Cabbage and cauliflower.</b> Cabbage and cauliflower should be
soaked in cold brine (&frac12; lb. salt to 12 quarts water) for one
hour before blanching.</p>
<p><b>Brussels sprouts.</b> Use small solid heads.</p>
<p><b>Peas.</b> A cloudy or hazy appearance of the liquid indicates that
the product was roughly handled in blanching and cold dipping, or
that broken peas were not removed before packing.</p>
<p><b>Carrots and parsnips.</b> Carrots can be packed whole, in slices or
in cross-section pieces. Skin of parsnips can be scraped off after
blanching and cold dipping.</p>
<p><b>Beets.</b> Small beets that run 40 to a quart are the most suitable
size for first-class packs. Well-canned beets will show a slight
loss of color when removed from the canner, but will brighten up in
a few days.</p>
<p><b>Turnips.</b> Scrape skin after blanching and cold dipping.</p>
<p><b>Corn and tomatoes.</b> Add 1 teaspoonful of salt to every quart of
mixture. Mix 2 parts of tomatoes with 1 part corn. One teaspoonful
of sugar improves the flavor.</p>
<p><b>Corn, tomatoes and string beans.</b> Use 1 part of corn, 1 part of
green string beans and 3 parts of tomatoes. Add 1 teaspoonful of
salt and 1 teaspoonful of sugar to every quart jar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>SOUPS</h3>
<br>
<p>After one has learned how to can fruits and vegetables
successfully, the next thing to attempt is the canning of
soups.</p>
<p>Soups may be canned with or without meat. We make one variety
which is a pure vegetable soup. We use no stock or meat, and can it
in its own juice or liquor, thus using no water.</p>
<p>When we wish to use it we dilute it three or four times and
serve it as a vegetable soup or, more frequently, when we have
chicken bones or any meat bones on hand, we add a can of this
concentrated vegetable mixture to the bones and make a delicious
stock soup.</p>
<p>I will give this recipe as I have given it to many friends, all
of whom have pronounced it excellent:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Peck ripe tomatoes</li>
<li>1 Head cabbage</li>
<li>1 Dozen carrots</li>
<li>1 White turnip</li>
<li>3 Pounds string beans</li>
<li>1 Pound okra</li>
<li>3 Red peppers</li>
<li>1 Peck spinach</li>
<li>2 Pounds asparagus</li>
<li>6 Small beets</li>
<li>6 Ears sweet corn</li>
</ul>
<p>Scald the tomatoes by placing them in a wire basket and plunging
them into boiling water for one and a half minutes. Cold-dip them
immediately. After removing the core and stem end of the tomato,
the skin slips right off. Save all the tomato juice. Cut the
tomatoes into quarters. Put into a large pail or bucket with the
juice. Blanch the cabbage, carrots, turnip, string beans, okra and
sweet red peppers five minutes. Cold-dip. Of course you blanch and
cold-dip each product separately. Cut each vegetable after it is
blanched and cold-dipped into small cubes and add to the
tomatoes.</p>
<p>Spinach must be carefully washed to remove all grit and sand.
All greens must be washed through several waters to cleanse them
thoroughly.</p>
<p>Instead of blanching the spinach in a kettle of boiling water,
as we do the other vegetables, we steam it by placing it in a
colander over boiling water or in a regulation steamer with tightly
fitting cover, such as is used for steaming suet puddings and brown
bread. If you can with a steam-pressure canner or a pressure
cooker, then steam the spinach there. If we boiled the spinach for
fifteen or twenty minutes we would lose a quantity of the mineral
salts, the very thing we aim to get into our systems when we eat
spinach, dandelion greens, Swiss chard and other greens. After the
blanching or steaming comes the cold dip.</p>
<p>There is something about blanching asparagus, either for soups
or when canned alone, that is worth knowing. Instead of blanching
the whole stalk of asparagus for the same length of time, we use a
little discretion, giving the tougher, harder ends a full four
minutes' blanching, but allowing the tender tip ends only two
minutes. You are possibly wondering how that is done.</p>
<p>Tie the asparagus stalks in bunches and put the bunches with all
the tips standing one way on a piece of cheesecloth. Tie the cloth
or snap rubber bands round it, and then stand the asparagus in
boiling water in an upright position for two minutes; next lay the
asparagus lengthwise in the blanching water for another two
minutes, and you have accomplished your purpose. You have given the
tougher parts two minutes' more blanching than the tender parts.
Use a deep enough kettle so the asparagus will be completely
covered when laid lengthwise. After the blanching, cold-dip the
asparagus.</p>
<p>Wash the beets. Leave two inches of the top and all the tail on
the beets while blanching. Blanch for five minutes, then cold-dip.
Next scrape off the skin, top and tail. The tops can be put right
into the soup too. Any surplus tops can be steamed with the spinach
and can be treated similarly.</p>
<p>Blanch corn on the cob five minutes. Cold-dip. Cut the corn from
the cob, cutting from tip to butt end. Add the corn to the other
vegetables. Add no water. Pack the mixed vegetables into clean
glass jars; add one level teaspoonful of salt to every jar;
partially seal; cook one hour and a half in wash-boiler or other
homemade outfit. At the end of that period remove jars from canner,
seal tight, and the work is done.</p>
<p>Of course you are interested in the cost of this soup. Most of
the ingredients came right from our garden. We had to buy the okra
and the red peppers, but I figured everything just as if I had to
buy it from the market; and on this basis, the cost of our soup
would have been only seven and a half cents a can. We canned it in
tin, using size Number Two, which is the same as pint size in glass
jars.</p>
<p>Another vegetable soup without stock, dried beans and peas being
used, is made as follows:</p>
<p>Soak six pounds of Lima beans and four pounds of dry peas over
night. Boil each thirty minutes. Blanch sixteen pounds of carrots,
six pounds of cabbage, three pounds of celery, six pounds of
turnips, four pounds of okra, one pound of onions, and four pounds
of parsley for three minutes and dip in cold water quickly. Prepare
the vegetables and chop into small cubes. Chop the onions and
celery extra fine. Mix all of them thoroughly and season to taste.
Pack in glass jars or tin cans. Fill with boiling water. Partially
seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Process ninety minutes if
using hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam outfit; sixty
minutes if using water-seal outfit or five-pound steam-pressure
outfit; forty-five minutes if using pressure cooker.</p>
<p>In many homes cream of tomato soup is the favorite. To make this
soup the housewife uses a tomato pulp and combines it with milk and
seasonings. You can can a large number of jars of this pulp and
have it ready for the cream soup. To make and can this pulp follow
these directions:</p>
<p><b>Tomato Pulp</b>. Place the tomatoes in a wire basket or piece
of cheesecloth and plunge into boiling water for one and a half
minutes. Plunge into cold water. Remove the skins and cores. Place
the tomatoes in a kettle and boil thirty minutes. Pass the tomato
pulp through a sieve. Pack in glass jars while hot and add a level
teaspoonful of salt per quart. Partially seal glass jars. Sterilize
twenty minutes if using hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam
outfit; eighteen minutes if using water-seal, or five-pound
steam-pressure outfit; fifteen minutes if using pressure-cooker
outfit.</p>
<p><b>Soup Stock.</b> To make the soup stock which is the
foundation of all the stock soups, use this recipe:</p>
<p>Secure twenty-five pounds of beef hocks, joints and bones
containing marrow. Strip off the fat and meat and crack bones with
hatchet or cleaver. Put the broken bones in a thin cloth sack and
place this in a large kettle containing five gallons of cold water.
Simmer&mdash;do not boil&mdash;for six or seven hours. Do not salt
while simmering. Skim off all fat. This should make about five
gallons of stock. Pack hot in glass jars, bottles or enameled or
lacquered tin cans. Partially seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin
cans. Sterilize forty minutes if using hot-water-bath outfit or
condensed-steam outfit; thirty minutes if using water-seal or
five-pound steam-pressure outfit; twenty-five minutes if using
pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<p>Soups made with soup stock are many and varied. One can utilize
the things at hand and change the distinctive flavor from year to
year. I will give you a few good specimen recipes which if followed
will give good results:</p>
<p><b>Vegetable Soup.</b> Soak a quarter pound dried Lima beans and
one pound unpolished rice for twelve hours. Cook a half pound pearl
barley for two hours. Blanch one pound carrots, one pound onions,
one medium-size potato and one red pepper for three minutes and
cold-dip. Prepare the vegetables and cut into small cubes. Mix
thoroughly Lima beans, rice, barley, carrots, onions, potato and
red pepper. Fill glass jars or the enameled tin cans three-fourths
full of the above mixture of vegetables and cereals. Make a smooth
paste of a half pound of wheat flour and blend in five gallons soup
stock. Boil three minutes and add four ounces salt. Pour this stock
over vegetables and fill cans. Partially seal glass jars. Cap and
tip tin cans. Sterilize ninety minutes if using hot-water-bath
outfit or condensed-steam outfit; seventy-five minutes if using a
water-seal or five-pound steam-pressure outfit; forty-five minutes
if using pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<p><b>Cream of Pea Soup.</b> Soak eight pounds of dried peas over
night. Cook until soft. Mash fine. Add the mashed peas to five
gallons of soup stock and bring to boil. Pass the boiling liquid
through a fine sieve. Make a smooth paste of a half pound flour and
add paste, ten ounces of sugar and three ounces of salt to the soup
stock. Cook until soup begins to thicken. Pack in glass jars or tin
cans. Partially seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Process
ninety minutes if using hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam
outfit; eighty minutes if using water-seal outfit; seventy minutes
if using five-pound steam-pressure outfit; forty-five minutes if
using pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<p><b>Cream of Potato Soup.</b> Boil one and a half pounds of
potatoes, sliced thin, and five gallons of soup stock for ten
minutes. Add three ounces of salt, a quarter teaspoonful of pepper
and a half pound of butter and boil slowly for five minutes. Make
three tablespoonfuls of flour into smooth paste and add to the
above. Cook three minutes and pack in glass jars or tin cans while
hot. Partially seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Sterilize
ninety minutes if using a hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam
outfit; seventy-five minutes if using a water-seal outfit;
sixty-five minutes if using a five-pound steam-pressure outfit;
forty-five minutes if using a pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<p><b>Bean Soup.</b> Soak three pounds of dried beans twelve hours
in cold water. Cut two pounds of ham into quarter-inch cubes and
place in a small sack. Place beans, ham and four gallons of water
in kettle and boil slowly until the beans are very soft. Remove the
ham and beans from the liquor and mash the beans fine. Return ham
and mashed beans to the liquor, add five gallons of soup stock and
seasoning, and bring to boil. Pack into jars or cans while hot.
Partially seal jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Process two hours if
using hot-water-bath or condensed-steam outfit; ninety minutes if
using water-seal outfit; seventy-five minutes if using five-pound
steam-pressure outfit; sixty minutes if using pressure cooker.</p>
<p><b>Okra Soup.</b> Slice eight pounds okra into thin slices the
round way. Blanch ten minutes and cold-dip. Boil one and a half
pounds rice for twenty-five minutes. Mix okra and rice and fill
cans or jars half full. To five gallons soup stock add five ounces
salt, a quarter teaspoonful of coriander seed and a quarter
teaspoonful of powdered cloves, and bring to boil. Fill remaining
portion of jars or cans. Partially seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin
cans. Process two hours if using hot-water-bath outfit or
condensed-steam outfit; ninety minutes if using water-seal outfit;
seventy-five minutes if using five-pound steam-pressure outfit;
sixty minutes if using pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<p><b>Chicken-Soup Stock.</b> Place thirty pounds chicken in ten
gallons of cold water and simmer for five hours. Remove meat and
bones, then strain. Add sufficient water to make ten gallons of
stock. Fill glass jars or tin cans with hot stock. Partially seal
glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. This stock is used to make soup
where the term "chicken-soup stock" is used. Process ninety minutes
if using hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam outfit;
seventy-five minutes if using water-seal outfit; sixty minutes if
using five-pound steam-pressure outfit; forty-five minutes if using
pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<p><b>Chicken Broth With Rice.</b> For each gallon of soup stock
use twelve ounces of rice. Boil rice thirty minutes. Fill jars or
tin cans two-thirds full of rice and the remainder with soup stock.
Partially seal glass jars. Cap and tip tin cans. Process ninety
minutes if using hot-water-bath outfit or condensed-steam outfit;
seventy-five minutes if using water-seal outfit; sixty minutes if
using five-pound steam-pressure outfit; forty-five minutes if using
pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<p><b>Chicken Gumbo.</b> Cut two pounds ham into small cubes and
boil thirty minutes. Mince three pounds chicken and chop half a
pound of onions fine. Make a smooth paste of a half pound flour.
Add above to five gallons of chicken-soup stock. Then add a half
pound butter and a quarter pound salt and boil ten minutes. Next
add three ounces powdered okra mixed with one pint water. Pack into
glass jars or tin cans while hot. Partially seal glass jars. Cap
and tip tin cans. Process ninety minutes if using hot-water-bath
outfit or condensed-steam outfit; seventy-five minutes if using
water-seal outfit; sixty minutes if using five-pound steam-pressure
outfit; forty-five minutes if using pressure-cooker outfit.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOMATO ACID CHECKS BACTERIA</b></p>
<p>Some women who have canned soup tell me it spoiled or tasted
"sourish and smelled sourish too." This is what we call "flat
sour." It may happen to any vegetable you can, as well as to the
soups. "Flat sour" affects peas, beans, asparagus and corn more
than other vegetables. If the vegetables have been picked for some
time and the bacteria have had a chance "to work," and you are not
exceedingly careful about your canning, you may develop "flat sour"
in the soup. If you let one little spore of this bacteria survive
all is lost. Its moist growing place is favorable to development,
particularly if not much acid is present. One little spore left in
a jar will multiply in twenty hours to some twenty millions of
bacteria. This twenty million can stand on the point of a needle,
so a can could acquire quite a large population in a short time.
Bacteria do not like acids, so it is always a good idea to have
tomatoes in your soup mixture, and get the tomatoes into the stone
crock early in the game. The tomato acid will safeguard the other
vegetables which lack acid.</p>
<p>If you are careless about the blanching and
cold-dipping&mdash;that is, not doing these full time&mdash;if you
work too slowly in getting the products into jars and then let the
full jars stand in the warm atmosphere, you are pretty sure to
develop "flat sour."</p>
<p>Place each jar in the canner as it is packed. The first jars in
will not be affected by the extra cooking. Have the water just
below the boiling point as you put in each jar. When you have the
canner full bring the water to the boiling point as quickly as
possible and begin to count cooking or sterilizing time from the
moment it does boil.</p>
<p>Some women make the mistake at the end of the cooking period of
letting the jars remain in the boiling water, standing on the false
bottom of the canner until they are cool enough to handle with no
danger of burning the hands. This slow method of cooling not only
tends to create "flat sour," but it is apt to result in
cloudy-looking jars and in mushy vegetables.</p>
<p>For this reason you should have in your equipment a lifter with
which you can lift out the hot jars without the hands touching
them. If you use a rack with wire handles this answers the same
purpose.</p>
<p>This "flat sour," which is not at all dangerous from the
standpoint of health, must not be confused with the botulinus
bacteria, which is an entirely different thing.</p>
<p>"Flat sour," perfectly harmless, appears often with
inexperienced canners. Botulinus, harmful, appears rarely. You need
not be at all alarmed about eating either "flat sour" or botulinus,
because the odor from spoiled goods is so distasteful&mdash;it
really resembles rancid cheese&mdash;that you would never get a
spoon of it to your mouth.</p>
<p>If you are debating whether this jar or that jar of soup or
vegetables is spoiled, do not <i>taste</i> the contents of the jar.
<i>Smell</i> it. Tasting might poison you if you happened on the
botulinus bacteria, which is so rare it need alarm no one; whereas
smelling is perfectly safe.</p>

<h3>JELLIES, JAMS, PRESERVES, MARMALADES, FRUIT JUICES AND
SIRUPS</h3>
<br>
<p>For jelly making select firm, slightly underripe fruit that is
fairly acid and contains a large amount of pectin. Fruit that is
just a little underripe contains more pectin than the mature or
overripe fruits. Pectin is the substance that makes jelly harden.
This fundamental jelly-making quality does not exist in all fruits.
Such fruits as currants, crab apples and grapes contain much pectin
and are, therefore, considered excellent jelly-making fruits.</p>
<p>The white inner skin of grapefruit is also a prolific source of
pectin, but as it has a bitter taste we seldom use it for jellies,
though we find it valuable in making orange, grapefruit and other
marmalades.</p>
<p>Rhubarb, strawberries and cherries all lack pectin, but can be
made into good jellies if we add the white skins of oranges and
lemons to them while cooking.</p>
<p>So the very first thing we must know about jelly making is
whether or not a fruit contains pectin. There will be no tears shed
over jelly that will not "jell" if all young housewives will learn
the simple test for pectin; to find out whether a juice contains
pectin or not is a very easy matter.</p>
<p>Take one tablespoonful of grain alcohol&mdash;90 to 95 per
cent.&mdash;and add to it one tablespoonful of <i>cooked</i> juice
that has been cooled. The effect of the alcohol is to bring
together the pectin in a jelly-like mass. If a large quantity of
pectin is present it will appear in one mass or clot which may be
gathered up on a spoon. You will notice I said <i>cooked</i> juice.
It is peculiar that this pectin frequently is not found in the
juices of raw fruits, though it is very plentiful in the cooked
juices. Therefore the test must be made with cooked juice.</p>
<p>There is little pectin in the juice of raw apples, raw quince,
raw grapes, and yet the cooked juices are full of pectin.</p>
<p>This test not only indicates the amount of pectin present, but
it also gives some idea of the proper proportions of sugar to
juice. If three-fourths or more of the juice forms a gelatinous
mass or clot this indicates that you should use three-fourths as
much sugar as juice. If the pectin is slightly gelatinous or is
less than three-fourths of the whole volume of juice, use less
sugar. If the pectin is less than one-half add some form of pectin
to make the jelly, or can the juice for use as a beverage, for
flavoring ice cream or some form of cooking.</p>
<p>By employing this test, sugar can often be reduced, and thus the
jelly texture will be fine, less rubbery and the flavor will be
better.</p>
<p>After the fruit has been selected and prepared as usual by
washing, stemming, and so forth, it is ready to be heated in an
acid-proof kettle. With juicy fruits use just enough water to
prevent burning&mdash;about one cup of water to every four or five
quarts of fruit. The juicy fruits are currants, raspberries, and so
forth. With less juicy fruits, as apples or quinces, use enough
water to cover, or follow the rule, half as much water as fruit.
Use the cores, skins and seeds; these improve the flavor and color
of the jelly.</p>
<p>Berries can be mashed. Heat the fruit slowly in a covered
kettle, stirring once in a while to obtain an even cooking. When
the simmering point is reached, crush the fruit with a well-soaked
wooden masher. When the fruit is tender or has a transparent
appearance, it is ready to strain.</p>
<p>The jelly bag must be of closely woven material; one with a
large mouth is advisable. If cheesecloth is used double it and tie
opposite corners together. When a very clear jelly is desired use a
flannel or felt bag for straining the juice.</p>
<p>What drips into the dish or pan is called Extraction One. When
this Extraction One is fairly drained out, which takes about thirty
minutes, do not squeeze the pulp for a second grade jelly as so
many housewives do; instead, make another juice extraction. To do
this, empty the contents or pulp in the bag into the preserving
kettle, cover with water, and stir until thoroughly mixed; then
cover, bring slowly to a boil as before and drain again. The juice
that drips out is called Extraction Two.</p>
<p>The pectin-alcohol test can be used here again to find out
whether there is much or little or no pectin left. If much pectin
is present, you can repeat the operation and get Extraction
Three.</p>
<p>Three extractions usually exhaust the pectin, but sometimes you
can get as many as five extractions.</p>
<p>You may say, "Why bother with extractions&mdash;why not squeeze
the juice and be done with it?" You will get clearer,
better-flavored and more glasses of jelly if you will make the
extractions than if you squeeze the jelly bag.</p>
<p>I always make the jelly from Extraction One by itself, but
usually combine Extraction Two and Three.</p>
<p>The next step in jelly making is vitally important&mdash;that
is, how much sugar to use to a given amount of fruit juice. This is
where many housewives "fall down" on jelly making. They use the
same proportion of sugar to all juices.</p>
<p>To make jelly that does not crystallize the right proportion of
sugar must be added to the juice. To make jelly that is not tough
or unpleasantly sour, the right proportion of sugar and juice must
be used.</p>
<p>Currants and unripe or partly ripened grapes are so rich in
pectin that they require equal amounts of sugar and
juice&mdash;that is, to every cup of extracted currant and grape
juice we add one cup of sugar.</p>
<p>Red raspberries and blackberries require three-fourths of a cup
of sugar to every cup of juice. All fruits which require much water
in the cooking take three-fourths of a cup of sugar to every cup of
juice. Crab apples and cranberries are examples.</p>
<p>It is harder to make jellies from the fruits to which a large
amount of water is added than from the juicy fruits.</p>
<p>I am frequently asked, "When should you add the sugar to the
fruit juice in jelly making? Do you add it at the beginning of the
boiling, in the middle of the process, or at the end, and should
the sugar be hot when added to the juice?" It is better to add the
sugar in the middle of the jelly-making process than at the
beginning or the end. Skim the juice well before adding the sugar,
so as to lose as little sugar as possible.</p>
<p>If the sugar is hot when added it will not cool the juice, and
thus the cooking time will be shortened. To heat the sugar put it
in a granite dish, place in the oven, leaving the oven door ajar,
and stir occasionally. Be careful not to scorch it.</p>
<p>After the juice is put on, the jelly making should be done as
quickly as possible. No simmering should be allowed and no violent
boiling. A steady boiling, for as few minutes as possible, will
produce good results.</p>
<p>Currant, blueberry and grape jelly usually can be made in from
eight to ten minutes. The hot sugar is added at the end of four or
five minutes.</p>
<p>Raspberry, blackberry and apple jelly take from twenty to thirty
minutes. The sugar is added at the end of ten or fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p>The jellying point is hard to determine. If you have a cooking
thermometer or candy thermometer always use it when making jelly.
It is the one sure, reliable test.</p>
<p>The temperature for jellies is 221 degrees Fahrenheit. If you
want a very soft jelly, boil it 220 degrees. If you want to use it
immediately, then boil it to 222 degrees.</p>
<p>If you do not have a thermometer the next best test is to pour
the boiling sirup from the side of a clean, hot spoon, held
horizontally. If the sirup is done two drops will break
simultaneously from the side of the spoon.</p>
<p>Another test is to take a little jelly on a cold plate and draw
a path through it with the point of a spoon; if the path stays and
the juice does not run together, the jellying point has been
reached.</p>
<p>When the jellying point has been reached, remove the kettle from
the fire, skim the jelly and pour immediately into hot, sterilized
glasses, which have been set on a cloth wrung out of hot water to
prevent breaking. Fill the glasses not quite full.</p>
<p>Never attempt to make more than six to eight glasses of jelly at
one time. If new at the game make only four, because there is
danger of the juice jellying in the kettle before it can be
removed.</p>
<p>When the jellies are well set cover them with <i>hot</i>, not
merely melted, paraffin. The paraffin if hot will kill any germs
that may fall on the surface of the jelly. Then cover with the
clean tin or aluminum covers and store the jelly in a dry, cool
place after proper labeling.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEPS IN JELLY MAKING</b></p>
<p>1. Select firm, slightly underripe fruit that is fairly acid and
contains a large amount of pectin.</p>
<p>2. Prepare fruit as usual by washing, stemming, and so
forth.</p>
<p>3. Heat slowly in acid-proof kettle until fruit is tender. Mash
berries before beginning to cook them. A little water may be added
if necessary to keep from burning. Cut hard fruits into small
pieces; add half as much water as fruit.</p>
<p>4. Pour into dampened bag.</p>
<p>5. Drain through closely woven bag.</p>
<p>6. Make alcohol test for pectin to determine minimum amount of
sugar to use, also the character of the fruit. The amount of
pectin, the fundamental jelly-making property, varies in different
fruits. To make the pectin test add to one tablespoonful of cold
cooked fruit juice one tablespoonful of grain alcohol. Shake
gently. Allow to stand one-half hour. If three-fourths or more of
the juice forms a lump add three-fourths as much sugar as juice in
making jelly. If the precipitate&mdash;pectin&mdash;is not held
together in a lump or is less than three-fourths of the whole
volume of juice, add less sugar in proportion to juice. If less
than one-half forms a lump, add pectin to make the jelly, or can
the juice for use as a beverage, flavoring, and so forth.</p>
<p>7. If fruit juice meets jelly-making test put on to cook.</p>
<p>8. Add required amount of sugar after juice begins to boil or
midway in the process.</p>
<p>9. Stir until sugar is dissolved.</p>
<p>10. Cook rapidly, but not hard.</p>
<p>11. Test to determine when jelly stage is reached by dipping a
clean spoon into boiling juice. Remove and allow juice to drip from
it. If done, two drops will break simultaneously from side of
spoon. Some prefer to wait until mass sheets off from side of
spoon. Better still, use thermometer.</p>
<p>12. Remove from fire and skim.</p>
<p>13. Pour immediately into hot, sterilized glasses.</p>
<p>14. When cool add hot melted paraffin. Melt the paraffin in a
little coffeepot or pitcher with spout, so it will pour easily.</p>
<p>15. Cover, label and store.</p>
<p>No time can be given for jelly making, for several things enter
into consideration: The proportion of pectin in the juice, the
amount of water used in cooking the fruit and the proportion of
sugar to juice; the more sugar used, the less time needed.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JAMS AND BUTTERS</b></p>
<p>Jams and butters are not so difficult to make as jellies.</p>
<p>1. Carefully wash berries and fruits.</p>
<p>2. Weigh the fruit on standard scales or, if scales are not
convenient, use measuring cup.</p>
<p>3. Mash berries. Cut large fruits into several pieces.</p>
<p>4. Add enough water to prevent sticking.</p>
<p>5. Stir to keep from burning.</p>
<p>6. Cook gently until the mass begins to thicken.</p>
<p>7. Measure sugar, using three-fourths part of sugar to one part
fruit. That is, for every pound of fruit use three-fourths of a
pound of sugar, or to every cup of fruit use three-fourths of a cup
of sugar.</p>
<p>8. Continue cooking, allowing the jam to simmer gently.</p>
<p>9. Cook the mixture until the desired consistency is reached.
When a little of the jam falls in heavy drops from the spoon, it is
thick enough.</p>
<p>10. A small amount of mixed ground spices, vinegar or
crystallized ginger can be added if desired.</p>
<p>11. Pour into hot, sterilized glasses to within one-half inch of
the top.</p>
<p>12. Allow to cool, seal with paraffin, cover, label and
store.</p>
<p>Fruit butters are always softer than jam. Marmalades are made
much as are jams. The rind is usually used in lemon, orange and
grapefruit marmalades.</p>
<p>Conserves consist of a combination of several fruits. Nuts and
raisins are often added to conserves.</p>
<p>Preserves are thick mixtures containing sugar equal to at least
three-fourths of the weight of the fruit.</p>
<p>If you wish to eliminate the necessity of using paraffin or
other wax tops for jellies, jams and preserves, you can use the
cold-pack method of canning. You may have containers with screw or
bail tops which you wish to use in this way. The following is one
recipe showing how to proceed.</p>
<p><b>Cherry Preserves</b>. Place one gallon of water in a kettle
and add ten pounds of pitted cherries. Boil slowly for eighteen
minutes. Add twelve pounds of granulated sugar and cook until
product is boiling at a temperature of 219 degrees. Cool quickly in
shallow pans. Pack into glass jars. Put rubber and cap in position,
not tight. Cap and tip if using enameled tin cans. If using a
hot-water-bath outfit, sterilize twenty minutes; if using a
water-seal outfit, a five-pound steam-pressure outfit or a
pressure-cooker outfit, sterilize fifteen minutes. Remove jars.
Tighten covers. Invert to cool and test the joints. Wrap jars with
paper to prevent bleaching and store. When using pressure-cooker
outfits on preserves, keep the valve open during period of
sterilization.</p>
<p><b>Fruit Juices</b>. Fruit juices furnish a healthful and
delicious drink and are readily canned at home. Grapes, raspberries
and other small fruits may be crushed in a fruit press or put in a
cloth sack, heated for thirty minutes, or until the juice runs
freely, and allowed to drip.</p>
<p>Strain through two thicknesses of cotton flannel to remove the
sediment, sweeten slightly, bottle, close by filling the neck of
the bottle with a thick pad of sterilized cotton, heat to 160
degrees, or until air bubbles begin to form on the bottom of the
cooker, and keep at this temperature one hour and a half to two
hours; or heat to 200 degrees, or until the bubbles begin to rise
to the top of the water, and hold at this temperature for thirty
minutes. The hot water comes up to the neck of the bottle. Cork
without removing the cotton. If canned in jars close the jar
partly, and seal tight after cooking.</p>
<p>Fruit juices should never be heated above 200 degrees, as a
higher temperature injures the flavor.</p>
<p><b>Strawberry Preserves. 1.</b> Add thirty-five ounces of sugar
to one-half pint of water; bring to a boil and skim.</p>
<p>With this amount of sirup the berries can be packed attractively
without floating and no sirup will be left over.</p>
<p>To this amount of sirup add exactly two and three-fourths pounds
of washed, capped and stemmed strawberries. Boil the fruit until it
registers 222 degrees Fahrenheit on a candy or chemical
thermometer. If no thermometer is available boil until the sirup is
very heavy&mdash;about as thick as molasses. Remove the scum.</p>
<p>Fill the sterilized jars full of hot berries. Pour in enough of
the hot sirup to fill the jar, leaving as little air space as
possible. Put sterilized rings and caps on at once, but do not
fasten tightly.</p>
<p>Stand the sealed jars in tepid water up to their necks if
possible. Bring this water to a boil. Let pint jars stay in the
boiling water for at least fifteen minutes and quart jars at least
twenty-five minutes; then close caps tightly at once. At the
conclusion of the operation, stand each jar for a moment on its cap
to make sure that the seal is absolutely tight.</p>
<p><b>Recipe Number 2.</b> The following method is preferred by
some because it leaves more of the natural color in the
preserves:</p>
<p>To two pounds of washed, capped and stemmed strawberries add
twenty-six ounces sugar; let stand over-night. In the morning pour
juice thus obtained into a preserving kettle, add berries and cook
to 222 degrees Fahrenheit, or until the sirup is very heavy. Pack
and sterilize, as in Recipe Number 1. These recipes can be used for
all other berries.</p>
<p>When wet weather makes strawberries too soft or sandy for the
table, they are still useful for making "strawberry acid," a thick
sirup which, mixed with water, ice and perhaps spearmint, makes a
cooling summer drink.</p>
<p><b>Strawberries&mdash;Sun Preserves.</b> Select firm ripe
berries; hull and rinse. Place them in a shallow platter in a
single layer; sprinkle sugar over them. Pour over them a thick
sirup made of one quart of water and eleven pounds of sugar, boiled
until very thick.</p>
<p>Cover them with a glass dish or a plain window glass. Allow them
to stand in the hot sun eight to twelve hours. Pack them in jelly
glasses and cover with paraffin or put in regular glass jars or tin
cans. Put the rubber and cap in position, not tight. Cap and tip or
seal if using enameled tin cans. Sterilize for the length of time
given below for the particular type of outfit used:</p>

<p>Remove the jars, tighten the covers, invert the jars to cool,

preserves, remember to keep the valve open during the
sterilizing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SPECIAL DIRECTIONS FOR JELLY AND JAM MAKING</b></p>
<p>Apples vary in the percentage of sugar and acid they contain; a
fine flavored acid apple should be used when possible. Winter
apples are best for jelly making. If necessary to make apple jelly
in the spring, add juice of 1 lemon to every pint of apple
juice.</p>
<p>Apricots are delicious combined with pineapple.</p>
<p>Blackberries, elderberries and loganberries make delicious
juices and shrubs for summer beverages.</p>
<p>The total time of making blueberry jelly need not exceed 10
minutes.</p>
<p>Cranberries are not always put through a jelly bag, but are
rubbed through a sieve.</p>
<p>Cherries are most delicious if preserved in the sun. A good
combination for preserves is equal parts of cherries and
strawberries.</p>
<p>Crab apples can be combined with some juices, such as peach,
pear and pineapple, to furnish necessary pectin.</p>
<p>One-half currants and one-half raspberries make a delicious
jelly; currants are in best condition for jelly making from June 28
to July 3.</p>
<p>Black currant jam is considered quite a delicacy these days.</p>
<p>Acid grapes are best for jelly; sweet, ripe grapes contain too
much sugar. Equal portions ripe and green grapes are
satisfactory.</p>
<p>If gooseberries are fully ripe they make finer-flavored jam than
do green-as-grass gooseberries.</p>
<p>Some women are successful in making peach jelly, but be sure to
test for pectin before completing the process, to save time and
effort.</p>
<p>Pineapple is best canned alone or used as foundation for
conserves.</p>
<p>An underripe, acid plum is best.</p>
<p>Plums and apples combined make an excellent tasting jelly.</p>
<p>Quince parings are often used for jelly, the better part of the
fruit being used for preserving.</p>
<p>Raspberries and other berries should not be gathered after a
rain, for they will have absorbed so much water as to make it
difficult, without excessive boiling, to get the juice to
"jell."</p>
<p>Rhubarb is an excellent foundation for the more expensive fruit.
It will take the flavor of other fruits and thus we can make an
otherwise expensive jam "go a long way."</p>
<p>Strawberries combine well with other fruits and can be utilized
in many ways.</p>
<p>Select sour, smooth-skinned oranges.</p>
<p><b>Lemon Marmalade</b>. After the 9 oranges and 6 lemons are
sliced, put in kettle; add 4 quarts water, cover and let stand 36
hours; then boil 2 hours. Add 8 pounds sugar and boil one hour
longer.</p>
<p>Grapefruit used alone is bitter. Oranges or lemons or both are
usually combined with grapefruit.</p>
<p>All wild fruits or berries used for jelly making must be fresh
and not overripe. Barberry jelly is firmer and of better color if
made from fruit picked before the frost comes, while some of the
berries are still green.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MEAT</h3>
<br>
<p>Canned meat adds variety to the diet in the winter-time and
makes a pleasant change from the cured and smoked meats. You put
meat into jars in the raw state and extend the sterilizing period
or you can cook the meat partially or completely and then sterilize
for a shorter period of time. Of course a reliable method of
canning meat must be used, such as the cold-pack process, where the
sterilizing is done in the tin or jar in either boiling water or
steam under pressure. We usually recommend the partial cooking,
roasting or boiling of the meat before canning especially for
beginners. If you are a beginner in the business of cold-pack
canning then by all means cook the meat before putting it in cans.
If you have canned peas, beans and corn successfully for years then
you are ready for all kinds of raw meat canning.</p>
<p>To save criticism of the cold-pack method of canning meat and to
guard against any danger from eating poorly prepared and improperly
sterilized meat we do not urge beginners to experiment with meat,
although the meat can be safely canned by any one whether new at
the canning game or a veteran in it if directions are carefully
followed. But it is the big "If" that we have to watch.</p>
<p>Many farmers and farmerettes are canning meats of all kinds all
over the country and there is never a can lost. We need more meat
canning done at home and you can do it if you will practice
cleanliness in all your work and follow directions.</p>
<p>The fear of getting botulinus bacteria from eating canned meat
is just a "bug-a-boo." It should be clearly understood that
botulism is one of the very rare maladies. The chances for getting
it by eating canned goods, say the experts, is rather less than the
chances from dying of lockjaw every time you scratch your finger.
To regard every can as a source of botulism is worse than regarding
every dog as a source of hydrophobia. Moreover, for the very timid,
there is the comforting certainty that the exceedingly slight
danger is completely eliminated by re-cooking the canned food for a
short time before eating it.</p>
<p>There are always a few cases of illness traceable to bad food,
not only to canned food but to spoiled meats, fish, bad milk,
oysters and a number of things. There are also cases of injury and
death by street accidents, but we do not for that reason stop using
the streets. If you put good meat into the can and do your canning
right then you will have good results. Never put into a can meat
that is about ready to spoil, thinking thereby to "save it."</p>
<p>If you want to be absolutely sure, even if the jar of meat seems
perfectly fresh when it is opened, you can re-cook the meat, thus
insuring yourself against any possibility of botulinus poisoning.
So you see, there is nothing at all alarming about that frightful
sounding word "botulinus." Using fresh products, doing the canning
properly and reheating before serving eliminates all danger.</p>
<p>For canning meat, tin cans are in most respects superior to
glass, as they eliminate all danger of breakage, preserve the meat
just as well as glass, and by excluding the light prevent any
change of color. If you use glass jars be sure to get the best
brand of jar rubbers on the market. This is very important.</p>
<p>If, as I have said, you are a beginner&mdash;cook the meat first
by frying, roasting, broiling, baking or stewing&mdash;just as you
would prepare it for immediate use. The meat is usually seasoned
according to taste and is cooked until thoroughly heated through,
before putting in the cans. Do not cook until tender as that will
be too long with the additional sterilizing. If too tender it will
fall apart and be unappetizing although perfectly good. See that
nothing is wasted in the canning. If you are canning a young steer
or a calf you would go about it as follows:</p>
<p>Select the meat that you would ordinarily want. Slice the meat
wanted for steak. What is not suited for either of these can be
used for stews, or be put through the meat grinder and made into
sausage meat, formed into little cakes, fried and canned. What meat
is left clinging to all bones will be utilized when the bones are
boiled for soup stock. The sinews, the head and the feet, after
being cleaned may be used for soup stock also.</p>
<p>The liver should be soaked in water, the coarse veins cut out
and the liver skinned and prepared any way that is desired before
canning it or it may be made into liver sausage. The heart can be
used for goulash. The kidneys should be soaked in salt water, split
open and the little sack removed; then they can be either stewed or
fried and then canned. The sweetbreads may be prepared in various
ways and then canned.</p>
<p>The brain is soaked in water to remove the blood, and the
membrane enclosing it is removed. It can be fried or prepared in
any favorite way and then canned. The ox tail is used for soup. The
tongue is soaked in water, scrubbed, cleaned, salted, boiled,
skinned and packed in cans with some soup stock added.</p>
<p>If you do not care to use the head for soup stock and if it
comes from a young animal, split it open and soak in cold water.
Use a brush and scrub thoroughly. Remove the eyes and mucous
membrane of the nostrils and then boil it. After it is boiled,
remove all meat and make a mock turtle stew or ragout. Prepare the
tripe as for table use and then can.</p>
<p>After the soup stock is made and the bones are cracked for a
second cooking, the bones need not be thrown away. You can dry
them, run them through a bone crusher and either feed them to the
chickens or use them for fertilizer. In this way not a particle of
the dressed animal is wasted.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to utilize the cuts that are really
"left-overs."</p>
<br>
<p><b>GOULASH</b></p>
<ul>
<li>2 Pounds of meat scraps which can consist of beef, veal or
pork.</li>
<li>2 Ounces of any fat.</li>
<li>2 Onions chopped fine.</li>
<li>1 Stalk celery, cut in small pieces.</li>
<li>2 Carrots.</li>
<li>2 Cups tomatoes either canned or fresh.</li>
<li>1 Bay leaf.</li>
<li>6 Whole cloves.</li>
<li>6 Peppercorns.</li>
<li>1 Blade mace or a little thyme or both.</li>
<li>A little flour.</li>
<li>1 Tablespoonful chopped parsley.</li>
<li>Salt and paprika to taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut the meat into one inch squares and roll in flour. Melt the
fat in the frying pan, add the vegetables (onions, celery, carrots)
and brown lightly: add the meat and brown. Stir with a spoon or
fork to prevent burning. When browned empty into a pan.</p>
<p>Put the bay leaf, cloves, peppercorns, mace and thyme into a
cheesecloth bag and add to the meat, add tomatoes. Cover with soup
stock or water and simmer 45 minutes if it is going to be canned.
If for immediate use, 2 hours will be necessary to thoroughly cook
it.</p>
<p>Remove the spices, season with salt, paprika and the chopped
parsley. You can add Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce if desired.
Use only small quantities as these sauces are very strong in their
distinctive flavor. Put hot mixture into cans and sterilize.</p>
<p>If the different spices are not at hand a good goulash can be
made by using the meat, fat, onions, tomatoes, flour, salt and
pepper and omitting the rest of the recipe.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LIVER SAUSAGE</b></p>
<p>Beef, veal, or hog liver. Remove the membrane and cut away the
large blood vessels. Soak in water 1 to 2 hours to draw out blood.
Boil until done. When cooled put through a food chopper or grate
finely. Take half as much boiled fat pork as liver. Divide this fat
into two portions; chop one portion into one-quarter inch cubes;
pass the other portion through the food chopper; mix all together
thoroughly; add salt, ground cloves, pepper, and a little grated
onion to taste. A little thyme and marjoram may be added to suit
taste. (For a liver weighing 1&frac12; pounds add &frac34; pounds
fat pork, 3 to 4 teaspoonfuls salt, &frac12; teaspoonful cloves,
&frac12; teaspoonful pepper, 1 small onion, &frac14; teaspoonful
thyme, and pinch of marjoram.) This mixture is stuffed into large
casings. (If no casings are available, make casings of clean white
muslin.) Cover with boiling water, bring to a boil, and boil for 10
minutes. Pack into cans, fill in with the water in which the
sausages were boiled. Sterilize.</p>
<p>This liver sausage may also be made from the raw liver and raw
pork, but in that case the sterilizing is for a longer period, as
the time-table indicates. This recipe is recommended by the United
States Department of Agriculture.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HEAD CHEESE</b></p>
<p>Cut a hog's head into four pieces. Remove the brains, ears,
skin, snout and eyes. Cut off the fattest parts for lard. Put the
lean and bony parts to soak over night in cold water in order to
extract the blood and dirt. When the head is cleaned put it over
the fire to boil, using water enough to cover it. Boil until the
meat separates readily from the bones. Then remove it from the fire
and pick out all the bones. Drain off the liquor, saving a part of
it for future use. Chop the meat up finely with a chopping knife.
Return it to the kettle and pour on enough of the liquor to cover
the meat. Let it boil slowly for fifteen minutes to a half-hour.
Season to taste with salt and pepper just before removing it from
the fire. Bay leaves, a little ground cloves and allspice may be
added and boiled a short time in the soup. Pack while hot in cans
to within &frac12; inch of top. Sterilize. This head cheese is
always served cold.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CORNED BEEF</b></p>
<p>After beef has been properly corned for three weeks, remove the
meat from the brine. Soak for two hours in clear water, changing
water once. Place in a wire basket and boil slowly for half an
hour. Remove from the boiling water, plunge into cold water, and
remove gristle, bone and excessive fat. Cut into small pieces and
pack closely into cans. Add no salt and proceed as in other
canning.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED PORK</b></p>
<p>After the animal has been killed, cool quickly and keep the pork
cool for at least 24 hours. Can only lean portions, using the fat
to make lard. Place meat in a wire basket or cheesecloth and boil
30 minutes, or roast in the oven for 30 minutes. Cut into small
sections and pack closely into cans. Add salt and proceed with
remainder of process.</p>
<p>Other pieces of beef and pork: Hamburg steak, sausage, venison,
squirrel, raccoon, opossum, lamb, are canned as follows:</p>
<p>After cleaning, season and fry, roast, stew, or bake in oven as
though preparing for serving directly on the table. Cook until meat
is about three fourths done. Pack while hot into sanitary tin cans
or glass jars. Pour over the meat the hot liquids, gravies,
dressings, etc., or hot water. Add salt and proceed as in any other
cold-pack canning.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO CAN POULTRY AND GAME WITH THE BONES REMOVED</b></p>
<p>Kill bird and draw immediately; wash carefully and cool; then
cut into convenient sections. Boil until the meat can be removed
from the bones; remove from the boiling liquid and take out all
bones; pack closely into glass jars or enameled cans; fill jars
with the hot liquid after it has been concentrated one half; add 1
level teaspoonful salt to every quart of meat for seasoning; put
rubbers and top of jars in place but not tight. If using enameled
cans completely seal. Sterilize the length of time given in the
<a href='#canning_meat'>time-table on page 108</a> of this book.
After the sterilizing remove the jars; tighten the covers if glass
was used; invert to cool and test joints. Wrap with paper to
prevent bleaching.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRIED SPRING CHICKEN</b></p>
<p>After cleaning and preparing the chickens, season and fry as
though for serving directly on the table. Cook until the meat is
about three-fourths done. If a whole spring chicken, break the neck
and both legs and fold around body of chicken. Roll up tight, tie a
string around the chicken and drop this hot, partially fried
product into sanitary tin cans or glass jars. A quart tin can (No.
3) will hold two to four small chickens. Pour liquid from the
griddle or frying pan into the can over the chicken. Proceed, as in
any other canning, with the sealing, sterilizing and removing of
the jars. Chicken fries canned in the late fall preserve the meat
at the most delicious stage and furthermore we avoid the expense of
feeding the chickens throughout the winter.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO CAN COCKERELS</b></p>
<p>When cockerels reach the point in their growth where it is no
longer profitable to feed them, and when they are wanted for home
use during the winter months they should be canned. This method of
handling the cockerel not only saves money by cutting down the feed
bill, but it places in the pantry or cellar the means of a
delicious chicken dinner at a time of the year when the price of
poultry is high.</p>
<p>The bird should not be fed for at least twenty-four hours before
killing. It should be killed by the approved method and picked dry.
When the feathers have been removed and the pin feathers drawn the
bird should be cooled rapidly. This rapid cooling after killing is
essential to a good flavor in canned meat. As soon as the bird has
been properly cooled it should be singed and washed carefully with
a brush.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CUTTING UP AND DRAWING CHICKENS</b></p>
<p>Mr. George Farrell, a most expert canner, tells us how to go
about this job of canning chicken.</p>
<p>In preparing the bird for canning, care should be taken in
drawing it so that the contents of the digestive tract do not come
in contact with the meat.</p>
<p>1. Remove the tops of the wings, cutting at the first joint.</p>
<p>2. Remove the wings.</p>
<p>3. Remove the foot, cutting at the knee joint.</p>
<p>4. Remove the leg, cutting at the hip or saddle joint.</p>
<p>5. Cut the removed portion of the leg into two parts at the
joint.</p>
<p>6. Place the bird so the back of the head is toward the
operator, cut through the neck bone with a sharp knife but do not
cut the windpipe or gullet.</p>
<p>7. With the index finger separate the gullet and windpipe from
the skin of the neck.</p>
<p>8. Cut through the skin of the neck.</p>
<p>9. With a pointed knife cut through the skin from the upper part
of the neck, thus separated, to the wing.</p>
<p>10. Leave the head attached to the gullet and windpipe and
loosen these from the neck down as far as the crop.</p>
<p>11. With a sharp pointed knife cut around the shoulder blade,
pull it out of position and break it.</p>
<p>12. Find the white spots on the ribs and cut through the ribs on
these white spots.</p>
<p>13. Cut back to the vent; cut around it, and loosen.</p>
<p>14. Begin at the crop and remove the digestive tract from the
bird, pulling it back toward the vent.</p>
<p>15. Remove the lungs and kidneys with the point of a knife.</p>
<p>16. Cut off the neck close to the body.</p>
<p>17. Cut through the backbone at the joint or just above the
diaphragm.</p>
<p>18. Remove the oil sack.</p>
<p>19. Separate the breast from the backbone by cutting through on
the white spots.</p>
<p>20. Cut the fillet from each side of the breastbone.</p>
<p>21. Cut in sharp at the point of the breastbone, turning the
knife and cutting away the wishbone with the meat. Bend in the
bones of the breastbone.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PACKING CHICKEN</b></p>
<p>Use a one quart jar. Caution: Do not pack the giblets with the
meat.</p>
<p>1. Have the jar hot.</p>
<p>2. Pack the saddle with a thigh inside.</p>
<p>3. Pack the breastbone with a thigh inside.</p>
<p>4. Pack the backbone and ribs with a leg inside.</p>
<p>5. Pack the legs large end downward, alongside the
breastbone.</p>
<p>6. Pack the wings.</p>
<p>7. Pack the wishbone.</p>
<p>8. Pack the fillets.</p>
<p>9. Pack the neck-bone.</p>
<p>10. Pour on boiling water to within one inch of the top; add a
level teaspoonful of salt; place the rubber and cap in position,
partially seal, and sterilize for the length of time given below
for the particular type of outfit used:</p>
Water bath, home made or commercial (pint or quart jars) 1 hour<br>
Water seal, 214&deg; 3 hours<br>
5 pounds steam-pressure 2 hours<br>
10 to 15 pounds steam-pressure 1 hour<br>
<p>Remove jars; tighten covers; invert to cool, and test joints.
Wrap jars with paper to prevent bleaching.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PIGEONS</b></p>
<p><i>Young</i> pigeons. Dress pigeons, wash well, and roast for 30
minutes basting frequently. Some pieces of fat bacon put over the
breasts will prevent them getting too dry.</p>
<p><i>Old</i> pigeons. Dress, wash, and fry pigeons.</p>
<p>Brown some onions in the fat with the pigeons, using a pound of
onions to a dozen birds. Cover with hot water after pigeons and
onions are a golden brown; simmer until the meat is tender and can
be removed from the bones. Add from time to time boiling water, if
necessary, in order to keep the birds covered. When tender, take
meat from bones. Return the meat to the liquor, salt to taste and
pack while boiling into cans or jars, fill with liquor to within
one-half inch of top.</p>
<p>All small game birds may be canned like pigeons. Blackbirds may
be treated like pigeons. They make an excellent stew.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN CANNING OF TENDER COTTON-TAILS OR TWICE-SKINNED
JACK-RABBITS</b></p>
<p>1. Blanch in boiling water until the meat is white.</p>
<p>2. Cold dip.</p>
<p>3. Pack tightly in sterilized jars.</p>
<p>4. Add boiling water and 1 teaspoonful salt to quart.</p>
<p>5. Adjust rubber and lid.</p>
<p>6. Sterilize in hot water bath for three hours.</p>
<p>7. Remove from bath and complete the seal.</p>
<p>Rabbit meat thus canned, may be served in various appetizing
ways.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RABBIT SAUSAGE</b></p>
<p>For rabbit sausage and mince-meat only the backs and legs of the
carcass are used, discarding the sinews.</p>
<p>Grind together equal parts of rabbit and fat pork (or at least
&frac14; fat pork). The pork may be salt pork if all salt is
omitted from the mixture.</p>
<p>To every ten pounds of the above add 6 teaspoonfuls salt, 1
teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls powdered sage. Mix
thoroughly. Shape in flat cakes and fry till nicely browned. Pack
tightly in jars, pour over the fat in which the sausage was fried,
and sterilize.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RABBIT MINCE-MEAT</b></p>
<p>Rabbit mince-meat is used a great deal on the plains and large
quantities of it are canned. The mince-meat may be made by simply
substituting the rabbit meat for beef in your favorite recipe. The
following is an inexpensive recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Cup of rabbit meat which has been parboiled in salted water
and drained, then chopped finely.</li>
<li>1 Cup chopped apple.</li>
<li>&frac12; Cup finely chopped suet.</li>
<li>&frac12; Cup seeded raisins.</li>
<li>&frac12; Cup currants.</li>
<li>1 Cup molasses or syrup.</li>
<li>2 Tablespoonfuls sugar.</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon cider, lemon juice, fruit juice or vinegar.</li>
<li>&frac14; Cup chopped watermelon pickles or green tomato
pickles.</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of cinnamon or nutmeg.</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon of salt.</li>
<li>&frac12; Teaspoon cloves, mace or other spice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix together all ingredients except the meat, add the meat broth
and simmer for about 1 hour. Add the meat. Pour into jars, and
sterilize. Remove and seal.</p>
<br>
<p>STEPS IN CANNING MEAT AND GAME</p>
<p>For all meat, poultry or game canning the following general
instructions should be kept in mind.</p>
<p>1. Sterilize the jars, caps and rubbers.</p>
<p>2. Grade the meat for size.</p>
<p>3. Cut up into convenient portions for cooking or canning.</p>
<p>4. Saut&eacute;, fry or bake, broil or stew as desired. This
step can be omitted if you are an experienced canner.</p>
<p>5. Pack in sterilized, hot jars or tin cans.</p>
<p>6. Add 1 level teaspoonful salt per quart of meat for seasoning
if not already seasoned.</p>
<p>7. If glass jars put on rubber and seal, not too tight. Seal tin
cans.</p>
<p>8. Process in boiling water or steam under pressure.</p>
<p>9. Remove, completely seal the jar.</p>
<p>10. Invert to cool and test the joint.</p>
<p>11. Label and store.</p>
<br>
<p>If you can in tin use the enamel or lacquered cans. A slight
amount of water in the bottom of the jars of prepared meat will
insure quicker sterilization of the air remaining in the jar. Where
meat has been stewed the liquor can be poured into the jar for
filling. If you use a steam-pressure cooker outfit of course the
time of cooking will be much shorter than if you use a wash-boiler
or some other homemade outfit. If you cook in boiling water we call
that the water-bath method.</p>
<p>The following data will be of interest to those who contemplate
canning meat.</p>
<p>Hog on foot&mdash;weight 500.</p>
<p>Liver, heart and a part of the ribs were eaten at the time of
butchering, therefore, not canned. The remainder of the ribs canned
six No. 3 cans:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>FISH</h3>
<br>
<p>People in some sections of the country are interested in canning
mountain trout and others live where there is an abundant supply of
either fresh-water fish or salt-water fish. Heretofore we have been
wasteful and lax about the fish supply. But as we have learned to
can vegetables and meats so we are going to learn to can fish. Fish
is really canned the same in every step after preparation as peas
and corn are canned.</p>
<p>In order to have a good product, fish must be fresh when canned.
No time should be lost in handling the fish after being caught.
Putrefaction starts rapidly, and the fish must be handled promptly.
The sooner it is canned after being taken from lake, stream or
ocean, the better. Never attempt to can any fish that is stale.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PREPARATION OF FISH FOR CANNING</b></p>
<p>As soon as fish are caught it is advisable to kill them with a
knife and allow the blood to run out. Scale fish. This is easily
done if the fish is dipped in boiling water. For canning, most
varieties of fish need not be skinned. If the fish is very large
and coarse, the large back fin may be cut out and the backbone
removed, but with most varieties this is unnecessary. Cut off the
head and tail, being careful to leave no more meat than necessary
on the parts removed. Remove the entrails and the dark membrane
that in some fish (e.g., mullets) covers the abdominal cavity.
Thoroughly clean the inside. The head may be cleaned and used for
fish chowder.</p>
<p>If you wish to be sure that all blood is drawn out before
canning, place the fish in a brine made of one ounce of salt to one
quart of water. Allow the fish to soak from 10 minutes to 1 hour
according to the thickness of the fish. Never use this brine but
once. If the meat of the fish is very soft or loose, it may be
hardened by soaking in a brine (strong enough to float an Irish
potato) for from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness
of the pieces and the softness of the flesh.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNING THE FISH</b></p>
<p>1. Remove the fish from the brine where it has been placed in
order to draw out all the blood and to harden the texture of the
fish.</p>
<p>2. Drain well.</p>
<p>3. Cut into can lengths.</p>
<p>4. Place fish in a piece of cheesecloth or in a wire basket and
blanch in <i>boiling water</i> from three to five minutes. Three
minutes for the soft flesh fish, such as suckers, crappies,
whitefish. Fish with a firmer flesh, as pike, muskalonge and
sunfish require 5 minutes blanching. The blanching removes the
strong fish flavor and cleans the outside of the fish.</p>
<p>5. Cold-dip the fish by plunging into cold water immediately.
This makes the flesh firm.</p>
<p>6. Pack in hot jars or cans to within &frac12; inch from top.
Add 1 teaspoonful salt per quart. Put on a good rubber and
partially seal the jar, completely seal tin cans.</p>
<p>7. Place jars or cans in canner and process in <i>boiling</i>
water for three hours. Three hours sterilization will insure the
keeping of all varieties of fish, providing fresh products are used
and the blanching and other work is carefully done. If canning with
a steam-pressure canner or a pressure cooker sterilize for one hour
and a half under 10 to 15 lbs. pressure.</p>
<p>8. At the end of the sterilizing period cool the jars quickly
after sealing completely. The tin cans may be cooled by immersing
them in cold water.</p>
<p>9. Store for future use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SOFTENING OF BONES IN FISH</b></p>
<p>This can be done satisfactorily under pressure. The bones of
fish are composed of large quantities of harmless lime, bound by a
matrix of collagen, which is insoluble under ordinary conditions.
When subjected to a high temperature under pressure this collagen
is converted into gelatin and dissolved, leaving the bones soft and
friable and even edible. Bony fish, such as herring and shad, which
are too small to use otherwise are greatly improved when subjected
to steam under pressure.</p>
<p>The bones in herring are softened in 37 minutes at a temperature
of 240 degrees; shad in 1 hour; flounder 1 hour. Other fish are
fully cooked and the bones softened in times approximately
proportionate to the size of the bones.</p>
<p>The following table was made after many experiments and gives
the time required to soften the bones in many common species of
fish.</p>
<p>The term "softening" means the point in cooking when the small
bones, ribs, etc., are soft, but when the large vertebrae are not
yet sufficiently soft to be consumed along with the meat. In some
of the larger fishes where the large bones could scarcely be eaten,
even if they were softened, it would appear to be a waste of time
and fuel to carry them to a point of complete cooking, and in such
cases it ought to be sufficient to soften the small bones and
sterilize the contents of the can. For such a purpose, the
"softening" rather than the "soft" point, may be used.</p>
<p>The time periods are measured from the point when the given
pressure and temperature are reached (at the top of the cooker) to
the time when the heat is shut off. The heating-up and cooling-off
period of time are therefore not included. The fish were salted,
but no water was added.</p>
<p>Samples of fish canned during the course of these experiments
were kept six weeks at room temperature (about 68&deg; F.) and were
then incubated at 98&deg; F. for 48 hrs. All were sterile.</p>

<br>
<p><b>FRIED FISH</b></p>
<p>1. Clean the fish and remove entrails. Split along the back and
remove backbone.</p>
<p>2. Place in brine strong enough to float an Irish potato. Allow
fish to remain in this brine from 10 minutes to 1 hour according to
the thickness of the flesh. This draws out the blood and hardens
the meat.</p>
<p>3. Draw, wipe dry.</p>
<p>4. Cut in pieces that can go through jar or can openings.</p>
<p>5. Roll in cornmeal or other flour, dip into beaten egg and roll
in flour again.</p>
<p>6. Then put into frying basket and fry in deep fat until nicely
browned, or it can be saut&eacute;d in bacon or other fat until
well browned.</p>
<p>7. Drain well by placing pieces on coarse paper to absorb
excessive fat.</p>
<p>8. Pack into hot jars or enameled tin cans.</p>
<p>9. Add 1 teaspoonful salt per quart. Add no liquid.</p>
<p>10. Partially seal glass jars. Completely seal tin cans.</p>
<p>11. Process 3 hours in hot water bath outfit. Process 1&frac12;
hours in steam pressure (10 to 15 lbs. pressure).</p>
<p>12. Remove from canner. Seal glass jars. Cool quickly as
possible.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BAKED FISH</b></p>
<p>Prepare and bake fish same as for table use until half done.
Pack in hot jars, add salt and sterilize three hours in
hot-water-bath outfit or 1&frac12; hours in steam pressure or
pressure cooker, 10 to 15 lbs. pressure.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ANOTHER FORMULA FOR MISCELLANEOUS FISH</b></p>
<p>Rub the fish inside and out with a mixture made as follows: to
50 pounds fish, mix 2&frac12; pounds salt, 2&frac12; pounds brown
sugar and 2&frac12; ounces saltpeter. Let the fish stand in a cool
place for 48 to 60 hours with the mixture on, then wash and drain.
Fill into glass jars or enamel lined tin cans and add the following
sauce until cans are nearly filled: &frac14; pound whole black
pepper, 1&frac12; pounds salt, 1 pound of onions chopped fine,
&frac12; ounce bay leaves, &frac14; pound whole cloves, 2 quarts
cider vinegar and 25 quarts of water. Soak the pepper, cloves and
bay leaves for 48 hours in the vinegar. Put the water, salt and
onions in a kettle. Bring to a boil and cook 30 minutes, then add
the vinegar and spices. Let boil for one minute. Strain and it is
ready for use.</p>
<p>Sterilize for 3 hours in hot-water-bath outfit.</p>
<p>Sterilize for 1&frac12; hours in steam pressure or pressure
cooker (10 to 15 lbs. pressure).</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED FISH IN OIL</b></p>
<p>Rub fish with salt, brown sugar and saltpeter as above directed.
Wash and dry thoroughly in the sun. Spread on wire screens and dip
in oil heated to a temperature of 300 degrees. Use a strap handle
plunge thermometer to determine heat of oil. Cottonseed oil may be
used for this purpose, although olive oil is best. As soon as the
fish are cool enough to handle, pack tightly in cans, filling up
with the hot oil.</p>
<p>Sterilize 3 hours in hot-water-bath-outfit; 1&frac12; hours in
steam pressure or pressure cooker (10 to 15 lbs.).</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNED FISH IN TOMATO SAUCE</b></p>
<p>Handle same as specified under "Another Formula for
Miscellaneous Fish," except pour in the following sauce instead of
pepper, cloves, onions, etc.: Ten gallons of tomato pulp (mashed
tomatoes and juice with cores, seeds and skins removed); 1 gallon
cider vinegar, 1 pint Worcestershire sauce; 2&frac12; pounds red
sweet peppers; 2&frac12; pounds sugar, 2 cups salt, 2 pounds onions
(chopped fine); 1 pound West India peppers and 1 ounce Saigon
cinnamon. The fish are processed same as "Fish in Oil." Enamel
lined cans or glass jars must be used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH CHOWDER</b></p>
<p>The cleaned heads of any fish, the backbones cut out of large
fish with what meat adheres to them and all other fish scraps may
be used for fish chowder. Put all these parts in cold water (to
cover) and cook until all the meat can be easily removed from the
bones. Pick all the meat from the bones, strain the fish liquor and
return it with the picked fish meat to the kettle. Add the
following ingredients: To every two pounds of fish picked from
bones and the liquor in which fish was cooked add 6 onions, diced
or sliced thin; 6 potatoes, diced or sliced thin; 2 tablespoonfuls
fat; 1 teaspoonful paprika; 2 teaspoonfuls salt or salt to
taste.</p>
<p>Cook vegetables, fat and seasonings until vegetables are half
done. Pack hot in cans and sterilize same as all other fish. When
the chowder is opened, heat and add milk according to taste.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FISH ROE</b></p>
<p>For canning be sure to use roe of freshly caught fish and only
such roe as is known to be good to eat. The roe of some fishes,
such as the garfish, is not eaten.</p>
<p>Clean the roe by removing the shreds and strings adhering to it
and wash well in cold water, being careful not to break the roe.
Soak for 2 hours in a brine made of 6 quarts of water and 6 ounces
of salt. Drain and pack in hot glass jars or enameled tin cans. Can
for the same length of time as other fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OYSTERS</b></p>
<p>Be sure all oysters that are to be canned are absolutely fresh,
have not "soured" and contain no spoiled oysters. Oysters are
opened by hand. All oysters should be rejected that have partly
open shells, as this is a sign that the oyster is dead and
consequently not fit to eat.</p>
<p>Rinse the oysters to prevent any pieces of shell or grit from
getting into the cans. Blanch 5 minutes. Cold-dip. If the canned
oysters are to be sold it is required by law to mark on each can
the net weight of solids or meat exclusive of liquids.</p>
<p>There have been a number of standard grades of oysters
recognized on the Baltimore market. They are given as follows:
"Standard Oysters" (four kinds).</p>
<p>No. 1 cans, containing respectively 1&frac12;, 3, 4 and 5 ounces
of meat, after being processed in the cans.</p>
<p>No. 2 cans, containing respectively 3, 6, 8 and 10 ounces of
meat.</p>
<p>"Select" and "Extra Select" Oysters contain respectively 6
ounces and 12 ounces for No. 1 and No. 2 cans. The above are the
net weights of meats only that have been drained over a strainer
with a wire bottom of &frac12; inch mesh. These are the only grades
that have so far been recognized by the trade. An even balance
scale, with one platform for graduated weights and another for
articles to be weighed, is used to weigh oysters or clams. It is
suggested that those who are going to can clams or oysters find out
from their prospective customers just what requirements are as to
weights and then make their pack meet the occasion. Under no
circumstances is it advisable to make any misstatements or misbrand
in any respect.</p>
<p>After oysters have been packed in the can, fill with boiling
brine made of 5 quarts of water to &frac14; lb. salt to within
&frac12; inch from top of can. Sterilize as other fish.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CLAMS</b></p>
<p>If clams are received in a muddy condition, it is advisable,
though not necessary to wash them before opening. After opening,
discard broken or discolored clams. Do not can any clams unless
absolutely fresh. Blanch. Cold-dip. Weigh out the amount of solid
meat, after draining, that is to go into each can. Weigh and label
just as oysters are weighed and labeled.</p>
<p>Fill can to within &frac12; inch from the top with boiling brine
made of 5 gallons of water and 1 pound of salt. Sterilize.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CLAM BROTH AND CHOWDER</b></p>
<p>Place the clams, after being opened, in a kettle with enough
cold water to cover. Add a few stalks of celery. Boil for 10
minutes. Season with salt, and pepper to taste and add 1 tablespoon
butter to every 50 or 60 large clams. Can. Clam chowder can be made
according to any recipe and then canned.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SHRIMPS</b></p>
<p>Shrimps when first caught are a grayish white color. They are
very delicate and spoil quickly if allowed to stand for any length
of time in a warm place. There are two general methods of canning
shrimp&mdash;the "dry pack" and "wet pack." Nearly all the trade
now calls for "wet pack" because the other always has a rather
offensive odor and the meat is never so fresh and sweet of flavor
as the "wet pack." Canned shrimp is very pleasing to the taste and
is preferred by many to lobster for salads and stews.</p>
<p><b>Wet Pack.</b> Medium sizes are preferable as very large
shrimps are apt to be too tough and too dry. Put the shrimps into a
wire scalding basket and lower into a boiling hot salt water
solution made by mixing one pound of salt to each gallon of water.
Allow the shrimps to remain in this bath for about five minutes,
then remove and drain thoroughly.</p>
<p>Peel and remove viscera (entrails). The boiling and the salt
will harden the meat and make the peeling comparatively easy. Pack
into enameled tin cans or glass jars. Nos. 1 and 1&frac12; cans are
used almost exclusively. These sizes should contain 4&frac12; oz
and 9 ounces of meat respectively. It is unsafe to put in more meat
than above directed, for it might cake and become solid when
processed.</p>
<p>Add a very mild brine to within &frac12; inch from top of can.
For the brine use 1 teaspoonful salt to 1 quart of boiling water.
Sterilize.</p>
<p><b>Dry Pack.</b> Handle same as above, except do not pour into
the cans any brine. The fish is packed in the cans and processed as
follows without the addition of any liquor.</p>
<p><b>Drying of Shrimps.</b> After shrimps are boiled and peeled
they may be dried. Spread on a drier of any kind and dry at a
temperature of from 110&deg;F. to 150&deg;F. When thoroughly dry
pack in dry clean glass jars or in parchment-paper lined boxes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SALMON</b></p>
<p>Scale fish, clean and wipe dry. Do not wash. If the fish are
large cut in lengths to fill the cans and in sizes to pass through
can openings easily. Salmon is usually packed in No. 1 cans or in
flat cans. Fill cans with fish after it has been blanched 5 minutes
and cold dipped. Sterilize as other fish.</p>
<p>Many salmon packers lacquer the outside of their cans to prevent
rusting. This is a very advisable point. The test for unsound
salmon is the nose. If the contents issue an offensive odor, it is
unsound. Freezing does not hurt canned salmon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>AMERICAN OR DOMESTIC SARDINES</b></p>
<p>The fish taught and used for packing domestic sardines belong to
the herring family and are said to be of the same species as the
sardines of France, Portugal and Spain. There are two methods
generally used in canning sardines. First, when the fish are put in
a sauce such as mustard dressing or tomato sauce, and secondly
where they are packed in oil.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANNING SARDINES IN SAUCE</b></p>
<p>The heads are cut off, the scales taken off and the fish
cleaned. Blanch 5 minutes; cold dip; drain and pack into the cans
dry. Cover with sauce, either mustard or tomato.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SARDINES IN OIL</b></p>
<p>The fish are prepared in the same manner as above described but
instead of blanching them, they are put in wire baskets and
immersed in boiling peanut or cottonseed oil until tender. Olive
oil might be used, but is rather expensive. When cooked, they are
drained, packed into cans in order, and the cans filled with olive
oil. It is often advisable to salt the fish while fresh and before
cooking as it improves the flavor.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRAB MEAT</b></p>
<p>Put 5 gallons of water in a large kettle. Add &frac14; lb. of
baking soda to it. When boiling vigorously throw the live crabs in
it and boil quickly for 20 minutes. Remove crabs and wash them in
cold water. Pick out all meat. Wash the meat in a brine made of 1
ounce of salt dissolved in three quarts of water. Drain and pack in
enameled No. 1 flat cans. Sterilize. As soon as the time of
sterilizing is up, plunge the cans immediately into cold water,
otherwise crab meat discolors. For this reason, glass jars are not
so well adapted to crab meat canning as tin cans.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLAKED CODFISH</b></p>
<p>The fish are first cleaned and the entrails removed, then the
fins are cut off. The fish are then soaked for about two hours in a
salt brine to remove the blood. This brine is made with about 10
lbs. of salt to 8 gallons of water. The brine is then rinsed off
and the fish are cooked, either boiled or cooked by steam. When
codfish are thoroughly cooked, the meat will drop off of the bone
in pieces, and it is very white in color and crisp in texture.
These pieces are then broken in suitable sizes and are ready to
place in the cans. The cans are filled as full as possible, because
after processing the fish will shrink some.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CRAWFISH</b></p>
<p>The best way to can crawfish is to put it up in a bouillon as
follows: Water, 2 gallons; vinegar, 1 quart; cloves, 10; carrots in
slices, 6; onions in slices, 6; cloves of garlic, 3.</p>
<p>To the above should be added a good quantity of pepper to suit
the taste, a little salt and bunch of parsley and a little thyme.
Boil slowly for about an hour. Throw in the crawfish after the
intestines have been extracted; to do this take the live crawfish
in your hand and tear off the wing which is in the middle of the
tail; it will pull out at the same time a little black intestine
which is very bitter. Boil one or two minutes, never longer, put in
cans and process.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>EASY METHODS OF CANNING IN TIN</h3>
<br>
<p>If the proper sanitary requirements are provided and
instructions of the cold-pack method of canning are followed, it is
entirely safe and practical to use tin cans for all kinds of
fruits, vegetables and other food products. Food
poisoning&mdash;commonly called ptomaine poisoning&mdash;and the
effects ascribed to "salts of tin" result from improper handling
and improper preparation of the product before packing, or from
allowing the product to stand in the tin after it has been opened.
The raw food products used for canning in tin must be in sound
condition, just as they must be if put into glass containers.</p>
<p>It is true that canned foods may be rendered unfit for use by
improper handling of the product before packing and that
decomposition may occur after canning, owing to insufficient
processing, improper sealing or the use of leaky containers. This
condition, however, is no more likely to be encountered in foods
put up in tin than in products canned in other types of containers.
You run no more danger of poison from your own tin-canned products
than from tin-canned food bought at the store. Most canned foods if
in a spoiled condition readily show this condition by the swelling
of the can or by odor or taste. Canned foods showing such evidences
of decomposition should not be used.</p>
<p>Certain foods which are high in protein, such as meats, peas,
beans and fish products, may undergo decomposition without making
this condition obvious to the senses. It is essential, therefore,
that the greatest care be taken to subject such products to proper
preparation and ample processing. It should be remembered that
canned foods, after opening the containers, should be treated as
perishable products and should be handled with the same precautions
that are applied when fresh products are being used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ADVANTAGES OF CANS</b></p>
<p>Many housewives ask, "Why can in tin when we have always used
glass jars?" There are many advantages in canning in tin which we
can well consider. There is no breakage as in glass; you can handle
the tin cans as carelessly as you choose and you will not hear a
snap or crack indicating a lost jar. Furthermore, tin cans are
easier to handle not only in canning but in storing.</p>
<p>The expense each year of new tin covers or new tin cans is no
more than the purchase of new rubbers and the replacement of broken
glass jars. Furthermore, one big advantage of tin over glass is
that tin cans can be cooled quickly by plunging them into cold
water immediately upon removal from the canner, and thus the
cooking is stopped at the proper moment. The product is
consequently better in form and flavor than when the cooking is
prolonged, as it must be in glass jars. Many women like the large
openings of cans because they can make better packs than when using
narrow-necked jars.</p>
<p>If you do not care to bother with the soldering you can purchase
a safe and simple device that will do the work for you. This device
is called a tin-can sealer. With a sealer no soldering is
necessary. Even an inexperienced person, by following directions
carefully, can seal a can as well as an experienced one. The sealed
cans look exactly like those purchased at the store. Two or three
cans a minute can be sealed with this device.</p>
<p>This is the way to operate a can sealer: Prepare the fruits and
vegetables as for any canning, following directions formerly given
for cold-pack canning.</p>
<p>After the fruits or vegetables have been properly prepared,
blanched and cold-dipped if necessary, place them in sanitary,
solderless cans. Put water or sirup on, according to directions.
Put the top on the can and place the can in the sealer.</p>
<p>Raise the can into the chunk by swinging the raising lever at
the bottom of the machine against the frame. Turn the crank,
rapidly at first, with the right hand, and at the same time push
the seaming-roll lever very slowly with the left hand until it will
go no farther. This is one of the most important steps in the use
of the machine. Continue to give the crank several turns after the
seaming-roll lever has gone as far as it will go. This completes
the first operation or seam.</p>
<p>Continue turning the crank with the right hand, and with the
left hand pull the seaming-roll lever until it will go no farther
in this direction. After this has been done give the crank several
more turns, and the second and final operation is complete. Bring
the seaming-roll lever back to the middle position and remove the
can. The can is then ready for sterilization.</p>
<p>Before sealing a new lot of cans or after changing for a
different size of can, one or two of the cans about to be used
should be tested for leaks. If this is done and the cans stand the
test it will be unnecessary to test the remaining cans of that same
lot. The following is a simple and safe test:</p>
<p>Put one tablespoon of water into an empty can and seal. Have on
hand a vessel containing enough boiling water to cover the can. Set
aside and, as soon as bubbles disappear from the surface, immerse
the can in the hot water. This heats the water in the can and
creates a pressure within the can. Keep the can under the surface
for two minutes, and if by that time no bubbles rise from the can
the can has been sealed air-tight.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ADJUSTING THE SEAMING ROLLS</b></p>
<p>If bubbles rise from the can the seam is not sufficiently tight.
If this seam is not sufficiently tight the <i>second</i> seaming
roll needs adjusting, provided the directions regarding seaming
rolls given below have been observed. To set the rolls proceed as
follows: Loosen the nut on the bottom of the seaming-roll pin. With
a screw driver turn the seaming-roll pin counter
clockwise&mdash;that is, from right to left. Turn very slightly
and, while holding the seaming-roll pin with the screw driver in
the left hand, tighten nut with the right hand, and test as
before.</p>
<p>Occasionally it is well to compare the seam after the first
operation with the sample can which is sent with the machine.</p>
<p>If seaming rolls cut into the can they are set too close, and
the seaming-roll pin should be adjusted in the opposite direction
from above.</p>
<p>After adjusting, always test cans as suggested above before
canning. The seaming rolls are set before the machine leaves the
factory and should not require adjusting for some time, but I have
found that slight variations in cans may make adjusting
necessary.</p>
<p>If for any reason the second seaming roll is brought into
contact with the can before the first operation is complete it may
injure the can seriously, thus preventing an air-tight seam.</p>
<p>If the first seaming roll is forced in too rapidly it may ruin
the seam. Push the seaming-roll lever gently and steadily, while
turning the crank with the right hand. This rolls the seam
gradually. There is no danger from bringing in the second seaming
roll too quickly if the first seaming roll has completed its
work.</p>
<p>There are thus, as you see, two kinds of tin cans used in home
canning: The sanitary or rim-seal can, which is used with a sealer,
and the cap-and-hole can. The latter consists of a can, and a cover
which carries a rim of solder and is fastened on the can by the
application of heat.</p>
<p>The sanitary can has a cover a trifle larger than the diameter
of the can, thus leaving the full diameter of the can open for
filling. That part of the cover that comes into contact with the
can is coated with a compound or fitted with a paper gasket or ring
which makes a perfect seal when the cover is crimped on the can.
Some mechanical device is necessary for sealing this can, and this
is the sealer.</p>
<p>Cans may be had with inside enamel or plain without any enamel.
The following fruits and vegetables should be canned in
enamel-lined cans: All berry fruits, cherries, plums, rhubarb,
pumpkin, beets and squash. All highly colored products should be
canned in enamel-lined cans to prevent the bleaching effect induced
by their action upon the plain tin. Some prefer to can fish and
meat in the enamel-lined cans. Other products not mentioned here
may be canned in plain cans, since they are less expensive than the
enamel-lined cans.</p>
<p>Covers are lined in two ways, with the paper gasket and the
compound gasket. The compound gasket is merely a preparation,
scarcely visible, applied to the under side of the cover and is not
easily damaged by handling. The paper gasket is a ring placed on
the under side of the cover and must be handled carefully. If the
paper gasket becomes broken the cover must be discarded. To
sterilize covers having the paper gasket, place them in the oven
for a few minutes, but <i>do not wet them</i>, before sealing cans.
Do not remove or handle paper gaskets.</p>
<p>When the cans are removed from the cooker the ends should be
raised; this is caused by the pressure within. If they are not
raised at the ends the cans should be carefully examined for
defects. After the cans are sterilized they should be cooled off in
water. This will cause the ends to collapse. If they do not
collapse the reason is probably due to overfilling. It must be
remembered that peas, beans and corn swell a certain amount after
water is placed in the cans; therefore, in canning these vegetables
the cans should be filled only to within a quarter of an inch of
the top. If the pressure of the air from without will not cause the
end to collapse, it should be forced in by hand.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE TINNING OUTFIT</b></p>
<p>Tin-can sealers are made to handle the regular Number 2, or pint
cans, and the Number 3, or quart cans. The sizes are
interchangeable, so that in a few minutes' time a Number 2 machine
may be changed into a Number 3 machine with the necessary
attachments. So it is economy to buy a machine with these
attachments, as you can then use either pints or quarts as you
desire.</p>
<p>If you are selling to boarding houses and hotels you also will
want half-gallon and gallon cans. If you use these larger-size cans
and want the sealer you can get it for these sizes, but you must
tell exactly what you want when ordering.</p>
<p>The prices which I give are 1919 prices and are of course not
stationary. A sealer that will seal the Number 2 sanitary tin cans
costs $14. A sealer for Number 3 cans will cost the same amount.
But the ideal arrangement is the combination machine which can be
used for both the pints, Number 2, and the quarts, Number 3. This
type of sealer costs $16.50. A special machine is used for sealing
the Number 10 or gallon cans, and its price is $35.</p>
<p>The price of the "winter can opener" is $17.00 for smaller size
and $19.50 for the larger one.</p>
<p>Several standard sizes of tin cans are in common use for canning
purposes, as follows:</p>

</table>
<p>The cans are put up in crates holding 100 or 500 cans. If you
are canning for the ordinary market use Number 2 cans for berries,
corn, peas and cherries; Number 3 cans for tomatoes, peaches,
apples, pears and sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>In buying cans it is always necessary to state whether you
desire plain tin or lacquered&mdash;enameled&mdash;cans. In buying
caps always ask for the solder-hemmed caps and give the diameter of
the can opening. For whole fruits and vegetables, cans with
two-and-seven-sixteenth-inch or even larger openings are
preferable. Since the size of the can opening varies and it
ordinarily will not be advisable to have more than one capping
iron, it is recommended that the larger
size&mdash;two-and-seven-sixteenth-inch&mdash;capping iron be
purchased.</p>
<p>The tin cans come in lots of 100 or 500 cans. It is possible to
buy as few as two dozen cans, but that never pays. It is cheaper to
buy a larger quantity. Number 2 plain sanitary cans in 500 lots
cost $3.45 a hundred; in 100 lots, $3.65 a hundred. Number 2
sanitary cans&mdash;enameled&mdash;in 500 lots cost $3.80 a
hundred; in 100 lots, $3.95 a hundred. Number 3, plain, in 500 lots
are $4.50 a hundred; Number 3, plain, in 100 lots are $4.70 a
hundred. Number 3, enameled cans, in 500 lots, are $4.95 a hundred;
Number 3, enameled cans, in 100 lots, are $5.10 a hundred.</p>
<p>The gallons come twelve cans to a case. They are $1.40 a dozen
if 100 cases are bought. If less than 100 cases are ordered they
are $1.50 a dozen.</p>
<p>The cans that you have to solder yourself run just about the
same price, Number 2 being $3.60 in 500 lots and $3.80 in 100 lots.
Number 3 are $4.70 in 500 lots and $4.90 in 100 lots. The buyer
must pay express or freight charges on both sealers and tin
cans.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PREPARING OLD CANS FOR REFILLING</b></p>
<br>
<p>Formerly, after using a tin can once we threw it away; but men
with brains, realizing this waste, have come to our rescue, and as
a consequence we can now use a can three times&mdash;that is, if we
have a sealer. The sealer that seals our cans will also open them
for us, so it becomes our winter can opener. With this can opener
we can use our tin cans three times, buying each year only new
tops, which cost less than good rubbers.</p>
<p><b>Cutting and Reflanging Tin Cans.</b> Cutting off the can the
first time. First lift the spring pin in the top piece, push the
lever from you, drop the spring pin between the stop of the first
operation roll and the cutting-roll stop. Place the can in the
sealer, push the can-raising lever against opposite side of frame.
Turn the crank and gently push seaming-roll handle from you until
you come against cutting-roll stop, and the top of your can is cut
off.</p>
<p><b>Reflanging.</b> Remove standard can base and in its place put
in the reflanging base, lift the spring-pin and bring seaming-roll
lever to the original position. Drop the spring pin between the
stops of the first and second operation rollers, place the can in
the sealer, open end down, push raising lever round until the can
engages with the chuck, turn the crank and at the same time
gradually push raising lever round against the frame. The can is
now ready for use again.</p>
<p><b>Resealing</b>. The can is now three-sixteenths of an inch
shorter than originally. Remove the reflanging base, put one of the
narrow washers on the top of the can-raising lever, then the
standard can base, and the sealer is now ready. Proceed as with the
original can.</p>
<p><b>Cutting the Can the Second Time.</b> Proceed as at the first
time, only be sure to cut off the opposite end. The can may be cut
open and reflanged only twice, once on each end of the can body. In
cutting and reflanging the second time, leave the
three-sixteenth-inch washer under the can base and reflanging
base.</p>
<p><b>Resealing the Second Time.</b> Remove reflanging base and put
the second three-sixteenth-inch washer under the standard can base
and proceed as directed under resealing.</p>
<b>THE SOLDERING OUTFIT</b>
<p>The soldering equipment required includes a capping iron, a
tipping copper, soldering flux, a small brush, a porcelain, glass
or stoneware cup in which to keep the soldering flux: sal ammoniac,
a few scraps of zinc, solder, a soft brick and a file.</p>
<p><b>Soldering Flux.</b> Soldering flux is a solution of zinc in
crude muriatic acid. It is used for cleaning the irons and for
brushing the tins and lead surfaces so as to make it possible for
the melted lead to adhere to the tin.</p>
<p><b>To Make the Flux.</b> Purchase at the drug store ten cents'
worth of crude muriatic acid. Place this in a porcelain, stone or
glass jar. Add as much zinc in small pieces as the acid will
thoroughly dissolve. The flux is always best when it has stood from
twelve to sixteen hours before using. Strain through a piece of
cloth or muslin. Dilute with a little water, about half and half.
This will make the soldering flux. When using keep the flux well
mixed and free from dust and dirt.</p>
<p><b>Tinning Capping Iron.</b> Purchase five or ten cents worth of
sal ammoniac at the drug store; clean iron with file or knife. Mix
a little solder with the sal ammoniac. Heat the capping iron hot
enough so that it will melt the solder and convert it into a
liquid. Place the iron in the vessel containing the mixture of sal
ammoniac and solder. Rotate iron in the mixture until the soldering
edge of the iron has become bright or thoroughly covered with the
solder. All particles of smudge, burned material, and so forth,
should be removed from the iron before tinning.</p>
<p><b>Tinning the Tipping Copper.</b> The tipping copper is tinned
in very much the same way as the iron. Sometimes it is desirable to
file the tipping copper a bit so as to make it smooth and to
correct the point. Heat the copper and rotate the tip of it in the
mixture of sal ammoniac and lead until it has been covered with the
melted lead and is bright as silver. The copper should be filed
nearly to a sharp point.</p>
<p><b>Capping a Tin Can.</b> Use one tin can for experimenting. By
capping and tipping, heating the cap, and throwing it off and
simply putting another cap on the same can, you can use this one
can until you become proficient in capping.</p>
<p>When capping the full packs arrange the cans in rows upon the
table while the capping and tipping irons are heating in the fire.
Take a handful of solder-hemmed caps and place them on all cans
ready to be capped. Place a finger on the vent hole, hold cap in
place, and run the brush containing a small amount of flux evenly
round the solder-hemmed cap with one stroke of the hand. Do this
with all cans ready to be capped. Then take the capping iron from
the fire. Insert in center the upright steel. Hold the capping iron
above the cap until the center rod touches the cap and holds it in
place. Then bring it down in contact with all four points of
solder-hemmed cap and rotate back and forth about three strokes. Do
not bear down on capping iron. A forward and back stroke of this
kind, if properly applied, will perfectly solder the cap in place.
Remove capping iron and inspect the joint.</p>
<p>If any pin-holes are found recap or repair with copper. It may
be necessary to use a piece of wire lead or waste lead rim from a
cap to add more lead to the broken or pinhole places of a cap.</p>
<p><b>Tipping a Tin Can.</b> Take flux jar and brush. Dip brush
lightly in flux and strike the vent hole a side stroke, lightly,
with brush saturated with flux.</p>
<p>Use the waste solder-hemmed cap rim or wire solder. Place point
of wire solder over vent hole. Place upon this the point of the
hot, bright, tipping copper. Press down with a rotary motion.
Remove quickly. A little practice will not only make this easy, but
a smooth, perfect joint and filling will be the result. The cans
are now ready for the canner. The handwork is all over, for the
canner will do the rest.</p>
<p><b>Precautions.</b> Do not fill tin cans too full. Leave a
one-eighth to one-quarter inch space at the top of the can and see
that the product does not touch the cover. If any of the product
touches the cover the application of the hot iron produces steam,
which may blow out the solder, making it impossible to seal the
can.</p>
<br>
<p><b>RULES FOR STERILIZING</b></p>
<p>Remember all fruits and vegetables are prepared for tin cans
exactly as they are for glass jars and the period of cooking or
sterilizing is the same. The following rules will help to avoid
difficulties in the operation of the various canning outfits:</p>
<p>For hot-water-bath outfits, whether homemade or commercial.</p>
<p>1. Support the cans off the bottom sufficiently to permit the
circulation of water under and round the cans.</p>
<p>2. Have the water cover the tops of the cans by at least one
inch. The heat and pressure must be equal on all parts of the
cans.</p>
<p>3. Count time as soon as the water begins to jump over the
entire surface. Keep it jumping.</p>
<p>4. On removing the cans throw them into a sink with running cold
water or plunge them into a pail of cold water.</p>
<p>5. If the cans are laid on their sides the false bottom is not
necessary.</p>
<br />
<p>For steam-pressure and pressure-cooker canners the following
precautions should be observed:</p>
<p>1. Lower the inside crate until it rests on the bottom of the
steam-pressure canners. In the case of the pressure cooker put the
rack in the bottom of the cooker.</p>
<p>2. Have the water come to, but not above, the platform.</p>
<p>3. Tin cans can be piled one above the other.</p>
<p>4. When the canner has been filled fasten the opposite clamps
moderately tight. When this has been done tighten each clamp
fully.</p>
<p>5. Have the canner absolutely steam-tight.</p>
<p>6. Allow the pet cock to remain open until live steam blows from
it.</p>
<p>7. Close the pet cock.</p>
<p>8. After the gauge registers the correct amount of pressure,
begin counting the time.</p>
<p>9. Maintain a uniform pressure throughout the process.</p>
<p>10. When the process is completed allow the steam to escape
gradually through the pet cock. You can lift the pet cock slowly,
using a pencil or a knife. This can be done only with tin cans. If
glass jars are used the canner must be cooled before opening the
pet cock. Blowing the steam from the pet cock is likely to cause a
loss of liquid from the partly sealed glass jars.</p>
<p>11. Throw the tin cans into cold water.</p>
<p>12. If tin cans bulge at both ends after they have been
completely cooled, it indicates that they are spoiling and
developing gas, due to bacteria spores or chemical action. These
may be saved if opened at once and resealed or resoldered and
processed again for ten minutes.</p>

<p>The following table will help you in estimating how many cans of
fruit and vegetables you will obtain from a bushel of product:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>INTERMITTENT CANNING OR FRACTIONAL STERILIZATION</h3>
<br>
<p>In some parts of the United States, particularly in the South,
such vegetables as corn, beans, peas, squash, spinach, pumpkin,
etc., are canned by what is known as the fractional sterilization,
or the so-called Three Days Process.</p>
<p>Southern canning experts have had trouble with certain
vegetables, such as those named, when they canned these vegetables
in the wash boiler by the cold-pack or one period method. They say
that the climatic conditions are so different in the South that
what is possible in the North is not possible in the South.</p>
<p>The vegetables are prepared, blanched, cold-dipped and packed as
in the cold-pack method and the filled cans or jars are processed
in the wash boiler or other homemade outfit a given length of time
three successive days.</p>
<p>After each day's processing the cans should be cooled quickly
and set aside, until the next day.</p>
<p>The method is as follows:</p>
<p>Process or sterilize glass jars for the required number of
minutes on the first day, remove from canner, push springs down
tightly as you remove the jar from the canner.</p>
<p>On the second day raise the springs, place the jar in the
canner, process or boil for the same length of time as on the first
day. Remove from the canner and seal tightly. Set aside until the
third day, when the process should be repeated.</p>
<p>For this canning a good spring-top jar is good, although the
Mason jar type of top will serve for one year; after one year of
use it is advisable to fit old Mason jars and similar types with
new tops.</p>
<p>If using the screw-top jars, such as the Mason, do not disturb
the seal at the second and third processing unless the rubber has
blown out.</p>
<p>This method is only necessary when depending upon boiling water
or condensed steam to do the work.</p>
<p>A steam-pressure canner or pressure cooker is used in the South
and many other places to avoid bothering with vegetables three
successive days.</p>
<p>The steam canner or pressure cooker soon pays for itself in
time, energy, and fuel saved as the vegetables may be canned at
high pressure in one processing.</p>
<p>The following time-tables are those used in the South and will
tell you exactly how long to blanch and process all products. The
preparation of vegetables and fruits is the same as in the
one-period method, but the time of blanching and sterilizing
differs as the time-table indicates.</p>

<p>You will notice in the time-table for tin, that there is a
column for "Exhausting." After the can is packed and capped it is
placed in the canner of boiling water to within 1 inch of the top
of the can where it remains the number of minutes, usually three,
indicated on the time-table. This is done to force the air from the
can through the little hole left open in the top, and is called
exhausting. Cans that are not exhausted frequently bulge after
processing and are looked upon with suspicion. Cans exhausted too
long frequently cave in at the sides. The time-table should be used
carefully and followed strictly in this part of the process. Tin
cans do not require exhausting in the Northern and Western
states.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>WHY CANNED GOODS SPOIL</h3>
<br>
<p>Every day brings letters to my desk saying, "Why did my jars of
vegetables lose water?" or, "When I looked into my canner I saw all
the beautiful dark sirup in the bottom of the canner instead of in
the jars," or, "What shall I do, my beets are all white?" etc.,
etc. In this chapter I am going to try and tell you a few things
you must and must not do. A few "Do's" and "Don'ts" may help you a
little in your canning and food preserving.</p>
<p>I want to say right here that if you have failures do not blame
the method as we are always so apt to do. Experts have worked long
enough, carefully and thoroughly enough, to convince themselves and
others that the cold-pack method and the intermittent method, which
methods are employed for cooking the product in the jar, are sure,
safe, reliable and efficient methods. So if your food spoils
convince yourself it is not the method but something else. Spoilage
is due to imperfect jars, imperfect rubbers, imperfect sealing of
tin cans, careless blanching, insufficient cold dipping or poor
sterilizing.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CAN-RUBBERS</b></p>
<p>Possibly your canning troubles are all due to using a poor grade
of rubber rings. This is poor economy. Rubbers are apt to give more
trouble than anything else to canners when using glass jars. Many
of the rubbers sold are of a very poor quality, disintegrating
quickly when subjected to heat and strain. My sister, canning in
the hot climate of India, has more trouble with the rubber
proposition than anything else.</p>
<p>You want good rubbers, are willing to pay for them, and here is
what you should know about rubber rings.</p>
<p>The one-period, cold-pack method and the intermittent method of
home canning require a rubber ring essentially different from that
commonly used in the old hot-pack method of home canning.
Investigation shows that many of the rings upon the market are
unsuitable for these newer methods, being unable to withstand the
long periods of boiling required in the canning of vegetables and
meats.</p>
<p>Practical canning tests have indicated that rubber rings for use
in this method should meet the following requirements:</p>
<p><b>Inside Diameter</b>. The ring should fit closely, requiring a
little stretching to get it around the neck of the jar. For
standard jars the ring should have an inside diameter of 2&frac14;
inches.</p>
<p><b>Width of Ring and Flange</b>. The width of the ring or flange
may vary from one-fourth of an inch to twelve thirty-seconds of an
inch. Tests which have been made show that fewer cases of
"blow-out" occur when the flange is ten thirty-seconds of an
inch.</p>
<p><b>Thickness</b>. Rubber rings as found on the market may vary
from 1/18 to 1/10 of an inch in thickness. Tests show that 1/12 of
an inch in thickness is sufficient to take up the unevenness in the
jar and still not so thick as to make it difficult to place the cap
or adjust the bail.</p>
<p>Cold-pack and intermittent-canning require a rubber ring that is
tough, does not enlarge perceptibly when heated in water or steam,
and is not forced out of position between the top and the jar by
slight pressure within the jar. This we call a "blow-out."</p>
<p>Rubber rings should be capable of withstanding four hours of
sterilization in boiling water without blowing out on partially
sealed jars, or one hour under ten pounds of steam pressure. They
should be selected with reference to proper inside diameter, width
of flange, and thickness. Good rubber will stretch considerably and
return promptly to place without changing the inside diameter. They
should also be reasonably firm and able to stand without breakage.
Color is given to rings by adding coloring matter during the
manufacturing process. The color of the ring is no index to its
usefulness in home canning. Red, white, black or gray may be
used.</p>
<p>Always use <i>new</i> can-rubbers with each year's product of
canned goods. An old rubber may look like a new one but it has lost
its elasticity and its use may cause imperfect sealing and thus
endanger the keeping quality of the food. This is always a hard
thing to impress upon thrifty penny-saving housekeepers. The old
rubber looks so good, so why not use it? But be wise in this and
remember it is <i>never safe to use old rubbers</i>. New rubbers
are expensive but what about the cost of the product, the loss of
your time and fuel! One jar lost due to an old rubber is so much
food, time and fuel lost.</p>
<p>And do not think yourself thrifty to use two old rubber rings
instead of one, thereby thinking to obtain a better seal, for you
will not. Two old rubbers are inferior in strength to one new good
rubber. If you use old rubbers and your canned goods spoil, blame
the rubbers.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GLASS JARS</b></p>
<p>Next in importance to the rubbers are the glass jars you use.
There are many kinds of fruit jars on the market. The question is
frequently asked, "Which jars on the market are the best." The only
answer to that is to choose the jar which is simplest in
construction, which will seal perfectly and wash easily, which
protects the contained food against contact with metal, which has
the fewest parts to lose or misplace and which fits the shelves and
receptacles planned to hold it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FLAT SOUR</b></p>
<p>Flat-sour often causes annoyance to beginners in canning some
vegetables, such as corn, peas, beans and asparagus. These canned
foods may show no signs of spoilage and yet when the can is opened
the product may have a sour taste and a disagreeable odor. This
"flat-sour" is not harmful and must not be confused with
"botulinus," which is harmful. However, the taste and odor are so
disagreeable you will have no desire to eat "flat-sour" canned
goods.</p>
<p>This trouble can be avoided if you will use fresh products, that
is, those which have not been allowed to wilt or stand around the
shops for several days, and will blanch, cold-dip, and pack one jar
of product at a time, and place each jar in the canner as it is
packed. The first jars in will not be affected by the extra
cooking. When the steam-pressure canner is used the jars or cans
may be placed in the retort and the cover placed into position but
not clamped down until the retort is filled.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TROUBLES WITH CORN</b></p>
<p>Corn seems to give the most trouble, but with a little care and
study this product may be canned as easily as any other grown in
the garden. A little experience in selecting the ears and ability
to recognize corn that is just between the milk and dough stage is
important. Blanch not longer than five minutes. A plunge in cold
water is sufficient. Cut the corn from the cob with a sharp knife
and pack at once in sterilized jars. Best results can be
accomplished when two people cut and one person fills. If it is
necessary for one person to work alone, cut off sufficient corn to
fill one jar, pour on <i>boiling</i> water, add salt, place rubber
and cap in position and put the jar at once in the canner. A little
overcooking does not injure the quality of canned corn. Corn should
not be tightly packed in the jar; it expands a little in processing
and for this reason each jar should be filled scant full. Corn that
has a cheesy appearance after canning had reached the dough stage
before being packed. Corn should never be allowed to remain in the
cold dip and large quantities should not be dipped at one time
unless sufficient help is available to handle the product
quickly.</p>
<p>Some to be absolutely sure when canning corn, cook it for ten
minutes in hot water before packing into jars.</p>
<p>Leave fully one inch of space at the top when packing corn but
enough water may be poured into the jar to fill the can or jar, for
when the corn swells the water will be absorbed.</p>
<p><b>Corn Turning Dark</b>. A dark color in canned corn is due to
some of the following causes:</p>
<p>1. Using water that contains too much iron.</p>
<p>2. Using corn that has reached the dough stage.</p>
<p>3. Blanching for too long a period&mdash;five minutes is
sufficient for corn.</p>
<p><b>Water-Logged or Soaked Corn</b>. When canned corn becomes
"water-logged" or "soaked" it is due to such causes as the
following:</p>
<p>1. Allowing the product to stand in the cold water too long
after the hot dip.</p>
<p>2. Allowing the jars to stand after they have been packed, and
filled with boiling water. The jars should be immediately placed in
the sterilizer after being packed.</p>
<p>3. Allowing ears of corn to stand in cold water after
opening.</p>
<p>4. Heating corn in warm water over a slow fire.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BEETS, THEIR LOSS OF COLOR</b></p>
<p>The loss of color in canned beets is due to faulty methods of
preparation before packing them into the jars. To secure good
results 3 or 4 inches of the top and all of the tail should be left
on while blanching. Beets should be blanched for five minutes and
the skin should be scraped but not peeled. Beets should be packed
whole if possible.</p>
<p>Small beets that run forty to a quart are less likely to fade
and are the most suitable size for first-class packs. The older the
beets the more chance there is for loss of color. Well-canned beets
will show a slight loss of color when removed from the canner, but
will brighten up in a few days.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CLOUDY PEAS</b></p>
<p>The condition of peas known as "cloudy" is due to such causes as
the following:</p>
<p>1. Cracking the skin of the pea.</p>
<p>2. Blanching for too long a period.</p>
<p>3. Use of water which is too hard or has too much mineral
content.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SHRINKAGE OF PRODUCT DURING CANNING</b></p>
<p>Shrinkage may be due to one or more of the following:</p>
<p>1. Improper blanching and cold-dipping.</p>
<p>2. Careless packing and using variety of sizes.</p>
<p>3. Sterilizing for too long a period.</p>
<p>4. Lack of sizing whole products for the container.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a natural shrinkage that cannot be prevented.
This is due to the fact that vegetables contain air in their
tissues and when this air is driven off by the heat, the boiling
water in the jar rushes in to fill its place. In consequence we
have an apparent shrinkage in the amount of water. So be careful to
do the blanching as correctly as possible to drive out the air;
however, the product will keep just as well in a jar half full of
water as if entirely covered with liquid. The contents of the jar
whether food or air are sterile.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SHRINKAGE OF GREENS</b></p>
<p>Shrinkage of greens or pot herbs during the canning process is
usually due to insufficient blanching. The proper way to blanch all
greens or pot herbs is in a steamer or in a vessel improvised to do
the blanching in live steam above the water line. If this is not
done much of the mineral salts and volatile oil contents will be
extracted by the water and lost.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LOSS OF LIQUID DURING CANNING</b></p>
<p>A loss of liquid in canning with a hot-water-bath outfit may be
caused by one or more of the following:</p>
<p>1. Not having the water in the sterilizing vat cover the tops of
the jars by at least one inch.</p>
<p>2. Not providing a suitable platform to hold the jars off the
bottom of the sterilizing vat, permitting circulation of water
under as well as around the jars.</p>
<p>3. Not having the wire bail that goes over the glass tops of
jars sufficiently tight.</p>
<br>
<p><b>REASONS WHY JUICES ARE DRAWN FROM JARS WHEN CANNING WITH
STEAM PRESSURE</b></p>
<p>1. Open pet cock after pointer or gauge has reached zero; test
for pressure by opening pet cock slowly at first. The gauge does
not register pressure until about one pound of pressure has formed,
hence opening the pet cock before the pointer is at zero means that
from one to two pounds of pressure is being relieved and this will
draw the juices the same as allowing the boiler to stand and a
vacuum to form.</p>
<p>2. Allowing the pressure to fluctuate during the time of
sterilizing, such as running the pressure up to fifteen, back to
seven or eight and then up again.</p>
<p>3. Wire bails can be and should be a little tighter when jars
are put in a steam pressure canner. The clamp should be left up as
stated.</p>
<p>4. There may be an escape of steam around the seal of the boiler
and this would allow the pressure on the inside of the boiler to
fluctuate.</p>
<p>Any one of those four things will always cause loss of
juice.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OPERATION OF HOT-WATER-BATH OUTFIT</b></p>
<p>These four rules will help in the operation of the
hot-water-bath canning outfit: Example, wash boiler.</p>
<p>1. Support the jars off the bottom sufficiently to permit the
circulation of water under and around the jars.</p>
<p>2. Have the water cover the tops of the jars by at least one
inch. The heat and pressure must be equal on all parts of the
jars.</p>
<p>3. Count time as soon as the water begins to <i>jump</i> over
the entire surface. Keep it jumping.</p>
<p>4. Remove jars from the water and tighten the covers as soon as
the time is up.</p>
<p>Rapid cooling of the products prevents overcooking, clarifies
the liquid and preserves the shape and texture.</p>
<p>Operation of steamers or "double-deckers" as they are sometimes
called. These have a small amount of water in a pan below two racks
and the products cook in steam instead of boiling water.</p>
<p>1. Have water boiling in pan when products are put in.</p>
<p>2. Use same time-table as for hot-water bath or wash boiler.</p>
<p>3. Remove jars from steam at the end of the sterilizing period.
Do not allow them to "cool off" in the steamer.</p>
<p>The operation of a water-seal canner is very simple.</p>
<p>1. Jars put on racks and lowered in water as in wash-boiler but
due to an extra jacket the temperature is higher than boiling
water.</p>
<p>2. Follow time-table under water-seal.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OPERATION OF STEAM PRESSURE AND PRESSURE COOKER
CANNER</b></p>
<p>1. Place each jar in the canner as soon as it is packed.</p>
<p>2. Have water come up to but not above the platform.</p>
<p>3. Have canner absolutely steam tight.</p>
<p>4. When canner has been filled fasten opposite clamps moderately
tight. When this has been done tighten each clamp fully.</p>
<p>5. Allow pet cock to remain open until live steam blows from
it.</p>
<p>6. Close pet cock.</p>
<p>7. Force pressure to the required point before counting
time.</p>
<p>8. Maintain a uniform pressure during the sterilizing
period.</p>
<p>9. Allow canner to cool before opening pet cock.</p>
<p>10. Have pet cock completely closed during the cooling.</p>
<p>11. Open pet cock before vacuum forms. This is evidenced by a
rush of air into the canner when the pet cock is open. You can test
this by placing the finger over the end of the pet cock. If a
vacuum forms it will draw the flesh of the finger into the
opening.</p>
<p>12. Remove jars from canner and tighten lids as soon as canner
is opened.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BREAKAGE OF JARS</b></p>
<p>When breakage of jars occurs it is due to such causes as
these:</p>
<p>1. Overpacking jars. Corn, pumpkin and sweet potatoes swell or
expand in processing. Do not quite fill jars with these
products.</p>
<p>2. Placing cold jars in hot water or vice versa. As soon as jars
are filled with hot sirup or hot water, place immediately in the
canner.</p>
<p>3. Having the wire bail of glass top jars too tight.</p>
<p>4. In steam canner, having too much water in the canner. The
water should not come above the tray.</p>
<p>5. Cold draft striking the jars when they are removed from the
canner.</p>
<p>6. Wire spring too tight, thus breaking jar when contents
expand.</p>
<br>
<p><b>MOLD ON CANNED PRODUCTS</b></p>
<p>Mold may result from one or more of the following:</p>
<p>1. Leaky rubbers or defective joints.</p>
<p>2. Removing tops from the jars at the end of sterilizing period
and substituting new rubbers, without returning the jars to the
canning outfit for at least a few minutes.</p>
<p>3. If the jars are kept in a damp cellar where the rubbers may
decompose, mold may enter through these decomposed rubbers.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ACIDITY OF TOMATOES AFTER CANNING</b></p>
<p>Too great a degree of acidity in canned tomatoes may be due to
climatic conditions or overripe or underripe product. Such acidity
can be corrected by adding &frac14; teaspoonful of baking soda to
one quart of tomatoes.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WATER REQUIREMENTS FOR HOME CANNING</b></p>
<p>The hardening of beans, peas and some other products after
cooking or processing, or the turning of green vegetables to a dark
or russet color usually indicates that the water contains too high
a percentage of mineral matter. Water used for canning purposes
should be pure, soft if possible or as free from objectionable and
excessive qualities of mineral matter as possible. If you are to
can any large quantity of food products and have difficulty with
the water available, it would be well for you to have the water
analyzed and for you to secure the advice of some one at your
college of agriculture.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TOO MUCH SALT IN CANNED GOODS INJURIOUS TO QUALITY</b></p>
<p>Most vegetables as well as meats are injured in quality by an
excessive use of salt for seasoning in the canning process. A
little salt is very palatable and its use should be encouraged but
it is better to add no salt in canning than to use too much, as it
can be added to suit the taste when served.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ALTITUDE AND ITS EFFECT ON CANNING</b></p>
<p>Remember that practically all instructions on home canning are
based upon a time schedule for sterilization from sea level to an
altitude of 500 feet above sea level. When canning at an altitude
of more than 500 feet above sea level, it will be necessary to use
your judgment in the increase of time for sterilizing on the basis
of 20 per cent for each 4,000 feet.</p>
<p>Blanching means <i>boiling</i>, not hot. In different directions
for canning we often find "hot" water mentioned when boiling water
is intended. Water should be <i>boiling at a gallop</i> when
vegetables are blanched&mdash;berries and soft fruits are not
usually blanched, though some are scalded to loosen the skin.</p>
<br>
<p><b>BERRIES OR FRUIT RISING TO THE TOP</b></p>
<p>Some women are disturbed because berries and fruits have a
tendency to always rise to the top of the jar leaving a sirup space
in the bottom. To prevent this you can scald all berries and fruits
which are not ordinarily scalded, for one minute and then cold-dip
them. They will be softened some, but remain firm, and can be
packed very closely in a jar. They can be packed so closely that
only a little sirup can be added. When a jar thus packed comes from
the sterilizer the berries or fruit are not floating as they would
be if they were not scalded.</p>
<p>Another method employed to prevent berries from floating is to
put the hot sterilized jar on its side while cooling and to roll it
frequently during the cooling period. The berries are then evenly
distributed through the sirup.</p>
<p>In canning mushrooms in tin, always use lacquered cans. Do not
fail to blanch and cold dip before packing, and remove the
mushrooms immediately after opening the tin cans.</p>
<p>In canning cabbage and other similar products always soak the
product in cold brine for one hour before sterilizing. Use &frac12;
pound salt to 12 quarts water. This is believed to improve the
flavor. Always wash greens or other vegetables, to remove all dirt
and grit.</p>
<br>
<p><b>TROUBLES WITH TIN CANS</b></p>
<p>To discover pin-holes or any leaks in a tin can, immerse it in
boiling water after sealing and if there is any bubbling from the
can, you may rest assured it needs resealing.</p>
<p>Swells in tin cans are caused by insufficient sterilization. The
action of bacteria causes gas to form in the can and as a result
there is a bulging at either end. If left alone long enough the
cans will explode. Watch carefully all bulging cans and use them
first. Sometimes a slight bulge occurs when a can has been filled
too full.</p>
<p>If you have trouble sealing tin cans the chances are that the
can is too full. See that no particle of food touches the top or
when soldering, if you employ that method of sealing, small pin
holes will be blown in the seal by escaping steam which is
generated by the hot sealer coming in contact with the cold food.
Another cause of sealing trouble lies sometimes in a poorly heated
capping steel or because it is not kept brightly tinned. To make a
proper seal the steel must be kept bright, hot and clean.</p>
<p>Also, be sure you buy good solder as there are inferior grades
that are too poor to flow when properly heated.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FROZEN PRODUCTS</b></p>
<p>Watch all jars and cans that have been subjected to a freeze. If
the cans or jars do not burst the only harm done is a slight
softening of the food tissues. In glass jars after freezing there
is sometimes a small crack left which will admit air and
consequently bacteria.</p>
<p>Sometimes cans and jars tip over in the wash boiler during
sterilizing. This is caused by using a false-bottom which is too
low or because it is not well perforated. Or it may be due to the
fact that the jar was not well packed and so may be too light in
weight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>GETTING READY TO DRY</h3>
<br>
<p>For various reasons women have not taken so kindly to drying
fruits and vegetables as they have to canning these foods.</p>
<p>One woman said to me: "I like the canning because I can come to
a demonstration and see the whole process carried through from
start to finish. The drying of strawberries cannot be completed in
sixteen minutes as the canning is." And another woman said: "What I
do not like about drying is having the stuff standing round the
house somewhere for so many hours. I like to get things in the jars
and out of sight."</p>
<p>These two objections seem to be expressed more than any other.
And in addition there is a third objection to drying: "I want my
prepared food ready to use on a minute's notice. I can quickly open
a can of my fruit and vegetables and there it is ready. With my
dried things I have to allow time for soaking and cooking." This we
will have to admit is true. But what weight have these three
arguments against the many advantages of drying?</p>
<p>When we study the history of food preservation we find that
drying was practiced before canning, pickling or preserving. I know
my grandmother successfully dried quantities of things.</p>
<p>Vegetable and fruit drying have been little practiced for a
generation or more, though there have been some thrifty
housekeepers who have clung to their dried corn, peas, beans and
apples. A friend of mine says: "Why, dried corn has a much better,
sweeter taste than your canned stuff. I would rather have one
little dish of my delicious dried corn than two big dishes of your
canned corn."</p>
<p>Drying, I think we will all admit, does not and cannot take the
place of canning fruits and vegetables in glass or tin. Drying and
canning are twin sisters, and always go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The ideal arrangement for all homes, whether on the farm, in the
village, in the town or in the city, is to have an ample supply of
canned food for emergencies and quick service, and an equally ample
supply of dried foods when meals are planned beforehand and there
is time enough for the soaking and cooking of the dried foods.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE ADVANTAGES OF DRYING</b></p>
<p>When we come right down to facts, drying has many advantages
over canning.</p>
<p>The process is very simple, as you will see. The cost is slight.
In almost every home the necessary equipment, in its simplest form,
is already at hand. There is no expense for glass jars or tin cans,
and with ordinary care there is no loss of products, as there may
be in handling glass jars or from spoilage. The actual work
requires less time and less skill than canning and the dried
products when properly prepared are just as good as the canned
ones&mdash;some say better.</p>
<p>One special thing in favor of drying is the little storage space
needed. You can often reduce 100 pounds of fresh product to ten
pounds by drying, without any loss of food value and with little
loss of flavor.</p>
<p>Dried products can be moved more conveniently than glass jars or
tin cans, for they are usually reduced to from one-third to
one-fifth of the original bulk.</p>
<p>Another valuable thing about drying is that the little odds and
ends one would scarcely bother to can may be dried in the oven as
you go about your housework.</p>
<p>I have often been asked the difference between the meaning of
the terms "evaporated," "dried," "desiccated" and "dehydrated."
These terms are used more or less interchangeably when applied to
foods from which the moisture has been removed. In a general way,
however, "evaporated" products are those from which the moisture
has been removed through the agency of artificial heat; dried fruit
is that which has been exposed to the heat of the sun, though not
infrequently the term is applied to products handled in the
evaporator. The other terms are commonly applied to products that
have been evaporated by one of the various patented processes in
which equipment of some special design has been used.</p>
<p>To avoid any confusion we will use the general term "dried" for
all products that have enough of the water removed to prevent
bacterial action, but which still retain the maximum food value,
color and flavor of the original product. And that is what we want
to accomplish when we attempt to dry.</p>
<p>How are we to remove the water and still retain food value,
color and flavor? There are three principal methods by which we can
do this. First, by artificial heat. Drying by artificial heat is
done in the oven or on top of a cookstove or range, in trays
suspended on the stove or in a specially constructed dryer built at
home or purchased.</p>
<p>Second, by the sun. Sun drying is done either out of doors in
the sun, under glass in sun parlors, or the products are hung in
the attic where the sun has free access.</p>
<p>Third, satisfactory drying may be done by an air blast from an
electric fan.</p>
<p>Of course any one of these may be used alone or two different
methods may be combined. You can start a product on the stove and
finish it in the sun, or <i>vice versa.</i></p>
<p>The simplest and yet the most effective drying may be done on
plates or dishes placed in the oven. It may be done on the back of
the kitchen stove with these same utensils while the oven is being
used for baking. In this way left-overs and other bits of food may
be dried with slight trouble while the stove is being used, and
saved for winter use. This method is especially effective for sweet
corn. A few sweet potatoes, apples or peas, or even a single
turnip, may be dried and saved.</p>
<p>To keep the heat from being too great, when drying in the oven
leave the oven door partly open. For oven use, a simple tray may be
made of galvanized-wire screen of convenient size, with the edges
bent up for an inch or two on each side. At each corner this tray
should have a leg an inch or two in length to hold it up from the
bottom of the oven and permit circulation of air round the
product.</p>
<p>Oven drying in a gas range is an effective method if the
temperature is kept even. An oven thermometer is a great
convenience, otherwise the temperature will have to be carefully
watched and the burners turned as low as possible. It is economy in
the end to purchase an oven thermometer, for then you can have the
temperature just right. It is best to start the temperature at 110
degrees Fahrenheit and dry at 130 degrees. Never go over 150
degrees.</p>
<p>If you wish to dry in the oven over the kerosene stove, place
soapstones over each burner to prevent the heat from becoming too
intense. Turn the burners very low until the stones are thoroughly
heated. You can turn off the burners completely after the desired
temperature is reached and it will be maintained from the heat of
the stones for five or six hours. If more time than that is
required for the drying, it may be necessary to light the burners
again before the end of the process. The products should be turned
constantly, so that they may dry evenly.</p>
<p>When using any oven for drying you can cover the oven racks with
cheesecloth and spread the products on them. Always have the racks
two or three inches apart to allow free circulation of air.</p>
<p>An effective dryer for use over a stove or range may easily be
made at home. For the frame use strips of wood a half inch thick
and two inches wide. The trays or shelves are made of
galvanized-wire screen of small mesh tacked to the supports.
Separate trays sliding on strips attached to the framework are
desirable. This dryer may be suspended from the ceiling over the
kitchen stove or range or over an oil, gasoline or gas stove, and
it may be used while cooking is being done. If an oil stove is used
there must be a tightly fitting tin or galvanized-iron bottom to
the dryer, to prevent the fumes of the oil from reaching and
passing through the material which is to be dried. A bottom of this
kind may be easily attached to any dryer, homemade or commercial. A
framework crane makes it possible for this dryer to be swung to one
side when not in use.</p>
<p>A larger kind of homemade stove dryer can be made. This is a
good size: base, 16 by 24 inches; height, 36 inches. The lower part
or supporting framework, six inches high, is made of galvanized
sheet iron, slightly flaring toward the bottom, and with two
ventilating holes in each of the four sides. The frame which rests
on this base is made of strips of wood one or one and a half inches
wide. Wooden strips, an inch and a quarter wide and three inches
apart, serve to brace the sides and furnish supports for the
trays.</p>
<p>In a dryer of the dimensions given there is room for eight
trays. The sides, top and back are of galvanized-iron or tin
sheets, tacked to the framework, though thin strips of wood may be
used instead of the metal. Small hinges and a thumb latch are
provided for the door. Galvanized sheet iron, with numerous small
holes in it, is used for making the bottom of the dryer. To prevent
direct heat from coming in contact with the product and also to
distribute the heat by radiation, a piece of galvanized sheet iron
is placed two inches above the bottom. This piece is three inches
shorter and three inches narrower than the bottom and rests on two
wires fastened to the sides.</p>
<p>The trays are made of wooden frames of one-inch strips, to which
is tacked galvanized-wire screen. Each tray should be three inches
shorter than the dryer and enough narrower to allow it to slide
easily on the supports when being put in or taken out.</p>
<p>In placing the trays in the dryer push the lower one back as far
as it will go, leaving a three-inch space in front. Place the next
tray even with the front, leaving the space at the back. Alternate
all the trays in this way to facilitate the circulation of the
heated air. It is well to have a ventilating opening, six by two
inches, in the top of the dryer to discharge moisture. The trays
should be shifted during the drying process to procure uniformity
of drying.</p>
<p>Several types of stove dryers are on the market. One of these
has a series of trays in a framework, forming a compartment. This
is placed on top of the stove. Another is a shallow metal box which
is filled with water. This is really a water-bath dryer. This dryer
or dehydrator can be used on either a gas or coal range. A
thermometer is necessary in order to maintain the right
temperature. The slices of vegetables or fruit are placed on the
tray with the thermometer, and the dryer does the work.</p>
<p>Commercial dryers having their own furnaces may be bought at
prices ranging from $24 to $120. Some of these, in the smaller
sizes, may be bought without furnaces and used on top of the
kitchen stove. The cost is from $16 upward.</p>
<p>Sun drying has much to recommend it. There is no expense for
fuel, no thermometer is needed, and there is no danger of
overheating the fruits or vegetables.</p>
<p>For sun drying of fruits and vegetables, the simplest way is to
spread the slices or pieces on sheets of plain paper or lengths of
muslin and expose them to the sun. Muslin is to be preferred if
there is danger of sticking. Trays may be used instead of paper or
muslin. Sun drying requires bright, hot days and a breeze. Once or
twice a day the product should be turned or stirred and the dry
pieces taken out. The drying product should be covered with
cheesecloth tacked to a frame for protection from dust and flying
insects. If trays are rested on supports placed in pans of water,
the products will be protected from crawling insects. Care must be
taken to provide protection from rain, dew and moths. During rains
and just before sunset the products should be taken indoors.</p>
<p>To make a cheap tray for use in sun drying, take strips of wood
three-quarters of an inch thick and two inches wide for the sides
and ends. To form the bottom, laths should be nailed to these
strips, with spaces of one-eighth of an inch between the laths to
permit air circulation. A length of four feet, corresponding to the
standard lengths of laths, is economical. Instead of the laths
galvanized-wire screen with openings of one-eighth or one-quarter
of an inch, may be used. In using wire the size of the tray should
be regulated by the width of wire screen obtainable. The trays
should be of uniform size, so that they may be stacked together for
convenience in handling.</p>
<p>A small homemade sun dryer, easily constructed, is made of light
strips of wood, a sheet of glass, a small amount of galvanized-wire
screen and some cheesecloth. A convenient size for the glass top is
eighteen by twenty-four inches. To hold the glass make a light
wooden frame of strips of wood a half inch thick and one inch wide.
This frame should have legs of material one by one and a half
inches, with a length of twelve inches for the front legs and
eighteen inches for those in the rear. This will cause the top to
slope, which aids in circulation of air and gives direct exposure
to the rays of the sun. As a tray support nail a strip of wood to
the legs on each of the four sides, about four inches below the top
framework and sloping parallel with the top. The tray is made of
thin strips of wood about two inches wide and has a galvanized-wire
screen bottom. There will be a space of about two inches between
the top edges of the tray and the glass top of the dryer, to allow
for circulation of air.</p>
<p>Protect both sides, the bottom and the front of the dryer with
cheesecloth, tacked on securely and snugly, to exclude insects and
dust without interfering with circulation. At the rear place a
cheesecloth curtain, tacked at the top but swinging free below, to
allow the tray to be moved in and out. Brace the bottom of this
curtain with a thin strip of wood, as is done in window shades.
This curtain is to be fastened to the legs by buttons when the tray
is in place. If you have a sunny, breezy attic you can hang your
drying trays there.</p>
<p>The use of an electric fan is an effective means of drying. As
there is no danger of the food scorching, the fan proves as
effective as the sun for drying.</p>
<p>Sliced vegetables or fruits are placed on trays one foot wide
and three feet long. These trays are stacked and the fan placed
close to one end, with the current of air directed lengthwise along
the trays. The number of trays to be used is regulated by the size
of the fan. Drying by this process may be done in twenty-four hours
or less. With sliced string beans and shredded sweet potatoes a few
hours are sufficient if the air is dry.</p>
<p>Of importance equal to proper drying is the proper packing and
storage of the finished product. Use baking-powder and coffee cans
and similar covered tins, pasteboard boxes with tight-fitting
covers, strong paper bags, and patented paraffin paper boxes, which
may be bought in quantities at comparatively low cost.</p>
<p>A paraffin container of the type used by oyster dealers for the
delivery of oysters will be found inexpensive and easily handled.
If using this or a baking-powder can or similar container, after
filling adjust the cover closely. The cover should then be sealed.
To do this paste a strip of paper round the top of the can,
covering the joint between can and cover for the purpose of
excluding air. Pasteboard boxes should be sealed by applying melted
paraffin with a brush to the joint.</p>
<p>If a paper bag is used the top should be twisted, doubled over
and tied with a string. Moisture may be kept out of paper bags by
coating them, using a brush dipped into melted paraffin. Another
good precaution is to store bags in an ordinary lard pail or can or
other tin vessel having a closely fitting cover.</p>
<p>The products should be stored in a cool, dry place, well
ventilated and protected from rats, mice and insects. In localities
where the air is very moist, moisture-proof containers must be
used. It is good practice to use small containers, so that it will
not be necessary to leave the contents exposed long after opening
and before using.</p>
<p>A very good plan is to pack just enough fruit or vegetables for
one or two meals in each container. This will lessen the chance of
large quantities being spoiled. For convenience label all
packages.</p>

<h2><b>CHAPTER XIII</b></h2>
<h3>HOW TO DRY FRUITS</h3>
<br>
<p>Having decided to add the accomplishment of drying to your other
housewifely arts, you have given some thought and study to the
subject of driers. You now know whether you prefer sun, artificial
or fan drying. You have either made or bought some kind of a drier.
Little other equipment is needed.</p>
<p>A few good paring knives, some plates, and if possible some
cutting or slicing device to lighten the work of preparation are
all that are necessary. A sharp kitchen knife will serve every
purpose in slicing and cutting fruits for drying, if no other
device is at hand. The thickness of all slices of fruit should be
from an eighth to a quarter of an inch. Whether sliced or cut into
strips the pieces should be small, so as to dry quickly. They
should not, however, be so small as to make them hard to handle or
to keep them from being used to advantage in preparing dishes for
the table, such as would be prepared from fresh products. Berries
are dried whole. Apples, quinces, peaches and pears dry better if
cut into halves, rings or quarters.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is essential. A knife blade that is not bright and
clean will discolor the product on which it is used.</p>
<p>Winter apples should be chosen for drying when possible, as
sweet apples and early varieties are not so well adapted to the
purpose. The Northern Spy, the Baldwin and the Ben Davis give a
good-flavored dried product. Most early varieties lack sufficient
firmness of texture for the best results. On the other hand, some
comparatively early kinds, such as Gravenstein and Porter, are
considerably prized in some sections.</p>
<p>To prepare them for drying, apples are peeled, cored, trimmed
and sliced one quarter of an inch thick. Be sure to cut out all
worm holes, decayed spots and other blemishes. Defects are easily
cut out with an ordinary straight-back, sharp-pointed knife having
a blade two and a half to three inches long.</p>
<p>To prevent discoloration, as fast as the fruit is prepared dip
it into a weak salt solution&mdash;three level teaspoonfuls of salt
to one gallon of water. After all the apples are prepared, remove
surplus moisture and put on trays, water-bath drier or whatever
device you are using.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO REGULATE THE HEAT</b></p>
<p>Start with the temperature at 110 degrees Fahrenheit, gradually
raise it to 130 degrees and do the drying at that temperature. It
is important to know the degree of heat in the drier, and this
cannot be determined very accurately except by using a thermometer.
Inexpensive oven thermometers can be bought or an ordinary
thermometer can be suspended in the drier. If a thermometer is not
used the greatest care should be given to the regulation of the
heat. The temperature in the drier rises rather quickly and the
product may scorch unless close attention is given to it.</p>
<p>The reason sun drying is popularly believed to give fruits and
vegetables a sweeter flavor probably is that in the sun they never
are scorched, whereas in the oven or over a stove scorching is
likely to happen unless one is very careful. An oven or dairy
thermometer is a good investment. If you do not have a thermometer
test the heat by the air feeling warm to the hand. The product
should never be so hot that it cannot be grasped in the hand. In
order to prevent the fruit from burning where artificial heat is
used and to keep it from sticking to the drier by remaining in
contact with it too long, stir the fruit occasionally. To insure
the most uniform drying in sun drying, the fruit also should be
stirred occasionally.</p>
<p>Remember that if trays with metal bottoms are used for drying,
they should be covered with cheesecloth to prevent acid action.
Oven racks may be covered with either cheesecloth or heavy wrapping
paper.</p>
<p>The interval between stirring varies with the type of drier
used, with the condition of the fruit and with the degree of heat
maintained. Make the first stirring within two hours after the
drying is begun. After that examine the product from time to time
and stir often enough to prevent scorching or sticking and to
insure uniform drying. Use a wooden paddle for stirring. Where
several trays or racks are placed one above the other, it is
necessary to shift the trays from time to time, so the upper tray
goes to the bottom and the bottom tray to the top.</p>
<p>The time necessary for drying fruit depends upon several
factors: The type and construction of the drier; the depth to which
the fruit is spread; the method of preparing, whether sliced,
quartered or whole; the temperature maintained; and weather
conditions, whether bright and sunny or cloudy and damp.</p>
<p>If the atmosphere is heavy and damp the drying is retarded.
Under some conditions it is hardly possible thoroughly to dry
fruit.</p>
<p>There is possibly no step in the entire drying process that
requires better-trained judgment than the matter of knowing when
the fruit is sufficiently dried. A little experience will soon
teach this.</p>
<p>The fruit should be so dry that when a handful of slices is
pressed together firmly into a ball the slices will be "springy"
enough to separate at once upon being released from the hand. No
fruit should have any visible moisture on the surface. As the dried
apples, pears, peaches and apricots are handled they should feel
soft and velvety to the touch and have a pliable texture. You do
not want fruit so dry that it will rattle. If fruits are brittle
you have dried them too much.</p>
<p>After the apples and all other fruits are dried they must go
through another process, called "conditioning." The best way to
"condition" fruits is to place them in boxes or cans and pour them
from one container into another once a day for three or four
successive days. By doing this you mix the fruit thoroughly and
give to the whole mass an even degree of moisture. Pieces that are
too dry will absorb moisture from those that are too moist.</p>
<p>You may lose a whole bag or jar of dried products if you neglect
the conditioning, for if one moist piece goes into that bag all is
lost. Moisture breeds mold and mold means decay.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions: "Do I ever lose any dried
products? Are my dried products when soaked and cooked as near like
the original fruit as possible?" If you lose products and if your
dried fruits are tasteless you had better start the conditioning
process. For with this one step added to your drying you need lose
no dried products, and you need not dry the fruits to the brittle
stage, as you must of necessity do when you put them away
immediately.</p>
<p>After you have poured the dried products back and forth every
day for three or four days as an additional precaution, reheat the
dried fruit to 140 degrees just long enough&mdash;about thirty
minutes&mdash;to allow the heat to penetrate throughout the
product.</p>
<p>Two kinds of moths stand out prominently among insects that
attack dried fruits and vegetables. They are much more likely to
get into the fruit during the process of drying than to find their
way through boxes into the stored products. This applies
particularly to drying in the sun. The Indian-meal moth is the most
destructive of these insects. It is about three-eighths of an inch
long and has a cloaked appearance, one-third gray and the rest
copper-brown. The fig moth is about the same size, but dark,
neutral gray. A minute, flattened chocolate-brown beetle usually
accompanies these moths and does considerable damage. Both of the
moths deposit their eggs on fruit when it is on the drying
racks&mdash;usually at dusk or after dark, for these insects are
not fond of daylight.</p>
<p>It takes from three to ten days for the eggs to hatch into
whitish or pinkish grublike caterpillars, and from five to ten
weeks from the laying of the eggs before more moths appear to lay
another lot of eggs. A number of "broods" or generations are
produced yearly, so if a few of these moth eggs are stored away on
dried fruits or vegetables hundreds of caterpillars are produced
and many pounds of valuable material may be destroyed during the
winter if the products are stored in a warm room. Dried fruits
stored in warm, dark bins or in sacks offer especially favorable
places for the development of these destructive moths.</p>
<p>It is evident that the larger the package, the greater the
chance of a few eggs doing much damage. Small cartons or containers
confine the injury from these moths to small quantities of
material; for if the containers are closed tightly the insects
cannot easily escape from them and infest other packages which may
not have been infested previously.</p>
<p>If you are drying by sun and the products are not thoroughly dry
at night, finish the process on the stove. If you desire to carry
it over to the next day screen the drying racks early in the
evening and fasten down the cheesecloth. With these precautions and
with proper storage, no danger ordinarily need be feared from these
insects. The additional precaution of heating the dried product to
140 degrees for thirty minutes sterilizes it if already
infested.</p>
<p>Though not necessary, tin cans or glass jars make good
receptacles for storage of dried fruits or vegetables. Pasteboard
boxes with tight covers, stout paper bags and patented paraffin
paper cartons also afford ample protection for dried products when
protected from insects and rodents. The dried products must be
protected from outside moisture, and will keep best in a cool, dry,
well-ventilated place. These conditions, however, are difficult to
obtain in the more humid regions, and there moisture-tight
containers should be used. If a small amount of dried product is
put in each receptacle, just enough for one or two meals, it will
not be necessary to open a container, the contents of which cannot
be consumed in a short time. If a paper bag is used the upper part
should be twisted into a neck, bent over and tied tightly with a
string. A further precaution is to place the small bags in a tin
container with a tightly fitting cover, such as an ordinary lard
can. All bags should bear a label.</p>
<p>Pears and quinces usually are prepared and dried exactly as are
apples. Pears are attractive when cut lengthwise into halves, with
the stem and calyx removed but the core left in. Or they may be
quartered. If sliced like apples the drying period is
shortened.</p>
<p>Peaches usually are dried unpeeled, but they are better if
peeled before drying. The first step in the preparation of peaches
is to split them open to remove the pit. To do this, cut completely
round the peach in the line of the suture with a sharp knife. The
cut must be complete, for tearing of the flesh will make the
finished product less attractive. If the fruit is to be peeled the
paring should be done before it is cut open to remove the pit.</p>
<p>To facilitate the removal of the skin, dip the peaches in a
kettle of boiling water for one and a half minutes; then plunge
directly into cold water, after which the skins can be easily
slipped off. After the pit has been removed, lay on drier pit side
up. The juice of the fruit will collect in the pit or "cup" and
will add to the flavor and quality of the dried peaches. The
peaches can be cut into smaller pieces if you wish to lessen the
drying period.</p>
<p>Plums and apricots are not peeled, but are cut into halves, the
pits removed and dried in the same way as peaches. Small,
thin-fleshed varieties of plums are not suitable for drying.</p>
<p>When drying cherries always remove the stems. The pits may or
may not be removed. The best product for later cooking or eating
has the pit removed, though large quantities of juices are lost in
the pitting unless you provide some way of saving and utilizing
it.</p>
<p>A prune is simply a plum having certain qualities not possessed
by all plums. All prunes are plums, but not all plums are prunes.
The final test as to whether a plum is a prune is the ability to
dry without fermenting with the pit still remaining in the fruit.
If a plum cannot dry without fermentation unless the pit is
removed, it is not a prune. Prunes for drying, like other fruits,
should be fully ripe.</p>
<p>Prunes are merely washed and then dried without removing the
pits. The fruit is dry when the skin is well shrunken. The texture
should be firm but springy and pliable enough to yield readily when
pressed in the hand. The drying should not be continued until the
individual prunes rattle as they are brought in contact with one
another in handling. Prunes must be conditioned before storing.</p>
<p>In drying, prunes shrink about two-thirds in weight&mdash;that
is, for every three pounds of fresh fruit you get one pound of
finished product.</p>
<p>Smaller fruits, such as red and black raspberries, blackberries,
huckleberries, dewberries, strawberries and blueberries, are simply
washed and then put to dry. Berries must not be dried too hard; if
too much moisture is removed they will not resume their original
form when soaked in water. But the material must be dried
sufficiently or it will mold. Haven't you often tasted extremely
seedy dried berries? They were dried until they rattled. Stop the
drying as soon as the berries fail to stain the hand when
pressed.</p>
<p>To obtain the most satisfactory results soft fruits should be
only one layer deep on the drying trays.</p>
<p>Fruits contain about 80 to 95 per cent water and when dried
sufficiently still retain from 15 to 20 per cent of water, so it is
a good plan to weigh before and after drying. The product should
lose from two-thirds to four-fifths of its weight.</p>
<br>
<p><b>STEPS IN FRUIT DRYING</b></p>
<p>1. Thoroughly cleanse the product.</p>
<p>2. Prepare the product by slicing and so on.</p>
<p>3. Spread on trays; put in oven or put on commercial drier.</p>
<p>4. Stir occasionally.</p>
<p>5. Shift trays.</p>
<p>6. Test for completeness of drying.</p>
<p>7. "Condition" for three or four days. Sweet fruits may contain
more moisture without spoiling than those of low sugar content.</p>
<p>8. Heat to 140 degrees Fahrenheit for thirty minutes, to kill
all insects.</p>
<p>9. Pack immediately in available receptacles.</p>
<p>10. Label and store.</p>
<br>
<p><b>FRUIT PASTES</b></p>
<p>Fruit pastes are delicious and can be dried.</p>
<p>1. Select, wash, prepare fruit.</p>
<p>2. Cook until soft; stir.</p>
<p>3. Add sugar to sweeten.</p>
<p>4. Continue cooking until very thick.</p>
<p>5. Spread out flat by spoonfuls on oiled paper.</p>
<p>6. Dry in slow oven; finish drying over kitchen range.</p>
<p>7. Turn from time to time like griddle cakes.</p>
<p>Nuts of all kinds can be dried in these cakes, which may be left
whole or cut in strips with scissors.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANDIED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES</b></p>
<p>1. Select product of uniform size and ripeness.</p>
<p>2. Wash; prepare in usual way.</p>
<p>3. Cut fruit in halves, quarters or smaller sections; cut
vegetables in narrow strips two and a half inches long.</p>
<p>4. Drop in a sirup cooked until it spins a thread. To prepare
ginger sirup, add a few roots of ginger to the sirup.</p>
<p>5. Cook until transparent.</p>
<p>6. Drain.</p>
<p>7. Dry in slow oven; Finish drying over kitchen range.</p>
<p>8. Roll in granulated sugar. (May be omitted for fruits.)</p>
<br>
<p>This method is recommended especially for candied apples,
peaches, pears and carrots.</p>
<p>In a properly constructed sun drier, all fruits will dry in from
3 to 12 hours, under normal summer conditions. Time depends on
dryness of atmosphere, sunshine and wind. Products dried in a sun
drier, no matter how crude, are superior to those dried in the open
without protection of some kind. Products dry more rapidly in high
altitudes than at sea level.</p>
<p>Racks in oven can be used. Plates or platters can be used in
oven. A stove drier hung over the stove can be used. A water-bath
or other commercial drier can be used with the stove.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>HOW TO DRY VEGETABLES</h3>
<br>
<p>Vegetable drying is a little more complicated than fruit drying,
just as vegetable canning is more complicated than fruit canning.
Blanching is an important part of the operation. It makes vegetable
drying satisfactory as well as easy and simple, just as it makes
vegetable canning possible.</p>
<p>However, there is one difference between blanching vegetables
for canning and blanching them for drying. After repeated
experiments it has been found that for drying purposes it is best
to blanch all vegetables in steam rather than in boiling water. In
vegetable canning we blanch almost all vegetables in boiling water,
usually steaming only the members of the "green" family.</p>
<p>So remember that for drying all vegetables are blanched in
steam. To do this steaming you can use your ordinary household
steamer, such as you use for steaming brown breads and suet
puddings, or you can simply place a colander over boiling water in
a kettle. Do not allow the colander to touch the water. If you are
fortunate enough to possess a pressure cooker, steam the vegetables
for drying in it.</p>
<p>Blanching is necessary for many reasons. It removes the strong
flavors, objectionable to many people. Beans, cabbage, turnips and
onions have too strong a flavor if dried without blanching.
Furthermore, it starts the color to flowing, just as it does in
canning. It removes the sticky coating round vegetables. Most
vegetables have a protective covering to prevent evaporation. The
removal of this covering by blanching facilitates drying. Blanching
also relaxes the tissues, drives out the air and improves the
capillary attraction, and as a result the drying is done in a much
shorter period. Products dry less rapidly when the texture is firm
and the tissue contains air.</p>
<p>Blanching checks the ripening processes. The ripening process is
destroyed by heating and this is to be desired for drying
purposes.</p>
<p>Blanching kills the cells and thus prevents the hay-like flavor
so often noticed in unblanched products. It prevents changes after
drying, which otherwise will occur unless the water content is
reduced to about five per cent.</p>
<p>Thorough blanching makes the product absolutely sanitary; no
insect eggs exist after blanching and cold-dipping.</p>
<p>There is one precaution that must be followed: Do not blanch too
long. Blanching too long seems to break down the cell structure, so
that the product cannot be restored to its original color, shape or
size. Follow the blanching time-table for drying just as carefully
as you follow the blanching time-table for canning.</p>
<p>After the blanching comes the cold-dip. For the benefit of new
canning and drying enthusiasts, let me explain that by "cold-dip"
we mean plunging the product immediately into a pan of very cold
water or holding it under the cold-water faucet until the product
is thoroughly cooled. Do not let the product stand in cold water,
as it would then lose more food value and absorb too much
water.</p>
<p>You can cold-dip the product without removing it from the
colander, strainer or steamer in which it is steamed. Plunge the
vessel containing the product into the cold water.</p>
<p>The cold-dipping checks the cooking, sets the coloring matter
which was started to flowing in the blanching process, and it makes
the product much easier to handle.</p>
<p>Let us now see just exactly what we must do when we want to dry
sweet corn, more of which is dried than of any other vegetable. All
other vegetables are dried in the same way as is corn, the only
difference being in the length of the blanching and drying
period.</p>
<p>All vegetables are prepared for drying just as they are prepared
for table use. When drying corn select ears that are young and
tender, and if possible freshly gathered. Products for drying
should be in the same perfect condition as you have them for table
use. If wilted and old it is not worth while drying them.</p>
<p>Remove the husks and the silk, and steam&mdash;on the
cob&mdash;for fifteen minutes. This sets the milk, besides doing
many other things which blanching by steam always does. After the
steaming, cold-dip the corn, and then cut it from the cob, using a
very sharp and flexible knife. Cut the grains fine, but only
halfway down to the cob; scrape out the remainder of the grains,
being careful not to scrape off any of the chaff next to the
cob.</p>
<p>When field corn is used, the good, plump cooking stage is the
proper degree of ripeness for satisfactory drying.</p>
<p>The corn should be thoroughly drained as this facilitates
drying. You can easily remove all surface moisture by placing the
corn between two towels and patting them.</p>
<p>It is now ready for drying. The corn may be dried in the sun,
but if so, it is advisable first to dry it in the oven for ten or
fifteen minutes and then finish the drying in the sun. Never
attempt sun drying in moist weather. The corn may be dried by
artificial heat, either on top of the stove or in the oven, using
either plates, oven-racks properly covered, or any commercial
dryer.</p>
<p>Work quickly after the blanching and cold-dipping and get the
corn heated as quickly as possible in order to prevent souring. You
get "flat-sour" often when canning if you do not work quickly
enough, and you will get sour vegetables in drying if you work too
slowly.</p>
<p>Where artificial heat is used begin at a lower temperature and
gradually increase it. As the corn is drying, stir it from time to
time and readjust the trays if necessary.</p>
<p>After the drying comes the test to determine whether or not the
corn is sufficiently dry. Vegetables at this point differ from
fruits. Fruits are dried only until leathery, whereas vegetables
are dried until they are bone-dry. They must crackle and snap.</p>
<p>This test is sometimes used to see if the product is
sufficiently dry: Put some of it in a covered glass jar with a
crisp soda cracker and keep them there for a few hours. If the
cracker loses its crispness and becomes soft and damp there is
still too much moisture in the product and it should be dried a
little longer to obtain the degree of dryness required.</p>
<p>After the corn is bone-dry it should, like all other vegetables
and fruits, be conditioned. This means to pour them from one bag or
box to another, once a day for three or four days. This enables you
to notice any moisture that may be left in the dried food. Foods
that show any traces of moisture should be returned to the drying
tray for a short time.</p>
<p>Notice Lima beans particularly, as they require a longer
conditioning period than most vegetables.</p>
<p>After the conditioning, in order to kill all insects and destroy
all eggs, it is advisable to place the vegetables on trays and heat
them in an oven for half an hour at a temperature of 140 degrees
Fahrenheit. Store directly from the oven.</p>
<p>Dried vegetables are stored just as are dried fruits&mdash;in
cans, cracked jars that cannot be used for canning, fiber
containers, cheesecloth, paper bags or paraffin containers.</p>
<p>In storing your dried products keep in mind these things:
Protection from moisture, insects, rats, mice, dust and light. If
you observe all these things it is unnecessary to have air-tight
containers.</p>
<p>All varieties of string beans can be dried, but only those fit
for table use should be used. Old, stringy, tough beans will remain
the same kind of beans when dried. There are two ways of preparing
string, wax or snap beans for drying:</p>
<p>1. Wash; remove stem, tip and string. Cut or break into pieces
one-half to one inch long; blanch three to ten minutes, according
to age and freshness, in steam; cold-dip. Place on trays or dryer.
If you have a vegetable slicer it can be used for slicing the
beans.</p>
<p>2. Prepare as above, then blanch the whole beans. After
cold-dipping, thread them on coarse, strong thread, making long
"necklaces" of them; hang them above the stove or out of doors
until dry.</p>
<p>Lima beans should be shelled from the pod and then blanched two
to five minutes if young and tender. If larger and more mature
blanch five to ten minutes.</p>
<p>Okra is blanched for three minutes. If the pods are young and
small, dry them whole. Older pods should be cut into quarter-inch
slices. Small tender pods are sometimes strung on stout thread and
hung up to dry.</p>
<p>Peppers may be dried by splitting on one side, removing the
seed, drying in the air, and finishing the drying in the dryer at
130 degrees Fahrenheit. A more satisfactory method is to place
peppers in a biscuit pan in the oven and heat until the skins
blister; or to steam them until the skin softens, peel, split in
half, take out seed, and dry at 110 to 130 degrees. In drying
thick-fleshed peppers like the pimento, do not increase heat too
quickly, but dry slowly and evenly.</p>
<p>Small varieties of red peppers may be spread in the sun until
wilted and the drying finished in the dryer, or they may be dried
entirely in the sun.</p>
<p>Peppers often are dried whole. If large they can be strung on
thread; if small the whole plant can be hung up to dry.</p>
<p>Shell full-grown peas and blanch three to five minutes; cold-dip
and then spread in a single layer on trays to dry.</p>
<p>When drying the very tender young sugar peas, use the pod also.
Wash and cut in quarter-inch pieces. Blanch six minutes, cold-dip
and remove surplus moisture before drying. When drying beets always
select young, quickly grown, tender beets. Steam twenty to thirty
minutes, or until the skin cracks. Dip in cold water, peel and
slice into one-eighth to one-quarter inch slices. Then dry.</p>
<p>Carrots having a large, woody core should not be dried. Blanch
six minutes; cold-dip. Carrots are often sliced lengthwise into
pieces about one-eighth inch thick. Parsnips, kohl-rabi, celeriac
and salsify are prepared in the same way as are carrots.</p>
<p>Onions should be held under water while peeling and slicing to
avoid smarting of the eyes. They should be sliced into one-eighth
to one-quarter inch slices. Blanch five minutes, cold-dip, remove
superfluous moisture and dry. Leeks are handled as are onions.</p>
<p>Select well-developed heads of cabbage and remove all loose
outside leaves. Split the cabbage, remove the hard, woody core and
slice the remainder of the head with a kraut slicer or cutter or
with a large, sharp knife. Blanch five to ten minutes and cold-dip;
dry.</p>
<p>Spinach and parsley should be carefully washed. Steam, cold-dip
and dry. If the spinach is sliced the drying will be greatly
facilitated. Beet tops, Swiss chard and celery are prepared like
spinach.</p>
<p>Select sound, well-matured Irish potatoes. Wash and boil or
steam until nearly done. Peel and pass through a meat grinder or a
potato ricer. Collect the shred in layers on a tray and dry until
brittle. If toasted slightly in an oven when dry, the flavor is
improved somewhat; or boil or steam until nearly done, peel, cut
into quarter-inch slices, spread on trays, and dry until brittle.
Peeling may be omitted, but the product will be very much inferior
in flavor. Irish potatoes cannot be satisfactorily dried unless
they are first cooked; otherwise they will discolor.</p>
<p>All root vegetables must be thoroughly cleaned, otherwise an
earthy flavor may cling to them. One decayed root may seriously
affect several pots of vegetable soup.</p>
<br>
<p><b>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS</b></p>
<p>1. All vegetables should be completely dried in from two to
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>2. Materials should be turned or stirred several times to secure
a uniform product.</p>
<p>3. If heat is used guard against scorching. The door is left
open if an oven is used; the temperature should be about 110
degrees at the beginning and usually should not exceed 130 degrees.
Onions, string beans and peas will yellow at more than 140
degrees.</p>
<p>4. A thermometer is essential to successful drying by artificial
heat.</p>
<p>5. It is impossible to give definite lengths of times for the
completion of sun drying, as this varies not only with different
products but with the weather. A sultry, rainy day is the worst for
drying.</p>
<p>6. Vegetables should be stone dry.</p>
<p>7. Succulent vegetables and fruits contain from 80 to 95 per
cent of water, and when dried sufficiently still retain from 15 to
20 per cent; so it is a good plan to weigh before and after drying
as a check. The product should lose from two-thirds to four-fifths
of its weight.</p>
<p>8. Work rapidly to prevent souring of vegetables.</p>
<p>9. Small vegetables, mature beans and peas and small onions may
be dried whole. Larger vegetables should be cut up so as to expose
more surface for drying.</p>
<p>10. The slicing, cutting and shredding should be done before
blanching, with the exception of corn, which is cut from the cob
after blanching.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>EVERY STEP IN BRINING</h3>
<br>
<p>We have learned how to preserve fruit and vegetables by canning
and drying and now we are going to learn another method to preserve
foods, in which salt is used. We use this salt method for
vegetables. It is not adapted to fruits. We may pickle apples,
pears and peaches, but we ferment, brine and dry-salt only
vegetables.</p>
<p>This salt method is not a substitute for drying or canning, but
just an additional method we may employ. Every thrifty housewife of
to-day wants her shelves of canned foods, her boxes of dried foods
and her crocks of salted foods. Each kind has its proper function
to perform in the household. One cannot take the place of the
other.</p>
<p>For women on the farm salting is a salvation. In busy seasons
when canning and drying seem an impossibility, a great many
vegetables can be saved by this method in a very short time. The
labor required is very small, as no cooking is necessary. A good
supply of salt is the one necessity.</p>
<p>Besides the saving of time, salting saves jars, which are
absolutely necessary in canning. Old containers can be used if they
are thoroughly cleansed. The vegetables can be put in any
container, so long as it holds water and is not made of metal.
Metal containers should not be used. Old kegs, butter and lard tubs
if water-tight, stoneware jars or crocks, chipped preserve jars,
glass jars with missing covers and covered enamel buckets can all
be utilized. Avoid using tubs made of pitch or soft pine unless
coated with melted paraffin, as they impart a flavor to the
vegetables. Maple is the best.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THREE METHODS OF SALTING FOOD</b></p>
<p>There are three ways of preserving food by salting: First,
fermentation with dry salting; second, fermentation in brine or
brining; and third, salting without fermentation, or dry
salting.</p>
<p><b>Dry Salting.</b> Fermentation with dry salting consists in
packing the material with a small amount of salt. No water is used,
for the salt will extract the water from the vegetables and this
forms a brine. This is the simplest process of all three and is
used mostly for cabbage. To make sauerkraut proceed as follows: The
outside green leaves of the cabbage should be removed, just as in
preparing the head for boiling. Never use any decayed or bruised
leaves. Quarter the heads and shred the cabbage very finely. There
are shredding machines on the market, but if one is not available
use a slaw cutter or a large sharp knife.</p>
<p>After the cabbage is shredded pack at once into a clean barrel,
keg or tub, or into an earthenware crock holding four or five
gallons. The smaller containers are recommended for household use.
When packing distribute the salt as uniformly as possible, using
one pound of salt to forty pounds of cabbage. Sprinkle a little
salt in the container and put in a layer of three or four inches of
shredded cabbage, then pack down with a wooden utensil like a
potato masher. Repeat with salt, cabbage and packing until the
container is full or the shredded cabbage is all used.</p>
<p>Press the cabbage down as tightly as possible and apply a cloth,
and then a glazed plate or a board cover which will go inside the
holder. If using a wooden cover select wood free from pitch, such
as basswood. On top of this cover place stone, bricks or other
weights&mdash;use flint or granite; avoid the use of limestone,
sandstone or marble. These weights serve to keep vegetables beneath
the surface of the liquid. The proportion of salt to food when
fermenting with dry salt is a quarter pound of salt to ten pounds
of food. Do not use more, for the product will taste too salty.</p>
<p>Allow fermentation to proceed for ten days or two weeks, if the
room is warm. In a cellar or other cool place three to five weeks
may be required. Skim off the film which forms when fermentation
starts and repeat this daily if necessary to keep this film from
becoming a scum. When gas bubbles cease to rise when you strike the
side of the container, fermentation is complete. If there is a scum
it should be removed.</p>
<p>As a final step pour very hot melted paraffin over the brine
until it forms a layer from a quarter to a half-inch thick, to
prevent the formation of the scum which occurs if the weather is
warm or the storage place is not well cooled. The cabbage may be
used as soon as the bubbles cease to rise. If scum forms and
remains the cabbage will spoil. You may can the cabbage as soon as
bubbles cease to rise and fermentation is complete. To can, fill
jars, adjust rubbers and partly seal. Sterilize 120 minutes in
hot-water bath, or 60 minutes in steam-pressure outfit at five to
ten pounds pressure.</p>
<p>The vital factor in preserving the material by this method is
the lactic acid which develops in fermentation.</p>
<p>If the vegetables are covered with a very strong brine or are
packed with a fairly large amount of salt, lactic acid fermentation
and also the growth of other forms of bacteria and molds are
prevented. This method of preservation is especially applicable to
those vegetables which contain so little sugar that sufficient
lactic acid cannot be formed by bacterial action to insure their
preservation.</p>
<p>In the well-known method of vinegar pickling the acetic acid of
the vinegar acts as a preservative like the lactic acid produced by
fermentation. Sometimes brining precedes pickling in vinegar, and
often the pickling is modified by the addition of sugar and spices,
which add flavor as well as helping to preserve the fruit or
vegetables. In some cases olive oil or some other table oil is
added to the vinegar, as in the making of oil cucumber pickles.</p>
<p>Besides sauerkraut, string beans, beet tops, turnip tops,
greens, kale and dandelions are adapted for fermentation with dry
salting. String beans should be young, tender and not overgrown.
Remove the tip ends and strings; cut or break into pieces about two
inches long. Wash the beet and turnip tops as well as all greens,
in order to remove dirt and grit. Weigh all products that are to be
salted.</p>
<p>For salting, a supply of ordinary fine salt, which can be
purchased in bulk for about two cents a pound, is most satisfactory
for general use. Table salt will do very well, but it is rather
expensive if large quantities of vegetables are to be preserved.
The rather coarse salt&mdash;known in the trade as "ground alum
salt"&mdash;which is used in freezing ice cream can be used. Rock
salt because of its coarseness and impurities should not be
used.</p>
<p>A weight must be used. The size of the weight depends on the
quantity of material being preserved. For a five-gallon keg a
weight of ten pounds will be sufficient, but if a larger barrel is
used a heavier weight will be needed. The weight should be
sufficient to extract the juices to form a brine, which will cover
the top in about twenty-four hours. If a brine does not form it may
be necessary to add more stones after the material has stood a
while.</p>
<p>There always will be more or less bubbling and foaming of the
brine during the first stages of fermentation. After this ceases a
thin film will appear which will rapidly spread over the whole
surface and quickly develop into a heavy, folded membrane. This
scum is a growth of yeast-like organisms which feed upon the acid
formed by fermentation. If allowed to grow undisturbed it will
eventually destroy all the acid and the fermented material will
spoil. To prevent mold from forming it is necessary to exclude the
air from the surface of the brine.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best method is to cover the surface&mdash;over the
board and round the weight&mdash;with very hot, melted paraffin. If
the paraffin is hot enough to make the brine boil when poured in,
the paraffin will form a smooth, even layer before hardening. Upon
solidifying, it forms an air-tight seal. Oils, such as cottonseed
oil or the tasteless liquid petroleum, may also be used for this
purpose. As a measure of safety with crocks, it is advisable to
cover the top with a cloth soaked in melted paraffin. Put the cover
in place before the paraffin hardens.</p>
<p>After sealing with paraffin the containers should be set where
they will not be disturbed until the contents are to be used. Any
attempt to remove them from one place to another may break the
paraffin seal and necessitate resealing.</p>
<p>Some vegetables which do not contain sufficient water are better
fermented by covering them with a weak brine. Those which are the
most satisfactory when fermented in this way are cucumbers, string
beans, green tomatoes, beets, beet tops, turnip tops, corn and
green peas. The general directions for this brining are as
follows:</p>
<p>Wash the vegetables, drain off the surplus water and pack them
in a keg, crock, or other utensil until it is nearly
full&mdash;within about three inches of the top of the vessel.
Prepare a weak brine as follows: To each gallon of water used add
one-half pint of vinegar and three-fourths of a cup of salt and
stir until the salt is entirely dissolved. The vinegar is used
primarily to keep down the growth of injurious bacteria until the
lactic-acid ferment starts, but it also adds to the flavor. Spices
may be added if desired.</p>
<p>The amount of brine necessary to cover the vegetables will be
equal to about one-half the volume of the material to be fermented.
For example, if a five-gallon keg is to be packed, two and one-half
gallons will be needed. It is best to make up at one time all the
brine needed on one day. A clean tub or barrel can be used for
mixing the brine. Pour the brine over the vegetables and cover. Set
the vessel and its contents away in a moderately warm room to
ferment.</p>
<p>When fermentation ceases, the container should be placed in a
cool cellar or storeroom and the surface of the liquid treated to
prevent mold. Before adding the paraffin or cottonseed oil, any
scum or mold which may have formed on the surface of the liquid
should be removed by skimming.</p>
<p>These general directions can always be followed with successful
results, but some modifications are desirable for certain
vegetables.</p>
<p><b>Cucumbers&mdash;Dill Style.</b> To pickle cucumbers wash the
cucumbers and pack into a clean, water-tight barrel, keg or crock.
On the bottom of the barrel place a layer of dill weed and a
handful of mixed spice. Add another layer of dill and another
handful of spice when the barrel is half full, and when almost
full, add a third layer. If a keg or crock is used, the amount of
dill and spice can be reduced in proportion to the size of the
receptacle. When the container has been filled to within a few
inches of the top, add a layer of covering material&mdash;beet
leaves or grape leaves&mdash;about an inch thick. If any spoilage
should occur on the surface, this layer will protect the vegetables
beneath. Press down with a clean board weighted with bricks or
stone.</p>
<p>Make the brine as given in the general rules. Add sufficient
brine to cover the material and allow it to stand twenty-four
hours. Then make air-tight. The time necessary for complete
fermentation to occur depends upon the temperature. In a warm place
five days to a week may suffice; in a cool cellar three to four
weeks.</p>
<p>The dill and spices may be omitted, in which case we then have
plain cucumbers.</p>
<p><b>String Beans.</b> Remove the ends and strings from the beans
and cut into pieces about two inches long; pack in the container;
cover with brine and ferment.</p>
<p><b>Green Tomatoes.</b> Green tomatoes should be packed whole and
prepared as cucumbers. The dill and spice may be added if
desired.</p>
<p><b>Beets.</b> Beets must be scrubbed thoroughly and packed
whole. If peeled or sliced before being fermented the beets lose
considerable color and flavor.</p>
<p><b>Beet Tops and Turnip Tops.</b> These should be washed
thoroughly and packed into the container without being cut up.</p>
<p><b>Peas.</b> Green peas should be shelled and packed in the same
way as string beans. It is advisable to use fairly small containers
for peas, so that the quantity opened up will be used before it has
a chance to spoil.</p>
<p><b>Corn.</b> Husk and clean the silk from the corn; wash and
place the ears on end in the jar, packing the jar nearly full. Pour
the brine over the ears; add cover and weights. Fermented corn has
a sour taste, which may not be relished if the corn is eaten alone.
For this reason it will be preferable in most cases to preserve
corn by canning, drying or by salting without fermentation.
Fermented corn, however, may be used in the preparation of some
dishes, such as chowders, omelets, and so forth, where its flavor
will be masked to some extent by the other ingredients. To some
people this peculiar acid taste of fermented corn is not at all
objectionable.</p>
<p><b>Salting Without Fermentation.</b> In this method the
vegetables are packed with enough salt to prevent fermentation or
the growth of yeasts or molds. The vegetables preserved most
satisfactorily by this method are dandelions, beet tops, turnip
tops, spinach, kale, chard, cabbage, cauliflower, string beans,
green peas and corn. The following directions should be
followed:</p>
<p>The vegetables should be washed, drained and weighed. The amount
of salt needed will be a quarter of the weight of the vegetables.
Kegs or crocks make satisfactory containers. Put a layer of
vegetables about an inch thick on the bottom of the container.
Cover this with salt. Continue making alternate layers of
vegetables and salt until the container is almost filled. The salt
should be evenly distributed so that it will not be necessary to
use more salt than the quantity required in proportion to the
weights of the vegetables that are used.</p>
<p>Cover the surface with a cloth, and a board of glazed plate.
Place a weight on these and set aside in a cool place. If
sufficient liquor to cover the vegetables has not been extracted
pour in enough strong brine&mdash;one pound of salt to two quarts
of water&mdash;to cover the surface round the corner.</p>
<p>The top layer of vegetables should be kept under the brine to
prevent molding. There will be some bubbling at first. As soon as
this stops, set the container where it will not be disturbed until
ready for use. Seal by pouring very hot paraffin over the
surface.</p>
<p>String beans should be cut in two-inch pieces. Peas should be
shelled. Cabbage should be shredded in the same way as for
sauerkraut. Corn, however, requires somewhat different treatment,
and the directions for salting it are as follows:</p>
<p><b>Salted Corn.</b> Husk the ears of corn and remove the silk.
Cook in boiling water for about ten minutes to set the milk. Cut
off the corn from the cob with a sharp knife. Weigh the corn and
pack in layers with a quarter its weight of fine salt, as described
above.</p>
<p>Some experts insist on blanching and cold-dipping all vegetables
for dry-salting without fermentation. They say that, though it is
not necessary, it makes the tissues softer and consequently they
are more easily penetrated by the salt. Furthermore, when preparing
these products for the table the salt soaks out more readily and
the products cook much more quickly if they have been blanched. So
where there is time it seems advisable to blanch for five minutes
for dry-salting.</p>
<p>If properly prepared and stored, fermented, brined and
dry-salted products will keep for a long time. It is absolutely
necessary to prevent mold from growing on the surface of the brine
of fermented vegetables, by the addition of paraffin or in some
other way. Protection of the surface of dry-salted vegetables is
desirable, but not necessary if the containers are covered to
prevent the evaporation of the brine. Most trouble with the
fermented or salted products may be traced to carelessness in
protecting the surface of the brine.</p>
<br>
<p><b>POINTS TO REMEMBER</b></p>
<p>These are the special things to remember about fermentation,
brining and dry-salting:</p>
<p>1. For fermentation, such as in making sauerkraut, use a quarter
pound of salt to ten pounds of food material. For every 100 pounds
of food add two and a half pounds of salt.</p>
<p>2. For brining use three-quarters of a cupful of salt and one
cupful of vinegar to each gallon of water.</p>
<p>3. For dry-salting use one pound of salt to four pounds of
food.</p>
<p>4. Do not use vinegar, pickle or pork barrels as containers for
salted foods unless they are very thoroughly scalded.</p>
<p>5. Thoroughly scald all containers, covers, weights and cloths
before using.</p>
<p>6. If using glass jars put a cork inside to press the food down.
If white vaseline is rubbed on the rubber rings the solution will
not get through rubber and be lost.</p>
<p>7. After adding salt or brine for fermented foods, cover the
food material with a piece of muslin or cheesecloth six inches
larger in diameter than the diameter of the container. Tuck this in
round the top of the food, cover with weight and adjust lid of
container.</p>
<p>8. During fermentation keep the cover on loosely until all
bubbles cease. Test by slightly knocking container to see if any
bubbles appear on the surface.</p>
<p>9. When you have made this test and discovered that the bubbling
has ceased, then it is time to protect the food from all organisms
which destroy lactic acid.</p>
<p>10. To protect the food cover with hot melted paraffin or liquid
oil.</p>
<p>11. If evaporation takes place, add water or brine to make up
the original amount of water.</p>
<p>12. When dry sealing is used let the product stand twenty-four
to thirty-six hours, then add strong brine to fill the containers.
The water from the vegetables usually only half fills the
containers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>CURING, SMOKING AND PRESERVING MEAT</h3>
<br>
<p>Many farmers seem to have more trouble with the curing of meats
than with the slaughtering. This part of the work is indeed very
important as it determines whether one will have good tasting cured
meat or meat that is too salty or possibly that is far removed from
the original taste of the raw product.</p>
<p>It is worth every farmer or farmerette's attention to spend some
time on this problem as it pays so well in the resulting, good
tasting meat. Why not have a superior grade of home-cured meat as
easily as a poor grade? Work carefully and accurately done will
produce good results while work slovenly or carelessly done can
produce nothing but poor results. To cure meat so that it is not
only delicious but has good keeping qualities is an art and
accomplishment worth striving for. A pride in this work is just as
fine and worth while as the housewife's pride in her culinary skill
or the pride of any other professional in his or her line of work.
To-day we are thinking of food and its problems as never before and
it behooves us all to put more time, thought, care and skill on all
things that pertain to foods. And as meat is such an essential item
in our diet, meat problems should receive their due attention.</p>
<p>All meat that is to be cured should always be thoroughly cooled
and cut into the desired convenient sizes before it is put into the
brine or packed in dry salt.</p>
<p>The pieces most commonly used for curing are the ham, shoulder
and bacon pieces from pork. From beef we use the cheaper, tougher
cuts such as the plate, shoulder and chuck ribs. Mutton is seldom
cured and preserved.</p>
<p>The ham should be cut off at the hock joint, the spare ribs
taken out of the bacon, and the ragged edges trimmed off smooth. If
ragged edges or scraggy ends are left these portions will become
too dry in the curing and will practically be wasted.</p>
<p>After all the animal heat is removed from the meat and it is
properly cut it is then ready for the curing. If salt is put on the
meat before the animal heat is all removed, it will have a tendency
to shrink the muscles and form a coating on the outside which will
not allow the generating gases to escape. Meat should never be in a
frozen condition when the salt is added as the frost will prevent
the proper penetration of the brine and uneven curing will be the
result.</p>
<br>
<p><b>METHODS OF CURING MEAT</b></p>
<p>The two most common methods of curing meat are first the brine
or sugar cure process and second the dry-curing process. For
general farm use the brine cured process is the better. It requires
less time, less effort and not such an exacting place for the work.
On most farms it is impossible to secure a desirable place in which
to do the dry-curing as the meat is exposed to rats, cats, flies
and other insects. The dry-curing requires considerable time to rub
and salt the meat at different times while the only attention that
is necessary for brine-curing is to properly prepare and pack the
meat in the vessel and prepare the brine for it.</p>
<br>
<p><b>UTENSILS FOR CURING</b></p>
<p>If possible use a round container for the curing. It is easier
to put the meat in tightly, and the space can be used to better
advantage. A hardwood barrel of some kind is excellent. Sirup,
molasses or lard barrels which have been thoroughly cleaned are
very satisfactory. If you use a vinegar or an oil barrel it should
be well burned on the inside before using. Stone crocks or jars are
sometimes used but they are expensive and cumbersome to handle
besides the constant danger of loss of brine from breakage.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PRESERVATIVES</b></p>
<p>For curing the meat the farmer usually uses salt, salt peter,
white or brown sugar or molasses. These are the necessary
preservatives. The others such as boracic acid, borax and soda are
often used for sweetening the brine and to keep it from spoiling
but are not absolutely essential. The salt extracts moisture and
acts as a preservative. The sugar or molasses imparts a nice flavor
and has a tendency to keep the muscle tissue soft in contrast to
the salt, which has a tendency to make it hard and dry. So the salt
and sugar have two distinct functions to perform, the one to harden
and preserve, the other to soften and sweeten. If you have a
favorite recipe that has proved satisfactory and you want to use
sorghum or molasses instead of sugar add one pound more of the
molasses. If you have been accustomed to using 2 pounds of sugar
then use 3 pounds of the other sweetening.</p>
<p>Salt peter is not absolutely necessary as far as the preserving
is concerned but it helps to hold the red color of the lean meat.
If salt peter is not used the lean meat will be gray in color. It
may possibly be a little tenderer if the salt peter is not used as
the salt peter tends to harden the meat. Chili salt peter can be
substituted in place of salt peter, if only four-fifths as much is
used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE SUGAR BRINE CURE</b></p>
<p>All formulas for the sugar brine cure are practically the same
varying only a little in the proportions of sugar, salt and salt
peter. If you have a formula that you have tried for years and have
found it to be satisfactory there is no reason you should attempt a
new one. But for those who want to try a different formula or
recipe I will give you this reliable one that is widely used and
indorsed by several agricultural colleges.</p>
<p>The container should be scalded thoroughly. Sprinkle a layer of
salt over the bottom and over each layer of meat as it is packed
in, skin down. When full, cover meat with boards and weight down
with a stone so that all will be below the brine, which is made as
follows:</p>
<p>Weigh out for each 100 pounds of meat, 8 pounds of salt, 2
pounds of sugar (preferably brown) or 3 pounds of molasses, and 2
ounces of salt peter. Dissolve all in 4 gallons of water. This
should be boiled, and when thoroughly cooled, cover the meat. Seven
days after brine is put on, meat should be repacked in another
barrel in reverse order. The pieces that were on top should be
placed on the bottom. The brine is poured over as before. This is
repeated on the fourteenth and twenty-first days, thus giving an
even cure to all pieces. Bacon should remain in the brine from four
to six weeks, and hams six to eight weeks, depending on the size of
the pieces. When cured, each piece should be scrubbed with tepid
water and hung to drain several days before smoking; no two pieces
should come in contact. For all curing always use dairy salt and
<i>not table</i> salt, as the latter contains starch to keep it dry
and this starch may cause the meat to spoil. If you carefully
follow these directions you will have delicious sugar-cured hams
and bacon.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CORNED BEEF</b></p>
<p>It is desirable to have an ample supply of corned beef on hand.
For this any part of the beef may be used but the parts usually
selected are the plate, rump, cross-ribs and brisket, which are the
tougher cuts of the meat. The brisket and plate are especially good
because of the character of the fat, which is somewhat like a
tissue. Cut all around the meat to about the same thickness, so
that it will make an even layer in the barrel. It is best to remove
the bone, although this is not necessary. Be sure to start the
pickling or curing while the meat is perfectly fresh, but well
chilled. Do not wait like some farmers do until they think the meat
is beginning to spoil and then salt it down just to save it. Allow
ten pounds of dairy salt to each 100 pounds of meat. Sprinkle a
layer of the salt in the bottom of the crock, barrel, or whatever
container is used. Have the salt about one-fourth of an inch in
depth. After the layer is in the bottom of the container put the
cuts of meat in as closely as possible, making the layer five or
six inches in thickness, then put on another layer of salt,
following that with another layer of meat. Repeat until the meat
and salt have all been packed in the barrel, care being taken to
reserve salt enough for a good layer on the top. Cover the meat
with a board and weight down with a stone and <i>not</i> an
<i>iron</i> weight. Do not allow any meat to project from the salt
or mold will start and the brine will spoil in a short time. Let
the meat stand over-night.</p>
<p>Prepare a brine by boiling 7 pounds salt, 3 pounds brown sugar
or 6 pounds molasses, 2 ounces baking soda, 2 ounces salt peter and
4 gallons water for every 100 pounds of meat. This quantity of
brine should be sufficient to cover that amount.</p>
<p>Remove any scum that rises to the surface and filter the hot
brine through muslin. Set the brine aside, best over-night, to
become perfectly cold before using. In the morning tip the
container in which the meat is packed so that all liquor which has
separated from the meat over night may drain off. Cover the meat
with the cold brine. Put the container in a cool place. The curing
will be more satisfactory if the meat is left at a temperature of
about 38 degrees F. Never let the temperature go above 50 degrees
F. and there is some risk with even a temperature of 40 degrees F.
if it is continuous. The sugar or molasses in the brine has a
tendency to ferment in a warm place.</p>
<p>After about five days the meat should be overhauled and
repacked, putting the pieces which were previously on the bottom on
top. Pour back the same brine, and five days later repeat the
overhauling. This may seem like some trouble and possibly look like
a useless waste of time but it is well worth while as it insures a
more rapid and uniform curing of the meat.</p>
<p>When unpacking the meat watch the brine to see that it is not
ropy or moldy. If you find either condition existing remove the
meat and rinse each piece with cold water and after scalding the
container pack the meat as at first with a little salt. Scald and
skim the brine and after it is cold pour it on the meat as before.
You can use corned beef if necessary after a week in the cure, but
it is not thoroughly cured until it has been from 20 to 30 days in
the brine. If kept for sixty days it will be salty enough to need
freshening before cooking.</p>
<p>If the meat has been corned during the winter, and is to be kept
until summer, watch the brine closely during the spring as it is
more likely to spoil then than at any other time.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLAIN SALT PORK</b></p>
<p>Rub each piece of meat with dairy salt, and pack closely in a
container. Let stand over-night. The next day weigh out ten pounds
of salt and two ounces of salt peter for each 100 pounds of meat,
and dissolve in four gallons of boiling water. Pour this brine,
when cold, over the meat, cover, and weight the meat down to keep
it under the brine. The pork should be kept in the brine until
used.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SMOKING CURED MEATS</b></p>
<p>Of course many farmers never attempt to smoke their cured meats
but use them directly from the brine but if possible it is more
satisfactory to smoke them before using for several reasons. First,
the process of smoking helps to preserve the meat. The creosote
formed by the combustion of the wood closes the pores of the meat
to a great extent thus excluding the air and helping it to keep and
at the same time makes the meat objectionable to insects. In the
second place, pickled or cured meats taste better and are more
palatable if smoked. Of course the smoking must be properly done
and the right kind of fuel must be used.</p>
<p><b>The Smokehouse and the Smoke.</b> It is not necessary to have
a regular smokehouse&mdash;although it is a delightful addition to
any farm. Here again a community meat ring is of great advantage.
One smokehouse will answer for many families. This is the ideal
arrangement and it can easily be managed if you are progressive and
anxious enough to supply your family with delicious meat the year
around saving time and money.</p>
<p>If, however, you have to do your own smoking and smoke only a
small quantity at a time a barrel or box will answer. Overheating
of the meat must be guarded against.</p>
<p>Green hickory or any of the hardwoods or maple should be used
for the smoking. Pine or any other resinous woods should not be
used as they give a disagreeable flavor to the meat. If it is
impossible to get hardwood use corncobs rather than soft wood. The
corncobs will leave a dirty deposit on the meat, which is carbon.
It is not objectionable only from the standpoint of "looks." The
meat which you are going to smoke should be removed from the brine
the day before the smoking. A half hour soaking in cold water
prevents a crust of salt from forming on the outside. Do not hang
the meat so that any two pieces touch as this would prevent uniform
smoking.</p>
<p>Always start with a slow fire so as to warm the meat up
gradually. Thirty-six to forty-eight hours of heat as near 120
degrees F. as possible will be sufficient under most
circumstances.</p>
<p><b>How to Store Smoked Meats.</b> A dry, cool cellar or attic
where there is good circulation is a good place for storage. If the
meat is to be used soon the meat can hang without coverings but for
long keeping you will have to wrap it when cold in waxed paper and
then in burlap, muslin or canvas bags and then hang it, after it is
tied very tightly to prevent insects from getting in, in a room
with a cool uniform temperature.</p>
<p>Some farmers get satisfactory results by wrapping the meats in
strong bags and then burying them in oat bins.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SAUSAGE</b></p>
<p>Frequently when animals are butchered on the farm there are
often wholesome portions of the carcass that are not used. All
trimmings, cheeks, liver, tongue, breast and other pieces can be
made into bologna, headcheese or some other form of sausage.
Sausage making is an art worth acquiring. There is always a good
demand for fresh and smoked country sausage, so if you wish to sell
some you will have no trouble in finding a market for your product
if it is a good one.</p>
<p>To make sausage you should have a meat grinder, which is an
absolute essential on every farm. If you do not have one already
then buy a No. 22 or No. 32.</p>
<p>In addition to the grinder you will need a stuffer attachment
which costs very little. A knife, cord, string, a clean tube and
casings or muslin bags will complete your equipment. The muslin
bags can be of any size but the easiest to handle are 12 inches
long and 2 inches in diameter. If the sausage is stuffed into these
bags they must be paraffined for home use. If you do not want to
bother with casings or bags put the sausage in stone crocks or tin
pans with a layer of lard or paraffin on top.</p>
<p>The best sausage is made by using 3 parts of lean meat to one of
fat. When using the grinder, distribute the lean and fat meat as
uniformly as possible.</p>
<p>You are not necessarily limited to pork sausage, for there are
many other delicious varieties you can make. They vary in the
different kinds of meat used and in the different seasonings and
spices.</p>
<p>Breakfast sausage has bread added to it; frankfurters are smoked
pork sausage in casings; liver sausage has pork and beef or veal
and bread in it; and blood sausage, as its name suggests, has blood
(preferably from a hog) added to it. Then there is tomato sausage
which is made of pulp from fresh tomatoes, pork sausage and
crackers. Summer sausage is made in the winter and kept for use
during the summer. After being dried and cured it will keep for
months. Brain sausage is delicious. To make it calves' brains are
mixed with lean pork. Cambridge sausage has rice added to it.</p>
<p>Headcheese is usually made from the hog's head but odds and ends
also can be used not only from pork but from beef and veal.</p>
<p>Scrapple usually means the head and feet of hogs but it can be
made from any hog meat. It is a good food as it uses cornmeal. It
makes a change from fried mush and most men working on a farm
relish it.</p>
<p>Sausage can be made from mutton mixed with pork in much the same
way as beef is used for similar purposes. A general formula would
be 2 parts of mutton to 3 parts pork with seasonings.</p>
<p>With a plentiful supply of good home-cured and home-smoked
meats, together with several varieties of sausages, you can feel
you are well equipped to feed your family with its share of meat.
Everything will have been utilized, nothing will have been wasted.
You produced your own meat, you slaughtered and cured and smoked it
and put all trimmings and other "left-overs" into appetizing food
for your family and you have saved money. You have utilized things
at hand and required no transportation facilities. And best of all,
you have the very finest in the land for your family and that gives
one a perfectly justifiable pride in the work accomplished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>PRESERVED OR "CANNED" EGGS</h3>
<br>
<p>As one-half of the yearly egg crop is produced in March, April,
May and June consumers would do well to store enough at that time
to use when production is light. Fifty dozen eggs should be stored
for a family of five to use during the months of October, November,
December and January, at which time the market price of eggs is at
the highest.</p>
<p>When canning them <i>the eggs must be fresh</i>, preferably not
more than two or three days old. This is the reason why it is much
more satisfactory to put away eggs produced in one's own chicken
yard or one's neighbor's.</p>
<p>Infertile eggs are best if they can be obtained&mdash;so, after
the hatching exclude the roosters from the flock and kill them for
table use as needed.</p>
<p><i>The shells must be clean.</i> Washing an egg with a soiled
shell lessens its keeping quality. The protective gelatinous
covering over the shell is removed by water and when this is gone
the egg spoils more rapidly. Use the soiled eggs for immediate use
and the clean ones for storage.</p>
<p><i>The shells also must be free from even the tiniest crack.</i>
One cracked egg will spoil a large number of sound eggs when packed
in water glass.</p>
<p>Earthenware crocks are good containers. <i>The crocks must be
clean and sound.</i> Scald them and let them cool completely before
use. A crock holding six gallons will accommodate eighteen dozen
eggs and about twenty-two pints of solution. Too large crocks are
not desirable, since they increase the liability of breaking some
of the eggs, and spoiling the entire batch.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the eggs on the bottom crack first
and that those in the bottom of the crock are the last to be
removed for use. Eggs can be put up in smaller crocks and the eggs
put in the crock first should be used first in the household.</p>
<br>
<p><b>METHOD OF STORING</b></p>
<p>There are many satisfactory methods of storing eggs. The
commercial method is that of cold storage and if it were not for
this method winter eggs would be beyond the average purse.</p>
<p>The fact that eggs have been held in cold storage does not
necessarily mean that they are of low quality. Carefully handled
cold-storage eggs often are of better quality than fresh local eggs
that have been improperly cared for.</p>
<p>In the home they may be packed by several methods: Salt, oats or
bran; covering them with vaseline, butter, lard, paraffin or
prepared ointments; immersion in brine, salicylic acid, water glass
(sodium silicate) or limewater.</p>
<p>Any of these methods will keep the eggs for short periods if
stored in a cool place. The salt, oats and bran are very
satisfactory. The ointments also are satisfactory. The water glass
and limewater will keep eggs without loss for a year. However, it
is not wise to put down more eggs than is necessary to tide over
the period of high price.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WATER GLASS METHOD</b></p>
<p>"Water glass" is known to the chemist as sodium silicate. It can
be purchased by the quart from druggists or poultry supply men. It
is a pale yellow, odorless, sirupy liquid. It is diluted in the
proportion of one part of silicate to nine parts of distilled
water, rain water, or other water. <i>In any case, the water should
be boiled and then allowed to cool.</i> Half fill the vessel with
this solution and place the eggs in it, being careful not to crack
them. The eggs can be added a few at a time until the container is
filled. Be sure to keep about two inches of water glass above the
eggs. Cover the crock to prevent evaporation and place it in the
coolest place available from which the crock will not have to be
moved. Wax paper covered over and tied around the top of the crock
can be used. Inspect the crock from time to time and replace any
water that has evaporated with cool boiled water.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LIMEWATER METHOD</b></p>
<p>Limewater is also satisfactory for preserving eggs and is
slightly less expensive than water glass. A solution is made by
placing two or three pounds of unslaked lime in five gallons of
water, which has been boiled and allowed to cool, and allowing the
mixture to stand until the lime settles and the liquid is clear.
The eggs should be placed in a clean earthenware jar or other
suitable vessel and covered to a depth of two inches with the
liquid. Remove the eggs as desired, rinse in clean, cold water and
use immediately.</p>
<p>If using the limewater method add a little of the lime sediment
to insure a constantly saturated solution. If a thin white crust
appears on the limewater solution it is due to the formation of
calcium carbonate coming in contact with the air and consequently
does no harm.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CANDLING EGGS AT HOME</b></p>
<p>If you purchase the eggs that are to be stored it is safer to
candle them. Examining eggs to determine their quality is called
"candling." Every one knows that some eggs are better than others,
but the ease with which the good ones can be picked out is not
generally understood. The better the quality of eggs, the surer the
housewife can be that they will keep satisfactorily.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOMEMADE CANDLER</b></p>
<p>The equipment for candling usually consists of either a wooden,
a metal, or a cardboard box and a kerosene lamp or an electric
light. A very inexpensive egg candler for home use can be made from
a large shoe-box or similar cardboard box. Remove the ends of the
box, and cut a hole about the size of a half-dollar in one side.
Slip the box over the lamp or electric bulb, darken the room, hold
the egg, with the large end up, before the opening in the box and
its quality can easily be judged.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SIGNS OF A GOOD EGG</b></p>
<p>When held before the opening of the candle, good eggs will look
clear and firm. The air cell (the white spot at the large end of
the eggs) should be small, not larger than a dime, and the yolk may
be dimly seen in the center of the egg. A large air cell and a
dark, freely moving yolk indicate that the egg is stale.</p>
<p>If the shell contents appear black or very dark, the egg is
absolutely unfit for food. If you are in doubt about the quality of
any eggs you are candling break a few of them into a dish and
examine them. This is an excellent way to learn to know how good
and bad eggs look when they are being candled.</p>
<p>Discard all eggs that have shrunken, loose contents, a watery
appearance, cracked and thin shells. Eggs of this description will
not keep and are apt to spoil the eggs close around them. Any egg
that floats in the solution should be discarded.</p>
<p>When packing eggs whether in salt, oats, or in solution place
them with small end down. When packing them in salt, oats, etc., do
not allow any two eggs to touch.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PACKING THE EGGS</b></p>
<p>One gallon of water glass as purchased will make enough
preservative to preserve from 75 to 100 dozen eggs.</p>
<p>Three gallons of either water glass solution or limewater
solution will preserve from 200 to 240 dozen eggs according to the
size of the eggs and the shape of the container.</p>
<p>The cost of preserving eggs by the water glass method is about
one cent per dozen eggs, not considering the cost of the container.
The lime water method is still cheaper.</p>
<p>The following gives the sizes of jars with approximate capacity
for eggs and the amount of water glass solution required to cover
the eggs:</p>
<p>1 gallon jar&mdash;40 eggs, 3&frac12; pints of solution or
1&frac34; qt.</p>
<p>2 gallon jar&mdash;80 eggs, 8 pints of solution or 2 quarts.</p>
<p>3 gallon jar&mdash;120 eggs, 11 pints of solution or 5&frac12;
quarts.</p>
<p>4 gallon jar&mdash;160 eggs, 14&frac12; pints of solution or
7&frac14; quarts.</p>
<p>5 gallon jar&mdash;200 eggs, 18 pints of solution or 9
quarts.</p>
<p>6 gallon jar&mdash;216 eggs, 22 pints of solution or 11
quarts.</p>
<p>10 gallon jar&mdash;400 eggs, 36 pints of solution or 18
quarts.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HOW TO USE PRESERVED EGGS</b></p>
<p>When the eggs are to be used, remove them as desired, rinse in
clean, cold water, and use immediately.</p>
<p>Eggs preserved in water glass can be used for soft boiling or
poaching up to November. Before boiling such eggs prick a tiny hole
in the large end of the shell with a needle to keep them from
cracking, as the preservative seals the pores of the shell and
prevents the escape of gases, which is possible in the strictly
fresh egg.</p>
<p>They are satisfactory for frying until about December. From that
time until the end of the usual storage period&mdash;that is until
March&mdash;they can be used for omelettes, scrambled eggs,
custards, cakes and general cookery. As the eggs age, the white
becomes thinner and is harder to beat. The yolk membrane becomes
more delicate and it is correspondingly difficult to separate the
whites from the yolks. Sometimes the white of the egg is tinged
pink after very long keeping in water glass. This is due, probably,
to a little iron which is in the sodium silicate, but which
apparently does not injure the eggs for food purposes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HOME STORAGE OF VEGETABLES</h3>
<br>
<p>Towards the end of the canning season most housewives have used
every available glass jar and tin can and hesitate about purchasing
a new supply. They have dried and brined many products and yet they
feel, and rightly so, that they would like still more vegetables
for winter use. There still remains another method that they may
employ to provide themselves with a plentiful supply of vegetables
and these vegetables can be in the fresh state too. Neither canned,
dried, pickled or salted but fresh.</p>
<p>Canning, drying, pickling and salting are essential and
necessary but they can not take the place of storage. To keep
vegetables in their natural state is the easiest and simplest form
of food preservation. Of course, you must take proper precautions
against freezing and decay. If you do this you can have an abundant
supply of many kinds of fresh vegetables all winter, where climatic
and living conditions will permit. Storage costs but little money
and little effort and yet it is very satisfactory.</p>
<p>There are many vegetables that can be stored to good advantage.
They are: Beets, Brussels Sprouts, Beans, Celery, Carrots, Chicory
or Endive, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Kohl-rabi, Lima Beans, Onions,
Sweet Potatoes, Squash (Winter), Salsify or Vegetable Oyster,
Tomatoes, Turnips.</p>
<p>To get good results in any kind of storage, you must observe
four things:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Proper ventilation.</li>
<li>2. Proper regulation of temperature.</li>
<li>3. Sufficient moisture.</li>
<li>4. Good condition of vegetables when stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are six different ways to store vegetables. They are:
cellar storage, pit storage, outdoor cellar or cave storage, attic
storage, sand boxes and pantry storage.</p>
<br>
<p><b>CELLAR STORAGE</b></p>
<p>We will first of all consider cellar or basement storage. One of
the most convenient places for the storage of vegetables is a cool,
well-ventilated and reasonably dry cellar underneath the house.
This cellar must have windows or some method of ventilation, must
not be too warm and not so cold that food will freeze. If there is
proper ventilation there can be some dampness without injury to the
vegetables. If your cellar or basement floods easily or has water
standing in it anywhere it should not be used for vegetable
storage.</p>
<p>If there is a furnace in the cellar or basement a small room as
far as possible from the heating plant should be partitioned off.
Do not build a room in the middle of the cellar, for two sides of
the room should consist of outside walls.</p>
<p>If possible have two outside windows for proper regulation of
the temperature and for good ventilation. If you cannot have two
windows have one.</p>
<p>A very good arrangement for constant circulation of air consists
in having a stove-pipe inserted through one of the lower panes of
the window to admit cold air. One of the upper panes of the window
can be removed to allow for the escape of warm air. That is, of
course, if the window is made of nine or twelve small panes of
squares of glass. In severely cold weather this upper pane can be
replaced or the opening stuffed up in some way.</p>
<p>If you do not have an old stove-pipe you can make a wooden flue
of old boards or old discarded boxes.</p>
<p>Most cellars and basements are now made with concrete floors.
The ideal floor for storage purposes is an earth floor. However, we
can put two or three inches of sand on our concrete floors and get
good results. Sprinkle the sand with water from time to time.</p>
<p>Put the vegetables that are to be stored in boxes, baskets,
barrels or crates. Use containers that hold only two or three
bushels apiece. If larger boxes or barrels are used there is always
danger of heating and decay. Of course, proper precautions should
be taken against mice.</p>
<p>An excellent way to prevent wilting of crops and shrinkage is to
put moist leaves, oak or maple, in the containers with the
vegetables. Moist sand is sometimes used but it is much heavier to
handle than the leaves. It is no difficult matter to rake the lawn
when you are ready to store the vegetables.</p>
<p>The vegetables that are adapted for cellar storage are beets,
cabbage, carrots, celery, parsnips, potatoes, salsify and
turnips.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PIT STORAGE</b></p>
<p>There are two kinds of pits that may be used for storage. Those
that are not frost-proof and those which are frost-proof.</p>
<p>Some vegetables are not injured by being held in a frozen
condition during the winter months. Cabbage is not injured by
moderate frost. Cabbage and parsnips will stand freezing and a
little thawing, so they can be put in pits or better still, boxes
or barrels set into the ground may be used. Make the pit mound
shaped. If the earth is mounded around the box, barrel or pit,
surface water cannot run in.</p>
<p>If using this kind of storage do not store the products until
both the ground and the products are frozen solid. The idea is to
keep the vegetables frozen or to have very few freezings and
thawings, and those few should be gradual.</p>
<p>After the pit has been made or the box or barrel has been set
into the ground and filled with vegetables, it should be covered
first with a piece of burlap or carpet, then with a mouse-proof
board cover and finally with straw or similar material. When taken
from the pit, the vegetables can be thawed out over night in cold
water, after which they can be kept in the cellar for a short
length of time.</p>
<p>The pits for keeping vegetables free from frost must be
carefully and thoughtfully made, but they are cheap and are very
useful and practical when caves or cellars are not convenient.</p>
<p>The frost-proof pit for storing vegetables should always be
placed in as well-drained a place as possible. A shallow excavation
should be made from one to two feet deep, four feet wide and as
long as desired. Line the pit with straw, hay or leaves, then place
the vegetables in a conical pile on the straw. Cover the vegetables
with six inches of the material used in making the lining. This is
covered with three or four inches of earth. The straw is allowed to
extend up through the earth at the top of the pile, thus assuring
ventilation.</p>
<p>When it becomes colder add more covering to the pit by another
layer of straw and a layer of earth. In very cold climates a layer
of manure or corn stalks will afford protection against frost.</p>
<p>It is well to make several small pits rather than one larger one
for the reason that when a pit has once been opened it is difficult
to protect the remaining vegetables from frost.</p>
<p>It is advisable to store several varieties of vegetables in one
pit so that when each pit is opened you have a variety of
vegetables. If you follow this plan separate the various crops by
using straw or leaves.</p>
<p>Pits are entered by chopping a hole through the frozen earth at
one end, large enough to reach into or crawl into. After the
vegetables have been obtained keep the hole stuffed and covered
most carefully and deeply with old sacks and straw.</p>
<p>If the smaller pits are used, a decidedly better arrangement,
take out all the vegetables in the pit and those that are not
needed for immediate consumption can be placed in the cellar
storage room, or other cool place, until needed. Do not use those
pits if you live where winter rains are abundant as the pits will
become water soaked and the vegetables will suffer more or less
decay.</p>
<br>
<p><b>OUTDOOR CELLAR STORAGE</b></p>
<p>Outdoor cellars or caves may be cheaply built for more or less
temporary use or they may be very expensively built of concrete,
brick, or clay blocks. Of course, the latter are permanent storing
places and offer perfect storage for potatoes, carrots, cabbages,
parsnips, beets, turnips and salsify.</p>
<p>The objectionable features of indoor cellar storage is that such
storage does not furnish ideal conditions for keeping the
vegetables fresh for any great length of time.</p>
<p>The objectionable feature to the pit storage is the
inaccessibility to these pits during severe weather.</p>
<p>The outdoor cellar or cave overcomes both these objections. The
outdoor cellar or cave is an underground structure, preferably
built in a hillside and fully covered with earth except at one end
only where the entrance is located. If there are doors at both ends
it is almost impossible to prevent freezing in very cold weather.
The cave door should fit perfectly and there should be a hatchway
or door over the steps leading down to the cave door.</p>
<p>A very satisfactory inexpensive cellar can be made by digging an
excavation about 5 ft. deep and in this erecting a frame by setting
posts in rows near the dirt walls. Saw these posts off at uniform
height and place plates on their tops. On these plates place
rafters. Board up completely with the exception of the entrance.
Cover the whole with dirt or sod and in cold climates add a layer
of straw or fodder.</p>
<p>A ventilation must be provided in the roof at the back end. A
sewer tile with the bell end up makes a very good flue. A dirt
floor is satisfactory as it contains moisture. If there is any
seepage use a drain tile to carry it off.</p>
<p>The more pretentious permanent cellars are provided with air
spaces to furnish insulation; are provided with large ventilation
shafts through the roof and cold air intakes under the floor.
Thorough drainage is obtained by placing a line of tile around the
outside wall and also by having the air intake serve as a drain for
surplus water that might get into the cave. The floor is cement or
concrete. Such a cave is expensive but is a permanent structure and
a good addition to any farm or estate. If properly made it is
possible to maintain a temperature of 34 to 38 degrees without much
fluctuation during the winter months. This kind of storage is not
only adapted for vegetables but apples as well. It is better
adapted to the Northern, Eastern and Western States than to the
Southern States, where it is likely to be warm at the time the
vegetables are ready for storage. When making the cave, have it as
near as possible to the kitchen door. Sometimes caves are made so
that they can be entered from the house, cellar or porch.</p>
<br>
<p><b>ATTIC STORAGE</b></p>
<p>Some vegetables such as onions, squashes, sweet potatoes and
pumpkins can be stored in the attic in crates which allow free
circulation of air. They must be absolutely free from bruises and
must be well ripened and cured. To cure the vegetables expose them
to the air for a few days in the shade. Remove the tops of onions
before storing. The attic is much better for storing onions than
the basement. Squashes are susceptible to cold and moisture, so are
suitable for the attic.</p>
<p>Be very careful in handling the squashes to prevent breaking the
stems off. Watch pumpkins and squash carefully and at the first
sign of decay, use immediately or can.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SAND BOX STORAGE</b></p>
<p>Sand boxes in cellars, pits or caves are desirable for beets,
turnips, kohl-rabi, carrots, winter radishes and rutabagas. The
sand keeps them cold and prevents evaporation. Kohl-rabi should be
tender when stored.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PANTRY STORAGE</b></p>
<p>Where there is no attic or where it is inconveniently reached,
the products that are adapted to a very dry place can be stored on
the pantry shelves or in a dry cellar near the furnace. They are
onions, squashes, pumpkins and sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>The keeping qualities of all these vegetables, no matter what
storage is used, depends chiefly upon their condition when placed
in storage. All products to be stored must be mature, but not
overgrown. Root crops should be dry while the ground is in good
working condition. All vegetables should be allowed to become
surface dry before placing them in storage.</p>
<p>White or Irish potatoes, especially, should not be exposed to
bright sunlight any length of time. Only vegetables free from
disease or injury should be stored. Any that are damaged can be
used immediately, or can be canned or dried.</p>
<p>Further particulars for the storing of fresh vegetables are
given in the following tables.</p>

celery and pack it in this trench with some soil about the roots.
When the weather becomes colder, cover the trench with boards
nailed together in the form of a V shaped trough and over this
inverted trough put a layer of soil. The ends of this trough should
be left open for ventilation until freezing sets in, then close
these openings with straw, old bags or soil. If the freeze ceases
and there is a spell of warmer weather open the ends slightly for
ventilation. When the celery is first stored in the trenches the
soil about the roots of the celery should be watered and and if the

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>HOW TO MARKET HOME CANNED PRODUCE</h3>
<br>
<p>You have some delicious jellies, jams, canned fruits and
vegetables that you wish to sell and you do not know just how to go
about it. There are at your disposal several means of selling:</p>
<p>1. Through advertising.</p>
<p>2. Through personal letters to desirable shops, delicatessens,
boarding-houses, colleges, etc.</p>
<p>3. By direct salesmanship; that is, by making personal visits to
the buyers, either homes or stores.</p>
<p>4. Through jobbers to whom you pay a commission on all
sales.</p>
<p>5. Through co&ouml;perative selling.</p>
<p>Perhaps the cheapest and easiest way for you to handle your
problem is to employ the method so much used to-day and that is
wayside advertising. Wayside advertising costs practically nothing
and yet it pays.</p>
<p>Autos are everywhere these days. You cannot take a country ride
without seeing many signboards at the farm entrances advertising
chickens, fresh eggs, vegetables, honey, apples and canned goods. I
have a friend who drives 50 miles every fall for her honey. She
first found it by seeing the sign in front of the farm and now she
returns year after year because she thinks no other honey is just
like it. She would never have discovered it if that farm woman had
not been clever enough to think of advertising her goods in this
cheap way. My friend told all her other "auto" friends, so the
country woman has a splendid outlet for her product now. If you
live on a good road that is patronized at all by autoists you ought
to get your signboard up at once.</p>
<p>We often pass a farm where the sign "Fresh Home-Made Candy"
always tempts us to stop and buy. What autoist could resist that
sign? And here miles from town this clever woman is carrying on a
profitable side trade, which is netting her a nice little yearly
income. Her candy is good; we go often and so do many others. She
has turned her profession into a paying proposition. She could send
her candy away by parcel post or by some other means, but she would
not be so far ahead as she is now.</p>
<p>In addition to your wayside advertising you could advertise in
papers, magazines, etc. Many producers believe strongly in
advertising in daily and weekly papers. You can quickly find out
whether this kind of advertising pays. Give it a trial at least.
After you have spent ten or fifteen dollars in advertising you
ought to know whether it pays.</p>
<p>Use one or two of the city papers near you, taking the
publisher's advice as to the best day of the week on which to run
the advertisement, the size and the position of the "ad." The first
cost of getting your customers may seem high, but with good
products you could soon build up a list of people to whom sales can
be made year after year.</p>
<p>This form of advertising has many advantages. If your
advertising copy is clever and you have some novelty to offer, you
ought to receive many orders. If orders come, you get the full
retail price, the shipping charges are paid by the customer, and
cash comes with every order. And it means, if your customers are
pleased, that you have permanent customers. The initial cost is
great and there is a risk, but remember "it pays to advertise."</p>
<p>There are millions of city women who never can a jar of fruit or
put up a single glass of preserves or jelly who will be glad to
have you send your goods direct to them by parcel post. But you
must get in touch with these women either through wayside
advertising, magazine and paper advertising or by direct
salesmanship, although very few women have the time for personal
calls.</p>
<p>Considerable business can be done by letter writing to stores,
restaurants and boarding-houses in distant cities. It may be
impossible for you to go personally, in which case letters often
bring the desired results. Make your letters business-like and
typewrite them. Do not be discouraged if you do not get many
replies at first as there are at least fifty per cent who pay no
attention to such letters. But this form of advertising usually
pays.</p>
<p>Another method followed by many home canners is that of
marketing direct to the retail grocers, care being taken, of
course, to protect these grocers by not selling to more than one
member in a community. One of the great advantages, of this direct
salesmanship is that little selling effort is required on your part
after the first arrangements have been made. The nearby market plan
is greatly to be recommended because you can keep in touch with
your selling concern, build up a line of desirable goods and
promote its sale by advertising.</p>
<p>Of course you can get more money for your goods if you have time
and the opportunity to sell <i>direct to</i> the consumers. You
will of necessity have to sell cheaper to the grocers because they
too must make their profit. Marketing direct to the consumer has a
special appeal to many people. Where time is available and the
community accustomed to purchasing in this manner, this method
offers great possibilities. The profits are of course higher but
the results more uncertain, for it is somewhat difficult to gauge
the demands of the public, and the canner must assume the risk
ordinarily taken by the merchant.</p>
<p>It takes time and patience to develop a list of customers but if
you have time in the winter to do this you will find it will pay
you well. If you can get customers who are willing to pay good
prices for quality, scrupulous cleanliness and the homemade flavor,
you will get a larger gross return than if you sold through
merchants, but if your time is valuable it would scarcely pay you
to take individual orders and deliver goods.</p>
<p>There is still another way and that is to market your
home-canned products in large lots to jobbers, but if this plan is
to be pursued successfully there must be a reasonably large pack
and wholesale rates. This method produces more uniform profits year
by year, for after a reputation is established the home-canner
would not experience great difficulty in thus disposing of her
entire output by contract, providing the quality was high and the
price demands not excessive.</p>
<p>But the greatest and best way of all to find a profitable market
for your things is to co&ouml;perate with other canners in your own
neighborhood and find a market for quantity as well as quality.
Delicatessens, club houses, tea shops, college dormitories,
restaurants and hotels, all pay good prices for fine quality. No
big buyer will bother to purchase one or two dozen of this or that.
He wants dozens of things. One of the very best profitable ways to
sell with little trouble is through quantities. Get all the women
in your community to bring together cans of fruit and preserves,
etc., to some marketing place. Find out how many jars of currant
jelly you have, how many cans of peas and corn, how many of
cherries, etc., and then notify your buyer or prospective
buyer.</p>
<p>Co&ouml;perative selling has been undertaken and found
profitable. In some cases, especially in localities frequented by
the summer boarder or the automobile tourist, sales are made direct
to customers who come to the salesrooms of the organizations or to
their special sales; in other cases goods are sent by parcel post
and other means. The women in the community can hire or beg a room
where all the women of the community can sell their products for
individual profit. This room should be located on the direct
automobile road in order to attract tourists and automobile
parties. An annual membership fee of from 50 cents to $1 generally
is required for these organizations, and a charge of from 10 to 15
per cent of the selling price usually is made to cover the cost of
selling. In a few instances the managing board has been able to
secure an efficient person to take charge of the enterprise for a
specified percentage on the sales.</p>
<p>Wholesale grocery concerns are interested in big
things&mdash;orders can be placed with them. Soda fountains in
towns and cities are excellent customers for the freshest eggs they
can get. They are encroaching more and more on the trade of the
restaurants and lunch rooms. Many serve light luncheons and would
be interested in good butter, preserves and jams. When you get a
list of names and addresses write to several dozen places, tell
what your organization has in the way of guaranteed eggs, homemade
products and what kind of service you could offer in the way of
regular shipments. When orders come it is an easy matter to look up
at your local bank the responsibility of any customer, so there is
little risk. Or cash can be insisted upon with every order,
although large concerns prefer to pay after receipt of goods and
bill.</p>
<p>Each woman in this co&ouml;perative organization must keep her
goods up to a certain standard, for an inferior lot of goods sent
to a large firm might ruin a reputation.</p>
<p>Three things govern the sale of canned
products&mdash;appearances, quality and price. So many things enter
into consideration of prices obtainable that it is difficult to set
a standard which will be applicable to different sections. The
quality of the pack, its neatness, the method of marketing and many
other matters must be considered in deciding this all-important
point. As a general proposition, however, if the products are
uniformly high grade, prices may be obtained which are somewhat in
excess of factory-made products marketed in the same manner.</p>
<p>Like any other new industry, the selling should be developed
slowly in order to minimize the possibility of loss and to assure
stable business. One should study the situation carefully both from
the manufacturing and marketing standpoints. Plan the season's
campaign before taking up the work, and do not let the enthusiasm
of the beginner interfere with good business judgment.</p>
<p>The selling when rightly managed can be made a successful
business or it can be turned into a liability through careless,
unbusinesslike methods and insufficient or unwise planning.
Properly handled it will pay well for the investment of time and
money, and offer opportunity for the disposal of surplus
home-canned, home-grown, homemade and home-prepared products of all
kinds.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LIVING UP TO CONTRACTS</b></p>
<p>Care must be taken not to contract for more than can be
delivered. This would be bad business, and business principles must
govern in selling home products just as in other enterprises if one
is to be increasingly successful from year to year.</p>
<p>Occasionally a quantity of fruit which will not meet the rigid
requirements of the canning business can be turned into preserves,
jellies or fruit juices. Preserves and jellies should be marketed
in glass, and fruit juices in bottles, although some manufacturers
are now marketing some of these products in fiber cups. This line
of products will require some additional equipment, but there is a
steady demand for such homemade things and many women are deriving
profits through the sale of their tastily prepared jellies, just as
pickles and condiments have lined the pocketbooks of ambitious
housewives before now.</p>
<p>Home canning for the market is essentially a matter of
specializing and of giving the consumer a better product than he is
accustomed to purchase. Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the
maintenance of a high standard for home-canned goods. Care should
be taken that every jar measures up to a rigid standard, for a
single one which falls below grade will neutralize the reputation
and standing obtained by the sale of a dozen jars of perfect
product. A quality is necessary which will warrant a money-back
guarantee on every jar.</p>
<br>
<p><b>THE USE OF LABELS IN CANNING</b></p>
<p>Labels for both tin cans and glass jars should tell the truth as
to the quality, weight and kind of product within the pack. Before
adopting a trade-mark and label, consult the Bureau of Chemistry,
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., as to label
requirements for canned goods prepared for the market.</p>
<p>It pays to show samples of all your canned goods at county and
state fairs. You may win many premiums. Goods which are canned with
preservatives should be debarred from all exhibits.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PACKING GLASS FOR SHIPPING</b></p>
<p>Wrap each glass or jar separately in rumpled newspapers or
excelsior and pack in barrels or boxes. Line these containers with
papers or excelsior.</p>
<p>Strong corrugated parcel post boxes can be obtained for this
purpose. Wrap each jar with excelsior or paper before putting it in
its proper section. If sending large amounts send all boxes or all
barrels, do not mix them,&mdash;sending half barrels and half
boxes&mdash;as large concerns like uniform packages.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PACKING TIN FOR SHIPPING</b></p>
<p>Two dozen cans is the regulation shipping case. Have the
shipping boxes of uniform size. Put the two dozen cans in the box
and nail on the top. Be exceedingly careful not to drive nails into
the cans. On both ends of the box paste labels such as are on the
cans, telling what the contents of the box are.</p>
<p>Address the box carefully using marking ink or a regulation tag.
If a tag, tack with small tacks on the top of the box. Write your
own name and address on the tag <i>distinctly</i> as the sender. Be
as careful of the tacks as you were of the nails. Always get a
receipt from your express agent if shipping by express as this will
be necessary in case of non-receipt of goods.</p>
<p>Send to the concern or individual to whom you are sending the
goods a list of the things you have sent. This is called an
invoice. Keep a copy of the invoice for yourself so if any question
arises you will know what you are talking about.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SHIPPING TERMS</b></p>
<p>C.O.D. means collect on delivery. The purchaser pays the price
of the products to the transportation company before they are
delivered.</p>
<p>F.O.B. means free on board. For instance: if you send a shipment
of canned goods to Chicago at $6.00 per case f.o.b. Charles City it
means that you deliver the canned goods to the freight depot at
Charles City and the purchaser pays both the price per case and the
freight. If you deliver them f.o.b. Chicago it means you deliver
them to the freight depot at Charles City and also pay the freight
to Chicago.</p>
<p>Bill of Lading with Sight Draft Attached is a call for the money
before the purchaser can take the products from the freight
office.</p>
<p>Drop Shipment. If a wholesale firm requests that you ship direct
to another firm buying from him, thus avoiding two shipments, this
is called a drop shipment.</p>
<p>Lot Shipment. If you ship two or more barrels or cases as a "lot
shipment" to the same destination they may be sent at a cheaper
rate than if each were shipped separately.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
