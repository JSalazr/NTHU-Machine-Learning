<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>  <b>With James Whitcomb Riley</b>,</p>
<p>  some years ago. This Man From Down On The Farm,</p>
<p>  made a Reading Tour, of&mdash;in Population&mdash;more than</p>
<p>  one-half of this Imperial Republic, including</p>
<p>  the Cream of the Canadian Provinces.</p>
<p>  Of that Tour, at some other time, in some more</p>
<p>  leisurely hour, he desires, if able, to make</p>
<p>  a full and faithful Record.</p>
<p>  This, is but a humble Spray of Kentucky Pine,</p>
<p>  placed at the feet of the Dead Poet!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="font-size:200%;">A</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">ccording</span> to a long established Custom,</p>
<p>  the Man, in some way, in private print&mdash;</p>
<p>  &mdash;for the Relative, for the Friend, for the Stranger too&mdash;</p>
<p>  quietly Celebrates the various Red-Letter Days, of the</p>
<p>  Dear Lady Here, On the Banks of Wolf Run&mdash;his Mother!</p>
<p>  Her full Restoration, to her usual Good Health,</p>
<p>  is a Source of much Joy, and the cause of much Gratitude.</p>
<p>  The many Prayers made for her Recovery must have been of</p>
<p>  much avail before the Great White Throne, of Infinite Mercy!</p>
<p>  He is also deeply grateful, that the nearness of her</p>
<p>  Eighty-Fifth Birthday, makes it possible for him,</p>
<p>  to make an Inscription Two-fold, for the Dead,</p>
<p>  for the Living&mdash;for the Dear Poet, for the Beloved Mother!</p>
<p>  The linking of their names together, under this Spray of</p>
<p>  Kentucky Pine&mdash;culled by a hand most loving&mdash;is like</p>
<p>  unto finding the other half of a broken Chord, in some</p>
<p>  Prelude Elusive: for James Whitcomb Riley, deeply</p>
<p>  endeared himself, to the Dear Lady Here, while he and</p>
<p>  her son were a long while away, on their Reading Tour.</p>
<p>  Out of sheer Kindliness, out of Goodness of Heart, he often</p>
<p>  wrote to her, delightful Letters of Good Cheer, filled with</p>
<p>  a charming detail, with more than a trifle of over-Praise;</p>
<p>  all of which, is most acceptable, to the heart of a too fond mother.</p>
<p>  Recently, from his Winter Home in the South-land, he sent to</p>
<p>  her, in response to one of these Farm Bubbles, a little</p>
<p>  Bit of unpublished Verse, written before his hand had</p>
<p>  failed him, reproduced for her&mdash;and others&mdash;in <i>fac-simile</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span style="font-size:200%;">P</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">ray</span> deem it not, all too presumptuous, this humble</p>
<p>  Spray of Kentucky Pine!</p>
<p>  It serves as a Reverent Tribute to the One!</p>
<p>  As a Loving Commemoration to the Other!</p>

<p style="font-size: 125%;">   <b>O! James Whitcomb Riley!</b> </p>
<p>   This Man From Down On The Farm&mdash;one-while </p>
<p>   your constant Companion, in work most </p>
<p>   Congenial, all-while your Faithful Friend&mdash;rejoices. </p>
<p>   and is exceeding Glad, That All Is Well With You! </p>
<p>   For no one knew, better than you, </p>
<p>   the Wisdom, the Beauty, of Death! </p>
<p>   No one the more fully realized </p>
<p>   the Folly, the Futility, of human Grief! </p>
<p>   You firmly believed, that he, who follows The Christ; </p>
<p>   that he, who, in all Humility, bears the Cross; that </p>
<p>   he, who, in all Gratitude, wears upon his unworthy brow, </p>
<p>   the imprint of the Kiss Divine!&mdash;the Kiss of Forgiveness </p>
<p>   Complete&mdash;you firmly believed, that he ought to be </p>
<p>   brave enough, strong enough, to meet the Call, </p>
<p>   whensoever, wheresoever, it may chance to come. </p>
<p>   You firmly believed that the Call always </p>
<p>   comes at the Right Moment: that Incompletion </p>
<p>   Here, finds its Completement There: that every </p>
<p>   human Life holds&mdash;like the Palace of Aladdin&mdash;its </p>
<p>   unfinished Window: that the finite mind, </p>
<p>   hampered by its mortality, is a clog to any </p>
<p>   Completion, to any Earthly Perfection. </p>
<p>   Therefore, feeling, believing, as you did Here, </p>
<p>   now knowing, as you must <i>know</i> There, </p>
<p>   this Man rejoices, and is exceeding Glad, </p>
<p>   That All Is Well With You! </p>

<div class="stanza">
<p style="font-size: 125%;">   <b>O! James Whitcomb Riley</b> </p>
<p>   Your Nature-on the surface&mdash;was </p>
<p>   Simple, Honest, Open, Direct. </p>
<p>   It was all of that but&mdash;it was More! </p>
<p>   It was deeper than Tears! </p>
<p>   It was wider than Laughter! </p>
<p>   It was more profound, more subtle, </p>
<p>   than either your spoken Word. </p>
<p>   or, your written, your printed Thought. </p>
<p>   You were infinitely better than the </p>
<p>   Very Best that you ever did! </p>
<p>   High Praise, but True! </p>
<p>   Your nature was strangely Complex: </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">     There was the Man! </p>
<p class="i6">       There was the Poet! </p>
<p class="i8">         There was the Mystic! </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>   The Man could be known&mdash;and was&mdash;of all men. </p>
<p>   The Poet could be read&mdash;as he was&mdash;and he understood. </p>
<p>   He could Sing&mdash;as he did&mdash;Songs </p>
<p>   which caught the Hearts of the </p>
<p>   People&mdash;from the Cradle to the Grave! </p>
<p>   The Mystic! </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p style="font-size: 125%;">   <b>O! James Whitcomb Riley</b>! </p>
<p>   That Mystic Element in your Nature! </p>
<p>   It was held under a Strong Curb: </p>
<p>   It was constantly held in Check: </p>
<p>   But it was never Overcome! </p>
<p>   It was a Mood&mdash;not a Madness. </p>
<p>   It seldom made an Outward Sign. </p>
<p>   Then, it was brief, spasmodic, eratic. </p>
<p>   It was known to but few, even of those </p>
<p>   who came with you, in constant contact. </p>
<p>   To this Man, that Mystic Element in your Nature, </p>
<p>   made a most wonderful Appeal, deep, strong. </p>
<p>   To him, it was the <i>real</i> <b>James Whitcomb Riley</b>! </p>
<p>   You were a Mystic, but never a Reformer. </p>
<p>   You cheerfully rendered unto Ceasar all things </p>
<p>   that were his just due. </p>
<p>   You had no desire to overturn Natural Law, </p>
<p>   Human Regulation. </p>
<p>   You accepted, without question, the Established </p>
<p>   Order of Things. </p>
<p>   But so strong was this touch of the Mystic </p>
<p>   that, it you had desired, you could have, </p>
<p>   quickly, thickly, populated some far off Smiling Isle, </p>
<p>   of the Fair Summer Seas, with a Band of </p>
<p>   Cultured Men, of Cultured Women, ready, </p>
<p>   eager, to follow you&mdash;that Mystic You! into </p>
<p>   the Creation of a New Cult, of a New Religion! </p>
<p>   In your Poems there is but a trickle of the Mystic </p>
<p>   &mdash;a flash a dash&mdash;as the falling of a Star! </p>
<p>   That Edgar Allen Poe Episode, is the Answer. </p>
<p>   You were unduly humiliated by that Incident&mdash; </p>
<p>   &mdash;and it was but as Nothing </p>
<p>   But your Super-Sensitiveness, made you Suffer! </p>

<div class="stanza">
<p style="font-size: 125%;">   <b>O! James Whitcomb Riley</b>! </p>
<p>   Death, hath yet other Compensations! </p>
<p>   It has placed you Beyond the Cloy of Fulsome Praise: </p>
<p>   Beyond the Sting of Cruel Blame: the One, </p>
<p>   may not help You the Other, cannot hurt You! </p>

<div class="stanza">
<p style="font-size: 125%;">   <b>O! James Whitcomb Riley!</b> </p>
<p>   Once, when under the Spell of a Mystic Mood, </p>
<p>   you sought&mdash;as you had often sought before&mdash;that </p>
<p>   Wise Wizard of White River. </p>
<p>   He met you, when you came into that Peaceful </p>
<p>   Indiana Valley&mdash;where dwells this Wizard&mdash;by the </p>
<p>   Flowing Fountain of those Healing Waters. </p>
<p>   He knew your need; he spoke no unnecessary word; </p>
<p>   he quickly set his place in order, and was ready </p>
<p>   to go with you&mdash;anywhere. </p>
<p>   There had been, on your arrival, a clamor to have </p>
<p>   you Read that afternoon&mdash;but the Wizard </p>
<p>   quietly slipped you away. </p>
<p>   Out into the Open you drove, in an old Barouche, </p>
<p>   behind a Pair of Good Horses. </p>
<p>   It was a long Drive; it was a beautiful Drive. </p>
<p>   It was driven in Silence. </p>
<p>   After several hours&mdash;the spell was still upon you&mdash;a </p>
<p>   sharp turn brought you to the Banks of White River; </p>
<p>   and there&mdash;under a Clump of the Sycamore, of the </p>
<p>   Willow, in a deep, Shady Pool, an Eddy, undisturbed </p>
<p>   by the current of the broad, shallow Stream&mdash;a </p>
<p>   Batch of Boys, swimming, chattering, diving. </p>
<p>   "Stop" you said to the driver; "Come here" you called to the Lads. </p>
<p>   They came trooping, dripping, out of the Pool. </p>
<p>   A change came over you; flinging off your coat, </p>
<p>   your hat, you arose to your feet. </p>
<p>   There they stood before you, naked, unabashed, curious. </p>
<p>   A complacent smile, flickered across the bearded </p>
<p>   face of the Wise Wizard. He must have known! </p>
<p>   He must have timed your arrival at that particular </p>
<p>   spot, at that particular moment. </p>
<p>   But even the Wizard could not have known what was to follow. </p>
<p>   Without a word of explanation, you gave them, that </p>
<p>   crowd of naked Boys&mdash;gave it, as you had never </p>
<p>   given it before, doubtless, as you never </p>
<p>   gave it again&mdash;your </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>  &mdash;Which ought to have been The Prelude to</p>
<p>  this Spray of Kentucky Pine.</p>
<p>  Because it was written, published, a little more than a year</p>
<p>  before the Death of the Poet.</p>
<p>  Therefore, it was a Tribute to him, <i>Living!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>  <span style="font-size: 200%;">A</span> Promethean Poet was there. He had touched the</p>
<p>  Heavenly flame; he had lasted the Waters of</p>
<p>  Inspiration: he had drained the Crystal Cup of Fancy,</p>
<p>  finding therein neither Lees nor Dregs, which</p>
<p>  bite the tongue, stifle the song, of lesser Men; he had</p>
<p>  reverently kissed the coy hand of Fame, when she had</p>
<p>  crowned his Worthy Brow, with her Wreath Immortal!</p>
<p>  His Poems, homely, simple, sweet&mdash;springing from the lap of</p>
<p>  Nature&mdash;had spread, like wild-fire of the Forest,</p>
<p>  into the Four Quarters of the Globe.</p>
<p>  He came from the Land, across the River, where, in</p>
<p>  these latter days, the People quit the planting of the Potato,</p>
<p>  to pen a Poem: pause in the cultivation of the Corn, to</p>
<p>  compose a Novel. Some of it is good, very good; Some</p>
<p>  of it is bad, very bad: but all of it produces</p>
<p>  a princely Revenue far in excess of any return</p>
<p>  from either the Potato or the Corn.</p>
<p>  Long before the avalanche-like advent of this State-</p>
<p>  wide Literary Madness, the Star of this Poet had risen&mdash;</p>
<p>  risen before, and still shines beyond, and above them all.</p>
<p>  The hand which wrote "Goodbye, Jim"&mdash;not classical</p>
<p>  in either Greek or Roman sense, yet a great</p>
<p>  American Classic&mdash;with its pungent odor of Blue Jeans, with</p>
<p>  its clean, sweet, clear-cut, fine smell, of its native soil&mdash;</p>
<p>  that hand may never again hold the Pen; the man</p>
<p>  himself, may crumble&mdash;God forbid!&mdash;back into the Dust&mdash;</p>
<p>  that "Little Dust of Harm"&mdash;out of which he came;</p>
<p>  but his Poems will not, cannot die.</p>
<p>  When those other Writers will have been forgotten;</p>
<p>  when even the gifted Maker of "Ben Hur" will be, but</p>
<p>  as an empty name; even then, this Poet,</p>
<p>  and his Poems, will cleave to the Mind, cling to the</p>
<p>  Heart, of countless Generations, not yet born!</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
