<p>I have tried to write of the life I know, the life I have
lived, and of the lives of the people whom, above all
others, I love, and of whom I am so proud.</p>

<p>My people have been miners for generations, and I myself
became a miner at the age of twelve. I have worked since then
in the mine at every phase of coal getting until about five years
ago, when my fellow workers made me their checkweigher.</p>

<h2>THE THONG OF POVERTY</h2>


<p>&quot;Is it not about time you came to your bed, lassie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, I'll no' be very long now, Geordie. If I had this
heel turned, I'll soon finish the sock, and that will be a
pair the day. Is the pain in your back worse the nicht, that
you are so restless?&quot; and the clicking of the needles ceased as
the woman asked the question.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm no' so bad at all,&quot; came the answer. &quot;My back's
maybe a wee bit sore; but a body gets tired lying always in
the yin position. Forby, the day aye seems long when you
are out, and I dinna like to think of you out working all
day, and then sitting down to knit at nicht. It must be very
tiring for you, Nellie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm no' that tired,&quot; she replied with a show of cheerfulness,
as she turned another wire in the sock, and set the
balls of wool dancing on the floor with the speed at which she
worked. &quot;I've had a real good day to-day, and I'm feeling
that I could just sit for a lang while the nicht, if only the
paraffin oil wadna' go down so quick. But the longer I sit,
it burns the more, and it's getting gey dear to buy now-a-days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said the weary voice of the man. &quot;If it's no' clegs
it's midges. Folk have always something to contend against.
But don't be long till you stop. It's almost twelve o'clock, and
you ought to be in your bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'll no' be very long, Geordie,&quot; was the bravely cheerful
answer. &quot;Just you try and gang to sleep and I'll soon
finish up. I'll have to try and get up early in the morning,
for I have to go to Mrs. Rundell and wash. She always gi'es
me twa shillings, and that's a good day's pay. The only thing
I grudge is being away all day, leaving you and the bairns, for
I ken they're no' very easy to put up with. They're steerin'
weans, and are no' easy on a body who is ill.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, they're a steerin' lot, lassie,&quot; he answered tenderly.
&quot;But, poor things, they must hae some freedom, Nellie. I
wish I was ready for my work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoot, man,&quot; she said with the same show of cheerfulness.
&quot;We might have been worse, and you will be better some day,
and able to work as well as ever you did.&quot;</p>

<p>For a time there was silence, broken only by the loud ticking
of the clock, the clicking of the needles, and occasionally a
low moan from the bed, as the injured miner sank into a restless
sleep.</p>

<p>There had been an accident some six weeks before, and
Geordie Sinclair, badly wounded by a fall of stone, had been
brought home from the pit in a cart.</p>

<p>It was during the time known to old miners as the &quot;two-and-sixpenny
winter,&quot; that being the sum of the daily wage
then earned by the miners. A financial crisis had come upon
the country and the Glasgow City Bank had failed, trade was
dull, and the whole industrial system was in chaos. It had
been a hard time for Geordie Sinclair's wife, for there were
four children to provide for besides her injured husband.
Work which was well paid for was not over plentiful, and she
had to toil from early morning till far into the night to earn
the bare necessities of life. There were times like to-night,
when she felt rebellious and bitter at her plight, but her tired
eyes and fingers had to get to the end of the task, for that
meant bread for the children in the morning.</p>

<p>The silence deepened in the little kitchen. No sound came
now from the bed, and the lamp threw eerie shadows on the
walls, and the chimney smoked incessantly.</p>

<p>Her eyes grew watery and smarted with the smoke. She
dropped stitches occasionally, as she hurried with her work,
which had to be lifted again when she discovered that the
pattern was wrong, and sometimes quite a considerable part
had to be &quot;ripped out,&quot; so that she could correct the mistake.</p>

<p>The dismal calling of a cat outside irritated her, and the
loud complacent ticking of the clock seemed to mock her
misery; but still she worked on, the busy fingers turning the
needles, as the wool unwound itself from the balls which
danced upon the floor. There was life in those balls of wool
as they spun to the tune of the woman's misery. They advanced
and retired, like dancers, touching hands when they
met, then whirling away in opposite directions again; they
side-stepped and wheeled in a mad riot of joyous color, just
as they were about to meet: they stood for a little facing each
other, feinting from side to side, then were off again, as the
music of her misery quickened, in an embracing whirl, as if
married in an ecstasy of colored flame, many-shaded, yet one;
then, at last, just as the tune seemed to have reached a crescendo
of spirit, she dashed her work upon the floor, as she
discovered another blunder, and burst into a fit of passionate
weeping.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a faint tap at the window, and she
raised her head, staying her breath to listen. Soon she heard
it again, just a faint but very deliberate tap, which convinced
her that someone was outside in the darkness. Softly she stole
on tiptoe across the room, so as not to disturb her sleeping
husband, and opening the door quietly, craned forward and
peered into the darkness to discover the cause of the tap.</p>

<p>&quot;It's just me,&quot; said a deep voice, in uneasy accents, from
the darkness by the window, and she saw then the form of a
man edging nearer the door.</p>

<p>&quot;And who are you?&quot; she asked a little nervously, but trying
to master the alarm in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you not ken me?&quot; replied the voice with an attempt
to speak as naturally as possible; yet there was something in
the tone that made her more uneasy.</p>

<p>Then the figure of the man drew nearer, and he whispered
&quot;Are they all sleeping?&quot; alluding to the inmates of the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; she answered, drawing back into the shelter of the
doorway. &quot;Why do you ask? And what is it you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I just came along to see how you were all getting on,&quot;
was the reply. &quot;I ken you must be in very straitened circumstances
by this time, and thought I might be able to help you
a bit,&quot; and there was an ingratiating tone in the words now
as he sidled nearer. &quot;You must have a very hard battle just
now, and I would like to do something to help you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come away in,&quot; said the woman, with still an uneasy
tremor in her voice, yet feeling more assured. &quot;Geordie is
sleeping, but he'll not be hard to waken up. Come away in,
and let us see who you are, and tell us what you really want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm no' coming in,&quot; he whispered hoarsely. &quot;Do you
no' ken me? Shut the door and not let any of them hear. I'm
wanting you!&quot; and he stepped into the light and reached forward
his hand, as if to draw her to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair gasped and recoiled in horror, as she recognized
who it was that stood before her.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she cried decisively, stepping further back into the
shelter of the house, her voice low and intense with indignation.
&quot;No, I have not come to that yet, thank God. Gang
home, you dirty brute, that you are! I'll be very ill off when
I ask anything, or take anything, from you, Jock Walker!&quot;
For it was well known in Lowwood that Jock Walker's errands
to people in distress had always in them an ulterior
motive.</p>

<p>He was the under manager at the pits, and his reputation
was of the blackest. There were men in the village of Lowwood
who were well aware of this man's relations with their
wives, and they openly agreed to the sale of the honor of
their women folk in return for what he gave them in the
shape of contracts, at which they could make more money than
their neighbors, or good &quot;places,&quot; where the coal was easier
won. In fact, to be a contractor was a synonym for this sort
of dealing, for no one ever got a contract from Walker unless
his wife, or his daughter, was a woman of easy virtue, and at
the service of this man.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Walker with chagrined anger. &quot;Please
yourself. But let me tell you that you'll maybe no' ay be so
high and mighty; you'll maybe be dam'd glad yet of the
chance that I have given you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; protested Mrs. Sinclair. &quot;Go away&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, Nellie,&quot; he said, his voice changing to a low
pleading tone, &quot;you're in a hole. You must be. Be a sensible
woman, and you'll never need to be so ill-grippet again. I
can put Geordie in a position that he'll make any amount of
money as soon as he is able to start. You are not a bit better
than anyone else, and for the sake of your bairns you should
be sensible. And forby,&quot; he went on, as if now more sure of
his ground, &quot;what the hell's wrang in it? It's no' what folk
do that is wrong. It's in being found out. Now come away
and be sensible. You ken what is wanted, and you ken that
I can make you well off for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, by heavens,&quot; she cried, now tingling with anger at
the insult. &quot;Never! Get out of this, you brute! If Geordie
Sinclair had been able this nicht, I'd have got him to deal
with you. Get out of here, or I'll cleave your rotten body,
and let out your rotten heart.&quot; And she turned in, and closed
and bolted the door, leaving Walker fuming with anger at the
repulse of his advances. Nellie Sinclair had never felt so
outraged in all her life before. She was trembling with anger
at the insult of his proposals. She paced the floor in her
stockinged feet, as if a wild spirit were raging within her demanding
release; then finally she flung herself into the &quot;big
chair,&quot; disgust and anger in her heart, and for the second time
that night burst into a passionate fit of weeping, which seemed
to shake her body almost asunder. For a long time she sat
thus, sobbing, her whole being burning with indignation, and
her mind in a fury of disgust and rebellion.</p>

<p>Then there was a faint stirring in the bed where the children
slept, and a little boy's form began to crawl from amongst the
rough bedclothes, his eyes gazing in amazement at the bowed
figure of his mother. She was crying, he concluded, for her
shoulders were heaving and it must be something very bad
that made his beautiful mother cry like this. He crept across
the bare wooden floor, his bare sturdy legs showing beneath
the short and meager shirt, and was soon at her side.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrang wi' you, mother?&quot; he asked, as he put his
soft little hand upon her head. &quot;What's wrang wi' you? Will
I kiss you held and make it better?&quot; But his mother did not
look up&mdash;only the big sobs continued to shake her, and the
boy becoming alarmed at this, also began to cry, as he placed
his little head against hers. &quot;Oh, mother, dinna greet,&quot; he
sobbed, &quot;and I'll kiss your heid till it's better.&quot;</p>

<p>At last she lifted her head, and seeing the naked boy, she
caught him in her arms and crushed him to her breast, as if
she would smother him. This was strange conduct for his
usually undemonstrative mother; but it was nice to be hugged
like that, even though she did cry.</p>

<p>&quot;What made you greet, mother?&quot; he queried, for he had
never before, in all his four years, seen his mother cry. For
answer she merely caught him closer to her breast, her hair
falling soft and warm all over him as she did so.</p>

<p>&quot;Was you hungry, mither?&quot; he tried again.</p>

<p>&quot;No' very,&quot; she answered, choking back her sobs.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you often hungry, too, mither?&quot; he persisted, feeling
encouraged at getting an answer at last.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; she replied. &quot;But dinna bother me, Rob,&quot;
she continued. &quot;Gang away to your bed like a man.&quot;</p>

<p>He was silent for a time at this repulse, and lay upon her
knee puzzling over the matter.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you greet when you are hungry?&quot; he enquired, with:
wide-eyed earnestness and surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;There noo,&quot; she answered, &quot;don't ask so many questions,
Daddy'll not be long till he is better again, and when he is
at work there'll be plenty of pieces to keep us all from being
hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And will there be jeely for the pieces?&quot; pursued the boy,
for it seemed to him that there had never been a time when
there was plenty to eat.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we'll get plenty o' jeely too,&quot; she replied, drying the
remaining tears from her eyes, and hugging him again to her
breast.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my,&quot; he said, with a deep sigh. &quot;I wish my father
was better!&quot; and the little lips were moistened by his tongue,
as if in anticipation of the coming feast.</p>

<p>Another silence; and then came the query&mdash;&quot;What way do
we not get plenty o' pieces when my daddy's no' working?
Does folk no' get them then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Robin,&quot; she answered, &quot;but dinna fash your wee noddle
with that. You'll find out all about it when you get big.
Shut your eyes and mother'll sing, an' you'll go to sleep.&quot;
And he snuggled in and shut his eyes, while Mrs. Sinclair gathered
him softly to her breast and began to croon an old
ballad.</p>

<p>As she sang it seemed to the boy that there were no such
things as &quot;jelly-pieces&quot; to bother about. He liked his mother
to sing to him, for he seemed to get rolled up in her soft,
warm voice, and become restful and happy. Gradually the low
crooning song grew fainter in his ears, the flicker of the fire
danced further and further away, until long streaks of golden
thready light seemed to reach out, straight from his eyes to
the fireplace, and all the comfort that it was possible to have
flowed through his soul, and at last he slept. Mrs. Sinclair
placed him beside his brothers and sisters in the bed and went
back to finish her knitting. The night was far gone before
she accomplished her task, and she stood and surveyed her
humble home with weariness in her heart.</p>

<p>Through the dim smoke which hung like a blue cloud along
the roof, and made more seemingly thick by the small lamp
upon the table, she looked at her husband lying asleep, and so
far free from pain. Then her eyes traveled to the children
in the other bed, and they filled with tears as she thought that
she had had to put them supperless to bed that night, and
again rebellion surged through her blood as she thought of
all the misery of her life. Was it worth living and going on in
this way? Was it worth while to continue? What had she
done to reap all this suffering?</p>

<p>She was hungry and weak and exhausted. Perhaps if she
could sleep she would forget it, and in the morning the socks
she had finished would bring her a few pence, and that would
mean food.</p>

<p>She decided to go to bed, and in passing by the shelf at
the window, her eye caught sight of a plateful of potato skins,
the remains of the meager dinner of boiled potatoes which the
children had had; and clutching them, she began greedily to
devour them, filling her mouth and cramming them in in handfuls,
until it seemed as if she would choke herself. Then,
licking the plate clean of every crumb, she undressed and
slipped quietly into bed, to lie and fret and toss, as she thought
of the insult which Black Jock had offered her, and pondered
over the unhappy lot of her children and their injured father.</p>

<h2>A TURN OF THE SCREW</h2>


<p>On the Friday following Jock Walker's visit to Mrs.
Sinclair, a notice was put up at the pit by Peter Pegg
and Andrew Marshall, to the effect that a collection
would be taken next day on behalf of Geordie Sinclair. The
notice was posted up before Andrew and Peter descended the
pit for the day.</p>

<p>&quot;Black Jock,&quot; as Walker was called by the miners, saw the
notice before it had been ten minutes posted, and deliberately
tore it down. He then visited Peter Pegg and Andrew Marshall
at the coal face.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you an' Andrew are goin' to gather for Geordie
Sinclair the morn?&quot; he said, addressing Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; Peter answered, &quot;we were thinkin' it was aboot time
somethin' was done. There's four bairns an' their two selves,
an' though times are no' very guid for ony of us now, it maun
be a lot worse for them. Geordie has been a guid while off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do ye think, Peter, they are in such need?&quot; asked Walker,
with a hint in his voice that was meant to convey he knew
better.</p>

<p>&quot;Lord, they canna be aught else!&quot; decisively returned Peter.
&quot;How can they be? I ken for mysel',&quot; he went on, &quot;that if it
was me, I wad hae been in starvation lang syne.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, wad ye believe me when I tell ye&mdash;an' it's a fact&mdash;they're
about the best-off family in this place, if ye only
kent it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!&quot; cried Peter in surprise, &quot;the best-off family in the
place! Lord, I canna take that in!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe no',&quot; said Walker, &quot;but I ken, an' ye're no' the
first that's been taken in by Nellie Sinclair. If ye notice, she
never tells any thin' to anybody; but she lets ye carry the
notion in your mind that she's in great straits. She's a cute
one, Nellie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, Nellie does keep hersel' to hersel',&quot; admitted Peter.
&quot;She's no' given to clashin' and claverin' about the doors like
some o' the rest o' the women; but I canna' for the life o' me
see where she can be onythin' but ill aff at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, I ken when folk are bein' imposed on,&quot; said Walker,
in a knowing tone, &quot;an' I tore down your notice this mornin'.
I didna want to see you mak' a fool o' yersels. I ha'e been
considerin' for a while,&quot; he went on, speaking quickly, &quot;about
puttin' a stop to this collectin' business at the office on pay
Saturdays, for it just encourages some men to lie off work
when there's no' very muckle wrong wi' them; after they get
the collection they soon start work again. Ye had better no'
stand the morn, for I might as well begin at once and put a
stop to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Up till now Andrew Marshall had not spoken; he was a
silent man, given more to thought than speech, but this was a
way of doing things he did not like.</p>

<p>&quot;But ye might let us tak' the collection first, and then put
up a notice yersel sayin' that a' collections have to be stopped.
It wad be best to gi'e the men notice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Walker, &quot;there's to be nae mair collections taken.
I might as well stop it this time as wait. So ye'll no' stand the
morn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will I no'?&quot; returned Andrew challengingly. &quot;How the
hell do ye ken whether I will or no'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ken ye'll no',&quot; replied Walker, with quiet menacing tones;
&quot;the ground at the office belongs to the company, and is private.
So ye can do it if ye like, but ye'll be weel advised no'
to bother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't gi'e a damn,&quot; cried Andrew explosively, &quot;whether
the ground is private or no'. I'll take that 'gathering' for
Geordie Sinclair the morn, though ye ha'e a regiment o'
sodgers at the office.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Walker, as he departed, &quot;if ye do, ye
can look out.&quot;</p>

<p>Peter took his pipe out of his mouth and spat savagely on
the ground; he then replaced it with great deliberation and
looked gloomily at the stoop-side. He was a man about thirty-five,
tall, bony and angular; his neck was long and thin, and
his head seemed always on the point of turning to allow him
to look over his shoulder. His right eye was half closed, while
his left eye looked big and saucer-like, and never seemed to
wink; one eye was ready to laugh and the other to &quot;greet,&quot;
as his comrades described it. He had been badly disfigured
in a burning accident in the pit when he was a young man,
and a broken nose added still more to the strangeness of his
appearance. Andrew, on the other hand, was stout and broadly
built, with a bushy whisker on each cheek, and a clump of
tufty hair on his head.</p>

<p>&quot;What do ye mak' o' that, Andrew?&quot; enquired Peter, after
a few minutes, as he again spat savagely at the stoop-side.</p>

<p>&quot;What do I mak' o't?&quot; echoed Andrew, as he glowered across
the little bing of dross at his mate, &quot;it's just in keepin' wi'
the rest o' his dirty doin's, the dirty black brute that he is!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what's wrong wi' him?&quot; mused Peter as he
sucked quietly at his snoring pipe. But there was no answer
from Andrew, who was sitting silent and glum, gazing at his
little lamp.</p>

<p>&quot;What are ye goin' to do about it, then?&quot; broke in Peter
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Just what I said,&quot; returned Andrew with quiet firmness.
&quot;I'll take that collection the morn, some way or another, if I
should be damned for it. Does he mean to say that we can let
folk starve?&quot; He lifted his pick and began to hew the coal
with an energy that told of the passion raging within him.</p>

<p>&quot;Does he mean to think I'm goin' to see decent folk starve
afore my e'en?&quot; he asked after a while, pausing to wipe the
sweat from his eyes. &quot;No' damned likely! Things ha'e come
to a fine pass when folk are compelled to look at other folk
starvin' an' no' gi'e them a crust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do ye think there's onything in what he said about them
bein' weel-aff?&quot; asked Peter cautiously, while his big eye tried
to wink. &quot;Nellie is a wee bit inclined to be prood an' independent,
ye ken, an' disna say muckle about her affairs. An
forby we don't ken very muckle about her; she's an incomer
to the place, and she might ha'e been weel-aff afore she
married Geordie, for aught we ken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It disna matter,&quot; replied Andrew, &quot;I dinna care though they had
thousan's. What I don't like is this
'ye'll-no'-do-this-an'-ye'll-no'-do-that' sort o' thing. What the hell
right has ony gaffer wi' what a man does? It's a' one to him what I do.
I'm nae slave, an' forby, I dinna believe they are weel-aff. They maun
be hard up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he'll maybe sack ye,&quot; suggested Peter, &quot;if ye take
the collection.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let him,&quot; cried Andrew, now thoroughly roused, &quot;the
bastard! I would see the greyhounds o' hell huntin' him
roun' the rocks o' blazes afore I'd give in to him!&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing further was said of the matter until well on in
the day, when it suddenly occurred to Andrew that Peter,
who had a large family, might not care to incur the displeasure
of Walker by taking the collection the next day.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, Peter,&quot; he said, after he had thought the matter
over, &quot;if ye don't care to take the collection wi' me, I
won't press ye. I'll no' think ony worse o' ye if ye don't. Ye
ha'e a big family, while I ha'e only the wife to look after.
Sometimes I think it's lucky we ha'e nae weans; I can flit, and
ye might no' be able to rise an' run. But I mean to take the
collection onyway, for I don't like a man to order me what I
ha'e to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I wasna mindin' that, Andra,&quot; replied Peter, trying
to make Andrew believe that he had not guessed the truth.
&quot;I'll take the collectin wi' ye, an' Black Jock can gang to hell
if he likes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Peter, ye'll do naethin' o' the kind. I'll take it mysel'.&quot;
And Andrew would not move from that decision.</p>

<p>Next day everybody was curiously expectant; it had got
noised abroad that Walker had defied Andrew Marshall to
take a collection at the office, and had threatened him with
arrest. There were wild rumors of other penalties, and when
pay-day came everybody was surprised to see Andrew draw his
pay and walk home. They concluded that Andrew had thought
better of it, and had been cowed into submission. When darkness
began to fall, however, Andrew sauntered out and visited
every home in the village, soliciting aid on behalf of Geordie
Sinclair. There were few houses from which he did not get a
donation, though the will to give was often greater than the
means. In each house Andrew had to give in detail the interview
between Black Jock and himself in the pit.</p>

<p>&quot;The muckle big, black, dirty brute that he is!&quot; the good-wife
would cry in indignation. &quot;It's a pity but he could ken
what starvation is himsel'. It might make him a bit mair
like a human bein'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true,&quot; Andrew would agree.</p>

<p>In one or two houses he met with a blank refusal, but in
these he was not disappointed, for he knew that the men
would not risk Walker's disapproval by contributing. Again,
some were wholly hostile. They were the &quot;belly-crawlers,&quot; as
Geordie Sinclair had once dubbed them at a meeting, those who
&quot;kept in&quot; with the management by carrying tales, and generally
acting as traitors to the other men.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'll no' gi'e ye onythin',&quot; would be the reply; &quot;he can
just be like me an' gang an' work for his bairns. Forby,
look at yon stuck-up baggage o' a wife o' his. She can
hardly pass the time o' day wi' ye&mdash;she thinks hersel' somethin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; Andrew would reply, &quot;maybe ye ha'e mair
need o't for other things.&quot; And he would pass on to the next
house.</p>

<p>He had gathered between three and four pounds, contributed
sometimes even in pennies, and going to Geordie's house, he
knocked at the door. This was the most uncomfortable part
of his work, and he stood shifting from one foot to the other,
wondering what he would say when he entered. Mrs. Sinclair
was busy washing the floor and cleaning up, after having
been at work all day washing for someone in the village. She
wiped her hands and opened the door.</p>

<p>&quot;How are ye a' keepin' the night?&quot; inquired Andrew, as he
stepped inside at Mrs. Sinclair's invitation, feeling more and
more uncomfortable. It was a hard enough matter to go and
ask others whom he knew had little to spare, but now, having
got the money, he did not know how he was going to hand
it over to Nellie. He ruminated for a time as to how he would
break into the subject. He knew that Nellie Sinclair must
have heard of the collection, and guessed his errand, for he
saw that she, too, was uneasy and agitated.</p>

<p>&quot;How are ye a' the night?&quot; he again enquired, to break
the silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm no' so bad at a', Andra,&quot; replied Geordie. &quot;I'm
feelin' a wee bit easier the night. How's yersel'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No' so bad,&quot; answered Andrew, putting his hand in his
pocket for his pipe.</p>

<p>&quot;Dash it! I'm away without my pipe,&quot; he said with a show
of annoyance. &quot;Can ye len' me yours, Geordie, to get a
smoke? I ha'e my tobacco and matches. Ye see,&quot; he went on,
speaking more rapidly, &quot;I thought I would just slip round to
see how ye was keepin'.&quot;</p>

<p>Andrew knew that Geordie would not have had a smoke
for a long time, and this was his way of leaving him with a
pipeful of tobacco.</p>

<p>&quot;I think my pipe's on the mantelshelf,&quot; returned Geordie,
&quot;but I doot it's empty.&quot;</p>

<p>Andrew took down the pipe, filled it generously, set it
alight, and sat for a few minutes trying vainly to keep up a
connected conversation. After he had puffed a few minutes
at Geordie's pipe he laid it down, dived his hand into his
trousers pocket as he made for the door. He pulled forth the
money, which was in a little bag, and laid it down on the
table, saying: &quot;I'm no' guid at this kind of thing, Geordie.
There's something for ye from the men. Guid nicht!&quot; and
he was off, leaving Nellie in tears and Geordie in glum silence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair's tears were tears of rebellion as well as of
gratitude. She was touched by Andrew's delicacy, but her independent
spirit was wounded at having to take help from
anyone. She thought of the children and of her husband, who
needed nourishment, and taking up the little bag she poured
its contents into her lap, while her hot tears fell upon the
money. Little Robert, who was sitting watching, and who had
never in all his life seen so much money, ran to his mother with
a cry of delight.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mammy, will I get sweeties noo?&quot; and the boy danced
with glee, as he shouted, &quot;I'll get jeely-pieces noo, hurray!&quot;</p>

<p>That night there was happiness in Geordie Sinclair's house,
for there was food in plenty, and it seemed as if the children
would never be able to appease their hunger.</p>

<p>The &quot;jeely-pieces,&quot; or slices of bread with jam on them,
disappeared with amazing rapidity, and Geordie had some
beef-tea, which seemed to improve him almost as soon as he
had taken it. For the first time for many months Mrs. Sinclair
and the children went to bed with satisfied appetites;
and the children's dreams were as the incidents in the life of
a god, exalted and happy, and their mother's rest was unbroken
and full of comfort.</p>

<p>But on Monday morning Andrew Marshall had to pay the
price of the happiness he had been instrumental in giving
them, for he was informed by one of Walker's henchmen that
his place was stopped. The excuse given was that it was too
far in advance of the others. Andrew knew what that meant,
and as he went home, fierce rebellious feelings stirred within
him. Peter Pegg, he was glad to know, had got started on
&quot;oncost&quot; work, and Andrew felt he had done right in not allowing
Peter to take the collection with him.</p>

<h2>THE BLOCK</h2>


<p>&quot;I see Andra Marshall's back again,&quot; observed Sanny Robertson
to Peter Pegg one evening three months later.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Peter, &quot;he was at Glampy, but his place
was stopped, an' there wasna anither for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Got the sack again, I suppose,&quot; said Sanny. &quot;Weel, he
maun learn, Peter, that gaffers are no' gaun to put up wi' his
nonsense. If a man will no' do what he's telt, he maun just
take the consequences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Peter, very dryly, and as Peter knew his man,
no more was said.</p>

<p>Later the same night Matthew Maitland observed to Peter,
as they sat on their &quot;hunkers&quot; at the corner:</p>

<p>&quot;Andra's back again, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; was the answer, &quot;he was telt his place was stopped.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Imphm,&quot; said Matthew, &quot;it's a damn fine excuse. It's a
pity but somethin' could be done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's the Block,&quot; said Peter. &quot;I'm telt that a' the managers
roun' aboot ha'e an understandin' with one another no' to gi'e
work to onybody they take a dislike to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; agreed Matthew, &quot;I ha'e heard aboot it, but I would
soon put a stop to it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Matthew, it's a union we need up here badly. I'm
telt that that chap Smillie has managed to start one down in
the West Country, an' it's daein' weel. He's got some o' their
wages up a hale shillin' a day since he took it in hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that a fact, Peter? The sooner we ha'e him up here the
better then. Black Jock needs a chap back onyway,&quot; and
Matthew looked like a man who had suddenly discovered a
great truth.</p>

<p>Andrew Marshall had never been allowed to forget his action
in defying Walker; everywhere he went it was the same story&mdash;no
work for him. The &quot;Block&quot; system among the managers
was in good working order, and could easily starve a man into
docility. Andrew became more desperate as time passed,
and he knew that he and his wife were nearing the end of their
small savings. He returned home one evening from his usual
fruitless search for employment, and threw himself into the
arm-chair by the fireside.</p>

<p>&quot;No work yet, Andra?&quot; asked Katie.</p>

<p>&quot;Nane,&quot; was the gloomy response.</p>

<p>&quot;We have no' very mony shillin's left noo, Andra. I dinna
ken what we'll do.&quot;</p>

<p>Savage, revengeful feelings surged through Andrew, and
found vent in a volley of oaths which terrified his wife.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna talk like that, Andra,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;It's no' canny,
an' forby, the Lord disna like ye to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If the Lord cared He could take Black Jock by the scruff
o' the neck an' fling him into hell oot o' the road. It's Black
Jock that's at the bottom o' this, an' I could twist his dirty
neck for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, Andra, it's the Lord's doin', an' maybe things'll
soon men'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it's the Lord's doin', I dinna think muckle o' His conduct
then,&quot; and Andrew lapsed into sullen silence.</p>

<p>On Monday morning he was up at five o'clock, desperately
resolved to lay his case before the men. He walked to the end
of the village, knowing the colliery would be idle, for Tam
Donaldson was to be &quot;creeled.&quot; This was a custom at one time
very prevalent in mining villages. When a young man got
married, the first day he appeared at his work afterwards he
was taken home by his comrades, and was expected to stand
them a drink. It generally ended in a collection being made,
after they had tasted the newly-married man's whiskey, and
a common fund thus being established, a large quantity of beer
and whiskey was procured, and all drank to their heart's content.</p>

<p>Andrew heard the men calling to each other as they made
their way to the pit, the lights from their lamps twinkling
in the darkness of the winter morning.</p>

<p>&quot;Is Tam away yet, Jamie?&quot; he heard wee Allan ask, as he
overtook old Jamie Lauder on his way to the pit.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, I saw to that,&quot; replied Lauder, &quot;I chappit him up
at five o'clock, so that he wadna sleep in. I hinna missed a
creelin' for thirty-five years, an' I wasna' gaun to miss Tam
Donaldson's. I heard him goin' oot two or three minutes
afore me. We're in for a guid day, for he telt me he had in
two bottles for the spree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a' right, then; I was afraid he wad maybe sleep
in,&quot; and the two trudged on together towards the pit.</p>

<p>A group of dark figures stood on the pithead, waiting their
turn to go below. The cage rattled up from the depths of
the shaft, the men stepped in, and almost immediately disappeared
down into the blackness. Arrived at the bottom, they
walked along towards the different passages, chaffing and jesting
with Tam Donaldson, the newly-married one.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye'll be gaun to do something decent the day, Tam, when
we take ye hame?&quot; said Jamie Allan. &quot;I hear ye ha'e two
bottles ready for the occasion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but I'm damned shair there's no a lick gaun unless
ye take me hame,&quot; answered Donaldson. &quot;If I ha'e to be
creeled, I'll be creeled right, an' every one o' ye'll gang hame
wi' me afore ye get a taste.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but we'll see to that, chaps,&quot; said old Lauder. &quot;Here's
a hutch, get him in an' aff wi' him.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim pretended to resist, and stoutly maintained that
they should not creel him. He was seized by half a dozen pairs
of arms, and with much expenditure of energy and breath, deposited
in the hutch. Some considerate person had put some
straw and old bags in the &quot;carriage&quot; to make it more comfortable,
and a few of the wags had chalked inscriptions, the
reverse of complimentary, all over it.</p>

<p>&quot;There, noo', boys,&quot; said old Lauder, who had been busy
hanging lighted pit lamps round Tam's cap, &quot;gi'e him a guid
run to the bottom, and see that he gets a guid bump in the
lye.&quot;</p>

<p>The men ran the hutch to the &quot;bottom&quot; straight against
the full tubs ready to be sent to the surface.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Sourocks, let us up,&quot; called Allan to the old
man who acted as &quot;bottomer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hell to the up will ye get!&quot; replied the old fellow, &quot;I'm
gaun to put on these hutches first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, ye'll no', an' if ye do, you'll gang into the 'sump,' an'
we'll chap the bell oorsels&quot;&mdash;the sump being the lodgment into
which the water gathered before pumping operations could
start.</p>

<p>&quot;Sourocks&quot; thought discretion the better part of valor in
this case, and swearing quietly to himself, he signaled to the
engineman at the top to draw them up.</p>

<p>&quot;He's no gaun to walk hame,&quot; said Allan, as they all gathered
again on the pit head. &quot;We'll take the hutch hame wi'
Tam in it. Put a rope on it, and we'll draw the damned thing
through the moor, an' maybe Tam'll mind the day he was
creeled as lang as he lives.&quot;</p>

<p>This proposal was jumped at, especially by the younger
men, to whom an idle day did not mean so much worry on
pay-day as to their married elders.</p>

<p>Andrew Marshall had waited at the end of the village, knowing
that the creeling was to take place, and that he would get
the men on their way from the pit. Presently old Lauder,
who had taken a short cut across the moor, came up, and Andrew
accosted him.</p>

<p>&quot;Will ye wait here, Jamie, so that I can try an' get a meetin'
held wi' the rest o' the men when they come alang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will that, Andra,&quot; replied Jamie, taking the lighted lamp
from his head, and sitting down at the corner on his &quot;hunkers.&quot;
&quot;They're a' comin' hame anyway, for we're creelin'
Tam Donaldson.&quot;</p>

<p>Soon the procession appeared, the hutch jolting along the
rough street, the men shouting and singing as they came.
The village had turned out to see the fun. Andrew and
Jamie found themselves in the midst of a crowd of women
and children, as the foremost of the men came to a halt at
the corner.</p>

<p>Andrew quietly stepped out and addressed the men, asking
them if they would wait a few minutes&mdash;as they were idle in
any case&mdash;to have a meeting. All were agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's Sanny Robertson,&quot; said Tam Tate, peering into the
breaking light, &quot;he'll no' likely wait, but we'll see what he
says aboot it,&quot; and all waited in silence until Robertson approached.
He seemed to guess what was in the air, and hurriedly
tried to pass on, but Andrew stepped out with the usual
question.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he replied uneasily, &quot;I'll ha'e no part in ony mair
strife. Folk just get into bother for nothing. Men'll ha'e
to keep mind that gaffers now-a-days'll no' put up wi' disobedience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but ye maun mind,&quot; said Tam Tate hastily, &quot;that men
maun be treated as human bein's, even by a gaffer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can aye get on with the gaffer,&quot; replied Robertson, &quot;an'
I dinna see what way ither folk canna do the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a' richt,&quot; put in old Jamie Lauder, &quot;but a' men
are no' just prepared to do as ye do,&quot; and there was a hint
of something in his voice which the others seemed to understand.</p>

<p>&quot;I ha'e no quarrel,&quot; sulkily replied Robertson, &quot;an' I dinna
see what way I should get into this one. I can get plenty o'
work, an' ither folk can get it too, if they like to behave themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ye're a liar,&quot; roared Tam Tate angrily, his usual hasty
temper getting the mastery. &quot;It's no' you that gets the work,
it's Mag!&quot;</p>

<p>The others laughed uproariously, for it was common knowledge
that Sanny got his good jobs because of Walker's intimacy
with his wife.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye leave the best man in the house every mornin' when
ye gang oot!&quot; roared another amid coarse laughter, whilst
Andrew turned to tackle the next comer.</p>

<p>A few refused to wait, but it was generally known that
these were the men whose houses were always open to Walker
by day or night. When they were all gathered, Andrew Marshall
stood up, and for the first time in his life spoke at a
meeting.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, men,&quot; he began, &quot;ye a' ken the position o' things.
Ye ken as weel as me that I got the sack for gatherin' for
Geordie Sinclair. Weel, I ha'e been oot o' work three months;
the Block is on against me, an' it seems I ha'e to starve. I
canna get work onywhere, an' I stopped ye a' the day to ask
ye to make my quarrel yours, an' try and put an end to this
business.&quot;</p>

<p>That was the whole speech, but its simple sincerity appealed
to all, and many expressed approval and determination
to stand by Andrew in his fight.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it's a damn'd shame,&quot; said old Lauder.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell ye what it is,&quot; said Matthew Maitland, &quot;it's a
downricht barefaced murder, an' I would smash this damn'd
cantrip o' Black Jock's. I ken that he'll get a' that is said
at this meetin', an' maybe I'll get the same dose; but I think
it's aboot time somethin' was done to put an end to his capers,&quot;
and so Matthew floundered on.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' let us see what can be done for Geordie, too,&quot;
put in Peter Pegg, and his long neck seemed to get longer at
every syllable, while his big eye made a great attempt to
wink and to look backward, as if he expected to see someone
coming from behind. &quot;We a' ken,&quot; continued Peter, &quot;that
Geordie is ready for work noo', this fower week syne, but
Black Jock says he has no places, an' forby two strangers got
jobs just yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ken for yae thing that there's fower places staunin' in
Millar's Level,&quot; said Jamie Lauder, &quot;an' I'm telt there's five
or six staunin' in the Black Horse Dook. It's a' a bit of humbug,
an' I think we should try an' put an end to it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, I think we're a' agreed on that,&quot; said Tam Tate.
&quot;Has ony o' you onything to suggest?&quot;</p>

<p>For a few minutes there was silence, while they sat or stood
deep in thought, trying to find a solution. It was an eerie
gathering, with the gray dawn just beginning to break, while
on every head the indispensable lamp burned and flickered.
Men expectorated savagely upon the ground, staring hard at
the stones at their feet, thinking and wondering how they
might serve their comrades.</p>

<p>&quot;It's about time we had a union,&quot; said one.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; replied another, &quot;so that some bigmouthed idiot can
pocket the money an' get a guid saft job oot o' it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've had plenty of unions,&quot; put in another. &quot;The last
yin we started here&mdash;ye mind Bob Ritchie gaed aff to America
wi' a' the money. It was a fine go for him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ay, but let us see what can be done wi' this case,&quot;
said Jamie Lauder. &quot;Hoo' wad it do if we appointed a deputation
to gang an' lay the hale thing afore Mr. Rundell?&quot;</p>

<p>Jamie was always listened to with the respect due to his
proved good sense, for everyone knew that he was a man
who would not intentionally hurt a fellow creature by word
or deed.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe it wad be a guid plan,&quot; agreed Tam Tate. &quot;He
maybe disna ken the hauf that gangs on. What do ye a'
think o' it, men?&quot;</p>

<p>This was before the days of limited companies and coal syndicates,
and the proprietor of the pits in Lowwood, Mr. Rundell,
lived about two miles out of the village. He was not a
bad man, as men go; he was fiery and quick-tempered, but
had a not ungenerous nature withal, and was usually susceptible
to a reasoned statement. Just as they were about to
decide on a course of action, Andrew spoke: &quot;I dinna want
ony mair o' ye than can be helped to get into bother, so, if
ye like, Jamie Lauder&mdash;if he's agreeable&mdash;could gang wi'
me and Geordie Sinclair, and we'll put the hale case afore him
an' see what he mak's o't.&quot;</p>

<p>This was received with approval, and it was agreed that
Andrew, Jamie and Geordie should form the deputation.</p>

<p>But Black Jock soon heard of the decision, and, as usual,
acted with alacrity; for, had the men only known it, they had
decided on a course which he did not want them to adopt.
He visited Jamie Lauder, and told him that the day before
Rundell and he had agreed that the places in the Black Horse
Dook should be started at once, and that he was angry at the
course taken by the men. He believed that Mr. Rundell would
also be very angry, and if only Andrew and Geordie had come
to him the night before, they could have been working that
day. He represented Rundell as being in an explosive mood,
and that he was furious at the men taking the idle day, and
that he had threatened that if they were not at work next
day, he would lock them out. So plausibly did he speak, and
so sincere did his concern appear, that Jamie, who was withal
a simple man, and aware that the circumstances of his comrades
would not admit of a very long fight, began to think it
might be as Black Jock had said.</p>

<p>&quot;I think ye'd better ca' a meetin' o' the men, Jamie, and put
the hale case afore them. Let them ken that Rundell decided
just yesterday to start the places, and that Andra and
Geordie can start the morn. I ha'e no ill wull at ony o' the
twa o' them, and I'm vexed that things ha'e been as bad as
they've been, but I couldna get the boss to start the places, and
what could I do? They can a' be back at their work the morn
if they like to look at it reasonably. Of course, ye can please
yersel',&quot; he went on, &quot;it's a' yin to me; but if Rundell tak's
it into his head to ha'e a fight, well&mdash;ye ken what it means,
an' I wouldna like to ha'e ony strife the noo', for times are
very hard for us a'.&quot;</p>

<p>Simple and honest as Jamie was, Black Jock's plausibility
appealed to him, and he began to think that Walker perhaps
was not so bad as he was made to appear. Again, Jamie
knew that Rundell was a man of hasty temper and impulsive
judgments, and could not brook trouble, and he began to think
that perhaps it might be better to hold the meeting as suggested
and tell the men what he had heard, and appeal to them
to go back to work.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said to Walker, &quot;I'll call a meeting to-night
and put the case as you have said, and ask them to go back.
But mind, you've not to go back on your promise. You'll
have to start Andrew and Geordie within twa days, or the
men will no' continue to work. Mind, I'm taking a lot on myself
to do this, and you'll have to carry out your part and
start them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll fill my part, never fear,&quot; was the answer, and there
was relief in Walker's voice. &quot;See, there's my hand,&quot; he
said, extending a big black limb as he spoke, first spitting on
his palm to ensure due solemnity. &quot;There's no dryness about
that, Jamie. I mean it. I'll start Geordie and Andrew all
right. You get the men to go back to work to-morrow, for
I'm afraid Rundell will make trouble if you remain idle
anither day. Noo' I promise.&quot; And Jamie took the extended
hand in token of the bargain and returned to summon the
meeting, which was duly held, and, as Walker had anticipated,
the men were appeased, and returned to work the next
day.</p>

<p>Sure enough, within two days Andrew Marshall and Geordie
Sinclair were both started to work, and matters went smoothly
for a time.</p>

<p>But though they had had a lesson, it did not stop their
activities as agitators for the establishment of a union, for
they knew that there was no protection for any of them if
they remained unorganized.</p>

<p>&quot;Men never were meant to work and live as colliers do,&quot;
said Geordie, thoughtfully. &quot;Life should be good, and free,
and happy, with comfort and enjoyment for all. Look at the
birds&mdash;they are happy! So are the flowers, or they wouldn't
look so pleased. God meant a' men and weemin to be glad,
even though they have to work. But hoo' the hell can folk be
happy and worship God on two and sixpence a day? It's all
wrong, Andrew, an' I'll never believe that men were meant
to live as we live.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true, Geordie,&quot; agreed Andrew soberly. &quot;I only
wish we could get everybody to see it as we see it. There's
plenty for a' God's creatures&mdash;enough to make everybody happy,
an' there need be no ill-will in the world, if only common-sense
was applied to things; but I'm damn'd if I can see
where even the men can be happy who are making their money
oot o' our lives. They're bound to ken surely that what comes
from misery can not make happiness for them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True, Andrew, true, and we maun just go on working for
it. Sometimes I have the feeling that we are on the point
of big changes: just as if the folk would awaken up oot o'
their ignorance, with love in their hearts, an' make all things
right for everybody. A world o' happiness for everybody is
worth workin' for. So we maun gang on.&quot;</p>

<p>And so they talked of their dreams and felt the better for it.</p>

<h2>A YOUNG REBEL</h2>


<p>About two years after these events little Robert Sinclair
went to school. It was a fine morning in late
spring, and Robert trudged the seemingly long road,
clasping an elder brother's hand, for the school lay about a
mile to the north-west of the village, and that seemed to the
boy a very long way.</p>

<p>It was a great experience. Robert's clothes had been well
patched, his face had been washed and toweled till it shone,
his eyes sparkled with excitement, and his heart beat high;
yet he was nervous and awed, wondering what he would find
there.</p>

<p>&quot;By crikey,&quot; said wee Alec Johnstone to him, &quot;wait till
auld Clapper gie's ye a biff or twa wi' his muckle tawse. Do
ye ken what he does to mak' them nippy? He burns them a
wee bit in the fire, an' then st'eeps them in whusky. An'
they're awful sair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but I ken what to do, Rab, if ye want to diddle him,&quot;
put in another boy. &quot;Just get a horse's hair&mdash;a lang yin oot
o' its tail&mdash;and put it across yer haun', an' it'll cut his tawse
in twa, whenever he gie's ye a pammy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I'm gaun to do, Jamie,&quot; replied another. &quot;I'll
get some hairs frae Willie Rogerson. He's gettin' me some
frae his father's when he's in the stable the morn, an' ye'll see
auld Cabbage-heid's tawse gaun in twa, whenever he gie's me
yin.&quot; And they all looked admiringly at this little hero who
was going to do this wonderful thing so simply.</p>

<p>&quot;I got four yesterday,&quot; said another, &quot;an' I wasna' doin'
onything. By criffens! it was sair, an' gin I had only had a
horse's hair, I'd soon ha'e putten his tawse oot the road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I got four yesterday too,&quot; said another, &quot;an' a' because
I was looking at yon new laddie wha cam to the schule yesterday.
By! they were sair. I never heard auld Cabbage-heid
till he cam up an' telt me to put oot my haun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Peter Rundell's his name,&quot; chimed in another. &quot;He's
the Boss's laddie. My! if you just saw what fine claes he
has on. A new suit, an' lang stockings, an' a pair o' fine new
buits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' a white collar too,&quot; said another, &quot;an' hundreds
o' pooches in his jacket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has a waistcoat wi' three pooches in it&mdash;yin for a
watch&mdash;an' a braw, black, shiny bonnet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He had a white hankey too, an' sweeties in yin o' his
pooches.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert felt a certain amount of resentment as he listened
to the description, and he grudged Peter Rundell his new suit
for he himself had never known anything of that kind, but
had always worn &quot;make-downs&quot; created by his mother's
clever fingers out of the discarded clothes of grown-ups.</p>

<p>&quot;Auld Cabbage-heid didna' like me looking at Peter Rundell
an' that's the way he gied me four, but I'll get a horse's
hair too, an' his tawse 'll soon get wheegh. He's awful cruel,
Rab,&quot; he said, turning to Robert, &quot;an' ye'd better look oot.&quot;</p>

<p>Each and all had some fearful story to tell of the cruelty
of the headmaster, and all swore they'd get even with him.
These stories filled Robert with a certain fear, for he was
an imaginative and sensitive boy. Still he knew there was
no escape. He must go to school and go through with it whatever
the future might hold for him.</p>

<p>So far he had grown wild and free, and loved the broad wide
moor which began even at the end of the row where he lived.
It seemed to him that there never had been a time when he
did not know that there was a moor there. Nothing in it surprised
him, even as a child. Its varied moods were already understood
by him, and its silences and its many voices appealed
to and were balm to his soul. The great blue hills
which fringed it away in the far distance were for him the
ends of the world, and if he could go there some day, he would
surely look over and find&mdash;what? The thought staggered him,
and his imagination would not, or could not, construct for him
what was at the other side. All day, often, he had lain stretched
full length upon the moor, watching the great white clouds
sailing past, seeing himself sometimes sitting astride them,
proudly surveying, like God, the whole world. At times it
was so real that he bounded to his feet when by some misadventure
he slipped from the back of the cloud. He listened
to the songs of larks, the cries of curlews and lapwings and all
the other moorland birds, and became as familiar with each of
them as they were with one another.</p>

<p>But this going to school was a break in his freedom, and it
stirred him strangely. He felt already that he would rather
not go to school. He had always been happy before, and he
did not know what lay ahead.</p>

<p>In the schoolroom that morning, Robert was called out by
the headmistress to her desk, and while she was jotting down
in her register particulars as to his age, etc., it happened that
Peter Rundell was also on the floor. Robert looked so wonderingly
at the white collar and the shining boots, that Rundell,
to fill in the blanks and keep himself cheerful, promptly put
out his tongue. Robert, not to be behind in respectfulness,
just as promptly put out his, at the same time making a
grimace, and immediately they were at it, pummeling each
other in hearty glee before the teacher could do anything to
prevent them. It was their first fight. The whole class was in
immediate uproar and cries of&mdash;&quot;Go on, Rob!&quot; and &quot;Good
Peter!&quot; were ringing out, as the supporters on either side
shouted encouragement. Both went at it and for a couple of
minutes defied the efforts of the teacher to separate them; but
in response to calls for help, Mr. Clapper, the headmaster,
came in, and taking hold of Robert soon had him across his
knee, and was giving him a taste of the &quot;tawse&quot; he had heard
so much about that morning, and Robert went back to his seat
very sore, both physically and mentally, and crying in pain
and anger. Thus his first day began at school, and the succeeding
months were full of many such incidents.</p>

<p>Life ran along in the ordinary ruts for three or four years,
but always Peter and Robert were antagonists. If Rundell
happened to get to the top of the class, Robert never rested
till he had excelled and displaced him; and then it was Peter's
turn to do likewise till he too succeeded.</p>

<p>Robert, when in the mood, was eager and brilliant, and
nothing seemed able to stay him. At times, however, he was
given to dreaming, and lived through whole days in the classroom
quite unconscious of what was going on around him.
He worked mechanically, living in a strange world of his own
creation, usually waking up to find himself at the foot of the
class with Peter smiling at the top.</p>

<p>Often he went hungry, for times were still hard, and the
family had increased to six. It was a bitter struggle in which
Mrs. Sinclair was engaged to try and feed&mdash;let alone clothe&mdash;her
hungry children. Patient, plodding, and terrible self-sacrifices
alone enabled her to accomplish what she did. It
was always a question of getting sufficient food rather than
aiming at any particular kind. It was quantity rather than
quality that was her biggest problem, for the children had
sharp appetites and could make a feast of the simplest material.
A pot of potatoes, boiled with their &quot;jackets&quot; on, tumbled
on to the center of the bare, uncovered table and a little
salt placed in small heaps at the exact position where each
person sat, a large bowl of butter-milk when it could be got,
with a tablespoon for each with which to lift a spoonful of the
milk, and thus was set the banquet of the miner's family.</p>

<p>&quot;Mither, Rob's taken twa sups of milk to yae bite o' tattie,&quot;
little Mary would say.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' what did you do?&quot; Robert would reply. &quot;When
you thought naebody was lookin', you took three spoonfu' to
yae wee tattie. I was watchin' you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now that'll do,&quot; the mother would admonish them. &quot;Try
and make it gang as far as ye can. Here you!&quot; she would
raise her voice to another, &quot;dinna be so greedy on it. The rest
maun get some too.&quot; At this the guilty child would frown
and look ashamed at being caught taking more than his
share.</p>

<p>Robert's dreams, however, were always satisfying, and even
the sordid surroundings of the home were gilded by the warmth
and glow of his imagination. Some day, somewhere he seemed
to feel, there was a place for him to fill in the hearts of men.
Vague stirrings told him of great future events which no one
could dominate, save the soul that filled his body.</p>

<p>One day, during the dinner hour, when the school children
were all at play, Robert and Peter again came into conflict.
Some girls were playing at a ring game, and Robert and a few
other boys were shamefacedly looking on. He was by this
time at the bashful age of ten, and already the sweet, shy
face of Mysie Maitland had become familiar in every dream.
Mysie's modesty and grace appealed to him and the strange
magnetic power of soul for soul was continually drawing them
together, even at this early age. No voice was like Mysie's
voice, no name like her name to him. If only she chanced
shyly to ask if he had a spare piece of pencil Robert was
happy; he'd gladly give her his only piece and forthwith proceed
to borrow another for himself. He saw that Mysie did
certain things, used, for instance, to clean her slate with a bit
of rag, and he instantly procured one, and this kept his jacket
sleeve clean and whole.</p>

<p>
&quot;Choose, choose wha' ye'll tak',<br />
Wha' ye'll tak', wha' ye'll tak',<br />
Choose, choose wha' ye'll tak',<br />
A laddie or a lassie.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>So sang the girls, as with hands joined they walked round
in a ring, with Mysie, blushing and sweet, standing in the
center&mdash;a sweet, shy, little rosebud&mdash;a joy in a cheap cotton
frock.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Mysie,&quot; urged the girls, who had now come to a
standstill with the finish of the song. &quot;Choose an' dinna keep
us waiting.&quot; But Mysie stood still, her little heart beating
at a terrible rate, her breath coming in short, quick gasps, and
a soft, glowing light of nervous intensity in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come on, Mysie Maitland,&quot; cried one girl in hurt
tones, &quot;choose an' dinna spoil the game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; urged another, &quot;the whistle will be blawn the
noo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's feart,&quot; said one, &quot;an' she disna need, for we a' ken
that she wants to choose Bob Sinclair.&quot;</p>

<p>Something sang uproariously in Bob's ears at this blunt
way of stating what they all felt; a hot wave surged
over him, and his whole being seemed to fill with the
energy of a giant. He shifted uneasily, his senses all acutely
alert to pick up even Mysie's faint gasp of shame, as the hot
blood suffused her face. Would she choose him before all
these others? He hoped she wouldn't, and he tried to summon
a smile to hide his uneasiness. Still Mysie hesitated. She
wanted to choose Robert, but if she did, perhaps the other
boys and girls would tease them afterwards.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come on, Mysie. It's no' fair,&quot; cried one of the girls,
getting more and more impatient. &quot;Choose an' be done wi' it.
It's only a game.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus urged Mysie stepped forward, and, excited out of all
judgment, her face covered with shame, her heart thumping
and galloping, she grabbed the first hand she saw, which happened
to be Peter Rundell's, and something seemed to darken
the day for all. Robert, now that he had not been chosen,
felt murder in his heart. His body felt charged with energy,
a flood of passion poured over him and he lost all discretion.
He saw only Peter's shining collar, his fine boots and good
clothes, and above all the smile, half of shame, half of triumph,
upon his face. In passing Peter staggered against
Robert, who let drive with his fist, and there was a fight
before anyone really knew what had happened.</p>

<p>&quot;What are ye shovin' at? Can ye no' watch folk's toes?&quot;
And he was on Peter like a whirlwind. There was the hatred
of years between them, and they pummeled each other
heartily.</p>

<p>&quot;A fight, boys!&quot; yelled the others. &quot;Here's a fight!&quot; and
a crowd rapidly gathered to watch operations, while little
Mysie, who had been the cause of it all, shrank back into a
quiet corner, the tears running from her eyes and a sore pain
at her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on, Bob! Gi'e him a jelly yin,&quot; cried Bob's supporters.</p>

<p>&quot;Watch for his nose, Peter,&quot; cried those who pinned their
faith to the coal-owner's son. Amid a chorus of such encouragement,
both boys belabored each other and fought like
barbarians.</p>

<p>&quot;Let up, Peter,&quot; cried Bob's admirers, &quot;an' gi'e him fair
doo,&quot; as the two rolled upon the ground, with Peter, who was
much the bigger boy, on top. &quot;Come on now, he let you up
when you was doon,&quot; and so they kept the balance of fair
play. But the fight raged on in a terrible fury of battle, sometimes
one boy on top, sometimes the other. Bob was the
more active of the two, and hardier, and what he lacked in
weight he made up in speed. One of Peter's eyes was bruised,
while Robert's lip was swelling, and each strained to plant the
decisive blow that would end the fight.</p>

<p>&quot;Nae kickin', Peter! Ye're bate,&quot; yelled one watchful supporter
of Bob, as he noticed the former's booted foot come
into violent contact with Bobbie's bare leg.</p>

<p>&quot;Big cowardie!&quot; cried another, as Peter, crying now with
rage and vexation, hit out with his foot. &quot;Fight fair an' nae
kickin'!&quot;</p>

<p>Bob managed to dodge the kick, and flinging himself in before
Peter recovered his balance, planted a heavy blow upon
his opponent's nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Ho! a jelly yin! a jelly yin!&quot; roared the crowd in admiration.
&quot;Gi'e him anither yin,&quot; and even Peter's supporters
began to desert him. Bob, thus encouraged, laid about him
with all the strengthened &quot;morale&quot; of a conscious victor, finding
it comparatively easy now to hit hard&mdash;and often. Peter,
blinded by tears and choking with passion, could not see, but
struck aimlessly, till one resounding smack upon his already
injured nose brought the eagerly looked for crimson blood
from it, and that of course, in schoolboy etiquette, meant the
end of the fight. Peter was now lying upon the ground, his
handkerchief at his nose, and roaring like a bull, not so much
because of his injured nose, as because of the hurt to his pride
and vanity.</p>

<p>&quot;Haud back yer held,&quot; advised one boy, &quot;an' put something
cauld doon yer back.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly there was silence, and everyone looked awed and
shamefaced as Mr. Clapper, the headmaster, strode into the
midst of them. He had heard the noise of the fight, and had
stolen up unobserved just in time to see Peter get the knockout
blow.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; he demanded sternly, his
eyes traveling all over the children, till they rested finally on
Robert. No one answered, and so he proceeded to question
Peter, who had struggled to his feet. Peter, like many other
boys in similar circumstances, poured forth a great indictment
of his adversary, and Mr. Clapper then turned to Robert.</p>

<p>&quot;What have you to say, Sinclair?&quot; he asked. &quot;Speak out,
and give me your side.&quot;</p>

<p>But Robert said nothing. His rebellious spirit was roused,
and he resented the tone of the headmaster's voice. Again
Mr. Clapper tried, but Robert remained silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Come now, tell me what led to the fight? Why were you
fighting with Peter?&quot;</p>

<p>Robert would not speak, and Mr. Clapper, being of an explosive
temperament, with little tact, was fast losing his temper.
He turned to question some of the other boys, finally
calling them all into the school, and putting Robert into the
teacher's room, so that he might &quot;get to the bottom of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Clapper, whatever good points he may have possessed,
was not at all fitted for the teaching profession, for he lacked
the sympathy necessary in dealing with children, and he was
a rigid believer in the doctrine of punishment.</p>

<p>After a time he came into the room where Robert sat, and
began once more to question him. But Robert was still obdurate,
and stolidly kept silent. Mr. Clapper recognized at
once that this was a clear case of a dour nature in the wrong.
It needed correction, and that of a severe kind. That
spirit he felt must be broken, or there would be trouble
ahead in after years for Robert Sinclair. Mr. Clapper was
determined to do his duty, and he believed that Robert in
later life would probably feel grateful for this thrashing. He
thrashed the boy soundly and severely upon the most sensitive
parts of his body, so that the pain would help to break his
spirit. He saw no indignity heaped upon a high-spirited,
sensitive soul. It was all for the boy's own good, and so the
blows fell thick and heavy upon the little back and hips.</p>

<p>Robert bit his lip to repress the roar of pain that wanted
to escape. He would not cry, and this was another spur to
the efforts of Mr. Clapper. The boy's flesh twitched and
quivered at every blow, yet never a cry came from him. It
but served to feed his rebellion, and he struggled and fought
with fury until completely exhausted.</p>

<p>&quot;There now,&quot; declared Mr. Clapper, flinging down the
&quot;tawse&quot; upon the table, panting from his exertions and wiping
his brow, &quot;I shall leave you for a time until you decide to
speak. If you will not speak when I return, I shall thrash
you again,&quot; and he went out, locking the door, leaving the
boy, still proud and unsubdued, but aching in every muscle
and bone of his little body.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Robert very nearly cried, but he dashed
the gathering tears from his eyes, angry at the weakness, and
resolved, as he adjusted his garments, that he would die rather
than speak now. He looked round, and seeing the window
raised a little from the bottom, sprang to it, a sudden resolve
in his heart to run away. Just as he got astride the sill he
spied a piece of chalk and the &quot;tawse&quot; on the table, so turning
back he put the &quot;tawse&quot; in his pocket, and with the chalk
wrote on the table:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You are an ould pig and I'll not speak, and you'll never
put your hands on your tawse again.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he was out of the window, dropped easily to the
ground, and was away to the moors. He ran a long way, until
finding that he had not been detected, he skirted a small wood,
dug a hole in the soft moss, put in the &quot;tawse,&quot; and covered
them up. There they may be lying to this day, for no one
ever learned from him where they were buried.</p>

<p>The spell of the moor took possession of him, and his
wounded soul was soon wrapped in the soft folds of its silence.
The balm of its peace comforted him, and brought ease and
calmed the rebellion in his blood. He was happy, forgetting
that there ever had existed a schoolmaster, or anything else
unpleasant. Here he was free, and no one ever misunderstood
him. He gave pain to no one, and nothing ever hurt him
here.</p>

<p>He flung himself down among the rank gray grass and
heather, while the moor cock called to his mate in an agony of
pleading passion, the lapwing crooned upon a tuft of grass
as she prepared a place for her eggs, the whaup wheepled and
twirled and cried in eerie alarm, the plover sighed to a low
white cloud wandering past; while the snipe and the lark, the
&quot;mossie,&quot; the heather lintie, and the wandering, sighing winds
among the reeds and rushes of the swampy moss, all added
their notes to soothe and satisfy the little wounded spirit lying
there on the soft moorland. Already he was away upon the
wings of fancy in a world of his own&mdash;a world full of dreams
and joys unspeakable; a world of calm comfort, where there
was no pain, no hunger, no unpleasantness; a world of smiles
and warm delights and love.</p>

<p>Thus he dreamed as he watched the white clouds trailing
their draperies along the sky, till the shadows creeping over
the hills, and the cries of the heron returning to his haunts in
the moor, woke him to a realization of the fact that the school
was long since out, and probably another thrashing awaited
him when he got home. Sadly and regretfully he dragged his
little aching body from its soft mossy bed, felt that his limbs
were still sore, and that he was very, very hungry. Rebellion
again surging within him as he remembered all, he trudged
home, fearful yet proud, resolved to go through with the inevitable.</p>

<h2>BLACK JOCK'S THREAT</h2>


<p>That same day Walker intimated to Geordie, when he
was at work underground, that a reduction was to be
imposed on his ton rate, which meant for Sinclair that
it would be more difficult to earn a decent wage. Geordie had
always had it in his head to confront Walker about his very
unfair treatment of him, and on this occasion he decided to
do so.</p>

<p>&quot;What way are you breakin' my rate?&quot; he asked, when
Walker told him of the reduction.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's no' me,&quot; replied Walker. &quot;It's Rundell. He thinks
it can be worked for less than it's takin', and, of course, I've
just to do as I am tell'd.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, I don't ken,&quot; said Geordie. &quot;But I've thocht for
a lang while back that you had a hand in it. Have I done
anything to ye, for I don't ken o' it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ye've never done me any harm, Geordie,&quot; replied Walker
with a show of sincerity. &quot;What mak's ye think that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, for a lang time noo', I've ay been kept in hard
places, or places wi' nae air, or where there was water to contend
wi'. There's ay been something, an' I ha'e come to the
conclusion that there's mair design than accident in it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna think so,&quot; was the reply. &quot;But maybe it's because
you're ay agitatin' to have a union started.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' what about it,&quot; enquired Geordie, getting a bit heated.
&quot;If I ha'e been advocatin' the startin' o' a union? It seems
to me to be muckle needed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I've nothing to say aboot it,&quot; replied Walker. &quot;It's
the boss, an' I was merely givin' ye a hint for yer ain guid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a' richt,&quot; exclaimed Geordie, getting still more heated.
&quot;I can see as far through a brick wall as you can see through
a whin dyke. The boss has naething to do wi' it. It's you,
an' I'm quite pleased to get the chance to tell ye to yer face.
Ye could, many a time, ha'e given me a better place, if you
had cared. But let me tell you, if there was a union here, it
would soon put an end to you an' yer damn'd cantraips.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very weel. Gang on an' start yin. Man, though ye were
a' in a union the morn, I could buy an' sell the majority of
them for the promise of a guid place, or a bottle of whisky&mdash;Ay,
if they jist thocht they were in wi' the gaffer, I'd get all
I wanted frae the maist o' them. A clap on the shoulder,
a smile, or even a word would do it. The one hauf o' the men
can ay be got to sell the ither. Ye daurna' cheep, man, but
I hear of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Damn'd fine I ken that,&quot; replied Geordie, &quot;an' it's mair the
peety. But that's no' to say that men'll ay be like that. If
they'd be true an' stick to yin anither, they'd damn'd soon
put an end to sic gaffers as you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe ye'll be the first to be put an end to,&quot; said Walker,
rising to leave. &quot;I might ha'e something to say to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You rotten pestilence o' hell,&quot; cried Geordie, now fairly
roused, and jumping over the coals on the &quot;roadhead&quot; after
him. &quot;I'll cleave the rotten heart o' ye if I get my fingers
on ye, you an' yer fancy women, yer gamblin' an' yer shebeens!&quot;</p>

<p>But Walker was off; he did not like to hear these matters
of his private life mentioned, and so Geordie, left to himself,
lit his pipe, and sat down to cool his temper.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Matthew Maitland came round to borrow
a shot of powder, and Geordie unburdened his mind to
him.</p>

<p>&quot;He's a dirty brute,&quot; said Matthew, &quot;an' it's time we had
a union started. I hear great stories aboot how Bob Smillie's
gettin' on wi' the union that he started doon the west country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ken Bob fine,&quot; said Geordie. &quot;He's a fine fellow. I
worked next wall to him doon there a while, an' a better chap
ye couldna' get.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hear that he's gotten as muckle as tippence on the ton
to some o' the miners who ha'e joined. I'm gaun to join whenever
it can be started.&quot;</p>

<p>Geordie agreed that it would be good to have a union, but
he knew that whoever led in the matter would very likely have
to pay for his courage. There was the &quot;Block&quot; to consider,
and he could not see how they might start a union just then
in such hard times.</p>

<p>He sat and thought after Matthew had gone away, and
was still sitting when Matthew's shot went off. His lot, he
knew, was hard. He could not afford to &quot;flit,&quot; even though
he did find work somewhere else. His six children depended
upon his readiness to swallow insult and injustice, and he
could see no way but to submit. If only his first boy were
ready for work, it would soon make a difference in the house.
It was only a few months now till that time would come, and
perhaps things might change.</p>

<p>All day he was sullen and angry, and he tore at his work
like some imprisoned fiend, a great rebellion in his heart,
and a fury of anger consuming him. Everything seemed to
go wrong that day, and at last when &quot;knock-off&quot; time came, he
felt a little easier, though still silent and angry. His last
shot, however, missed fire, just as he was coming away home;
and that, added to all the other things that day, made him feel
that his whole life was clouded, and was one long trial.</p>

<p>On the way home from the pit he heard the story of Robert's
rebellious outburst at school, and when he came into the house
his wife saw by his face that something had upset him. She
proceeded to get him water to wash himself, and brought in
the tub, while he divested himself of his clothes, flinging each
garment savagely into the corner, until he stood naked save
for his trousers. Most miners are sensitive to the presence of
strangers during this operation, and it so happened at that
particular time the minister chose to pay one of his rare visits
among his flock in the village.</p>

<p>&quot;Wha the hell's this noo?&quot; asked Geordie, when he heard
the tap at the door, as he looked up through soapy eyes, his
head all lathered with the black suds. &quot;Dammit, they micht
let folk get washed,&quot; he said angrily.</p>

<p>When he heard the voice of the minister, he plunged his
head into the tub, and began splashing and rubbing, and lifting
the water over his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you are busy washing, I see, Mr. Sinclair,&quot; observed
the minister, looking at the naked collier.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Geordie shortly, &quot;an' I dinna think you'd ha'e
thankit me for comin' in on the tap o' you, when you were
washin' yerself,&quot; he said bluntly&mdash;a remark which his wife
felt to be a bit ill-natured, though she said nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I am sorry,&quot; replied the minister. &quot;I did not mean to
intrude. I'll not stay, but will call back some other time,&quot;
and his voice was apologetic and ill at ease.</p>

<p>&quot;I think sae,&quot; retorted Geordie, splashing away and spitting
the soap from his mouth. &quot;Yer room's mair to my taste than
yer company the noo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My! that was an awfu' way to talk to the meenister,&quot; said
Mrs. Sinclair when the door was again closed. &quot;You micht
aye try to be civil to folk,&quot; and there was resentment in her
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, dammit, wha can be bothered wi' thae kind o' folk
yapping roun' about when yer washin' yerself. He micht ken
no' to come at this time, when men are comin' hame frae their
work,&quot; and he went on with his splashing. &quot;Here, gi'e my
back a rub,&quot; and he lay over the tub while she washed his
back from the shoulders downward, making it clean and free
from the coal dust and grime. Then she proceeded to dry
him all over with a rough towel, after which he put on a clean
shirt, and taking off his pit trousers, stepped into the tub and
began to wash his lower limbs and make them as clean as the
upper part of the body.</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, folk should ha'e a place to wash in anyway,&quot; he
grumbled, as if to justify his outburst, for secretly he was
beginning to feel ashamed of it. &quot;The folk that ha'e the
maist need o' a bath are the folk wha never get the chance
o' yin,&quot; he went on. &quot;Look at that chap wha was in the noo.
He never needs to dirty a finger, an' look at the hoose he has
to bide in, wi' its fine bathroom an' a' things that he needs.
Och, but we are a silly lot o' blockheads!&quot; And so he raved
on till he sat down to his frugal dinner of potatoes and buttermilk,
after which he relapsed into silence again, and sat reading
a newspaper.</p>

<p>It was in this mood that Robert found him when he returned
from the moors. Nellie had noticed that something was
worrying her husband, and she suspected some fresh trouble
at the pit, though she asked no questions.</p>

<p>&quot;Where hae ye been?&quot; asked Geordie very calmly, as Robert
entered furtively, and sat down on a chair near to the door.
The boy did not answer. He dreaded that calmness. He
seemed to feel there was something strong, cruel and relentless
behind it. But he had something of his father's nature in
him, so he sat in silence.</p>

<p>&quot;What kind o' conduct's this I hear ye've been up to?&quot; was
the next question, with the same studied calm, seemingly passionless
and pliable. Still no answer from the boy, though
when he looked at his father he felt afraid. He turned his
eyes appealingly to his mother, but her face betrayed nothing,
and a feeling of hopelessness entered Robert's heart. There
was nothing else but to go through with it.</p>

<p>&quot;Tak' aff yer claes,&quot; quietly commanded the father, and the
boy reluctantly began to peel off his scanty garments one by
one, till he stood naked on the bare floor. He was glad that
no one except the baby was in to see his humiliation, his
brothers and sisters being all out at play.</p>

<p>The father rose and went to the corner where his working
clothes lay in a heap. Selecting the belt he wore round his
waist at his work, he grasped it firmly, and with the other
hand took the boy by one arm, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Are ye going to answer my question noo', and tell me where
ye ha'e been?&quot;</p>

<p>But Robert did not answer, so down came the hard leather
belt with a horrible crack across the naked little hips, and a
thick red mark appeared where the blow had fallen. A roar
of pain broke from the boy's lips, in spite of his resolution
not to cry, as lash after lash fell upon his limbs and across
the little white back. Horribly, cruelly, relentlessly the belt
fell with sickening regularity, while the tender flesh quivered
at every blow, and an ugly series of red stripes appeared along
the back and down across the sturdy legs.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dinna' hit me ony mair, faither,&quot; he pleaded at last,
the firm resolution breaking because of the pain of the blows.
&quot;Oh, dinna hit me!&quot; and he jumped as the blows fell without
slackening. &quot;Oh, oh, oh! Mother, dinna' let him hit me ony
mair!&quot; roared the boy, while the grim, set face of the parent
never relaxed, and the belt continued to lash the quivering
flesh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair, who by this time was crying too, feeling every
blow in her mother-heart, began to fear this grim, cruel look
on her husband's face. He was mad, she felt, and there was
murder in his eyes; and at last, spurred to desperation, she
jumped forward, tore at the belt with desperate strength, and
flung it into the corner, crying, as she gripped the boy in her
arms.</p>

<p>&quot;In the name of Heaven, Geordie, are ye gaun to kill my
bairn afore my een?&quot;</p>

<p>She tore the boy fiercely from his father's grasp and shielded
him from her husband, exclaiming at the same time with indignation,
&quot;Ha'e ye nae humanity aboot ye at a'? Hit me
if ye are goin' to hit any more. It's murder, an' I'll no' stand
ony longer an' let ye do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Geordie, surprised and amazed at her action, and the fierceness
in her voice, looked up, and immediately reason seemed
to steal back into his mind. A flush of shame overspread his
face, and he sat down, burying his face in his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Wheesht, sonny. Wheesht, my wee man,&quot; crooned the
mother soothingly, as she began to help Robert to get on his
clothes, the tears falling still from her own eyes, as she saw
the ugly stripes and bruises upon his back beginning to discolor.
&quot;Wheesht, sonny! Dinna' greet ony mair. There
noo', my wee son. Daddy's no' weel the nicht,&quot; she excused,
&quot;an' didna' ken what he was doin'.&quot; Then breaking into a
louder tone: &quot;I wonder what in Heaven's name puir folk are
born for at a'. There noo'. There noo'. Dinna greet, my
wee man, an' mither'll gi'e ye yer denner.&quot;</p>

<p>Sinclair could stand it no longer, so slipping on his boots
and reaching for his cap, he went out, never in all his life
feeling more ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>Left to themselves&mdash;for all the other children were still out
at play&mdash;Nellie soon had Robert quietened and sitting at his
dinner of cold potatoes and buttermilk. Bit by bit she drew
from him the story of the fight at school; divining for herself
the reason for Robert's attack upon Peter Rundell, she soon
was in possession of the whole story with its termination of
revolt against the headmaster and even the confession of what
he had written on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;An' what did ye do wi' the tawse, son?&quot; she enquired, her
dark eyes showing pride in the revolt of her laddie. She was
proud to know that he had sufficient character to stand up to
a bully, even though he were a headmaster.</p>

<p>&quot;I buried them in the muir,&quot; he replied simply, &quot;but I dinna'
want to tell naebody where they are. I'll never gi'e them
back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, weel, if ye dinna' want to tell me, dinna' do it,&quot; she
said. &quot;I'll gang with ye to the school the morn, an' I'll see
that ye're no' meddled wi'. But, Robin, while I like to see
ye staunin' up against what is wrong, I dinna want ye to dae
wrang yerself. An' I think ye was in the wrang to strike
Peter. He staggered against ye, an' I dinna think he wad try
to tramp on yer taes. An' always when ye're in the wrang,
own up to it, an' make what amends ye can.&quot;</p>

<p>Robin did not reply to this, but she could see that he knew
she was right. Before he could say anything she added,
&quot;Come awa' noo', if ye ha'e gotten yer denner, son, I think
ye should gang awa' to yer bed. Ye'll be the better o' a lang
sleep. Dinna' think hard o' yer faither; he's feelin' ashamed
o' hittin' ye. There must be something botherin' him, for I
dinna' mind o' him ever leatherin' one o' ye like that.&quot;</p>

<p>This was true, for Geordie Sinclair was rather a &quot;cannie&quot;
man, and had never been given to beating his children before.
She felt that something had happened in the pit, and whatever
it was it had made her husband angry.</p>

<p>Robert again stripped off his clothes and crept into bed,
while his mother seemed to feel every pain once more as she
looked upon the soft little body with the ugly black stripes
upon it. She placed him under the rough blankets as snugly
as possible, telling him to lie well over near to the wall, for
there were five of them now who lay abreast, and there was
never too much room. He was soon asleep, and Mrs. Sinclair
put fresh coals on the fire, and began to tidy up, so as to have
everything as cheerful as possible when her husband should
return. It was no easy matter to keep a house clean, with
only a single apartment, and eight individuals living in it.</p>

<p>The housing conditions in most mining villages of Scotland
are an outrage on decency. In Lowwood there were no sanitary
conveniences of any kind, and it was a difficult matter for
the women folk to keep a tidy house under these circumstances.
But it was wonderful, the homeliness and comfort found in
those single apartment houses. It was home, and that made
it tolerable. In such homes fine men and women were bred
and reared, but the credit was due entirely to our womenfolk;
for they had the fashioning of the spirit of the homes, and
the spirit of the homes is always the spirit of the people.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h2>THE COMING OF A PROPHET</h2>


<p>Another year passed, and Robert was now eleven
years of age. Though full of hardship, hunger and
poverty, yet they were not altogether unhappy years
for him. There were joys which he would not have liked to
have missed, and in later life he looked back upon them always
through a mist of memory that sometimes bordered on tears.</p>

<p>He had grown &quot;in wisdom and stature,&quot; and gave promise
of being a fine sturdy boy; but lately it had been borne in
upon him that no one seemed just to look at things from his
point of view. He was alluded to as &quot;a strange laddie,&quot; and
the gulf of misunderstanding seemed to grow wider every day.
Old Granny Frame, the &quot;howdie-wife&quot; of the village, always
declared that he would be a great man, but others just took
it for granted that he would never see things as they saw them.</p>

<p>He was already too serious for a boy, and his joys were not
the joys of other children. Sensitive, and in a measure
proudly reserved, he took more and more to the moors and the
hills. All day sometimes he roved over them, and at other
times he would lie motionless but happy, for the moor always
understood. If he were hurt at anything which happened,
the moor brought him solace; if he grieved, it gave him relief;
and if he were happy, it too rejoiced. He loved it in all moods,
and he could not understand how its loving silence was
dreaded by others.</p>

<p>His parents now found that their battle, though not much
easier, certainly was no worse, and hope shone bright for them
in the future. The oldest boy was already at work and one
girl was away &quot;in service.&quot; Robert, too, would soon be ready,
and in quick succession behind him there were three other boys.
Geordie Sinclair was often told by his workmates that he
would &quot;soon ha'e naethin' to do but put in wicks in the pit
lamps.&quot; But Geordie merely smiled. How often before had
he heard that said of others who had families like his own
and he knew that he would never see them all working. Fifty
years was a long time to live for a collier in those days of
badly ventilated and poorly inspected pits and many men
were in their graves at forty.</p>

<p>Walker still indulged in petty persecution, whilst Geordie
agitated for the starting of a union, and many a battle the
two had, until the enmity between them developed into keen
hatred.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what Black Jock really has against me,&quot; he had
said over and over again, unable to understand his persistent
hostility, but his wife had never dared tell him.</p>

<p>One night, however, after he had been out of work a week,
because, as Black Jock had said, &quot;there was nae places,&quot; she
decided to tell him the real reason of Walker's antipathy.</p>

<p>&quot;Man, it's no' you, Geordie, that Black Jock has the ill will
at,&quot; she ventured to say, &quot;it's me, an' he hits me an' the bairns
through you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You,&quot; said Geordie in some surprise, &quot;hoo' can that be?&quot;</p>

<p>Bit by bit, though with great reluctance, she told her husband
how and when Black Jock had attempted to degrade
her. When she had ended, he sat in grim silence, while the
ticking of the clock seemed to have gained in loudness, and so,
too, the purring of the cat, as it rubbed itself against his leg,
first on one side and then the other, drawing its sleek, furry
side along his ankle, turning back again, and occasionally
looking up into his face for the recognition which it vainly
tried to win.</p>

<p>The fire burned low in the grate as Nellie busied herself
with washing the dishes; while outside the loud cries of the
children, playing on the green, mingled occasionally with a
clink, as the steel quoits fell upon each other, telling of some
enthusiastic players, who were practicing for the local games.
Loud cries of encouragement broke from the supporters, and
Geordie and Nellie heard all these&mdash;even the plaintive wail
of a child crying in a house a few doors farther up the &quot;row,&quot;
and the mother's attempts to soothe it into forgetfulness of
its temporary pain or disappointment.</p>

<p>The little apartment seemed to have become suddenly cheerless.
Nellie felt the silence most oppressive, for she was wondering
how he was taking it all. Soon, however, he rose and
reached for his cap. Looking at his wife with eyes that set
all her fears at rest&mdash;for she saw pride in them, pride in her
and the way she had acted&mdash;he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank ye, Nellie; ye are a' the woman I always thocht
ye was, an' I'll see that nae dirty brute ever again gets the
chance to insult ye,&quot; and he was out of the door before she
could question him further.</p>

<p>Geordie went straight to where Walker lived and knocked
at the door. A girl of fourteen came in answer to his knock,
for Walker was a widower, his wife having died shortly after
the birth of their only child.</p>

<p>&quot;Is yer faither in?&quot; enquired Geordie quietly, hardly able
to control the raging anger in his heart.</p>

<p>&quot;No, he's no' in,&quot; replied the girl. &quot;Oh, is that you,
Geordie?&quot; she asked, recognizing him in the darkness. &quot;My
father said when he went oot that if ye cam' to the door, I
was to tell ye he had nae places yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a' richt,&quot; said Geordie, still very quietly. &quot;Do ye
ken onything aboot where he is this nicht?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, unless he's up in Sanny Robertson's, or maybe in Peter
Fleming's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank ye,&quot; said Geordie, turning away, &quot;I'll go up an'
see if he is there.&quot;</p>

<p>He knew that Peter Fleming was working that night, and
had stopped on an extra shift to repair a road, by special
instructions from Walker; so Geordie went direct to Fleming's
house and knocked at the door. After an interval a woman's
voice enquired, &quot;Wha's that?&quot; and Geordie thought there
was anxiety in it.</p>

<p>&quot;Open the door,&quot; said Geordie quietly. &quot;What the hell are
ye afert for?&quot; and the woman, thinking it was her husband
returned from work, immediately opened the door.</p>

<p>&quot;You're shairly early,&quot; she said; then suddenly recognizing
who the intruder was, she tried to shut the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Na, na,&quot; said Geordie, now well in the doorway, &quot;I want
to see Black Jock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's no' here,&quot; she lied readily enough, but with some
agitation in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;You're a liar, Jean,&quot; replied Geordie, &quot;that's him gaun
oot at the room door,&quot; and Geordie withdrew hurriedly, determined
that Black Jock should not escape him. He hurried
to the end of the &quot;row,&quot; and waited with all the passion of
long years raging through his whole being. He stepped out
as Walker advanced, and said: &quot;Is that you, Walker?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; came the answer, &quot;what do ye want?&quot; as he came
to a halt.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a meenit,&quot; said Geordie, placing himself in front of
Walker, barring his way. &quot;I want to warm yer dirty hide.
It ought to have been done years ago, but I never kent till
the nicht, and I'm gaun to dae it the noo,&quot; and the tones of
his voice indicated that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! What's wrang?&quot; asked Walker in affected surprise.
&quot;I'll get ye a place,&quot; he went on hurriedly, &quot;just as soon as
I can&mdash;in fac' there's yin that'll be ready by the morn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm no gi'ein' a damn for yer place. It's you I'm efter the
nicht. Come on, face up,&quot; and Sinclair squared himself for
battle.</p>

<p>Thus challenged, Walker, who was like all bullies a coward
at heart, tried to temporize, but Sinclair was in no mood
for delay.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, pit them up, or I'll break yer jaw for you,&quot; he
said threateningly.</p>

<p>&quot;Man, Geordie, what ails ye the nicht?&quot; asked Walker in
hurried alarm, wondering wildly how he could stave off the
chastisement which he knew from Geordie's voice he might
expect. &quot;Talk sensibly, man. Try an' ha'e some sense.
What's the matter wi' ye?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Matter,&quot; echoed Geordie, &quot;jist this. The wife has jist telt
me a' aboot the nicht ye cam' chappin' to the door when I
was lyin' hurt. She kent I'd break yer neck for it, and she
was feart to tell me. So put up yer fists, ye black-hearted
brute that ye are. I'm gaun to gi'e ye what we should hae
gotten seven years syne, an' it'll maybe put ye frae preyin'
on decent women. Come on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Awa', man, Geordie, an' behave yersel',&quot; began Walker,
trying to evade him.</p>

<p>&quot;Tak' that, then, ye dirty brute!&quot; and Geordie smashed
his fist straight between Walker's eyes.</p>

<p>Roused at last, Walker showed fight and swung at Sinclair.
He was the younger man by about two years, and had not had
the hard work and bad conditions of the other, but Sinclair
was a strong man, and was now roused to a great pitch, so
he struck out with terrific force. Then the two closed and
swayed about, struggling, cursing and punching each other
with brutal might. Sinclair's extra weight and more powerful
build soon began to tell, and he was able to send home one
or two heavy blows on Black Jock's face and body. Panting
and blowing, they separated, and as they did so, Sinclair
caught his opponent a straight hard crash on the jaw that
sent him rolling to the muddy road, and feeling as if a thousand
fists had struck him all at once.</p>

<p>Walker lay for a short time, then gathering himself together,
he rose to his feet and set off at a quick pace in the direction
of his house, whilst Geordie, too, turned homewards, feeling
that it was useless to follow him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair did not hear what had happened till a week
later, when Geordie, being in a communicative mood, told her
of the affair in simple, unaffected terms.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards a great event happened in Lowwood,
which made the deepest impression on Robert's mind. His
father still being out of work, had sent a letter to Robert
Smillie, who was then beginning to be heard of more and more
in mining circles. In the letter Geordie explained, to the
best of his ability, the local circumstances, and he mentioned
his own case of persecution, and his agitation for the starting
of a union. Smillie sent word in reply that he would come in
two days, and Geordie enthusiastically set to work to organize
a meeting, going round every house in the district, telling the
folks that Smillie was coming, and exhorting them to turn
out and hear him.</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna think it'll do any guid,&quot; said old Tam Smith, when
Geordie called upon him. &quot;It's a' richt talkin' about a union,
but the mair ye fecht the mair ye're oppressed. The bosses
ha'e the siller, an' they can ay buy the brains to serve them.&quot;</p>

<p>Geordie made no reply, for he knew from experience that
it was only too true.</p>

<p>&quot;Just look at young Jamie Soutar,&quot; continued Tam. &quot;He is
yin o' the cleverest men i' the country. He wrocht wi' me
as a laddie when he went into the pit, an' noo' he's travelin'
manager for that big company doon the west country, an' I'm
telt he's organizin' an' advocatin' the formin' o' what he calls
a Coal Combine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a' richt, Tam. I admit it a', though I dinna jist
ken what a Coal Combine means; but I ken that Bob Smillie
is makin' great wark wi' the union he has formed. I ken he
has gotten rises in wages for a' the men who ha'e joined, an'
that he is advocatin' an eight hours day. If that can be done
doon there, it can be done here; for there's naebody has ony
mair need o' a eight hours day than miners.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'll turn oot a' richt at the meetin',&quot; said Tam, who
was always credited with seeing farther than most of his workmates,
&quot;an' I'll join the union, too, if it's formed; but ye'll
see if ye live lang enough that the union'll no' be a' ye think
it. The ither side will organize to bate ye every time.&quot; And
with this encouraging prophecy, Geordie went on to the next
house.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm no' comin' to nae meetin'. I want naethin' to
dae wi' yer unions. I can get on weel enough without them,&quot;
curtly said Dan Sellars, the inmate. He was what Geordie
somewhat expressively called a &quot;belly-crawler,&quot; a talebearer,
and one who drank and gambled along with Walker, Fleming,
Robertson and a few others.</p>

<p>&quot;Man, it'll no' do muckle guid,&quot; said another, &quot;ye mind
hoo' big Geordie Ritchie ran awa' wi' the money o' the last
union we started? It'll gi'e a wheen bigmouths a guid job
and an easy time. That's a' it will do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ay,&quot; answered Sinclair, &quot;but that's no' to say that
the union'll ay fail. Folks are no' a' Geordie Ritchies, an'
they're no' a' bigmouths either. We're bound to succeed if
we care to be solid thegither.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll come to the meetin', Geordie, although I was sayin'
that, but I'll no' promise to join yer union,&quot; was the answer,
and Sinclair had to be content with that.</p>

<p>Thus went Geordie from house to house, meeting with much
discouragement, and even downright opposition, but he was
always good-humored, and so he seldom failed to extract a
promise to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>The night of the meeting arrived, and the hall&mdash;an old,
badly lit and ill-ventilated wooden erection&mdash;was packed to
its utmost. There were eager faces, and dull, listless ones
among the audience; there were eyes glad with expectancy,
and eyes dulled with long years of privations and brutal labor;
limbs young and supple and full of energy, and limbs stiff and
sore, crooked and maimed.</p>

<p>Geordie Sinclair was chairman, and when he rose to open
the meeting and introduce Smillie, he felt as if the whole
world were looking on and listening.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, men,&quot; he began, halting and hesitating in his utterance,
&quot;for a lang time now there has been much cryin' for a
union here. There has been a lot of persecution gaun' on, an'
it has been lang felt that something should be done. We ha'e
heard of how other men in other places ha'e managed to start
a union, and how it has been a guid thing in risin' wages. Mr.
Smillie has come here the nicht to tell us how the other districts
ha'e made a start, and what thae other districts has
gotten. If it can be done there, it can be done here. I ha'e
wrocht aside Bob Smillie, an' I ken what kind of man he is.
He has done great wark doon in the west country, an' he
is weel fitted and able to be the spokesman for the miners o'
Scotlan'. I'm no gaun' to say ony mair, but I can say
that it gie's me great pleasure to ask Mr. Smillie to address
ye.&quot;</p>

<p>A round of applause greeted Smillie as he rose to address
them. Tall and manly, he dominated his audience from the
very first sentence, rousing them to a great pitch of enthusiasm,
as he proceeded to tell of all the many hardships which miners
had to endure, of the &quot;Block&quot; system of persecution, and to
point to the only means of successfully curing them by organizing
into one solid body, so that they might become powerful
enough to enforce their demands for a fuller, freer, and a
happier life. Never in all his life did he speak with more
passion than he did that night in Lowwood.</p>

<p>Little Robert was present in the hall&mdash;the only child there;
and as Smillie spoke in passionate denunciation of the tyrannies
and persecutions of the mine-owners and their officials, his
little heart leapt in generous indignation. Many things which
he had but dimly understood before, began to be plain to him,
as he sat with eyes riveted upon Smillie's face, drinking in
every word as the speaker plead with the men to unite and
defend themselves. Then, as his father's wrongs were poured
forth from the platform, and as Smillie appealed to them in
powerful sentences to stand loyally by their comrade, the boy
felt he could have followed Smillie anywhere, and that he could
have slain every man who refused to answer that call. Away
beyond the speaker the boy had already glimpsed something
of the ideal which Smillie sketched, and his soul throbbed and
ached to see how simple and how easy it was for life to be
made comfortable and good and pleasant for all. Bob Smillie
never won a truer heart than he did that night in winning
this barefooted, ragged boy's.</p>

<p>Round after round of applause greeted the speaker when
he had finished, and in response to his appeal to them to organize,
a branch of the union was formed, with Geordie Sinclair
as its first president. At the request of the meeting
Smillie interviewed Black Jock next morning, and as a result
Sinclair got started on the following day.</p>

<p>Smillie stayed overnight with Geordie. They were certainly
somewhat cramped for room, though Geordie had just lately
got another apartment &quot;broken through,&quot; which gave them a
room and kitchen.</p>

<p>The two men sat late into the night, discussing their hopes
and plans, and the trade union movement generally.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a great work, Bob, you ha'e set yersel', an' it'll mean
thenklessness an' opposition frae the very men you want maist
to help,&quot; said Sinclair as they talked.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it will,&quot; was the reply, spoken in a half dreamy tone,
as if the speaker saw into the future. &quot;I ken what it'll mean,
but it must be done. I have long had it in me to set myself
this work, for no opposition ought to stand in the way of the
uplifting of the workers. I ... It's the system, Geordie!&quot;
he cried, as if bringing his mind back to the present. &quot;It is
the system that is wrong. It is immoral and evil in its foundations,
and it forces the employers to do the things they do.
Competition compels them to do things they would not have
to do if there were a cooperative system of industry. Our
people have to suffer for it all&mdash;they pay the price in hunger,
misery and suffering.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Geordie, &quot;that's true, Bob. But what a lang
time it'll tak' afore the workers will realize what you are oot
for. They'll look on your work wi' suspicion, and a wheen
o' them'll even oppose you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; was the reply, &quot;I know that. It will mean the slow
building up of our own county first, bit by bit, organizing,
now here, now there, and fighting the other class interests all
the time. It will divide our energies and retard our work,
and the greatest fight will be to get our own people to recognize
what is wanted and how to get it. Then through the
county we'll have to work to consolidate the whole of Scotland;
from that to work in the English and Welsh miners,
while at the same time seeking to permeate other branches
of industrial workers with our ideas. And then, when we
have got that length, and raised the mental vision of our
people, and strengthened their moral outlook, we can appeal
to the workers of other lands to join us in bringing about the
time when we'll be able to regard each other, not as enemies,
but as members of one great Humanity, working for each
other's welfare as we work for our own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's it, Bob,&quot; agreed Geordie, completely carried away
with Smillie's enthusiasm. &quot;That's it, Bob. If we can only
get them to see hoo' simple and easy it a' is ... Oh, they
maun be made to see it that way!&quot; he burst out. &quot;We'll work
nicht an' day but in the end we'll get them to see it that
way yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but it won't be easy, Geordie,&quot; he replied. &quot;Our
people's lives have been stunted and warped so long, they've
been held in bondage and poverty to such an extent, that it
will take years&mdash;generations, maybe&mdash;before they come to
realize it. But we must go on, undeterred by opposition, rousing
them from their apathy, and continually holding before
them the vision of the time we are working to establish.
Ay, Geordie,&quot;&mdash;and a quieter note came into his voice, &quot;I hope
I shall be strong enough to go on, and never to give heed to
the discouragements I shall undoubtedly meet with in the
work; but I've made up my mind, and I'll see it through or
dee.&quot;</p>

<p>The talk of the two men worked like magic upon the impressionable
mind of young Robert, who sat listening. Long
after all had retired for the night he lay awake, his little mind
away in the future, living in the earthly paradise which had
been conjured up before him by the warm, inspiring sentences
of this miners' leader, and joyful in the contemplation of this
paradise of happy humanity, he fell asleep. Could he have
foreseen the terrible, heartbreaking ordeals through which
Smillie often had to pass, still clinging with tenacity to the
gleam that led him on, praying sometimes that strength would
be given to keep him from turning back; of the strenuous
battle he had, not only with those he fought against, but of
the greater and more bitter fights he too often had with those
of his own class whom he was trying to save; and of the fights
even with himself, it would have raised Smillie still more in
the estimation of this sensitive-hearted collier laddie.</p>

<h2>ON THE PIT-HEAD</h2>


<p>&quot;Hooray, mither, I've passed the examination, an' I
can leave the school noo!&quot; cried Robert one day,
breaking in upon his mother, as she was busily preparing
the dinner. She stopped peeling the potatoes to look
up and smile, as she replied: &quot;Passed the fifth standard,
Robin?&quot; she said, lovingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said the boy proudly, his face beaming with smiles.
&quot;It was quite easy. Oh, if you had just seen the sums we
got; they were easy as winking. I clinked them like onything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My, ye maun hae been real clever,&quot; said Mrs. Sinclair
encouragingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Sammy Grierson failed,&quot; broke in Robert again, too full
of his success to contain himself. &quot;He couldna' tell what was
the capital of Switzerland! Then the inspector asked him
what was the largest river in Europe, an' he said the Thames.
He forgot that the Thames was just the biggest in England.
I was sittin' next him an' had to answer baith times, an' the
inspector said I was a credit to the school. My, it was great
fun!&quot; and he rattled on, full of importance at his success.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but maybe Sammy was just nervous,&quot; said his mother,
continuing her operations upon the potatoes, and trying to let
him see that there might have been a cause for the failure of
the other boy to answer correctly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, but he's a dunce onyway,&quot; said the boy. &quot;He canna
spell an easy word like 'examination,' an' he had twenty-two
mistakes in his dictation test,&quot; he went on, and she was quick
to note the air of priggish importance in his utterance.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' you're left the school now,&quot; said Mrs. Sinclair,
after a pause, during which her busy fingers handled the
potatoes with great skill. &quot;Your faither will be gey pleased
when he comes hame the day,&quot; she said, giving the conversation
a new turn.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, I'll get leavin' the school when I like, an' gaun to the
pit when I like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would ye no' raither gang to the school a while langer?&quot;
observed the mother after a pause, and looking at him with
searching eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; was the decisive reply. &quot;I'd raither gang to work.
I'm ready for leaving the school and forby, all the other
laddies are gaun to the pit to work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But look at the things ye micht be if ye gaed to the school
a while langer, Robin,&quot; she went on. &quot;The life of a miner's
no' a very great thing. There's naething but hard work, an'
dangerous work at that, an' no' very muckle for it.&quot; And
there was an anxious desire in her voice, as if trying to convince
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but I'd raither leave the school,&quot; he answered, though
with less decision this time. &quot;Besides, it'll mean more money
for you,&quot; he concluded.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, look how quick a miner turns auld, Rob. He's done
at forty years auld,&quot; she said, as if she did not wish to heed
what he said, &quot;but meenisters an' schoolmaisters, an' folk
o' that kin', leeve a gey lang while. Look at the easy time
they hae to what a collier has. They dinna get up at five
o'clock in the mornin' like your faither. They rise aboot
eight, an' start work at nine. Meenisters only work yae day a
week, an' only aboot two hoors at that. They hae clean claes
to wear, a fine white collar every day, an' sae mony claes that
they can put on a different rig-oot every day. Their work is
no' hard, an' look at the pay they get; no' like your faither
wi' his two or three shillin's a day. They hae the best o' it,&quot;
she concluded, as she rested her elbows on her knees and
again searched his face keenly to see if her arguments had had
any effect upon him.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but I'd raither work,&quot; reiterated the boy stubbornly.</p>

<p>&quot;Then they hae plenty o' books,&quot; continued the temptress,
loth to give up and keen to draw as rosy a picture as possible,
&quot;and a braw hoose, an' a piano in it. They get a lang holiday
every year, and occasional days besides, an' their pay for it.
But a collier gets nae pay when he's idle. It's the same auld
grind awa' at hard work, among damp, an' gas, an' bad air,
an' aye the chance o' being killed wi' falls of stone or something
else. It's no' a nice life. It's gey ill paid, an' forby
naebody ever respects them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, mither; but do you no' mind what Bob Smillie said?&quot;
chipped in the boy readily, glad that he could quote such an
authority to back his view. &quot;It's because they dinna respect
themselves. They just need to do things richt, an' things
wadna' be sae bad as they are,&quot; and he felt as if he clinched
his argument by quoting Smillie against her.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Robin,&quot; she replied, &quot;that's true; but for it a', you
maun admit that the schoolmaister an' the meenister hae the
best o' it.&quot; But she felt that her counter was not very
effective.</p>

<p>&quot;My faither says meenisters are nae guid to the world, but
schoolmaisters are,&quot; said the boy, with a grudging admission
for the teaching profession. &quot;But I dinna care. I'd raither
gang to work. I dinna want to gang ony langer to the school.
I'm tired o' it, an' I want to leave it,&quot; and there was more
decision in his voice this time than ever.</p>

<p>&quot;A' richt, Robin,&quot; said Mrs. Sinclair resignedly, as she emptied
the peeled potatoes into a pot and put them on the fire.</p>

<p>There were now seven of a family, and she knew that Robert
was needed to increase the earnings, and that meant there
was nothing but the pit for him.</p>

<p>&quot;You maun hae been real clever, though, to pass,&quot; she said
again, after a pause. &quot;How many failed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Four, mither,&quot; he cried, again waxing enthusiastic over
the examination. &quot;Mysie Maitland passed, too. She was
first among the lasses, and I was first in the laddies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, man, Bob, learnin' is a gran' thing to hae,&quot; she said
wistfully, looking at him very tenderly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but I'm gaun to the pit,&quot; he said decisively, fearing
that she was again going to enlarge upon the schoolmaster's
life.</p>

<p>&quot;Very weel,&quot; she said after a bit, &quot;I suppose ye'll be lookin'
for a job. Your faither was saying last nicht that ye're too
young to gang into the pit. Ye maun be twelve years auld
afore ye get doon the pit noo, ye ken. So I suppose it'll be
the pithead for ye for a while.&quot;</p>

<p>She had often dreamed her dream, even though she knew it
was an impossible one, that she would like to see her laddie
go right on through the Secondary School in the county town
to the University. She knew he had talents above the ordinary,
and, besides, her soul rebelled at the thought of her
boy having to endure the things that his father had to go
through with. She was an intelligent woman, and though she
had had little education, she saw things differently from most
of the women of her class. She had character, and her influence
was easily traced in her children, but more especially in
Robert, who was always her favorite bairn. She was wise,
too, and had fathomed some secrets of psychology which many
women with a university training had never even glimpsed.</p>

<p>She often maintained that her children's minds were molded
before she gave them birth, and that it depended upon the
state of mind she was in herself during those nine months, as
to what kind of soul her child would be born possessing. It
may have been merely a whim on her part, but she held tenaciously
to her belief, acted in accordance with it, and no one
could dissuade her from it. Robert was her child of song,
her sunny offspring, stung into revolt against tyranny of all
kinds. His soul, strong and true as steel, she knew would
stand whatever test was put upon it. Incorruptible and sincere,
nothing could break him. Generous and forgiving, he
could never be bought.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll gang the nicht, mither, an' see if I can get a job. I
micht get started the morn,&quot; he said breaking in upon her
thought.</p>

<p>&quot;A' richt, Robin,&quot; she replied with a sigh of resignation. &quot;I
suppose it'll hae to be done. It'll be yer first start in life,
an' I hope ye'll aye be found doin' what's richt; for guid
never comes o' ill thinkin' or ill doin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I get a job, mither, maybe I'll get one-an'-tippence a
day like Dick Tamson. If I do it'll be a big help to you,
mither. My! I'll soon mak' a poun' at that rate,&quot; and he
laughed enthusiastically at the thought of it. A pound seemed
to represent riches to his boyish mind. What might his
mother not do with a pound? Ever so many things could be
bought. And that was merely a start. His wages would
soon increase with experience, and when he went down the
pit, which would be soon, he'd earn more, and his mother
would maybe be able to buy new clothes for all the family.</p>

<p>He wondered what it would be like to have a new suit of
clothes&mdash;real new ones out of a shop. Hitherto he had only
enjoyed &quot;make downs,&quot; as they were called&mdash;new ones made
out of some one's cast-off clothing. But a real new suit, such
as he had seen the schoolmaster's boy sometimes wearing!
That would be a great experience! And so, lost in contemplation
of the things big wages might do, the day wore on,
and he was happy in his dreams.</p>

<p>That same night Robert went to call on the &quot;gaffer,&quot; Black
Jock, and as he neared the door he met Mysie Maitland.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are ye goin', Rab?&quot; she enquired shyly.</p>

<p>&quot;To look for a job,&quot; he replied proudly, feeling that now
he was left school, and about to start work, he could be
patronizing to a girl. &quot;Where are you gaun?&quot; he asked, as
Mysie joined him in the direction of Walker's house.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm gaun to look for a job, too,&quot; she replied. &quot;I'm no'
gaun back to the school, an' my mither thinks I'll be as weel
on the pit-head as at service. An' forby, I'll be able to help
my mither at nichts when I come hame, an' I couldna' do that
if I gaed to service,&quot; she finished by way of explanation. As
Mysie was the oldest of a family of six, her parents would be
glad to have even her small earnings, and so she, too, was
looking for a job.</p>

<p>When Walker came to the door, Robert took the matter
in hand, and became spokesman for both himself and Mysie.</p>

<p>&quot;We've left the school the day, Mr. Walker, an' Mysie an'
me want to ken if ye can gie us a job on the pitheid?&quot; and
Walker noted with amusement the manly swagger in the boy's
voice and bearing.</p>

<p>&quot;We dinna' usually start lasses as wee as Mysie,&quot; replied
Walker, eyeing the children with an amused smile, &quot;but we
need twa or three laddies to the tables to help the women to
pick stones.&quot;</p>

<p>Mysie's face showed her keen disappointment. She knew
that it was not customary for girls to be employed as young
as she was; and Robert noted her disappointed look as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Could ye no' try Mysie, too?&quot; he asked, breaking in
anxiously. &quot;She's a guid worker, an' she'll be able to pick as
many stanes as the weemen. Willn't ye, Mysie?&quot; And he
turned to the girl for corroboration with assurance.</p>

<p>As Mysie nodded, Walker saw a hint of tears in the girl's
eyes, and the quivering of the tiny mouth; and as there is
a soft spot in all men's hearts, even he had sympathy, for he
understood what refusal meant.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, I micht gie her a trial,&quot; he said, &quot;but she'll hae to
work awfu' hard,&quot; and he spoke as one conferring an especial
concession upon the girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, she'll work hard enough,&quot; said Robert. &quot;Mysie's a
guid worker, an' you'll see ...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, then,&quot; said Walker hurriedly breaking in upon Robert's
outburst of agreement, &quot;ye can both come oot the morn, and
I'll try and put ye both up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How muckle pay will we get?&quot; asked Robert, who was now
feeling his importance, and felt that this was after all the
main point to be considered.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we gie laddies one an' a penny,&quot; replied Walker,
still smiling amusedly at the boy's eagerness, &quot;an' lasses are
aye paid less than callants. But it's all big lasses we hae,
an' they get one an' tippence. I'll gie Mysie a shillin' to
begin wi',&quot; and he turned away as if that settled the matter,
and was about to close the door.</p>

<p>&quot;But if she picks as many stanes as a laddie, will ye gie
her the same pay as me?&quot; interrupted Robert, not wishing the
interview to end without a definite promise of payment.</p>

<p>&quot;She's gey wee,&quot; replied Walker, &quot;an' she canna' expect as
much as a laddie,&quot; and he looked at Mysie, as if measuring
her with a critical eye to assess her value.</p>

<p>&quot;But if she does as muckle work, would ye gie her the
same money?&quot; eagerly questioned the boy, and Mysie felt
that there was no one surely so brave as Robert, nor so good,
and she looked at him with gratitude in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Very weel,&quot; said Walker, not desiring to prolong the interview.
&quot;Come oot the morn, an' I'll gie ye both one an' a
penny.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Six an' sixpence a week,&quot; said Mysie, as they tramped
home. &quot;My, that's a lot o' money, Rab, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's a guid lot, Mysie,&quot; he replied, &quot;but we'll hae to
work awfu' hard, or we'll no' get it. Guid nicht!&quot; And so
the children parted, feeling that the world was about to be
good to them, and all their thought of care was bounded by
six and sixpence a week.</p>

<p>Mysie was glad to tell the result of the whole interview
to her parents. She was full of it, and could talk of nothing
else as she worked about the house that night. Her mother
had been in delicate health for a long time, and so Mysie had
most of the housework to do. Matthew Maitland and his wife,
Jenny, were pleased at the result, and gave Robert due credit
for his part&mdash;a credit that Mysie was delighted to hear from
them.</p>

<p>The next morning the two children went to work, when
children of their years ought to have been still in bed dreaming
their little dreams.</p>

<p>The great wheels at the pithead seemed terrible in their
never-ending revolutions, as they flew round to bring up the
loads of coal. The big yawning chasm, with the swinging
steel rope, running away down into the great black hole, was
awesome to look at, as the rope wriggled and swayed with its
sinister movements; and the roar and whir of wheels, when
the tables started, bewildered them. These crashed and roared
and crunched and groaned; they would squeal and shriek as
if in pain, then they would moan a little, as if gathering
strength to break out in indignant protest; and finally, roar
out in rebellious anger, giving Robert the idea of an imprisoned
monster of gigantic strength which had been harnessed whilst
it slept, but had wakened at last to find itself impotent against
its Lilliputian captor&mdash;man.</p>

<p>An old man instructed them in their duties.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll staun here,&quot; he panted, indicating a little platform
about two feet broad, and running along the full length of the
&quot;scree.&quot; &quot;You'll watch for every bit stane that comes doon,
an' dinna' let any past. Pick them oot as soon as you see
them, an' fling them owre there, an' Dickie Tamson'll fill them
into the hutch, an' get them taken to the dirt bing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A' richt,&quot; said Robert, as he looked at the narrow platform,
with its weak, inadequate railing, which could hardly prevent
anyone from falling down on to the wagon track, some fifteen
or twenty feet below on one side, or on to the moving &quot;scree&quot;
on the other.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, mind an' no' let any stanes gang past, for there are
aye complaints comin' in aboot dirty coals. If ye dinna work
an' keep oot the stanes, you'll get the sack,&quot; and he said this as
if he meant to convey to them that he was the sole authority
on the matter.</p>

<p>He was an old man, and Robert, as he looked at him,
wondered if he had ever laughed. &quot;Auld Girnie&quot; they called
him, because of his habit of always finding fault with everything
and everybody, for no one could please him. His mouth
seemed to be one long slit extending across his face, showing
one or two stumps sticking in the otherwise toothless gums,
and giving him the appearance of always &quot;grinning.&quot;</p>

<p>The women workers' appearance jarred upon Robert. So
far women to him had always been beings of a higher order,
because he had always thought of them as being like his
mother. But here they were rough and untidy, dressed like
goblins in dirty torn clothes, with an old dirty sack hanging
from the waist for an overall. Instinctively Robert felt that
this was no place for women. One of them, who worked on
the opposite side of the scree from Robert&mdash;a big, strong,
heavily-built young woman of perhaps twenty-five&mdash;in moving
forward tore her petticoat, which caught in the machinery,
and made a rent right up above her knee.</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, to hell wi' it,&quot; she cried in exasperation, as she turned
up the torn petticoat, displaying a leg all covered with coal
grime, which seemed never to have been washed.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that no' awfu'? Damn my soul, I'll hae to gang hame
the nicht in my sark tail,&quot; and she laughed loudly at her
sally.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll put a pin in it, it'll do till I gang hame,&quot; she added,
and she started to pin the torn edges together. But all day
the bare leg shone through the torn petticoat, and rough jokes
were made by the men who worked near by&mdash;jokes which she
seemed to enjoy, for she would hold up the torn garment and
laugh with the others.</p>

<p>The women and boys never seemed to heed the things that
filled Robert and Mysie with so much amazement. The two
children bent over the swinging tables as the coal passed
before them. They eagerly grabbed at the stones, flinging
them to the side with a zeal that greatly amused the older
hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye'll no' keep up that pace lang,&quot; said one woman. &quot;Ye'll
soon tire, so ye'd better take it easy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let them alone,&quot; broke in the old man, who had a penny
a day more for acting as a sort of gaffer. &quot;Get on wi' yer own
work, an' never mind them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gang you to hell, auld wheezie bellows,&quot; replied one woman
coarsely, adding a rough jest at his breathlessness, whilst the
others laughed loudly, adding, each one, another sally to
torment the old man.</p>

<p>But after a time Robert felt his back begin to ache, and a
strange dizzy feeling came into his head, as a result of his
bent position and the swinging and crashing of the tables.
He straightened himself and felt as if he were going to break
in two. He glanced at Mysie, wondering how she felt, and he
thought she looked white and ill.</p>

<p>&quot;Take a wee rest, Mysie,&quot; he said. &quot;Are ye no' awfu'
dizzy?&quot;</p>

<p>Mysie heard, but &quot;six and sixpence a week&quot; was still ringing
in her head. Indeed, the monotonous swing of the tables
ground out the refrain in their harsh clamor, as they swung
backwards and forwards. &quot;Six and sixpence a week,&quot; with
every leap forwards; &quot;six and sixpence a week&quot; as they receded.
&quot;Six and sixpence&quot; with every shake and roar, and
with each pulsing throb of the engine; and &quot;six and sixpence
a week&quot; her little hands, already cut and bleeding, kept time
with regular beat, as she lifted the stones and flung them aside.
She was part of the refrain&mdash;a note in the fortissimo of industry.
The engines roared and crashed and hissed to it.
They beat the air regularly as the pistons rose and fell back
and forth, thump, thud, hiss, groan, up and down, out and in:
&quot;Six and sixpence a week!&quot;</p>

<p>Mysie tried to straighten herself, as Robert had advised,
and immediately a pain shot through her back which seemed
to snap it in two. The whole place seemed to be rushing
round in a mad whirl, the roof of the shed coming down, and
the floor rushing up, when with a stagger Mysie fell full length
upon a &quot;bing&quot; of stones, bruising her cheek, and cutting her
little hands worse than ever. This was what usually happened
to all beginners at &quot;pickin' sklits.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the women raised Mysie up, gave her a drink from
a flask containing cold tea, and sat her aside to rest a short
time.</p>

<p>&quot;Just sit there a wee, my dochter,&quot; she said with rough
kindness, &quot;an' you'll soon be a' richt. They mostly a' feel
that way when they first start on the scree.&quot;</p>

<p>Mysie was feeling sick, and already the thought was shaping
in her mind that she would never be able to continue. She
had only worked an hour as yet, but it seemed to her a
whole day.</p>

<p>&quot;Six and sixpence a week&quot; sang the tables as they swung;
&quot;six and sixpence a week&quot; whirred the engines; &quot;six and sixpence
a week&quot; crashed the screes; and her head began to throb
with the roar of it all. &quot;Six and sixpence a week&quot; as the
coal tumbled down the chutes into the wagons; &quot;six and sixpence&quot;
crunched the wheels, until it seemed as if everything
about a pit were done to the tune of &quot;six and sixpence a week.&quot;</p>

<p>It was thundered about her from one corner, it squealed
at her from another, roared at her from behind, groaned at her
in front; it wheezed from the roof, and the very shed in which
they stood swayed and shivered to its monotonous song.
&quot;Six and sixpence a week&quot; was working into every fiber of her
being. She had been born to it, was living it, and it seemed
that the very wheels of eternity were grinding out her destiny
to its roar and its crash, and its terrible regular throb and
swing.</p>

<p>She grew still more sick, and vomited; so one of the women
took her by the hand and led her down the narrow rickety
wooden stair out across the dirt &quot;bing&quot; into the pure air.
In a quarter of an hour she brought her back almost well,
except for the pain in her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Where the hell hae ye been, Mag?&quot; wheezed the old
gaffer, addressing the woman with irritated authority.</p>

<p>&quot;Awa' an' boil yer can, auld belly-crawler,&quot; was the elegant
response, as she bent to her work, taking as little notice of
him as if he were a piece of coal.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye're awa' faur owre much,&quot; he returned. This was an
allusion to clandestine meetings which were sometimes arranged
between some of the men in authority&mdash;&quot;penny gaffers,&quot;
as they were called&mdash;and some of the girls who took
their fancy.</p>

<p>After all, gaffers had certain powers of advancement, and
could increase wages to those who found favor in their eyes,
to the extent of a penny or twopence per day, and justified
it by representing that these girls were value for it, because
they were better workers. Again, matters were always easier
to these girls of easy virtue, for they got better jobs, and
could even flout the authority of lesser gaffers, if their relations
with the higher ones were as indicated.</p>

<p>Mag replied with a coarse jest, and the others laughed
roughly, and Mysie and Robert, not understanding, wondered
why the old man got angry.</p>

<p>Thus the day wore on, men and women cursed while
familiarities took place which were barely hidden from the
children. Talk was coarse and obscenely suggestive, and the
whole atmosphere was brutalizing. Long, however, before
the day was ended, Robert and Mysie were feeling as if every
bone in their little bodies would break.</p>

<p>&quot;Just take anither wee rest, Mysie,&quot; said Robert. &quot;I'll
keep pickin' as hard as I can, an' ye'll no' be sae muckle
missed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'll hae to keep on, too,&quot; she replied, almost despairingly,
with a hint of tears in her voice. &quot;Ye mind I promised
to work hard, an' ye said I was a guid worker, too. If I
dinna' keep on I micht only get a shillin' a day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I'll pick as much as the twa o' us can do,&quot; pursued
Robert, with persuasive voice. &quot;I'll gang harder, until ye
can get a wee rest.&quot;</p>

<p>So Mysie, in sheer exhaustion, stopped for a little, and the
dizzy feeling was soon gone again. Yet the horrible pain in
the back troubled them all day, and the dizziness returned
frequently, but the others assured them that they'd soon get
used to it. Their hands were cut, bruised and dirty, and poor
little Mysie felt often that she would like to cry, but &quot;six
and sixpence a week&quot; kept time in her heart to all her troubles,
and seemed to drive her onward with relentless force.</p>

<p>With rough kindness the women encouraged the two children,
and did much to make their lot easier. But it was a
trying day&mdash;a hard, heartbreaking day, a day of tears and
pains and discouragement, a horrible Gethsemane of sweat and
agony, whose memory not even &quot;six and sixpence a week&quot;
would ever eradicate from their minds, though it made the
day bearable.</p>

<p>The great wheels groaned and swished like the imprisoned
monster of Robert's imaginings, and at last came to a halt
at the end of the shift; but in the pattern which they had
that day woven into the web of industry, there were two bright
threads&mdash;threads of great beauty and high worth&mdash;threads
which the very gods seemed proud of seeing there, twisted and
twined, and lending color of richest hue to the whole design&mdash;threads
of glorious fiber and rare quality, which sparkled and
shone like the neck of a pigeon in the sunshine. These threads
in the web of industry, which had shone that day for the
first time, were the lives of two little children.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h2>THE MANTLE OF MANHOOD</h2>


<p>Months passed, and Robert still worked on the pithead.
Much of the novelty had passed, and he was
accustomed to the noise and clamor, though he never
lost the feeling that he was working with, or, indeed, was part
of, some giant monster, imprisoned and harnessed, it is true,
but capable of titanic labors and fall of unexpectedness. It
was ever-present, implacable and sinister, yet so long as its
fetters held, easily controlled.</p>

<p>The warm weather had come, and the lure of the moors
called to him at his work. Away out over there&mdash;somewhere&mdash;there
were strange wonders awaiting him. He watched the
trains, long, fast, and so inevitable-looking, rushing across the
moor about a mile and a half from where he worked, and often,
he thought that perhaps some day one of those flying monsters
would bear him away from Lowwood across the moors
into the Big City. What was a city like? And the sea? How
big would it be? It was a staggering thought to imagine a
stretch of water that ended on the sky-line&mdash;no land to be seen
on the other side! What a wonderful world it must be!</p>

<p>But a touch of bitterness was creeping into his character,
and for this his mother's teaching was responsible. Nellie
was always jealous of the welfare of the working class, and
was ever vigilant as to its interests. She did not know how
matters could be rectified, but she did know that she and
her like suffered unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&quot;There's no reason,&quot; she would say, &quot;for decent folk bein'
in poverty. Look at the conditions that puir folk live in!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoot ay! Nellie, but we canna' help it,&quot; a neighbor would
reply. &quot;It's no' for us to be better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What way is it no'?&quot; she would demand indignantly. &quot;Do
you think we couldna' be better folk if we had no poverty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but the like o' us ken no better, an' it wadna' do if
we had mair. We micht waste it,&quot; and the tone of resignation
always maddened her to greater wrath.</p>

<p>&quot;There's mair wasted on fancy fal-lals among the gentry
than wad keep many a braw family goin'. Look at the hooses
we live in; the gentry wadna' keep their dogs in them. The
auld Earl has better stables for his horses than the hooses
puir folk live in!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's maybe a' richt, Nellie, but you maun mind that
we're no' gentry. We havena' been brocht up to anything
else. Somebody has got to work, an' we canna' help it,&quot;
and the fatalistic resignation but added fuel to her anger.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, we could help it fine, if we'd only try it. It's no'
richt that folk should hae to slave a' their days, an' be always
in hardships, while ither folk who work nane hae the best o'
everything. I want a decent hoose to live in; I want to see
my man hae some leisure, an' my weans hae a chance in life
for something better than just work and trouble,&quot; and her
voice quivering with anger at the wrongs inflicted upon her,
she would rattle away on her favorite topic.</p>

<p>&quot;There you go again. You are aye herp, herpin' at the
big folk, or aboot the union. I wonder you never turn tired,
woman,&quot; the reply would come, for sometimes these women
were unable to understand her at all.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll never turn tired o' that,&quot; she would reply. &quot;If only
the men wad keep thegither an' no' be divided, they'd soon
let the big folk see wha' was the maist importance to the country.
Do you think onybody ever made a lot o' money by
their ain work? My man an' your man hae wrocht hard a'
their days. They've never wasted ony o' their hard-earned
money, an' yet they hae naething.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, because it takes it a' to keep us,&quot; would be the reply,
as if that were a conclusive answer, difficult to counter.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, how do ye think other folk mak' a fortune? Do ye
think they work harder than your man does? No! It's because
our men work so hard that other folk get it aff their
labor. Do they live a better life than your man or mine?
They waste mair in yae day, whiles, than wad keep your
family or mine for a whole year. Is it because they are
honester than us? No. You ken fine your man or yoursel'
wadna' hae the name o' stealin'. But they steal every day o'
their lives, only they ca' it business. That's the difference.
It's business wi' them, but it wad be dishonest on oor pairt.
Awa', woman! It's disgraceful to think aboot. Naebody
should eat wha disna work, an' I dinna care wha hears me say
it,&quot; and the flashing eyes and the indignant voice gave token
of her righteous wrath.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a' richt, Nellie, but it has aye been, an' I doot
it'll aye be. We just canna help it,&quot; would come the reply.</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you it's everybody's duty to work for better times.
We've no richt to allow the things that gang on. There's nae
guid in poverty and disease an' ill-health, an' we should a'
try to change it; and we could if only you'd get some sense
into your held, an' no' stand and speak as if you felt that
God meant it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Nellie, that's a' richt, but it's the Lord's will, an'
we maun put up wi' it.&quot;</p>

<p>At this juncture Mrs. Sinclair's patience would become exhausted,
and she would flare up, while the neighbor would suddenly
break off the discussion and go off home.</p>

<p>Her children were taught that it was a disgrace not to resent
a wrong, and Robert, though only a boy, was always
sturdily standing up against the things he considered wrong
at the pit-head.</p>

<p>Robert dreamed and built his future castles. There was
great work ahead to do. He never mentioned his longings and
visions to anyone, yet Mysie's sweet, shy face was creeping into
them always, and already he was conscious of something in her
that thrilled him. He was awkward, and his speech did not
come readily, in her presence. Whole days he dreamed, only
waking up to find it was &quot;knocking-off&quot; time. There was an
hour's break in the middle of the day, and then he wandered
out on the moor. Its silence soothed him, and he would lie
and dream among the rough yellow grass and the hard tough
heather, bathing his soul in the brooding quietness of it all.</p>

<p>He was now twelve years of age, and longing to get at work
down the pit. It was for him the advent of manhood, and
represented the beginning of his real work.</p>

<p>One night in the late summer, after the pit had knocked off
and the &quot;day-shift&quot; was returning home, he and Mysie were
walking as usual behind the women. He had meant to tell
her the great news all day, but somehow she was so different
now, and besides a man should always keep something to himself
as long as possible. It showed strength, he thought.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm goin' doon the pit the morn, Mysie,&quot; he said, now that
he had come to the point of telling her, and speaking as casually
as he could.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, are you?&quot; said Mysie, and stopped, disappointingly,
and remained silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay. I'm twelve now, you ken, an' I can get into the pit,&quot;
feeling a bit nettled that she was silent in the face of such
a happening.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; and again Mysie stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;My faither has got a place a week syne that'll fit John
an' him an' me. The three o' us are a' goin' to work thegither.
If he could have gotten yin sooner, I'd hae been doon
a month syne. But he's aye been waitin' to get a place that
wad suit us a',&quot; he said, volunteering this information to see
if it would loosen her tongue to express the regret he wanted
her to speak.</p>

<p>But again Mysie did not answer. She only hung her head
and did not look up with any interest in his news.</p>

<p>&quot;It's aboot time I was in the pit now, ye ken. You used
to get doon the pit at ten. My faither was in it when he was
nine, but you're no' allowed to gang doon now till you are
twelve year auld. I'm going to draw aff my faither and John,&quot;
and he was feeling more and more exasperated at her continued
silence.</p>

<p>Yet still Mysie did not speak, and merely nodded to this
further enlightenment.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never telt onybody except yoursel',&quot; he said, hurt at
her seeming want of interest, and feeling that what he was
going to say was less manly than he intended it to be. Indeed
he was aware that it was decidedly childish of him to say it,
but, like many wiser and older, he could not keep his dignity,
and took pleasure in hurting her; for there is a pleasure sometimes
in hurting a loved one, because they are loved, and will
not speak the things one wants them to say, which if said might
add to one's vanity and sense of importance. &quot;So ye'll just be
by yoursel' the morn, unless they put Dicky Tamson owre
aside you,&quot; he added viciously.</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna want Dicky Tamson aside me,&quot; she said with some
heat, and a hint of anxiety in her voice, which pleased him
a little. &quot;He's an impudent thing,&quot; and again she relapsed
into silence, just when he thought his pleasure was going to
be complete.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they'll maybe put Aggie Lowrieson on your side o' the
table,&quot; he volunteered, glad that at last she had shown some
feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;They can keep Aggie Lowrieson too,&quot; she said shortly.
&quot;I dinna' want her. I'll get on fine mysel',&quot; and she said
no more.</p>

<p>He talked of his new venture all the way home, and he felt
more and more hurt because she did not reply as eagerly and
volubly as he wished.</p>

<p>&quot;It'll be great goin' doon the pit,&quot; he said, again feeling that
he was going to be priggish. &quot;Pickin' stanes is a' guid enough
for a laddie for a wee while, an' for women, but you're the
better to gang into the pit when you're the age. You get mair
money for it. Of course, it's hard work, but I'll be earnin'
as much as twa shillin's a day in the pit, and that'll be twelve
shillin's a week.&quot;</p>

<p>But Mysie could not be drawn to look at his rosy prospects,
and still kept silent, so that the last few hundred yards were
covered in silence. At the end of the row where they always
parted, he could not resist adding a thrust to his usual &quot;good-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guid nicht then, Mysie. I thocht may be ye'd be vexed,
seem' that Dickie Tamson can torment you as muckle as he
likes now.&quot; And so he went home feeling that Mysie didn't
care much.</p>

<p>But Mysie had a sore heart that night. She knew only too
well that Dick Tamson would torment her, and would be egged
on by the other women to kiss and tease her, and they would
laugh at it all. Robert had always been her champion, and
kept Dick, who was a mischievous boy, at a distance. She was
sorry that Robert was going down the pit, and it seemed to
her that she'd rather go to service now. The harsh clamor
and the dirty disagreeable work were bearable before, but it
would not be the same with Robert away. She knew that she
would miss him very much. She thought long of it when she
lay down in her bed that night. He had no right to think
that she was not vexed, and she cried quietly beneath the
blankets.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's Mysie greetin',&quot; cried her little brother, who lay
beside her. &quot;Mither, Mysie's greetin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrang wi' her?&quot; called the mother anxiously from
the other bed.</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna' ken,&quot; answered the boy, &quot;she'll no' tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is't that's wrang with you, Mysie?&quot; again called the
mother more sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;I've a sore tooth,&quot; she answered, glad to get any excuse,
and lying with promptitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, hap the blankets owre your head,&quot; the mother advised,
&quot;and it'll soon be better. Dinna' greet, like a woman.&quot;</p>

<p>But Mysie still continued to cry softly, choking back the
sobs, and keeping her face to the wall, so as not to disturb
the other sleeper beside her&mdash;cried for a long hour, until exhaustion
overcame her, and at last she fell asleep, her last
thought being that Robert had no right to misjudge her so.</p>

<p>Robert, on the other hand, as is the prerogative of the man,
soon forgot all about his disappointment at Mysie's seeming
want of interest in his affairs, and was busy with his preparations
for the next day.</p>

<p>He had a lamp to buy, for Lowwood was an open-light pit,
and was soon busy on the instructions of his father learning
the art of &quot;putting in a wick&quot; to the exact thickness, testing
his tea flask, and doing all the little things that count in preparing
for the first descent into a coal mine. He was very
much excited over it all, and babbled all the evening, asking
questions regarding the work he would be called upon to do,
and generally boring his father with his talk.</p>

<p>But his father understood it all, and was patient with him,
answering his enquiries and advising him on many things,
until latterly he pleaded for a &quot;wink o' peace,&quot; and told the
boy &quot;for any sake&quot; to be quiet.</p>

<p>Geordie Sinclair knew that this enthusiasm would soon
evaporate. Only too well he knew the stages of disappointment
which the boy would experience, and for this reason
he was kindly with him.</p>

<p>He was now looking forward with better prospects. Robert
was the second boy now started, and already matters were
somewhat easier; but he shuddered to think of the lot of the
man who was battling away unaided, with four or five children
to support, and depending on a meager three and sixpence or
four shillings of a daily wage to keep the house together.
For himself the prospect was now better, and in looking back
he realized what a terrible time it had been&mdash;especially for his
wife; for hers was the more difficult task in laying out the
scanty wages he earned.</p>

<p>It never had seemed to strike him with such force before,
even when matters were at their worst, what it had meant to
her; and as he looked at her, sitting knitting at the opposite
side of the fire, he was filled with compassion for her, and
a new beauty seemed to be upon her lined face, and in the
firm set of her mouth.</p>

<p>Thus he sat reviewing all the terrible struggle, when she
had slaved to keep him and the children, during the time he
was injured, and a pang shot through, as the conviction came
to him, that perhaps he had not been as helpful as he might
have been to her, when a little praise even might have made it
easier for her.</p>

<p>Impulsively he rose to his feet and crossed to where she
sat, taking her in his arms and kissing her.</p>

<p>&quot;Losh, Geordie, what's wrong with you!&quot; she enquired, looking
up with a pleased sparkle in her eyes, for he was usually
very undemonstrative.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, just this, Nellie,&quot; he said with embarrassment in every
feature of his face, &quot;I've been thinking over things, and I
feel that I havena' given you encouragement as I should have
done, for all that you have done for me and the bairns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You fair took my breath away,&quot; said Nellie with a pleased
little laugh; then, as she looked at his glowing face, something
came into her throat, and the tears started.</p>

<p>&quot;There now, lassie,&quot; he said, again gathering her into his
arms, and kissing her tenderly, &quot;it's all past now, my lass, and
you'll get it easier from this time forth. God knows, Nellie,
you are worth all that I can ever do for you to help,&quot; and
the happy tears fell from her eyes, as she patted his rough,
hairy cheek, and fondled him again, as she had done in their
courting days.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll wash the floor for you, lass,&quot; he said impulsively, almost
beside himself with happiness, as he realized that this
little act of his had made them both so happy. &quot;You've been
in the washing tub all day, and I ken you'll be scrubbin' on
the floor first thing in the morning, as soon as we are away
to the pit. But I'll do it for you the nicht. The bairns are
all in bed, and I'll no' be long. You sit an' tak' a rest,&quot; and
he was off for the pail and a scrubbing brush, and was back
at the fireside pouring water from the kettle before his wife
realized it.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, never mind, Geordie,&quot; she said remonstratingly, &quot;I'll
do it myself in the morning. You've had your own work to do
in the pit, an' you need all the rest you can get.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said decisively. &quot;You sit doon, lass. I'll no' be
lang. Just you sing a bit sang to me, just as you used to sing,
Nellie, an' I'll wash out the floor,&quot; and he was soon on his
knees, scrubbing away as if it were a daily occurrence with
him. And Nellie, pleased and happy beyond expression, sat
in the big chair by the fireside and sang his favorite ballad,
&quot;Kirkconnel Lea.&quot;</p>

<p>
Oh, that I were where Helen lies,<br />
For nicht and day on me she cries,<br />
Oh, that I were where Helen lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On fair Kirkconnel Lea.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, Helen fair, beyond compare,<br />
I'll mak' a garland o' your hair<br />
Shall bind my heart for evermair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until the day I dee.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And Nellie Sinclair never in all her life sang that song so
well as she did that night; and she never sang it again. Robert,
who was lying in the room, heard her glorious voice, and
marveled at the complete mastery she showed over the plaintive
old tune. It was as if her very soul reveled in it, as
the notes rose and fell; and it stirred the boy into tremendous
emotional excitement, as the tragedy was unfolded in the
beautiful words and the sadness of the old tune.</p>

<p>It was a memorable night of quiet happiness for all, and
there was so much of tragedy lying behind it unseen and unknown.
But so often are the sweetest moments of life followed
by its sadness and its sorrow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h2>THE ACCIDENT</h2>


<p>Next morning at five o'clock Robert leapt from his bed,
full of importance at the prospect of going down the
pit. Stripping off his sleeping shirt, he chattered as
he donned the pit clothes. The blue plaid working-shirt which
his mother had bought for him felt rough to his tender skin,
but unpleasant as it was, he donned it with a sense of bigness.
Then the rough moleskin trousers were put on and fastened
with a belt round the waist, and a pair of leg-strings at the
knees. The bundles of clothes, separately arranged the night
before, had got mixed somewhat in Robert's eagerness to
dress, with the result that when his brother John rose, with
eyes half shut, and reached for his stockings, he found those
of Robert instead lying upon his bundle.</p>

<p>&quot;Gie's my socks,&quot; he ordered grumpily, flinging Robert's
socks into the far corner of the kitchen. &quot;You've on the
wrong drawers too. Can ye no' look what you're doin'?&quot; and
the drawers followed the socks, while Robert looked at his
mother with eyes of wonderment.</p>

<p>&quot;Tak' aff his socks, Rob,&quot; she said, &quot;he's a thrawn, ill-natured
cat, that, in the mornin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he should look what he's doin' an' no' put on other
folk's claes,&quot; and immediately the others burst out laughing,
for this advocate of &quot;watchin' what he was doin'&quot; had in his
half sleepy condition failed to see that he had lifted his jacket
and had rammed his leg down the sleeve in his hurry and
anger.</p>

<p>&quot;Noo, that'll do,&quot; said Geordie, as John flung the jacket at
Robert, because he laughed. &quot;That'll do noo, or I'll come
alang yer jaw,&quot; and thus admonished John was at once silent.</p>

<p>Robert soon had his toilet completed, however, even to the
old cap on his head, upon which sat the little oil-lamp, which
he handled and cleaned and wiped with his fingers to
keep it bright and shiny, whilst all the time he kept chattering.</p>

<p>&quot;For ony sake, laddie, hand your tongue,&quot; said Geordie at
last, as he drew in his chair to the table to start upon the
frugal breakfast of bread and butter and tea. &quot;Your tongue's
never lain since you got up.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert, thereupon, sat down in silence at the table, though
there were a hundred different things he wanted to ask about
the pit. He could not understand why everyone felt and
looked so sleepy, nor divine the cause of the irritable look
upon each face, which in the dim light of the paraffin lamp
gave a forbidding atmosphere to the home at this time of the
day.</p>

<p>At last, however, the meal was over, and when Geordie had
lit his pit lamp and stuck his pipe in his mouth, all three
started off with a curt &quot;Good morning&quot; to Mrs. Sinclair, who
looked after her boys with a smile which chased away the
previous irritability from her face.</p>

<p>Arrived at the pit-head, they found a number of miners there
squatting on their &quot;hunkers,&quot; waiting the time for descending
the shaft. As each newcomer came forward, the man who
arrived immediately before him called out: &quot;I'm last.&quot; By
this means&mdash;&quot;crying the benns,&quot;&mdash;as it was called&mdash;the order
of descent was regulated on the principle of &quot;First come, first
served.&quot; Much chaffing was leveled at little Robert by some
of the younger men regarding his work and the things which
would have to be done by and to him that day.</p>

<p>At last came the all important moment, and Robert, his
father and two men stepped on to the cage. After the signal
was given, it seemed to the boy as if heaven and earth were
passing away in the sudden sheer drop, as the cage plunged
down into the yawning hole, out of which came evil smells
and shadows cast from the flickering lamps upon the heads of
the miners. The rattling of the cage sent a shiver of fear
through Robert, and with that first sudden plunge he felt as
if his heart were going to leap out of his mouth. But by the
time he reached the &quot;bottom,&quot; he had consoled and encouraged
himself with the thought that these things were all in the first
day's experience of all miners.</p>

<p>That morning Robert Sinclair was initiated into the art
of &quot;drawing&quot; by his brother John. The road was fairly level,
to push the loaded &quot;tubs,&quot; thus leaving his father to be helped
with the pick at the coal &quot;face.&quot; After an hour or two, Robert,
though getting fairly well acquainted with the work, was
feeling tired. The strange damp smell, which had greeted his
nostrils when the cage began to descend with him that morning,
was still strong, though not so overpowering as it had been
at first. The subtle shifting shadows cast from his little lamp
were becoming familiar, and his nervousness was not now so
pronounced, though he was still easily startled if anything unusual
took place. The sound of the first shot in the pit nearly
frightened him out of his wits, and he listened nervously to
every dull report with a strange uneasiness. About one o'clock
his father called to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna tak' that hutch oot the noo, Robert. Just let it
staun', an' sit doon an' tak' yir piece. Ye'll be hungry, an'
John an' me will be out the noo if we had this shot stemmed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A' richt,&quot; cheerfully replied the boy, withdrawing down
to the end of the road, where his clothes hung upon a tree, and
taking his bread from one of his pockets, he sat down tired and
hungry to await his father and John.</p>

<p>Geordie's &quot;place&quot; was being worked over the old workings
of another mine which had exhausted most of the coal of a
lower seam many years previously, except for the &quot;stoops&quot;
or pillars, which had been left in. This was supposed to be
the barrier beyond which Rundell's lease did not go. It
would be too dangerous to work the upper seam with the
ground hollow underneath, so the &quot;places&quot; had all been
stopped as they came up, with the exception of Geordie Sinclair's.
Sinclair was puzzled at this, and he often wondered
why his place had not been stopped with the others. He was
more uneasy, too, when he began to find large cracks or fissures
in the metals, and spoke of this to Andrew Marshall a few
nights before; but he did not like to seem to make too much
of it, and the matter was passed over, till the day before, when
Walker visited the place for a few minutes, when Geordie accosted
him.</p>

<p>&quot;What way is my place going on?&quot; he asked, and was told
that it was a corner in the barrier, which extended for one
hundred yards and must go on for that distance, and that there
was really no danger, as the ground below was solid.</p>

<p>So, busily working away, and finding still more rents in the
floor and roof, Sinclair thought it must just be as he had seen
it in other places of a like kind, the weight of the upper metals
which were breaking over the solid ground by reason of the
hollow beneath between the stoops, though in this case it did
not amount to much as yet.</p>

<p>The coal was easy to get; he had one boy &quot;forrit to the
pick,&quot; with Robert as &quot;drawer,&quot; and his prospects seemed
good, he thought, as he was busily preparing a shot, ramming
in the powder, and &quot;stemming&quot; up the hole. He was
busy ramming the powder in the prepared hole, while the
elder boy prepared clay, with which to stem or seal it up after
the powder had been pressed back, leaving only the fuse protruding.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's a tree cracking,&quot; said the boy, drawing his father's
attention to a breaking prop; but as this is a common occurrence
in all mines where there is extra weight after development,
Geordie thought nothing of it at the time, intending
merely, before he lighted his shot, to put in a fresh prop.</p>

<p>&quot;Bring in another prop, sonny,&quot; he said to the boy, &quot;and
I'll put it in when I have stemmed this hole,&quot; and the boy
turned to obey his order.</p>

<p>But suddenly a low crackling sound, caused by the breaking
of more props, was heard, then a roar and a crash as of
thunder, followed by a long rumbling noise, which left not a
moment for the two trapped human beings to stir even a limb
or utter a cry. The immensity of the fall created a wind,
which put out little Robert's lamp; the great rumbling noise
filled him with a dreadful fear, and he sprang involuntarily
to his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Faither! Faither!&quot; he called, terror in his voice and
anxiety in his little heart, but there was no reassuring answer.
He felt his breathing getting difficult; the air was thick with
dust and heavy with the smell of rotting wood and damp decaying
matter.</p>

<p>&quot;Faither! Faither!&quot; he called again louder in his agony,
darting forward, thinking to go to their assistance, and knocking
his head against a boulder.</p>

<p>&quot;John! Faither! I'm feart,&quot; and he began to cry. Afraid
to move, unable to see, he staggered from one side to another,
bruising his face and arms against the jagged sides, the blood
already streaming from his bruises, and his heart frantic with
fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, faither! faither! Where are ye?&quot; and he began to
crawl up the incline, in desperate fear, while still the rumbling
and crashing went on in long rolling thunder. &quot;Oh! oh!&quot; he
moaned, now almost mad with terror. &quot;Faither! John!
Where are ye! Oh! oh!&quot; and he fell back stunned by striking
his head against a low part of the roof.</p>

<p>Again he scrambled to his feet, certain now that some disaster
had happened, since there was no response to his appeals,
and again he was knocked to the ground by striking his head
against the side of the roadway. But always he rose again,
frantically dashing from side to side, as a caged lark, when
first caught, dashes itself against the bars of its prison; until
finally, stunned beyond recovery, he lay in a semi-conscious
condition, helpless and inert, his bruises smarting but unfelt,
and the blood oozing from his nose and mouth.</p>

<p>Andrew Marshall, working about fifty yards away, heard
the roar and the crash, and the boy's cries, and at once ran
to Geordie's place. In his haste and anxiety he nearly stumbled
over the prostrate boy, who lay unconscious in the roadway.</p>

<p>&quot;Good God! What has happened?&quot; he exclaimed, anxiously
bending over the boy and raising him up, then dashing some
cold tea from Robert's flask upon him, and forcing some between
his lips. Then, when the boy showed signs of recovery,
he plied him with anxious questions.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's yir faither? What's wrang?&quot; But the boy only
clung to him in wild terror, and nothing connected could be
got from him.</p>

<p>Andrew lighted the boy's lamp and tore up the brae, leaving
Robert shrieking in nervous fright.</p>

<p>&quot;Great Christ! It has fa'en in!&quot; he cried, when he had
got as far as he could go. &quot;Geordie! Geordie! Are ye in
there?&quot; and as no answer came, he began tearing at the great
blocks of stone, flinging them like pebbles in his desperation,
until another warning rumble drove him back. Immediately
he realized how helpless he was alone, so he went back to
the boy and hurried him down the brae and out to where
some other men were at work. A few hasty words, and Robert
was passed on, and Andrew went back with the men, only to
find how hopeless it all was; for occasionally huge falls continued
to come away, and it seemed useless to attempt anything
till more help was procured.</p>

<p>Andrew hurried off to the bottom and overtook Robert,
sending back others to help, and he ascended the shaft and
was off to break the news to Mrs. Sinclair; after which he
returned to the pit, determined to get out all that remained
of Geordie and the boy John.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h2>HEROES OF THE UNDERWORLD</h2>


<p>Matters were now much easier and more comfortable
for Geordie Sinclair and his wife. They had long
since added another apartment to their house, and the
&quot;room&quot; was the special pride of Nellie, who was gradually
&quot;getting a bit thing for it&quot; just as her means permitted. They
had two beds in each apartment, and the room was furnished.
Mrs. Sinclair had long set her mind upon a &quot;chest of drawers,&quot;
and now that that particular piece of furniture stood proudly
in her room, much of her day was given to polishing it and
the half-dozen stuffed bottomed chairs, which were the envy
of every housewife in the village. A large oval mirror stood
upon the top of the drawers, and was draped with a piece of
cheap curtain cloth, bleached to the whiteness of new fallen
snow.</p>

<p>This mirror was a much-prized possession, for no other like
it had ever been known in the village. The floor was covered
with oilcloth, and a sheepskin rug lay upon the hearthstone,
while white starched curtains draped the window. The getting
of the waxcloth had been a wonderful event, and dozens of
women had come from all over the village to stand in gaping
admiration of its beauty. This was always where Mrs. Sinclair
felt a thrill of great pride.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye see,&quot; she would explain, &quot;it's awfu' easy to wash, and
a bit wipe owre wi' soap an' watter is a' it needs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My, how weel aff ye are!&quot; one woman would exclaim, &quot;I'm
telt that ye maunna use a scrubbin' brush on't, or the pattern
will rub off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ay,&quot; Nellie would laugh with a hint of superior wisdom
in it. &quot;Ye'll soon waste it gin ye took a scrubber to it. An'
ye maunna use owre hot water to it either,&quot; she would add.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my!&quot; would come in genuine surprise. &quot;Do you tell
me that. Eh, but you're the weel-aff woman now, to hae a
room like that, an' rale waxcloth on the floor!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thocht it was a fine, cheerie bit thing,&quot; Nellie would say.
&quot;It mak's the hoose ever so much mair heartsome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it is,&quot; would come the reply. &quot;It's a fine, but cheerie
thing. You're a rale weel-aff woman, I can tell ye,&quot; and the
woman would go home to dream of one day having a room like
Mrs. Sinclair's, and to tell her neighbors of the great
&quot;grandeur&quot; that the Sinclair's possessed, whilst Nellie would
set to, and rub and polish those drawers and that mirror, and
the stuff-bottomed chairs till they shone like the sun upon a
moorland tarn, and she herself felt like dropping from sheer
exhaustion.</p>

<p>She even took to telling the neighbors sometimes, when they
came on those visits that &quot;working folk should a' hae coal-houses,
for coal kept ablow the beds makes an awfu' mess o'
the ticks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, weel,&quot; would be the reply, made with the usual sigh of
resignation, &quot;I hae had a house a gey lang while now, an' I
dinna think I've ever wanted ony sic newfangled things as
that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what's wrang,&quot; Mrs. Sinclair would reply. &quot;We
dinna want them. If we did, we'd soon get them. What way
would the gentry hae a' thae things, an' us hae nane?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a' richt, Nellie,&quot; would be the reply. &quot;We wadna
ken what to do wi' what the gentry has got. They're rich an'
can afford it, an' forby they need them an' we don't. I think
I'm fine as I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine as ye are!&quot; with bitter scorn in her tones. &quot;Ye'll
never be fine wi' a mind like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wheesht, woman Nellie! You're no feart. Dinna talk like
that. We micht a' be strucken doon dead!&quot;</p>

<p>This usually ended the discussion, for Scots people generally&mdash;and
the workers especially&mdash;are always on very intimate
terms with the Deity, and know the pains and penalties of too
intimate allusions to His power.</p>

<p>Yet, with all her discontent, Mrs. Sinclair found life very
much easier than it had been, for now that she had some of
the boys started to work, she had made her house &quot;respectable,&quot;
and added many little comforts, besides having a &quot;bit
pound or twa lyin' in the store.&quot; So she looked ahead with
more hope and a more serene heart. Her children were well-fed
and clothed, and the old days of hunger and struggling
were over, she thought. Geordie was now taking a day off
in the middle of the week to rest, as there was no need for
him to slave and toil every day as he had done in the past.
After all it would only be a very few years till he would no
longer be able to work at all.</p>

<p>Rosy looked the future then, as Mrs. Sinclair, on the day on
which young Robert went down the pit, showed off her room
&quot;grandeur&quot; to an admiring neighbor.</p>

<p>&quot;My, what braw paper ye hae, Nellie. Wha put it on for
ye? Was it yirsel'?&quot; asked the visitor with breath bated in
admiration.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it was that. I just got the chance o' the bargain,
an' I thocht I'd tak' it,&quot; she replied, with subdued pride.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my! it's awful braw, an' sae weel matched too! I
never saw anything sae well done. You're rale weel-off, do
ye ken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My God! What's wrang?&quot; cried Nellie suddenly, gazing
from the window with blanched cheeks.</p>

<p>&quot;I doot there's been an accident. I heard the bell gang for
men three tows a' rinnin', an' I see a lot o' men comin' up the
brae. I doot the pit's lowsed.&quot;</p>

<p>Both of them hurried to the door, and found that already
a crowd of women had flocked to the end of the row, and
were standing waiting anxiously on the men, in order to learn
what had happened. They did not talk, but gazed down the
hill, each heart anxious to know if the unfortunate one belonged
to her. The sickening fear which grips the heart of
every miner's wife, when she sees that procession from the pit
before the proper quitting hour, lay heavy upon each one.
The white drawn faces, the set firm lips, and the deep troubled
breathing told how much the women were moved.</p>

<p>Wives and mothers, sweethearts and sisters, oh, what a hell
of torture they suffered in those few tense moments whilst
waiting for the news, which, though to a great extent it may
relieve many, must break at least one heart. No man, having
once seen this, ever wants to witness it again. Concentrated
hell and torture with every moment, stabbing and pulling at
each heart and then&mdash;then the sad, mournful face of Andrew
Marshall as he steps forward slowly past Mag Robertson, past
Jean Fleming, past Jenny Maitland, past them all, and at last
putting a kindly hand on the shoulder of Nellie Sinclair, he
says, with a catch in his voice that would break a heart of
granite: &quot;Come awa' hame, Nellie. Come awa' hame. Ye'll
need to bear up.&quot;</p>

<p>Then it is whispered round: &quot;It's Geordie Sinclair killed
wi' a fa'.&quot; And hope has died, and dreams have fled, and
the world will never again look bonnie and fresh and sweet
and full of happiness, nor the blood dance so joyously, nor
the eyes ever again sparkle with the same soft loving glance.</p>

<p>No more happy evenings, such as the night before had been,
when the glamor and romance of courtship days had come
back, and they had found a new beauty of love and the glory
of life, in the easier circumstances and rosy hopes ahead.</p>

<p>Misery and suffering, and the long keen pain, the sad cheerless
prospect, and over all the empty life and the broken heart.</p>

<p>Lowwood was plunged into gloom when the news of the accident
was known, and every heart went out in sympathy to
Nellie Sinclair and her young family. It was indeed a terrible
blow to lose at one and the same time her husband and her
eldest boy.</p>

<p>It was two days later, and the bodies had not yet been recovered.
Men toiled night and day, working as only miners
fighting for life can work, risking life among the continually
falling d&eacute;bris to recover all that remained of their comrades.</p>

<p>&quot;It couldna ha'e been worse,&quot; said Jenny Maitland sorrowfully
to her next door neighbor. &quot;It's an awfu' blow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; rejoined her neighbor, applying the corner of her
apron to her eyes. &quot;It mak's it worse them no' bein' gotten
yet. I think I'd gae wrang in the mind if that happened to our
yin,&quot; and then, completely overcome, she sat down on the
doorstep and sobbed in real sorrow.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it's an awfu' big fall. He had been workin' on
the top o' some auld workin's, an' I suppose they wadna ken,
an' it fell in. It maun hae been an awfu' trial for wee Rob,
poor wee man. His first day in the pit, an' his father an'
brither killed afore his een!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoo has Nellie taken it, Jenny?&quot; enquired the neighbor,
after a little, when her sobs had subsided.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye'd break yir heart if ye could see her,&quot; replied Jenny
sorrowfully. &quot;I gaed owre when oor yin gaed out wi' the
pieces&mdash;he cam' hame at fower o'clock to get mair pieces, for
they're goin' to work on to ten the nicht&mdash;an' I never saw
onything sae sad-lookin' as her face. She has never cried the
least thing yet. Never a tear has come frae her, but she'd be
better if she could greet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do ye tell me that! Puir Nellie! It's an awfu' hand fu'
she is left wi', too,&quot; commented the neighbor.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, she jist looks at ye sae sad-like wi' her big black een;
never a word nor a tear, but just stares, an' she's that thin an'
white lookin'. I look for her breakin' doon a'thegither, an'
when she does I wadna like to see her. The bits o' weans gang
aboot the hoose wonderin' at her, and she looks to them too,
but ye'd think she'd nae interest in onything. She jist looks
out o' the window an' doon the brae to the pit. It's awesome
to look at her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, puir body!&quot; and again the kindly neighbor was overcome,
and Jenny joined her tears too in silent sympathy.</p>

<p>&quot;The minister was owre last nicht,&quot; said Jenny after a little,
&quot;but I dinna think she ever spoke to him. He cam' in just
when I was comin' oot, an' I dinna like to leave her. He
talked away a wee while an' then put up a prayer; but there
was nae consolation in't for onybody. I think the sicht o' her
face maun hae been too muckle for him. He didna stay very
lang, and gaed awa' saying he'd come back again. Nellie
has everything ready&mdash;the bed a' made, wi' clean sheets an'
blankets on them&mdash;an' there she stan's always at that window,
lookin' doon the brae. It would break yer heart to see her,
Leezie, she's that vexed lookin'.&quot; So they wept and sorrowed
together.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Down in the pit, Andrew Marshall, Matthew Maitland,
Peter Pegg, and a number of others toiled like giants possessed.
Their naked bodies streamed with sweat and glistened in the
light of their lamps. Timber was placed in position, and driven
tight with desperation in every blow from their hammers;
blocks of rock were tossed aside, and smashed into fragments,
ere being filled into the tubs which were ever waiting ready
to convey the d&eacute;bris to the pit-head. Few words were spoken,
except when a warning shout was given, when some loose rubble
poured down from the great gaping cavern in the roof, and
then men jumped and sprang to safety with the agility of
desperation, to wait till the rumbling had ceased, only to leap
back again into the yawning hell, tearing at the stones, and
trying to work their way into the place where they knew Geordie
and the boy were lying. It seemed impossible that human
efforts would ever be able to clear that mountain away.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute, callans,&quot; said Andrew, almost dropping
with exhaustion, and drawing his hands across his eyes to
wipe the sweat from them, whilst he &quot;hunkered&quot; down, his
back against a broken tree which stood jutting out from the
building, supporting a broken &quot;baton&quot; (cross-tree), which bent
down in the center, making the roadway low and unsafe. &quot;Let
us tak a minute's thocht, and see if we can get a way o' chokin'
up that stuff fear fallin' doon. We'll never get it redd up goin'
like this.&quot;</p>

<p>So they sat down, tired but still desperate, to listen to each
one suggesting a way of stopping the d&eacute;bris from continuing
to fall. Baffled and at their wits' end, they could think of
nothing.</p>

<p>At last in came a number of other men to relieve them&mdash;men
equally anxious and desperate as they, burning with the
desire to get to grips with this calamity which had come upon
two of their comrades.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm no' goin' hame,&quot; said Andrew decisively, &quot;till I see
Geordie out.&quot; He was almost dropping with exhaustion, but
he could not think of leaving his dead friend in there. So at
last it was agreed that he should stay, and at least give the
benefit of his advice. The others, more tired than ever they
had been before in all their experience of the mines, where
hard work is the rule, trudged wearily home, to be met by the
waiting groups of women and children, who at all times stood
at the corners of the village eagerly asking for news, &quot;If
they'd been gotten yet.&quot;</p>

<p>After a few minutes' deliberation a plan was decided on by
Andrew and his comrades of trying to choke up the hole in
the roof with timber, and the work went on desperately, silently,
heroically. Time and again their efforts were baffled by
new falls, but always the same persistent eager spirit drove
them back to their toil. So they worked, risking and daring
things of which no man who never saw a like calamity has any
conception, and which would have appalled themselves at any
other time.</p>

<p>&quot;Look out, boys,&quot; called Tam Donaldson, springing back to
the road as the warning noise again began, and great masses
of rock came hurtling down, filling the place with dust and
noise.</p>

<p>A cry of pain and horror broke upon them as they ran, and
brought them back while the crumbling mass was still falling.</p>

<p>&quot;Great God! It's wee Jamie Allan,&quot; roared one man
above the din. &quot;He's catched by the leg! Here, boys, hurry
up! Try an' get this block broken afore ony mair comes doon.
God Almichty! Are we a' goin' to be buried thegither?
This bit, boys! Quick!&quot; And they tore at the great masses of
stone, the sweat streaming from every pore of their bodies,
cursing their impotence as they smashed with big hammers the
rock which lay upon Jamie's leg.</p>

<p>&quot;Mind yersel's, laddies!&quot; warned Jamie, as again the trickling
noise began, heralding another fall. &quot;Leave me, for God's
sake, an' get back!&quot; But not one heeded. Desperate and
strong with the strength of giants, they toiled on, the sight
of suffering so manifest in Jamie's eyes, as he strove not to cry
out, spurring them onward.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye'll never lift that bit, Tam,&quot; said Jamie, as four of them
tore at the block which lay upon his leg. &quot;It's faur too big.
Take an ax an' hack the leg off. I doot it'll be wasted anyway.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&quot; And unable longer to endure
the pain, he roared aloud in agony, and tore at the stone himself
with his fingers, like an imprisoned beast in a trap.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, boys, quick!&quot; cried Andrew, getting his long pinch
in below the stone, upon a fine leverage. &quot;Put yir weight
on this, Tam, an' Jock an' Sanny'll try an' pull Jamie out.
Hurry up, for she's working for anither collapse. A'thegither!&quot;
and so they tugged and tore, and strained and pulled,
while the roars of the imprisoned man were deafening.</p>

<p>&quot;A'thegither again, laddies!&quot; encouraged Andrew. &quot;This
time!&quot; and with a tremendous effort the stone gave way, and
Jamie was pulled clear, his leg a crushed mass of pulpy blood
and shattered bones. They dragged him back clear of any
further falls, and improvised a stretcher on which to carry
home his now unconscious body.</p>

<p>&quot;That was a hell o' a narrow shave,&quot; quietly observed Tam
Donaldson, as they panted together, and tried to collect themselves.
&quot;His leg's wasted, I doot, an' will need to come off.&quot;
When they had their stretcher ready, the wounded man was
tenderly placed upon it, carefully covered up with the jackets
of the others; whilst half-a-dozen of them carried him to the
pit bottom, and finally bore him home, where the doctor was
ready waiting to attend to him.</p>

<p>Andrew and a few others worked away, and at last managed
to get the running sore in the roof choked up with long bars
of timber, and even though it continued to rumble away above
them, the heavy blocks of wood held, and so allowed them to
work away in comparative safety.</p>

<p>Peter Pegg and Matthew Maitland returned at six o'clock
next morning, bringing with them another band of workers to
relieve those who had worked all night, but still Andrew Marshall
would not leave the scene of the disaster. He worked
and rested by turns, advising and guiding the younger men,
who never spared themselves. They performed mighty epics
of work down there in the darkness amid the rumbling, falling
roof. It was a great task they were set, but they never
shirked the consequences. They never turned back. Risks
were taken and accepted without a thought; tasks were eagerly
jumped to, and the whole job accepted as if it were just what
ordinarily they were asked to do.</p>

<p>Crash went the hammers; thump went the great blocks of
material into the tubs, and the men quietly got away the tubs
as they were filled. Night and day the great work went on,
never ceasing, persistent, relentless. If one man dropped out a
minute to breathe and rest when exhausted, another sprang
into his place, and toiled and strove like an engine.</p>

<p>There was something great and inspiring even to look on
at those mighty efforts&mdash;something exhilarating and elevating
in the play of muscles like great long shooting serpents under
the glistening skins of the men. Arms shot out, tugged and
tore, jerked and wrenched, then doubled up and the muscles
became knots, bulging out as if they would break through the
skin, as the great blocks were lifted; and then the blocks were
cast into the tub, the knots untied themselves, and slipped
elastically back into their places, and the serpents were momentarily
at rest until the body bent again to another block.
Out and in they flew, supple and silent, quick as lightning
playing in the heavens; they zig-zagged and shot this way and
that, tying and untying themselves, darting out and doubling
back, advancing and retiring in rhythmic action, graceful and
easy, powerful and inevitable. Bending and rising, the swaying
bodies gleamed and glistened with greasy dust and sweat,
catching the gleams from the lamps and reflecting them in
every streaming pore. Straining and tearing, the muscles, at
every slightest wish, seemed to exude energy and health, glowing
strength and power.</p>

<p>It was all so natural and apparently easy&mdash;an epic in moleskin
and human flesh, with only the little glimmer of oil-lamps,
which darted from side to side in a mad mazurka of toil, crossing
and recrossing, swinging and halting, the flames flattening
out with every heave of their owners' bodies, then abruptly
being brought to the steady again. Looked at from the road-foot,
it was like a carnival of fireflies engaged in trying how
quickly they could dart from side to side, and cross each
other's path, without coming into collision.</p>

<p>Who shall sing in lyrical language the exhilaration of such
splendid men's work? Who shall catch that glow of strength
and health, and work it into deathless song? The ring of the
hammers on the stone, the dull regular thud upon the timber,
the crash of breaking rock, and the strong, warm-blooded, generous-hearted
men; the passionate glowing bodies, and above
all, the great big heroic souls, fighting, working, striving in a
hell of hunger and death, toiling till one felt they were gods
instead of humans&mdash;gods of succor and power, gods of helpfulness
and strength.</p>

<p>So the work went on hour after hour, and now their efforts
were beginning to tell. No more came the rumbling, treacherous
falls; but perceptibly, irresistibly was the passage gradually
cleared, and the way opened up, until it seemed as if these
men were literally eating their way into that rock-filled passage.</p>

<p>&quot;Can ye tell me where Black Jock is a' this time?&quot; enquired
Andrew, as Peter and Matthew and he sat back the road, resting
while the others worked. &quot;Rundell has been here twa or
three times, for hours at a time, but I hae never seen Walker
yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hae never seen him either, an' I was hearin' that he was
badly,&quot; returned Peter, and his big eye seemed to turn as if
it were looking for and expecting some one to slip up behind
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; broke in Matthew, &quot;badly! I wadna say, but it
micht be that he's badly; but maybe he's not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do ye ken, boys,&quot; said Andrew quietly, taking his pipe out
of his mouth, and speaking with slow deliberation, &quot;I'm beginnin'
to think Black Jock is guilty o' Geordie's death.
Geordie, as we a' ken, had ay something against Walker. There
was something he kent aboot the black brute that lately kept
him gey quiet; for, if ye noticed, whenever Geordie went to
him about anybody's complaint, the men aye won. I ken
Walker hated him, an' I'm inclined to think that he has deliberately
put Geordie into this place, kennin' that the lower
seam had been worked out lang, lang syne. His plans wad
tell him as muckle about the workin's, and I ken, at least,
he's never been in Geordie's place since it was started, an'
there's nae ither places drivin' up sae far as this. They're a'
stoppit afore they come this length; an' forby, frae what Rundell
has let drap the day, he never kent that the coal was
being worked as far up as this. By &mdash;&mdash;! Peter, gin I could
prove what I suspect, I'd murder the dirty brute this nicht!
I would that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would Nellie no' ken, think ye, what it was that Geordie
had against Black Jock that kept him sae quiet?&quot; enquired
Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;I couldna' say,&quot; answered Andrew, &quot;but some day when I
get the chance I'll maybe ask her, an' if it is as I think, then
there'll be rows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me ken, Andrew,&quot; broke in Matthew. &quot;Let me ken if
ever ye discover onything; an' ye can count on me sharin' the
penalties o' hell alang wi' ye for the murder o' the big black
brute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard,&quot; said Peter, &quot;that he was boozin' wi' Mag Robertson
and Sanny. But we'll no' be long in kennin', for ill-doin'
canna hide.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After three frantic days of fighting against calamity, during
which Andrew never left the fight except for that brief journey
to tell Nellie the news, at last they came upon the crushed
mass of bloody pulp and rags, smashed together so that the
one could not be told from the other&mdash;father and son, a heap
of broken bones and flesh and blood.... And no pen can
describe accurately the scene.</p>

<p>The light had gone out from one woman's heart, the hope
had been crushed from her life. The rainbow which had promised
so much vanished. The lust and urge had gone out
of eager life. Never again would the world seem fair and
beautiful. Instead, all the weary fight and desperate battle
with poverty and privation over again; the dull misery and
the drab gray existence, and always the pain&mdash;the heavy, dragging
pain of a broken life. With a woman's &quot;Oh! my God!&quot;
the world for one heart stood still, and the blind fate of things
triumphed, crushing a woman's soul in the process.</p>

<h2>THE STRIKE</h2>


<p>A week had passed, and Geordie Sinclair and his boy,
or at least all that could be gathered up of them, had
been laid to rest.</p>

<p>Nellie was very ill, and was now in bed. The reaction had
been too much for her. But, as Jenny Maitland had said:
&quot;She's never cried yet, an' it would hae been better gin she
had. She jist looked at ye wi' her big black e'en sae vexed-like
and faraway lookin', an' never spoke hardly. When they
carried out the coffins, she sprang up gin she wad follow them,
but was putten back to bed again. It was heart-vexin' to look
at her.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert suffered, too. The sympathy of everyone went out
to him. At night when he went to bed the whole scene was
re&euml;nacted before him in all its horror. Those tense moments
of tragedy had so powerfully impressed his boyish mind that
he could never forget them.</p>

<p>At the end of the week Andrew Marshall visited them to
talk over matters. A collection had been made at the pay-office
by the men employed at the pit, and a beautiful wreath
purchased and placed upon the grave. A substantial balance
had been handed over to Mrs. Sinclair, and this defrayed the
expenses of the funeral. After Andrew had spoken of various
things, he broke on to the object of his errand that night.</p>

<p>&quot;I hae been thinkin', Nellie,&quot; he began nervously, &quot;that I
could tak' Rob in wi' me. Ye see, I ha'e no callans o' my ain,
and I ha'e aye to get yin to draw off me. So, gin ye're agreeable,
I could tak' Rob, an' I'll be guid to him. He can come
an' be my neighbor, an' as he'll hae to get work in ony case,
he micht as weel work wi' me as wi' ony ither body. Forby
I'll maybe be able to pay him mair than plenty ithers could
pay him, an' that is efter a' the point to be maist considered.
What do ye think?&quot;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Sinclair could not think; she merely indicated to
him that he might please himself and make his own arrangements
with the boy, which Andrew did, and Robert went to
work with him the following week. He was a mass of nerves
and was horribly afraid&mdash;indeed, this fear never left him for
years&mdash;but, young as he was, he recognized his responsibility,
to his mother and the rest of the family. He was now its head,
and had to shoulder the burden of providing for it, and
so his will drove him to work in the pit, when his soul revolted
at the very thought of it. Always the horror of the
tragedy was with him, down to its smallest detail; and sometimes,
even at work, when his mind wandered for a moment
from his immediate task, he would start up in terror, almost
crying out again as he had done on the day of the accident.</p>

<p>Andrew kept his word and was good to the boy now in his
care. Indeed, he took, as some said, more care of the boy than
if Robert had been his own, for he tried to save him from every
little detail that might remind him of the accident.</p>

<p>&quot;That's yours, Robin,&quot; he said, when pay-day came, as he
handed to the boy the half of the pay earned.</p>

<p>&quot;Na, I canna' tak' that, Andrew,&quot; replied Robert, looking
up into the broad, kindly, honest face of the man. &quot;My mither
wouldna' let me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would she no'?&quot; replied Andrew. &quot;But you are the heid
o' the hoose, Robin, sae just tak' it hame, an' lay it down on
the dresser-head. We are doin' gey weel the noo, an' forby,
ye're workin' for it. Noo run awa' hame wi't, an' dinna say
ocht to yir mither, but just put it doon on the dresser-head.&quot;
And so the partnership began which was to last for many years.</p>

<p>About this time there happened one of those tremendous upheavals,
long remembered in the industrial world, the great
Scottish Miners' Strike of 1894. The trade union movement
was growing and fighting, and every tendency pointed to the
fact that a clash of forces was inevitable. The previous year
had seen the English miners beaten after a protracted struggle.
They had come out for an increase in wages, and whilst it was
recognized that they had been beaten and forced to go back
to work suffering wholesale reductions, yet a newer perspective
was beginning to appear to the miners of Scotland.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll never be able to beat the maisters,&quot; said Tam Donaldson,
when the cloud first appeared upon the industrial horizon.
&quot;The English strike gied us a lesson we shouldna forget.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How's that?&quot; enquired Peter Pegg, as he sat down on his
hunkers one night at the end of the row, while they discussed
the prospects of the coming fight.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, ye saw how the Englishmen fought unitedly, an' yet
they were beaten, an' had to gang back on a reduction. We'll
very likely be the same, for the maisters are a' weel organized.
What we should do is to ha'e England an' Scotland coming out
together, an' let the pits stan' then till the grass was growin'
owre the whorles. That would be my way o' it, and I think
it would soon bring the country to see what was in the wind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's richt, Tam. It would soon bring the hale country
to its senses; for nae matter what oor fight is, we are aye in
the wrang wi' some folk; so the shock o' the hale country
comin' out would mak' them tak' notice, an' would work the
cure.&quot;</p>

<p>So they talked of newer plans, while Smillie toiled like a
giant to educate and organize the miners. He had taken hold
of them as crude material, and was slowly shaping them into
something like unity. A few more years and he would win;
but the forces against him knew it, too, and so followed the
great fight which lasted for seventeen weeks.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, while there was undoubtedly much privation,
there was not very much real misery, as the strike had
started early in a warm, dry summer.</p>

<p>Communal kitchens were at once established throughout the
country. Everybody did his best, and the womenfolk especially
toiled early and late. A committee was appointed in
each village to gather in materials. Beef at a reasonable price
was supplied by a local butcher. A horse and cart were borrowed,
which went round the district gathering a cabbage or
two here; a few carrots or turnips there, parsley at another,
and so on, returning at night invariably laden with vegetables
for the next day's dinner. Sometimes a farmer would give a
sheep, and the local cooperative society provided the bread at
half the cost of production. Those farmers who were hostile
gave nothing, but it would have paid them better had they
concealed their hostility, for sometimes, even in a single night,
large portions of a field of potatoes would disappear as by
magic.</p>

<p>Robert worked in this fight like a man. He helped to cut
down trees and saw them into logs, to cook the food at the
soup kitchen. Everything and anything he tried, running errands,
and even going with the van to solicit material for the
following day's meals.</p>

<p>All were cheerful, and no one seemed to take the fight bitterly.
Sports were organized. Quoiting tournaments were got
up, football matches arranged, games at rounders and hand-ball&mdash;every
conceivable game was indulged in, with sometimes
a few coppers as prizes but more often a few ounces of tobacco
or tea or a packet of sugar. Dances in the evenings were
started at the corner of the row to the strains of a melodeon,
and were carried on to the early hours of the morning. It
was from these gatherings that the young lads generally raided
the fields and hen runs of the hostile farmers, returning with
eggs, butter, potatoes, and even cheese&mdash;everything on which
they could lay their hands.</p>

<p>At one of these gatherings Robert related his experience with
&quot;auld Hairyfithill.&quot; Robert had been round with the van that
day, and calling at Wilson's, or Hairyfithill Farm, to ask if
they had any cabbage to give, he heard the old man calling to
the servant lass: &quot;Mag! Mag! Where are ye? Rin an' bring
in the hens' meat; there's thae colliers coming.&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Robert had gone into the kitchen to ask
if they had anything to give the strikers.</p>

<p>&quot;Get awa' back to yer work, ye lazy loons, ye!&quot; was the
reply from old Mr. Wilson. &quot;Gie ye something for your soup
kitchen! Na, na! Ye can gang an' work, an' pay for your
meat. Gang awa' oot owre, and leave the town, an' dinna
come back again.&quot; And so they had drawn blank at Hairyfithill.</p>

<p>&quot;It wad serve him richt, if every tattie in his fields was ta'en
awa',&quot; said Matthew Maitland, after the story had been told
and laughed over.</p>

<p>&quot;It wad that,&quot; agreed a score of voices; but nothing was
done nor anything further said, so the dancing proceeded.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning while the dancing was
still going on and a fire had been kindled at the corner in
which some of the strikers were roasting potatoes and onions
a great commotion was suddenly caused, when Dickie Tamson
and two other boys drove in among them old Hairyfithill's sow
which he was fattening for the market. Some proposed that
the pig be killed at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, dinna kill it,&quot; said Matthew Maitland, with real
alarm in his voice. &quot;Ye'd get into a row for that. Ye'd better
tak' it back, or there may be fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kill the damn'd thing,&quot; said Tam Donaldson callously, &quot;an'
it'll maybe a lesson to the auld sot. Him an' his hens' meat!
I'd let him ken that it's no' hens' meat the collier eats&mdash;at
least no' so lang as he can get pork.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's jist what I think, too, Tam,&quot; put in another voice.
&quot;I'd mak' sure work that the collier ate pork for yince. Come
on, boys, an' mum's the word,&quot; and he proceeded to drive the
pig further along the village, followed by a few enthusiastic
backers. They drove it into Granny Fleming's hen-house in
the middle of the square, put out the hens, who protested
loudly against this rude and incomprehensible interruption of
their slumbers, and then they proceeded to slaughter the pig.</p>

<p>It was a horrible orgy, and the pig made a valiant protest,
but encountered by hammers and picks, knives and such-like
weapons, the poor animal was soon vanquished, and the men
proceeded to cut up its carcass. It was a long and trying
ordeal for men who had no experience of the work; yet they
made up in enthusiasm what they lacked in science, and by
five o'clock the pig was cut up and distributed through a score
of homes. Every trace of the slaughter was removed, and the
refuse buried in the village midden, and pork was the principal
article on the breakfast table that morning in Lowwood.</p>

<p>&quot;I hear that auld Hairyfithill has offered five pound reward
for information about his pig,&quot; said Tam Donaldson a few
mornings later.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' it's a gran' price for onybody wha kens aboot it,&quot;
said auld Jamie Lauder. &quot;Pork maun hae risen in price this
last twa-three days, for I'm telt it was gaun cheap enough
then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is true,&quot; said Tam, &quot;but it was a damn'd shame to
tak' the auld man's pig awa', whaever did it. But I hear them
saying that the polisman is gaun to the farm the nicht to
watch, so that the tatties 'll no' be stolen,&quot; he went on, as
some of the younger men joined them, &quot;an' I suppose that
the puir polisman hasna' a bit o' coal left in his coal-house. It's
no' richt, ye ken, laddies, that a polisman, who is the representative
o' law and order in this place, should sit without a
fire. He has a wife an' weans to worry aboot, an' they need
a fire to mak' meat. Maybe if he had a fire an' plenty o'
coal it wad mak' him comfortable, an' then he'd no' be sae
ready to leave the hoose at nicht an' lie in a tattie pit to watch
thievin' colliers. If a man hasna' peace in his mind it'll mak'
him nasty, an' we canna' allow sic a thing as a nasty polisman
in this district!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's richt, Tam,&quot; said one of the younger men. &quot;It
would be a shame to see a woman an' twa-three weans sittin'
withoot a fire an' a great big bing o' coal lyin' doon there at
the pit. We maun try an' keep the polisman comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p>That night the policeman without in any way trying to
conceal his purpose walked down through the village and across
the strip of moor and took up his position at the end of Hairyfithill's
potato field. At once a group of young men led by
Tam Donaldson set off with bags under their arms after it was
dark for the pit at the other end of the village and were soon
engaged in carrying coal as if their lives depended on it.</p>

<p>&quot;Noo, lads, the first bag gangs to the polisman, mind,&quot; said
Tam, shouldering his load and walking off.</p>

<p>&quot;A' richt, Tam. If we a' gang wi' the first bag to him
that'll be nine bags, then we can get two or three bags for
hame. Dinna hurry; we ha'e a' nicht to carry, an' we can get
in a fine lot afore daylicht breaks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's richt,&quot; said Tam, &quot;but mind an' no' tire yersels too
much, for ye've a nicht at the tatties the morn. The polis'll
be at the bing the morn's nicht efter this carry-on, an' when
he is busy watchin' for coal thieves, we maun see that we get
in a denner or twa o' tatties. I heard him sayin' he could not
be everywhere at yince, an' couldna' both watch coal thieves
an' tattie stealin' at yin an' the same time.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>All this time matters went very smoothly. The men were
very firm, having great trust in Smillie. After about six weeks,
however, from various causes a suspicious atmosphere began
to be created. Hints had been appearing from time to time in
the newspapers that matters were not altogether as the miners
thought they were. Then vague rumors got afloat in many
districts and spread with great rapidity, and these began to
undermine the confidence of the strikers.</p>

<p>&quot;What think ye o' the fecht noo, Tam?&quot; enquired Matthew
Maitland one night as they sat among the others at the &quot;Lazy
Corner,&quot; as the village forum was called.</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna ken what to think o' it,&quot; replied Tam glumly.
&quot;Do ye think there's any truth in that story aboot Smillie
havin' sell't us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It wad be hard to ken,&quot; replied Matthew Maitland, taking
his pipe out of his mouth and spitting savagely upon the
ground. &quot;But I heard it for a fact, and that a guid wheen
o' men doon the country hae gaen back to their work through
it. An' yet, mind ye, Smillie seemed to me to be a straight-forret
man an' yin that was sincere. Still, ye can never tell;
an' twa-three hunner pound's a big temptation to a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said Tam dryly, &quot;we hae been diddled sae often wi'
bigmoothed men on the make, that it mak's a body ay suspicious
when yin hears thae stories. I heard Wiston, the coal-maister,
had gien him five hunner pounds on the quiet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard that too,&quot; replied Matthew, &quot;but, like you, I'm loth
to think it o' Smillie. I'd believe it quicker aboot yon ither
chiel, Charlie Rogerson. He comes oot to speak to us ay
dressed in a black dress-suit, wi' white cuffs doon to his finger
nebs, his gold ring, his lum hat, an' a' his fal-de-lals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, I dinna believe a word o' this story aboot Bob,&quot;
said Robert quietly, who had &quot;hunkered&quot; down beside the two
men who sat so earnestly discussing matters while the others
went on with their games and dancing.</p>

<p>&quot;Do ye no', Rob?&quot; said Tam.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I do not,&quot; was the firm reply, &quot;for nae matter what
happens in a fight, it's ay the opeenion o' some folk that the
men ha'e been sell't.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert, though young, took a keen interest in the fight.
While other lads of his age looked upon it as a fine holiday,
the heavy responsibilities he had to face gave him a different
outlook, and so the men seemed to recognize that he was different
from the other boys, and more sober in his view-point.</p>

<p>&quot;This story is set aboot for the purpose o' breakin' oup the
men,&quot; he continued. &quot;We hear o' Smillie haein hale rows o'
cottages bought, an' a lot ither rubbish, but I wouldna believe
it. It's a' to get the men to gang back to their work; an' if
they do that, it'll no' only break the strike, but it'll break up
the union, an' that's what's wanted mair than anything else.
I've heard Smillie an' my faither talkin' aboot a' thae things
lang syne, an' Smillie says that's what the stories are set aboot
for. We should ha'e sense enough no' to heed them, for I
dinna think Smillie has sell't us at a'.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a fine, firm ring in the boy's voice as he spoke
which moved the two older men, and made them feel a little
ashamed that they had been so ready to doubt.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, weel, Rob,&quot; said Tam, &quot;maybe you are richt, but a
lot o' men ha'e gaen back to their work already, an' it'll break
up the strike if it spreads. But we'll ha'e to get some tatties
in the nicht; the polisman's goin' to be watchin' auld Burnfoot's
hen-hoose, sae it'll be a grand chance for some tatties,&quot;
and the talk drifted on to another subject.</p>

<p>About the eighth week of the strike the news went round the
village that Sanny Robertson and Peter Fleming were &quot;oot at
the pit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wad smash every bone in their dirty bodies if I had my
way o' it. I would,&quot; said Matthew Maitland, with emphasis.
Matthew was always emphatic in all he said, though seldom so
in what he did.</p>

<p>&quot;But we'll ha'e to watch hoo we act,&quot; said Andrew Marshall
more cautiously. &quot;It's agin the law, ye ken, to use force.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wadna' gi'e a damn,&quot; said Peter Pegg, his big eye making
frantic efforts to wink. &quot;I wad see that they blacklegged nae
mair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sae wad I,&quot; promptly exclaimed half a dozen of the younger
men.</p>

<p>&quot;We maun see that they don't do it ony mair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' I hope we'll mak' sure work that they sleep in for
twa-three mornin's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell ye what,&quot; said old Lauder, &quot;let us get a few weemin'
and weans thegither, an' we'll gang doon to the pit an' wait
on them comin' up frae their shift. The bairns can get tin cans
an' a stane for a drumstick, an' we'll ha'e a loonie band. We
can sing twa or three o' thae blackleg sangs o' Tam Donaldson's,
an' play them hame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the plan, Jamie,&quot; replied Tam, who had suddenly
seen himself immortalized through his parodies of certain popular
songs. &quot;Let us get as mony women an' callans as possible,
and we can mak' a damn'd guid turnout. We'll sing like
linties, an' drum like thunder, an' the blacklegs'll feel as if
they were goin' through Purgatory to the tune o':&quot;</p>

<p>
Tattie Wullie, Tattie Wullie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tattie Wullie Shaw,</span><br />
Where's the sense o' workin', Wullie?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faith, ye're lookin' braw.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peter, man, I say,</span><br />

Peter Fleming, Peter Fleming,<br />

</p>

<p>With little difficulty a band of men, women and children was
organized and proceeded to the pit to await the coming up of
the culprits. Hour after hour they waited patiently, determined
not to miss them, and the time was spent in light jesting
and singing ribald songs.</p>

<p>&quot;I wadna' like if my faither was a blackleg,&quot; observed Mysie
Maitland to the girl next her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, nor me, either!&quot; quickly agreed the other. &quot;It wad
be awfu' to hear folk cryin' 'Blackleg' after yir faither, wadna'
it, Mysie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; was the reply. &quot;I wadna' like it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They should a' be hunted oot o' the place,&quot; put in
Robert, who was standing near. &quot;They are just sellin' the
rest o' the men, an' helpin' to break up the strike. So ye
mind, Mysie, hoo Tam Graham's lass aye clashed on the rest
o' us on the pit-head? She's just like her faither, ay ready to
do onything agin the rest, if it would gi'e her a wee bit favor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, fine I mind o' it, Rob,&quot; Mysie replied eagerly. &quot;Do ye
mind the day she was goin' to tell aboot you takin' hame the
bit auld stick for firewood? When I telt her if she did, I'd
tell on her stealin' the tallow frae the engine-house an' the
paraffin ile ay when she got the chance. She didna say she'd
tell then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Mysie. Maybe I'd ha'e gotten the sack if she had telt.
But she was aye a clashbag. But here they come!&quot; he shouted
animatedly, as the bell signaled for the cage to rise, and presently
the wheels began to revolve, as the cage ascended.</p>

<p>&quot;May the tow break, an' land the dirty scums in hell,&quot;
prayed one man.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' may the coals they howkit the day roast them
forever,&quot; added another. Though they prayed thus, yet once
again they found that the &quot;prayer of the wicked availeth
naught.&quot; Buckets of water, however, and even bits of stone
and scrap iron were surreptitiously flung down the shaft; and
when the blacklegs did appear, they were nearly frightened out
of their senses. It would have gone hard with them as they
left the cage, but someone whispered, &quot;Here's the polis!&quot; and
so the crowd had to be content with beating their tin cans;
and keeping time to the songs improvised by Tam Donaldson,
they escorted the blacklegs to their homes.</p>

<p>Next morning a large number of the strikers gathered at the
Lazy Corner, enjoying themselves greatly.</p>

<p>&quot;They tell me,&quot; said Tam Donaldson, &quot;that our fren's ha'e
slept in this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>A laugh greeted this sally, which seemed to indicate that
most of them knew about the sleeping-in and the reason for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, they'd be tired oot efter their hard day's work yesterday,&quot;
replied another.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' they dinna seem to be up yet,&quot; said a third, &quot;for
I see the doors are still shut, an' the bairns are no' awa' to
the school. They maun ha'e been awfu' tired to ha'e slept sae
lang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's gang doon and gi'e them a bit sang to help to keep
their dreams pleasant,&quot; suggested Tam Donaldson, as they
moved off down the row and stopped before Jock Graham's
door. Tam, clearing his throat, led of:</p>

<p>
Hey, Johnnie Graham, are ye wauken yet,<br />
Or is yer fire no' ken'lt yet?<br />
If you're no wauken we will wait,<br />
An' tak' ye to the pit in the mornin'.<br />
<br />
Black Jock sent a message in the dark,<br />
Sayin': Johnny Graham, come to your wark,<br />
For tho' ye've been locked in for a lark,<br />
Ye maun come to the pit in the mornin'.<br />
<br />
You an' Fleeming, an' Robertson tae,<br />
Had better a' gang doon the brae,<br />
An' you'll get your pay for ilka day<br />
That ye gang to your work in the mornin'.<br />
</p>

<p>Then, leading off on to another, Tam, with great gusto,
swung into a song that carried the others along uproariously:</p>

<p>
O' a' the airts the win' can blaw,<br />
It canna blaw me free,<br />
For I am high an' dry in bed,<br />
When workin' I should be;<br />
But ropes are stronger faur than is<br />
Desire for work wi' me,<br />
An' sae I lie, baith high an' dry&mdash;<br />
I'll hae to bide a wee.<br />
<br />
I canna say on whatna day<br />
I'll gang again to work,<br />
For sticks an' stanes may break my banes,<br />
As sure's my name's McGurk.<br />
Gie me the best place in the pit,<br />
Then happy I shall be,<br />
Just wi' yae wife to licht oor life,<br />
Big dirty Jock an' me!<br />
</p>

<p>After a round or two of applause and some shouts from the
children, Tam broke out in a new air:</p>

<p>
This is no' my ain lassie,<br />
Kin' though the lassie be,<br />
There's a man ca'd Black Jock Walker,<br />
Shares this bonnie lass wi' me.<br />
She's sweet, she's kin', her ways are fine,<br />
An' whiles she gies her love to me.<br />
She's ta'en my name, but, oh, the shame,<br />
That Walker shares the lass wi' me.<br />
<br />
This is no' my ain lassie,<br />
She is changefu' as the sea,<br />
Whiles I get a' her sweet kisses,<br />
Whiles Black Jock shares them wi' me.<br />
She's fat and fair, she's het and rare,<br />
She's no' that trig, but ay she's free,<br />
It pays us baith, as sure as daith,<br />
That Walker shares the lass wi' me.<br />
</p>

<p>This sent the crowd wild with delight, and cries of &quot;Good
auld Tam!&quot; were raised. &quot;Damn'd guid, Tam! Ye're as guid
as Burns.&quot; All of which made Tam feel that at last his genius
was being recognized. The explanation of the joke was to be
found in the fact, as one song had hinted, that the strikers had
securely fastened the doors of all the blacklegs' houses with
ropes, and jammed the windows with sticks, so that the inmates
could not get out. Even the children could not get out
to go to school. It was late in the afternoon before the police
heard of it, and came and cut the ropes, and so relieved the
imprisoned inmates.</p>

<p>This happened for a morning or two, and then the practice
stopped, for the police watched the doors throughout the
whole night. This preoccupation of the police was taken advantage
of to raid again old Hairyfithill's potato field, and also
to pay a visit to the bing for coal, and a very profitable time
was thus spent by the strikers, even though the blacklegs were
at their work in a few days.</p>

<p>What was happening in Lowwood was typical of almost all
other mining villages throughout the country. Everywhere
high spirits and cheerfulness prevailed among the men. As
for the leaders, the situation proved too big for some of them
to cope with it, the responsibility was too great; and so they
failed at the critical moment. The demand of an increase of
a shilling a day, for which the men had struck, had been conceded
by some of the owners, whilst others had offered sixpence.
Some of the leaders were in favor of accepting these
concessions, and allowing the men at the collieries concerned
to resume work, and so be able to contribute considerably to
help keep out those whose demands had not been met. Others
of the leaders refused to agree to this, and insisted that as all
had struck together, they should fight together to the end,
until the increase was conceded to all. This difference of
opinion was readily perceived and welcomed by the coalmasters,
and stiffened their resolution, for they saw that disagreement
and divisions would soon weaken the morale of the men,
and such proved to be the case.</p>

<p>No one can imagine what Smillie suffered at this time, as
he saw his splendid effort going to pieces; but being a big
man, he knew that it was impossible to turn back. His plans
might for the moment miscarry; but that was merely a necessary,
yet passing, phase in the great evolution of Industrialism,
and his ideals must yet triumph.</p>

<p>As the result of the differences among the leaders, the strike
collapsed at the end of seventeen weeks. The men were forced
to return to work on the old terms. In some cases a reduction
was imposed, making their condition worse than at the start.
The masters sought to drive home their victory in order to
break the union. In many parts of the country they succeeded,
while in others the spirit of the men resisted it. Generally it
ended in compromise; but, so far as the Union was concerned,
it was a broken organization; branches went down, and it was
many years afterwards before it was again reestablished in
some of the districts.</p>

<p>Though at the time it might have seemed all loss, yet it
had its advantages, and especially demonstrated the fact that
there was a fine discipline and the necessary unity among the
rank and file. The next great work was to find out how that
unity could be guided and that discipline perfected&mdash;how to
find a common ideal for the men. This was Robert Smillie's
task, and who shall say, looking at the rank and file to-day,
that he has failed?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h2>THE RIVALS</h2>


<p>Eight years passed, and Robert grew into young manhood.
One of his younger brothers had joined him
and Andrew Marshall in the partnership. It had been
a long, stiff struggle, and his mother knew all the hardness and
cruelty of it. In after years Robert loved his mother more
for the fight she put up, though it never seemed to him that
he himself had done anything extraordinary. He was always
thoughtful, and planned to save her worry. On &quot;pay-nights,&quot;
once a fortnight, when other boys of his age were getting a
sixpence, or perhaps even a shilling, as pocket-money, so that
they could spend a few coppers on the things that delight a
boy's heart, Robert resolutely refused to take a penny. For
years he continued thus, always solacing himself with the
thought that it was a &quot;shilling's worth less of worry&quot; his mother
would have.</p>

<p>Yet, riches were his in that the enchantment of literature
held him captive, and his imagination gained for him treasures
incomparably greater than the solid wealth prized by worldly
minds. His father had possessed about a dozen good books,
among others such familiar Scottish household favorites as
&quot;Wilson's Tales of the Borders,&quot; &quot;Mansie Waugh,&quot; by &quot;Delta,&quot;
&quot;Scots Worthies,&quot; Allan Ramsay's &quot;Gentle Shepherd,&quot; Scott's
&quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;Old Mortality,&quot; and the well-thumbed and
dog-eared copy of Robert Burns' Poems.</p>

<p>&quot;Gae awa', man Robin,&quot; his mother would say sometimes
to him, as he sat devouring Wilson's &quot;Tales&quot; or weeping over
the tragic end of Wallace's wife Marion as recounted in Jean
Porter's entrancing &quot;Scottish Chiefs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gang awa' oot an' tak' a walk. Ither laddies are a' oot
playin' at something, an' forby it's no' healthy to sit too long
aye readin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ach. I canna' be bothered,&quot; he would answer. &quot;I'd raither
read.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is't you're readin' noo?&quot; she would enquire. &quot;Oh,
it's the 'Scottish Chiefs,' an' I'm jist at the bit aboot Wallace's
wife being murdered by Hazelrig. My! It's awfu' vexin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's a fine book, Robin. Ye might read that bit oot
to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A' richt,&quot; and he would start to read while Nellie sat down
to listen. Soon both were engrossed in the sad story, so powerfully
told, and the tears would be running from the mother's
eyes as her fancy pictured the sorrows of Wallace, while Robert's
voice would break, and a sob come into his throat, as he
proceeded. When finally the passage was reached where the
brutal blow was struck, the book would have to be put down,
while mother and son both cried as if the grief depicted were
their own.</p>

<p>&quot;It's an awfu' gran' book, Rob,&quot; she would say after a
time, while she strove to subdue the sobs in her breast. &quot;Puir
Wallace! It maun ha'e been an awfu' blow to him, when he
heard that Marion was killed. But you maun read on a bit
far'er, for I'm no' gaun tae work ony mair till I see that dirty
beast Hazelrig get his deserts. He has wrocht for it, sae jist
gang on noo till you feenish the bit aboot him gettin' killed
wi' Wallace. He deserves it for killin' a woman.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus Robert would have to go on, until the incident in
question had been reached in the story, and as it unfolded
itself his voice would grow firmer and stronger as he became
infected with the narrative, while his mother's eyes would
glow, and her body be tense with interest, and an expectant
expression would creep over her face, betraying her excitement.
In the interview between Wallace and Hazelrig in the house in
the Wellgate in Lanark, when Wallace dramatically draws his
sword in answer to the supplication for mercy, and says: &quot;Ay,
the same mercy as you showed my Marion,&quot; Robert's voice
would thunder forth the words with terrible sternness, while
Nellie would gasp and catch her breath in a quick little sob
of excitement, as the feeling of satisfied justice filled her heart.
And when the blow fell that laid the English governor low,
she would burst out: &quot;Serves him richt, the dirty tyrant.
He's got what he deserved, an' it serves him right!&quot;</p>

<p>On another occasion Robert would suddenly burst out laughing,
when reading Delta's chronicle of the adventures of
Mansie Waugh, the Scottish &quot;Handy Andy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you laughing at, Robin?&quot; Nellie would enquire,
a smile breaking over her face also.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's Mansie Waugh, mither. Oh, but it's a gran' bit.
Listen to this,&quot; and he would begin to read the passage, where
Mansie, simple soul that he was, was described as going into
the byre in the morning to learn if the cow had calved during
the night, and finding, on opening the door, the donkey of
a traveling tinker, he turned and ran into the house, crying:
&quot;Mither! Mither! The coo has calved, an' it's a cuddy!&quot;</p>

<p>Whenever he reached this part of the story, his mother would
go off into a fit of uncontrollable laughter which left her helpless
and crumpled up in a heap upon the nearest chair. Her
laugh was very infectious; it began with a low, mirthful ripple,
well down in the throat, and rose in rapid leaps of musical joy
till it had traveled a whole octave of bubbling happy sounds,
when it culminated in a peal of double forte shakes and trills,
that made it a joy to hear, and finally it died out in an &quot;Oh,
dear me! What a callan Mansie was!&quot;</p>

<p>As Robert approached manhood, he took more and more to
the moors, wandering alone among the haunts of the whaup
and other moor birds, wrestling with problems to which older
heads never gave a thought, trying to understand life and to
build from his heart and experience something that would be
satisfying. Silent, thoughtful, &quot;strange&quot; to the neighbors, a
problem to everyone, but a bigger one to himself, life staggered
him and appalled his soul.</p>

<p>Earnestly he worked and tested his thought against the
thought of others, sturdily refusing everything which did not
ring true and meet his standard. Old religious conceptions,
the orthodoxy of his kith and kin, were fast tested in the crucible
of his mind and flung aside as worthless. The idea of Hell
and the old Morrisonian notion of the Hereafter appeared crude
and barbarous. His father's fate and the condition of the family
left to welter in poverty, the cruelty of life as it presented
itself to the great mass of the working class, could not be reconciled
with the Church's teaching of an all-loving and omniscient
Father.</p>

<p>With the audacity of youth, he felt that he could easily have
constructed a better universe. He felt that Hell could have no
terrors for people condemned to such hardship and suffering
as he saw around him. Life was colorless for them; stinted
of pleasure and beauty, with merely the joys of the &quot;gill-stoup&quot;
on a Saturday night at the local &quot;store&quot; to look forward to,
there was in it no real satisfaction either for the body or the
mind. Would he, indeed, have to wait till after death before
knowing anything of real happiness or comfort? His mind
refused to accept this doctrine so frequently expounded to
working class congregations by ministers, who were themselves
comparatively well endowed with &quot;treasures upon earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Life was good, life was glorious if only it could be made as
he dreamed it. This fair earth need be no vale of tears. There
were the blue skies, the white tapestry of cloudland ever varying;
there was the wind upon his face and the sweet rain;
there was the purl of mountain brook, the graceful sweep of
the river, the smile of the flowers, the songs of the birds; the
golden splendor of the day and the silver radiance of the
night.</p>

<p>But above and beyond all there was an ever-increasing love
of his fellows, there were noble women like his mother to
reverence, and there were sweet children to cherish. Surely life
was good, and never was meant to be the mean, sordid thing
that too often was the lot of people like himself. Heaven could
and should be realized here and now. At twenty, he finished
by accepting Humanity as it is, to be understood and loved,
to be served, and, if necessary, to die for it.</p>

<p>Though thus naturally reserved and meditative, yet he was
not unloved. There was no more popular lad in the village.
Everyone in a tight corner came to him for help and advice.
He was private secretary to half the village and father confessor
to the other half. He served everyone, and in return
all loved him more or less. In the course of time he came to
occupy the place his father had held before him as president
of the local branch of the Union, which had been recently revived.
His duties as a Union official forced him more and
more into mixing with others, and into taking a larger interest
in the affairs of the locality.</p>

<p>Gradually with the activities of public life his moodiness
gave place to a healthy cheerfulness, and his enthusiasm soon
led him into taking part in nearly every form of sport which
gave life more zest. His interest being roused, he was wholehearted
in his application, whether as a member of the executive
of any local sports association, or as a participant in the
game itself. He was elected to the committee responsible for
organizing the Lowwood Annual Games, but resigned because
having taken up racing as his pet pastime for the time being,
he wanted to compete in some of the items.</p>

<p>At last the &quot;Sports&quot; day arrived. The pits were idle, for
this was one of the recognized holidays. Everyone looked
forward eagerly to this day, and prepared for it, each in his
or her own way. For weeks before it the children practiced
racing, and trained themselves in jumping, football, quoiting
and such sports. Young men stole away to secret places in
the moor to train and harden themselves, timing their performances
and concentrating on the strenuous day ahead when they
would compete with one another in fair tests of speed, strength,
skill and endurance.</p>

<p>One event was always a special attraction, even to professional
racers all over the country. This was known as the
&quot;Red Hose Race,&quot; about which many legends were told. The
most popular of these was to the effect that the stockings were
knitted each year by the Laird's wife, and if no one entered
for the race, the Laird must run it himself, or forfeit his extensive
estate to the Crown. In addition to the Red Hose,
there was a substantial money prize. To win the race was
looked upon as the greatest achievement of the year, for it was
one of the oldest sporting events and had been run for so many
years that its origin seemed lost in the mists of antiquity.
Robert made up his mind to win the Red Hose in this particular
year. Mrs. Graydon, of Graydon House, had intimated
that she herself would be present and would hand over the
stockings to the proud winner in person, but it was not by any
means on this account that Robert was so keen to win. It was
the older lure that brought every year athletes of fame to run
in the historic race.</p>

<p>&quot;So you are going to run in the Red Hose,&quot; said a voice
behind Robert while the people were all gathering to watch
the preliminary races of the boys and girls. Robert turned
from the group of young men who had been discussing the
event with him, and met the smiling face of Peter Rundell,
dressed in immaculate style and looking as fresh and fine a
specimen of young manhood as anyone could wish to see.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said with a smile, &quot;and I intend to win it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you?&quot; returned Peter light-heartedly. &quot;I have also
entered for it, though I had no intention of doing so when I
came over; but Mr. Walker, who, as you know, is on the committee,
pressed me to go in, and so I consented.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Robert, in surprise, &quot;I thought after last year's
success you were not going to run again.&quot; Then, in a bantering
tone, and with a smile upon his lips, &quot;I suppose we'll be
rivals in this, then; but I gi'e you fair warning that I'm gaun
to lift the Red Hose if I get a decent chance at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I have set my mind on winning it, too,&quot; replied Peter.
&quot;I'd like to lift it, just to be able to say in after years that
I had done so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just hoo I feel aboot the matter too,&quot; lightly answered
Robert. &quot;I'd like jist to be able to say that I had won
the Red Hose. I feel in good form for it, so you'd better be
on your mettle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I shall give you the race of your life for it,&quot; said
Peter, entering into the same light spirited boasting. &quot;I hear
Mair and Todd and Semple are also entered, but with a decent
handicap I won't mind these, even with their international
reputation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Robert. &quot;I suppose I shall have the greater
pleasure in romping home before you all. Are the handicaps
out yet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I saw the list just before I spoke to you. Semple and
Mair are scratch, with Todd at five yards. You start at
twenty-five, and I get off at the limit forty.'</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Robert, a note of surprise in his voice. &quot;Walker
has surely forgotten who are the runners! Why, last year you
won nearly all the confined events, and you were second in
the Red Hose with twenty-five yards. He means you to romp
home this year!&quot; and there was heat in Robert's voice as he
finished.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I daresay it is a decent handicap,&quot; said Peter, &quot;and
even though Semple is among the crowd, I should manage, I
think, to pull it off with anything like luck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should think so,&quot; said Robert. &quot;Walker has just
made you a present of the race. But I suppose it can't be
helped, though it isn't fair. Anyhow, I'll give you a chase
for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right. Half an hour and we shall be on,&quot; and Peter
went on round the field, exchanging greetings with most of the
villagers.</p>

<p>He was finishing his education at a Technical College in
Edinburgh, and at present was home on holidays. He was a
well set up young man, and though popular with most people,
yet he brought with him an air of another world among the
villagers, which made them feel uncomfortable. They recognized
that his life was very different from their own, and while
they talked to him when he spoke to them, and were agreeable
enough to him, they felt awed and could not break down the
natural reserve they always had towards people of another
station of life. He was perhaps a little too thoughtless and impulsive,
though generous-hearted enough. He drifted into
things, rather than shaped them to his own ideas, and was often
not sufficiently careful of the positions in which he found himself
as a consequence of thoughtless acts.</p>

<p>The week before he had caught and kissed Mysie Maitland,
who was now serving at Rundell House, merely because he
was taken with her pretty face. From that Peter already believed
himself in love with her, because she had not resented
his action. He had even walked over with her from the village,
when she had been home visiting her parents one night, and
had felt more and more the witchery of her pretty face and
the lure of her fine little figure.</p>

<p>Up to this time Mysie had always believed herself in love
with Robert&mdash;Robert who was always so strange from the rest
of young men. He had always been her hero, her protector;
but there was something about him for which she could not
account and which she could not have defined. Such was her
admiration that she believed it was in his power to do anything
he cared to attempt; it was just possible that it was this
strange sense of unknown power which fascinated her. They
had never been lovers in the accepted sense of the word. They
had never &quot;walked out&quot; as young people in their social station
usually do, but yet had always felt that they were meant for
one another.</p>

<p>Only once had Robert kissed her, and that moment ever
lived with her a glowing memory. She had been home and
was returning through a moorland pass, when she came across
him lying upon the rough heather, his thoughts doubtless full
of her, for he had seen her in the village, and knew she must
return that way.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Rob!&quot; she cried, her face flushing with excitement as
she saw him. &quot;Ye nearly frichted me oot o' my wits the noo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I, Mysie?&quot; he answered, springing to his feet. &quot;I
didna mean to dae that. Ye'll be getting back, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; she returned simply, and a silence fell upon them, in
which both seemed to lose the power of speaking.</p>

<p>Robert looked at her as she stood there, her full, curved
breasts rising and falling with the excitement of the unexpected
meeting, the long lashes of her eyes sweeping her
flushed cheeks, as she stood with downcast eyes before him.
The last rays of the setting sun falling upon her brown hair
touched it with a rare strange beauty. Her red lips like dew-drenched
roses&mdash;luscious, pure, alluring, were parted a little
in a half smile. But it was the fascinating movement of the
breast, full, round and sensuous, that stirred and made an
overpowering appeal to every pulse within him. It seemed so
soft, so tender, so wonderfully alluring. At the moment he
could not understand himself or her. There was a strange,
surging impetus raging through him that he felt absolutely
powerless to subdue, and he swayed a little as he stood.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mysie!&quot; he cried, leaping forward and clasping her in
his strong, young arms, and crushing her against him, holding
her there, gasping, powerless but happy.</p>

<p>&quot;You are mine, Mysie. Mine!&quot; and he kissed her budded
lips in an ecstasy of passion and warm-blooded feeling, while
a thousand fevers seemed to course through him as he felt the
contact of her body and her warm, eager lips on his. Blinded
and delirious, he kissed her again and again in an impassioned
burst of fervor, passion scorching his blood and filling his
whole heart with the enjoyment of possession. She closed her
eyes, and her head touched his shoulder, while the faint scent
of her hair and its soft caressing touch upon his cheek maddened
him to a fury of love.</p>

<p>&quot;Say you are mine, Mysie! Say you are mine!&quot; he cried,
and his voice was strange and hoarse and dry with the desire
within him. He felt her body yielding as it relaxed in his
arms, as if in answer to some unspoken demand, and in a moment
he realized himself and started back, hot shame surging
over his face and conquering the passion in his blood. In
that strange mad moment he had felt capable of anything&mdash;powerful,
overmastering, relentless in his desires; and now&mdash;weak,
shame-stricken and helpless. Ere he could say anything,
Mysie had come to herself with a shock, and started away over
the moor as if possessed by something that was mysterious and
terrible.</p>

<p>That had happened a year ago, and though Robert sought
to learn when she was in the village, and often watched her
from a safe place where he was not seen, delighting his eyes
with the sight of her figure, and feeling again the same hot
shame come over him, as he had known that day on the moor,
yet he had never met her near enough to speak to her, but had
worshiped her at a distance and grown to love and desire
her more and more with every day that passed.</p>

<p>He dreamed dreams around her, but was afraid to encounter
her again. This strange mad love burned in his blood, until
at times he was almost sick with desire and love. Every moor-bird
called her name; every flower held the shyness of her face;
the clouds of peaceful sunsets showed the glory of her hair, and
the quiet, steadfast stars possessed the wonder of her eyes.
The madness of the passionate moment of possession on the
moor was at once his most treasured memory and his intensest
shame.</p>

<p>As for Mysie, since she had not heard any more from Robert
nor even seen him for almost a year, she felt quite flattered by
the attentions of Peter Rundell. It was not that she was in
love with either of the young men. Her nature was of the
kind that is in love with love itself, and was not perhaps capable
of a great love, such as had frightened her, when Robert,
taken off his guard, had let her glimpse a strong, overmastering
passion and a soul capable of great things. Already she
dreamed of a grand house of which she would be mistress as
Peter's wife, as she stood in the silence of her own room,
pirouetting and smirking, and drawing pictures of herself in
fine garments and stately carriage, playing the Lady Bountiful
of the district.</p>

<h2>THE RED HOSE RACE</h2>


<p>&quot;All competitors for the Red Hose, get ready!&quot; called the
bell-man, who announced the events at the sports, and
immediately all was stir and bustle and excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;Wha's gaun to win the day, Andrew?&quot; enquired Matthew
Maitland, as they stood waiting for the runners to emerge from
the dressing tent.</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna ken,&quot; answered Andrew Marshall. &quot;That's a
damn'd unfair handicap anyway. My neighbor is no' meant
to lift it seemingly. Look at the start they've gi'en him, an'
young Rundell starts at the limit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay!&quot; said Matthew. &quot;It's no' fair. It's some o' Black
Jock's doings. He's meanin' young Rundell to wun it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it looks like it; but it's fashious kennin' what may
happen. Rab's a braw runner,&quot; and Andrew spoke as one who
knew, for he was the only person who had seen Robert train.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, it's harder for him to be a rinner than for young
Rundell, a man wha never wrocht a day's work in a' his life,
while Rab's had to slave hard and sair a' his days....
Though Rundell can rin too,&quot; he added, with ungrudged admiration.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, he ran weel last year, but they tell me he'd like to
get the Red Hose to his credit, though for my pairt they'd
been far better to ha'e presented it to him, than to gi'e him it
that way. Man, he's a dirty brute o' a man, Black Jock!&quot;
and there was disgust in his voice. &quot;Jist look at Mag Robertson
there, flittering aboot quite shameless, and gecking and
smirking at him, an' naebody daur say a word to her. She's
a fair scunner!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If she belonged to me, I'd let her ken a different way o't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Andra,&quot; was the reply. &quot;But ye maun mind that Mag
mak's mair money than Sanny does. Jist look at her, the
glaikit tinkler that she is. Black Jock's no' ill to please when
that pleases him.&quot;</p>

<p>Mag Robertson, the subject of their talk, was quite oblivious,
apparently, of the many remarks that were being passed
about her, and she continued to follow Walker, who as a committee
member, was busily arranging matters for the race.</p>

<p>&quot;She's gie weel smeekit, Andra!&quot; observed Matthew in a
whisper, as Mag passed close by. &quot;Did ye fin the smell o&quot;
her breath?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay!&quot; replied Andrew. &quot;She can haud a guid lot before
ye see it on her. She's&mdash;&quot; but a shout from the crowd cut
his further revelations short.</p>

<p>&quot;Here they come!&quot; cried Matthew excitedly, as the tent
opened, and young Rundell came out with confident bearing,
leading the other half-dozen athletes to the starting place.
&quot;Let's gae roon' to the wunnin' post so as to see the feenish.&quot;</p>

<p>The competitors lined up, each on his separate mark, ready
for the signal to start. Rundell, in a bright-colored costume
of fine texture, showed well beside the other racer who started
along with him at forty yards. Peter was slimly built, but
there were energy and activity in his every movement; his legs
especially, being finely developed, showed no superfluous flesh;
his chest alone indicated any weakness, but withal he looked a
likely winner.</p>

<p>Robert, on the other hand, while not carrying a great amount
of flesh, was well built. The chest was broad and deep, the
shoulders square and the head held well up, his nose being
finely adapted for good respiration. The legs, by reason of
heavy work in early life, were a little bent at the brawn, but
were as hard as nails; they showed wonderfully developed
muscles, and gave the impression of strength rather than
speed.</p>

<p>They presented a fine picture of eager, determined young
manhood, clean and healthy, and full of life and mettle. Each
face betrayed how the mind was concentrated on, the work
ahead, every thought directed with great intensity towards the
goal, as they bent their bodies in preparation for the start.</p>

<p>The pistol cracked and rang out upon the midday air with
startling suddenness, and immediately they were off on a fine
start to the accompaniment of the cheering of the crowd which
lined the whole track in a great circle. The first round ended
with the runners much as they had started, the interval between
each being fairly equally maintained. Semple, however,
dropped out, not caring to overstrain himself as he had
some heavy racing next day at another gathering, where a
much higher money prize was the allurement.</p>

<p>Round the others went, the excitement growing among the
crowd, who kept shouting encouraging remarks to the racers
as they passed.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep it up, Robin!&quot; cried Andrew Marshall. &quot;Keep it up,
my lad. Ye're daein' fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come away, Rundell, the race is yer ain,&quot; shouted an enthusiastic
supporter of Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;Nae wonner!&quot; answered Matthew Maitland, heatedly.
&quot;They've gi'en him the race in a present. Look at the handikep!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' what aboot it?&quot; enquired the other, not knowing what
to answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Plenty aboot it,&quot; replied Matthew. &quot;If it hadna' been
he was Peter Rundell, he wadna' ha'e gotten sic a start. Black
Jock means him to get the race, an' it's no' fair. I wadna'
ha'e the damn'd thing in that way, an' if he does win it he'll
hae nae honor in it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Rab's runnin' weel,&quot; Matthew continued, as he followed
the runners with eager eyes, and stuck the head of his
pipe in his mouth in his excitement, burning his lips in the
process. &quot;Dammit, I've burned my mooth,&quot; he ejaculated,
spluttering, spitting and wiping his mouth. &quot;But the laddie
can rin. He's a fair dandie o' a rinner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He couldna' rin to catch the cauld,&quot; broke in Rundell's
admirer, glad to get in a word. &quot;Look at him. Dammit, ye
could wheel a barrow oot through his legs. He jist rummles
alang like a chained tame earthquake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; asked Matthew, somewhat nettled at this
manner of describing Robert's slightly bent legs. &quot;He canna
rin, ye say! Weel, if he couldna' rin better than Peter Rundell,
he should never try it. Look at Rundell!&quot; he went on
scathingly, &quot;doubled up like a fancy canary, and a hump on his
back like a greyhound licking a pot. Rinnin'! He's mair like
an exhibition o' a rin-a-way toy rainbow. He's aboot as souple
as a stookie Christ on a Christmas tree!&quot; And Matthew glared
at the other, as if he would devour him at a gulp.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at him noo,&quot; he cried, as Robert began to overtake
the young miner who had started equal with Rundell.
&quot;He's passed young Paterson noo, an' ye'll soon see him get
on level terms wi' Rundell. Go on, Rob!&quot; he yelled in delight,
as Robert shot past. &quot;Go on, my lad, you're daein'
fine!&quot;</p>

<p>Excitement was rousing the crowd to a great pitch, and
yells and shouts of encouragement went up, and cheers rang
out as the favored one went past the various groups of supporters.</p>

<p>All during the race as the competitors circled the course,
excitement grew, until the last round was reached, when every
one seemed to go mad. Only three remained to compete now
for the prize, the others having given up.</p>

<p>But the shouts and cheers of the crowd seemed strangely
far away to the racers, as each rounded the last corner for the
final stretch of about one hundred yards. They were both
spent, but will power kept them at it. They were not breathing,
they were tearing their lungs out in great gulping efforts,
and their hearts as well. Tense, determined, inevitability
seemed to rest upon them.</p>

<p>Louder roared the crowd, hoarser and deeper the cheers,
closer and closer the multitude surged to the winning post,
yelling, shouting, crying and gesticulating incoherently as the
two men sprinted along with great leaping strides, panting and
almost breaking down under the terrible strain of the mile
race.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they came, still running level, with hardly
an inch to tell the difference; but in a pace like this Robert's
greater strength and hard training were bound to tell. Fifty
yards to go, and they came on like streaks of color, fleeting
images of some fevered brain, and one girl's smile each knew
was waiting there at the far end.</p>

<p>The prize for which both were now striving was that for
which men at all times strive, which keeps the world young
and sends the zest of creation wandering through the blood&mdash;a
pair of dancing eyes, lit by the happy smile of love; for
Mysie Maitland had smiled to them, each claiming the smile
for himself, just before the race started.</p>

<p>And now the last ounce of energy was called up, but the
mine-owner's son failed to respond. Dazed and stupid, his
mind in a mad whirl, his legs almost doubling under him,
he found his powers weaken and his strength desert him, and
he staggered just as Robert was about to shoot past him; but
in staggering he planted his spiked shoe right upon Robert's
foot, and both men went down completely exhausted, Rundell
unable to rise for want of strength and Sinclair powerless because
of his lacerated foot.</p>

<p>&quot;Guid God! He's spiked him!&quot; roared Andrew in a terrible
rage. &quot;The dirty lump that he is&mdash;spiked him just when he
was gaun to win, too!&quot;</p>

<p>A howl of execration went up from Sinclair's supporters
as he lay and writhed in agony, while Rundell lay still except
for the heaving of his chest. For one tense moment they lay
and the crowd was silent, whilst each man's heart was almost
thumping itself out of place in his body, stretched upon the
rough cinder track.</p>

<p>Then a low murmur broke from the crowd as they saw young
Paterson coming round the track, almost staggering under the
strain, but keenly intent on finishing now that his two formidable
opponents were lying helpless. He had kept running during
the last round merely to take the third prize. Now here
was his chance of the coveted Red Hose, and he sprinted and
tore along as fast as he was able, calling up every particle of
effort he could muster, and intent on getting past before the
two men could gather strength to rise.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Rob!&quot; roared Andrew Marshall, &quot;get up an'
feenish, my wee cock! Paterson's comin' along, an' he'll win.
Get up an' try an' feenish it!&quot;</p>

<p>Stirred by the warning, Robert tried to rise. He raised himself
to his knees, but the pain in his injured foot was too great,
and he fell forward on his face unconscious, and the race ended
with Paterson as winner. It was an ironical situation, and soon
the crowd were over the ropes, and the two opponents were
carried to the dressing tent, where restoratives were applied
under which they soon came round.</p>

<p>It was a poor ending to such a fine exhibition. A terrible
anger smoldered in Robert's breast against the mine-owner's
son for his unconscious action, an action which Robert, blinded
by anger at losing, was now firmly convinced was deliberate,
and he felt he would just like to smash Rundell's face
for it.</p>

<p>Robert went home to have his injured foot attended to.
He was too disgusted to feel any more interest in the games
that day, and so he remained in the house, nursing his foot
for the rest of the day, which passed as such days usually do.
Everyone talked about his misfortune and regretted in a casual
way the accident which had deprived him of the coveted
honor.</p>

<p>It was in late June, and that night Peter Rundell, as he
was returning from the games after every event had been decided,
overtook Mysie on her way to Rundell House, after
having spent the evening at her parents' home.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a lovely evening, Mysie,&quot; he said, as he walked along
by her side. &quot;What did you think of the games to-day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no' bad,&quot; replied Mysie, not knowing what else to say.
&quot;It was a gran' day, an' kept up fine,&quot; she continued, alluding
to the weather.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Didn't I make a horrible mess of things in the Red
Hose?&quot; he asked. Then, without waiting, he went on: &quot;I
was sorry for Sinclair. He's a fine chap, and ought to have
won. It was purely an accident, and I couldn't help myself.
I was beaten and done for, and it was hard lines for him to
be knocked out in the way he was, just as he was on the point
of winning, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but ye couldna' help it,&quot; Mysie returned. &quot;It was an
accident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; and I would rather Sinclair had got in, though. It
was a good race, and Sinclair ought to have got the prize. It
was rotten luck. I'm sorry, and I hope the poor beggar does
not blame me. We seem always to be fated to be rivals,&quot; he
continued, his voice dropping into reminiscent tones. &quot;Do you
remember how we used to fight at school? I've liked Sinclair
always since for the way he stood up for the things he thought
were right. I believe you were the cause of our hardest battle,
and that also was an accident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Mysie, her face flushing slightly as she remembered
the incident, and how Peter had been chosen, when
her heart told her to choose Robert.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said Peter, &quot;I suppose we can't help these things.
Fate wills it. Let's forget all about such unpleasant things.
It's a lovely night. We might go round by the wood. It's
not so late yet,&quot; and putting Mysie's arm in his, he turned
off into the little pathway that skirted the wood, and she,
caught by the glamor of the gloaming, as well as flattered by
his attentions, acquiesced.</p>

<p>Plaintive and eerie the moor-birds protested against this
invasion of their haunts. The moon came slowly up over the
eastern end of the moor, flinging a silver radiance abroad, and
softening the shadows cast by the hills. A strange, dank smell
rose from the mossy ground&mdash;the scent of rotting heather and
withered grass, mixed with the beautiful perfume from beds
of wild thyme.</p>

<p>A low call came from a brooding curlew, a faint sigh from
a plover, and the wild rasping cry of a lapwing greeted them
overhead. Yet there was a silence, a silence broken for a
moment by the cries of the birds, but a silence thick and heavy.
Between the calls of the birds Mysie could almost hear her
heart's quickened beat. Blood found an eager response, and
the magic of the moonlight and the beauty of the night soon
wrought upon the excited minds of the pair. Mysie looked in
Peter's eyes more desirable than ever. The moonlight on her
face, the soft light within her eyes, her shy, downcast look,
and the touch of her arm on his charmed him.</p>

<p>&quot;There are some things, Mysie, more desirable than the
winning of the Red Hose,&quot; he said after a time, looking sideways
at her, and placing his hand upon hers, which had been
resting upon his arm. &quot;Don't you think so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna ken,&quot; she answered simply, a strange little quiver
running through her as she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't this better than anything else, just to be happy with
everything so peaceful? Just you and I together, happy in
each other's company.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; she answered again, a faint little catch in her voice,
her heart a-tremble, and her eyes moist and shining. Then
silence again, while they slowly strayed through the heather
towards the little wooded copse, and Mysie felt that every
thump of her heart must be heard at the farthest ends of the
earth. Chased by the winds of passion raging within him,
discretion was fast departing from Peter, leaving him more and
more a prey to impulse and the unwearying persistence of the
fever of love that was consuming him.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, Mysie, I read a song yesterday. It's the sort of
thing I'd have written about you:</p>

<p>
&quot;In the passionate heart of the rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which from life its deep ardor is feeing.</span><br />
And lifts its proud head to disclose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its immaculate beauty and being.</span><br />
I can see your fine soul in repose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With an eye lit with love and all-seeing,</span><br />
In the passionate heart of the rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All athrob with its beauty of being.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>He quoted, and Mysie's pulse leapt with every word, as the
low soothing wooing of his voice came in soft tones like a
gentle breeze among clumps of briars.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it a beautiful song, Mysie?&quot; he said. &quot;The man who
wrote that must have been thinking of someone very like you,&quot;
and as he said this, he gave her hand a tender squeeze. Mysie
thrilled to his touch and her heart leapt and fluttered like a
bird in a snare, her breath coming in short little gasps, which
were at once a pain and a joy.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna say that,&quot; she said, a note of alarm in her voice as
she tried to withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>But he only held it closer, and bent his lips over it, his manner
gentle but firm.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it is true, Mysie; but I am so stupid I can't do anything
of that kind. I'm merely an ordinary sort of chap.&quot;</p>

<p>Mysie did not answer, and once again silence fell between
them, broken only occasionally by the cry of the birds or the
bleating of a sheep.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I'm in love with you, Mysie,&quot; he said at last.
&quot;You've grown very beautiful. Could you care for me, Mysie?&quot;
he asked, looking at her in the soft moonlight, a smile
on his lips, his voice keeping its seductive wooing tone, and
his eyes kindling.</p>

<p>Mysie's experience of life had been gleaned from the love
stories of earls and lords marrying governesses and ladies'
maids after a swift and very eventful courtship. Already she
saw herself Peter's wife, her carriage coming at her order,
everyone serving her and she the queen of all the district.
Illiterate but romantic, she was swept off her feet at the first
touch of passion, and the flattery of being recognized!</p>

<p>She did not answer. She did not know what to say; and
Peter stole his arm about her waist, so tempting, so sweet to
touch, and they passed beneath the shadow of the trees as
they entered the little wooded copse. The moonlight filtered
down through the trees, working silvery patterns upon the
pathway. The silence, heavy and scented, was broken only
by the far-away wheepling of a wakeful whaup and the grumbling
of the burn near by, which bickered and hurried to be
out in the open again on its way to the river.</p>

<p>Mysie heard the sounds, felt the fragrance of young briars
and hawthorn mingled with the smell of last year's decaying
leaves which carpeted the pathway. She noted the beauty of
the foliage against the moon, heard the swift scurry of a
frightened rabbit and the faint snort of a hedge-hog on the
prowl for food.</p>

<p>&quot;What have you to say to me, Mysie?&quot; Peter persisted, his
hot breath against her cheek, his blood coursing through his
veins in red-hot passion. &quot;Could you care for me, Mysie? I
want you to be mine!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna ken what to say,&quot; she at last answered, distress
in her voice, yet pleased to be wooed by this young man.
&quot;Wad it no' be wrang to ha'e onything to dae wi' me? I'm
only your mither's servant.&quot; She felt it was her duty to put
it this way.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you are my sweetheart,&quot; he cried, discretion all gone
now in his eager furtherance of his pleading. &quot;I want you&mdash;only
you, Mysie,&quot; and he caught her in his arms in a strong
burst of desire for her. &quot;Mine, Mysie, mine!&quot; he cried, his lips
upon hers and hers responding now, his hot eyes greedily devouring
her as he held her there in his strong young arms.
&quot;Say, Mysie, that you are mine, that I am yours, body and
soul belonging to each other,&quot; and so he raved on in eager
burning language, which was the sweetest music in Mysie's
ears.</p>

<p>His arms about her, he made her sit down, she still unresisting
and flattered by his words, he fondling and kissing her,
his hands caressing her face, her ears, her hair, her neck, his
head sometimes resting upon her breast.</p>

<p>Maddened and scorched by the passion raging within him,
lured by the magic of the night, and impelled by the invitation
of the sweet dewy lips that seemed to cry for kisses, he
strained her to his breast.</p>

<p>He praised her eyes, her hair, her voice, whilst he poured
kisses upon her, his fire kindling her whole being into response.</p>

<p>Then a thick cloud came over the face of the moon, darkening
the dell, blotting out the silvery patterns on the ground,
chasing the light shadows into dark corners; and a far-off protest
of a whaup shouting to the hills was heard in a shriller and
more anxious note that had something of alarm in it; the burn
seemed to bicker more loudly in its anxiety to hurry on out
into the open moor; and the scents and perfumes of the wood
sank into pale ghosts of far-off memories.</p>

<p>When passion, red-eyed and fierce for conquest, had driven
innocence from the throne of virtue the guardian angels wept;
and all their tears, however bitter, could not obliterate the
stains which marked the progress of destruction.</p>

<p>At the end of the copse, when Mysie and Peter emerged,
they neither spoke nor laughed. There was shame in their
downcast faces, and their feet dragged heavily. His arm no
longer encircled her waist, he did not now praise her eyes, her
hair, her figure. Lonely each felt, afraid to look up, as if
something walked between them. And far away the whaup
wheepled in protest, the burn still grumbled, and the perfumes,
and the sounds of the glen and all its beauty were as if they
had never existed, and the thick cloud grew blacker over the
face of the moon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h2>THE AWAKENING</h2>


<p>Night after night for a week afterwards, Mysie lay
awake till far on into the morning. She seemed to be
face to face with life's realities at last. The silly, shallow
love stories held no fascination for her. The love affairs
of &quot;Jean the Mill Girl&quot; could not rouse her interest. Often
she cried for hours, till exhaustion brought sleep, troubled
and unrefreshing.</p>

<p>She grew silent and avoided company. She sang no more
at her work, and she avoided Peter, and kept out of his way.
She often compared Robert with him now, and loved to let
her mind linger on that one mad moment of delirious joy a
year ago, when he had crushed her to his breast, and cried
to her to be his. Thus womanhood dawned for her, and its
great responsibilities frightened her.</p>

<p>Robert, on the other hand, spent a week nursing his injured
foot, but apart from the week's idle time, he suffered
very little. He felt sore at losing the race, but was able now
to look upon it as an unfortunate accident. But that smile
which he had seen on the face of Mysie made him strangely
happy, and it helped him to get over his disappointment. He
was impatient to be out upon the moor again. He would wait
for Mysie some night, he concluded, and tell her calmly that
he wanted her to marry him.</p>

<p>His mother's prospects were fairly good now. The youngest
boy would soon be working; besides, two other brothers were
at work, while Jennie, his eldest sister, was in service, and
Annie, the younger one, was helping in the house. He waited,
night after night, after his injured foot was better&mdash;lingering
on the moor by the path which Mysie must travel. He lay
among the heather and read books, or dreamed of a rosy future,
with her the center of his dreams; but no Mysie came
along, and he began to grow anxious.</p>

<p>He wanted to make enquiries about her, but feared to arouse
suspicion of having too keen an interest in her. By various
ways he sought information, but never heard anything definite.</p>

<p>&quot;I see Matthew Maitland's ither lassie has started on the
pit-head,&quot; he said to his mother, as one night they sat by the
fire before retiring.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; answered Mrs. Sinclair. &quot;Matthew has the worst o'
it by noo. Wi' his twa bits o' laddies workin', an' Mysie in
service, an' Mary gaun to the pit-head, it should mak' his
burden a wee easier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna like the idea o' lasses gaun to work on the pithead,&quot;
he said simply. &quot;I aye mind of the time that Mysie
an' me wrocht on it. It's no' a very nice place for lasses or
women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; his mother said. &quot;I dinna like it either. Nae guid
ever comes o' lasses gaun there. They lose a' sense o' modesty
an' decency, after a while, an' are no' like women at a'
when they grow aulder. Besides, it mak's them awfu' coorse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wad hardly say that aboot them a',&quot; he ventured cautiously.
&quot;Mysie's no' coorse, an' she worked on the pithead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Mysie's no' coorse,&quot; admitted his mother; &quot;but Mysie
didna work very lang on the pit-head. An' forby, we dinna
ken but what Mysie micht hae been better if she had never
been near it, or worse if she had stayed langer. Just look
at Susan Morton, an' that Mag Lindsay. What are they but
shameless lumps who dinna ken what modesty is?&quot; and there
was a spark of the old scorn in her voice as she finished.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but I wadna gang as faur as you, mither,&quot; he said,
&quot;wi' your condemnations. I ken that baith Susan Morton an'
Mag Lindsay are guid-hearted women. They may be coarse
in their talk, an' a' that sort o' thing; but they are as kind-hearted
as onybody else, an' kinder than some.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh; I hae nae doot,&quot; she answered relentingly. &quot;I didna
mean that at a'; but the pit-head doesna make them ony better,
an' it's no' wark for them at a'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mind,&quot; said Robert reminiscently, &quot;when Mysie an' me
started on the pit-head, Mag Lindsay was awfu' guid to Mysie;
an' I've kent her often sharin' her piece wi' wee Dicky Tamson,
whiles when he had nane, if his mother happened to be
on the fuddle for a day or twa. There's no a kinderhearted
woman in Lowwood, mither, than Mag Lindsay. She'd swear
at Dicky a' the time she was stappin' her piece into him. It
was jist her wye, an' I think she couldna help it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ay, Mag's bark is waur then her bite. I ken that,&quot;
was the reply. &quot;An' wi' a' her fauts a body canna help likin'
her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speakin' of Mysie,&quot; said Robert with caution, &quot;I hinna
seen her owre for a while surely. Wull there be onything
wrang?&quot; and then, to hide the agitation he felt, &quot;she used
to come owre hame aboot twice a week, an' I hinna seen her
for a while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there canna be onything wrang,&quot; replied Nellie, &quot;or
we wad hae heard tell o' it. But t' is time we were awa' to oor
beds, or we'll no' be able to rise in time the morn,&quot; and rising
as she spoke, she began to make preparations for retiring, and
he withdrew to his room also.</p>

<p>Still, day after day, he hung about the moorland path, but
no Mysie, so far as he knew, ever came past. She had visited
her parents only once since the games and her mother was
struck by her subdued and thoughtful demeanor. But nothing
was said at the time.</p>

<p>Robert grew impatient, and began to roam nearer to Rundell
House, in the hope of seeing her. Always his thoughts
were full of Mysie and the raging passion in his blood for her
gave him no rest. He loved to trace her name linked with his
own, and then to obliterate it again, in case anyone would
see it. All day his thoughts were of her; and her sweet, shy
smile that day of the games was nursed in memory till it
grew to be a solace to his heart and its hunger.</p>

<p>He saw likenesses to her in everything, and even the call
of the moor-birds awakened some memory of an incident of
childhood, when Mysie and he had, with other children, played
together on the moors. Even the very words which she had
spoken, or the way she had acted, or how she had looked, in
cheap cotton frock and pinafore, were recalled by a familiar
cry, or by the sudden discovery of a bog-flower in bloom.</p>

<p>It was a glorious afternoon in late July. The hum of insect
life seemed to flood the whole moor; the scent of mown hay
and wild thyme, and late hawthorn blossom from the trees
on the edge of the moor, was heavy in the air, and the sun was
very hot, and still high in the heavens. The hills that bordered
the moor drowsed and brooded, like ancient gods,
clothed in a lordly radiance that was slowly consuming them
as they meditated upon their coming oblivion.</p>

<p>The heather gave promise, in the tiny purple buds that
sprouted from the strong, rough stems, of the blaze of purple
glory that would carpet the moors with magic in the coming
days of autumn. Yet there was a vague hint, in the too deep
silence, and in the great clouds that were slowly drifting along
the sky, of pent-up force merely awaiting the time to be set
free to gallop across the moor in anger and destruction. The
clouds, too, were deeply red, with orange touches here and
there, trailing into dark inky ragged edges.</p>

<p>Far away, at the foot of the hills a crofter's cow lowed lazily,
calling forth a summons to be taken in and relieved of its burden
of milk. The sheep came nearer to the &quot;bughts,&quot; and the
lambs burrowed for nourishment, with tails wagging, as they
drew their sustenance, prodding and punching the patient
mothers in the operation of feeding. Robert, noting all, with
leisured enjoyment strolled lazily into the little copse, and lay
down beneath the cool, grateful shelter of the trees.</p>

<p>Drugged by the sweetness and the solitude, he fell asleep,
and the sun was low on the horizon when he awoke, the
whole copse ringing with the evening songs of merle and
mavis, and other less musical birds, and, as he looked down
the glade, he saw, out on the moorland path, coming straight
for the grove, the form of Mysie&mdash;the form of which he had
dreamed, and for which he had longed so much.</p>

<p>The hot blood mounted to his face and raced through his
frame, while his heart thumped at the thought that now, in
the quietness of the dell, he would meet her and speak to her.
He would speak calmly, and not frighten her, as he had done
on that former occasion; and he braced himself to meet her.</p>

<p>Impatiently he waited, and then, as he saw her about to
enter the grove, he rose as unconcernedly as he could, trying
hard to assume the air of one who had met her by accident,
and stepped on to the path when Mysie was within ten yards
or so of him.</p>

<p>The color left her face, and her limbs felt weak beneath
her, as she recognized him, and he was quick to note the
change in her whole appearance.</p>

<p>She was paler, he thought, and thinner, and the bloom of
a few weeks ago was gone. Her eyes were listless, and the
soft, shy look had been replaced by an averted shame-stricken
one. She was plainly flurried by the meeting, and looking
about trying to find if there were not, even yet, a way of
evading it.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a fine nicht, Mysie,&quot; he began, stammering and halting
before her, &quot;though I think it is gaun to work to rain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; she responded hurriedly, her agitation growing, as
she was forced to halt before him.</p>

<p>&quot;I've come oot on the muir a wheen o' nichts noo, to try
an' meet you,&quot; he began, getting into the business right away,
&quot;an' I had begun to think you had stopped comin' owre.&quot;</p>

<p>But Mysie answered never a word. Her face grew paler,
and her agitation became more evident.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie,&quot; he began, now fully braced for the important
matter in view, &quot;I want you to marry me. I want you to
be my wife. You've kenned me a' my life. We gaed to the
school together, and we gaed to work together, an' I hae aye
looked on you as my lass. I canna keep it ony langer noo.
I hae wanted to tell you a lang time aboot it, an' to ask you
to be my wife. My place at hame is easier noo. My mother
has the rest o' the family comin' on to take my place, and
her battle is gey weel owre, an' I can see prospects o' settin'
up a hoose o' my ain, if you'll agree to share it with me. I
haven't muckle to offer you, but I think you'll ken by this time
that I'll be guid to you. Mysie, I want you. Will you
come?&quot;</p>

<p>For answer, Mysie burst into tears, her shoulders heaving
with the sobs of her grief, her breast surging and falling, while
her little hands covered her eyes, as she stood with bent head,
a pitiable little figure.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, Mysie?&quot; he enquired, his hands at once going
tenderly over her bent head, and caressing it as he spoke,
&quot;What is it, Mysie? Tell me. Hae I vexed you by speakin'
like that? Dinna greet, Mysie,&quot; he went on soothingly, his
voice soft and tender, and vibrant with sympathy and love.
&quot;Dinna greet. But tell me what's wrang. I'm sorry if it's
me that has done it, Mysie. Maybe I hae frightened you;
but, there now, dinna greet. I didna mean ony harm!&quot; and he
stroked and caressed her hair softly with his hands, or patted
her shoulders at every word, as a mother does with a fretful
child.</p>

<p>&quot;There noo, Mysie, dinna greet,&quot; he said again, the soft,
soothing note of vexation in his voice growing more tender and
husky with emotion. &quot;Look up, Mysie, for I dinna like to see
you greetin'. It maun be something gey bad, surely, to mak'
you greet like this,&quot; and his hands seemed to stab her with
every tender touch, and his soft words but added more pain
to her grief.</p>

<p>But still Mysie never answered. Her tears instead flowed
faster, and her sobs grew heavier, until finally she moaned like
a stricken animal in pain.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie! Mysie! my dochter, what is it?&quot; unable to control
himself longer. &quot;Surely you can tell me what ails you? What
is it, Mysie? Look up, my dear! Look up an' tell me what
ails you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&quot; moaned Mysie, the floodgates of her
grief now wide, and her soul in torture.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie,&quot; he cried, taking her head between his hands and
raising it up, &quot;what is it that's wrang with you? Is it me
that is the cause o' you being vexed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, no,&quot; she moaned, trying to avert her face. &quot;Oh,
dinna, Rob!&quot; she pleaded, and the old familiar name smote
him and thrilled him as of old.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me what is the matter,&quot; he said, a stronger note in
his voice, the old masterful spirit asserting itself again. &quot;What
is wrang wi' you? I can't understand it, an' I wish to try an'
help you.&quot;</p>

<p>But still she sobbed and there was no answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; he said. &quot;Tell me plainly if I have been the
cause of this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; oh, no,&quot; she sobbed, again hiding her eyes with her
hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Very weel, then,&quot; he went on. &quot;Will you no' tell me what
is wrong? I canna understand it unless you tell me. Are
you in ony trouble o' ony kind? Speak, Mysie.&quot; Then, his
voice becoming more pleading in its tones, &quot;Wad you be feart
to be my wife, Mysie? I aye thocht you cared for me. I
hae loved you a' my days. You maun ken that, I think. Speak
up, Mysie, an' tell me if you care for me. I want you, an' I
maun ken what you think o' it. Come, Mysie, tell me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dinna ask me, Rob,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;Dinna ask me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter then?&quot; he cried. &quot;There's something
wrong, an' you'll no' tell me. Very well, tell me what you
mean to do. I hae asked you a fair question. Are you going
to marry me? I want yes or no to that,&quot; and there was a
touch of impatience creeping into his voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on,&quot; he urged, after a short silence, broken only by
Mysie's sobs, &quot;gie me an answer. Or, if you wad raither wait
a wee while, till this trouble has blawn by that is bothering
you, I'm quite agreeable to wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It'll never blaw by, Rob,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;Oh, dinna ask me
ony mair. I canna be your wife noo, an' I jist want to be left
alane!&quot;</p>

<p>The pain and despair in her voice alarmed him. It was
so keen and poignant, and went to his heart like a knife.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; he gasped in surprise, as he strove to call his pride
to his assistance. It was so unlike what he had anticipated
that it amazed him to have such a disappointing reply. Then,
recovering somewhat:&mdash;&quot;Very well!&quot; with great deliberation,
while his voice sounded unnaturally strained. Then the effort
failing, and his pride breaking down: &quot;Oh, Mysie, Mysie,&quot;
he burst out in poignant agony again relapsing into the pleading
wooing tones that were so difficult to withstand, &quot;How I
hae loved you! I thocht you cared for me. I hae built mysel'
up in you, an' I'll never, never be able to forget you! Oh,
think what it is! You hae been life itsel' to me, Mysie, an'
I canna think that you dinna care! Oh, Mysie!&quot;</p>

<p>He turned away, his heart sore and his soul wounded, and
strode from the copse out on to the moor, a thousand thoughts
driving him on, a thousand regrets pursuing, and a load of
pain in his heart that was bearing his spirit down.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear God!&quot; moaned Mysie, kneeling down, her legs
unable to support her longer, &quot;Oh, dear God, my heart'll
break!&quot; and a wild burst of sobbing shook her frame, and her
grief overpowering flowed through the tears&mdash;a picture of utter
despair and terrible hopelessness.</p>

<p>Robert tore away from the dell, his whole calculation of
things upset. To think that Mysie could not love him had
never entered his head. What was wrong with her? What was
the nature of her terrible grief?</p>

<p>He kicked savagely at a thistle which grew upon the edge
of the pathway, his pride wounded, but now in possession of
the citadel of his heart; and on he strode, still driven by the
terrible passion raging within him; resolving already, as many
have done under like circumstances, that his life was finished.
Hope had gone, dreams were unreal and vanishing as the mist
that crawled along the bog-pools at night.</p>

<p>At the crest of the little hill, just where it sloped down to
the village, he stood and looked back.</p>

<p>Good God! Was he seeing aright! The figure of a man,
who in the gray gloaming looked well-dressed, was approaching
Mysie, and she was slowly moving to meet him. A few
steps more, and the man had the girl, he thought, in his arms,
and was kissing her where they stood.</p>

<p>Was he dreaming? What was the meaning of all this?
&quot;Oh, Christ!&quot; he groaned. &quot;What does it all mean?&quot; and he
rubbed his eyes and looked again, then sat down, all his pride
and anger raging within him as he watched, kindling the jungle
instinct within him into a raging fire, to fight for his mate&mdash;his
by right of class and association. He doubled back, as the
two figures turned in the direction of the copse&mdash;the resolve
in his mind to go back and forcibly tear Mysie from this unknown
stranger. He would fight for her. She was his, and he
was prepared to assert his right of possession before all the
world.</p>

<p>In a mad fury he started forward, a raging anger in his
heart, striding along in quick, determined, relentless steps,
his blood jumping and his energy roused, and all the madness
of a strong nature coursing through him; but after a few
yards he hesitated, stopped, and then turned back.</p>

<p>After all, Mysie must have made an appointment with this
man. She evidently wanted him, and that was her reason for
asking to be left alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, God!&quot; he groaned again, sitting down. &quot;This is hellish!&quot;
and he began to turn over the whole business in his
mind once more.</p>

<p>Long he sat, and the darkness fell over the moor, matching
the darkness that brooded over his heart and mind. He heard
the moor-birds crying in restlessness, and saw the clouds piling
themselves up, and come creeping darkly over the higher
ground, bringing a threat of rain in their wake. The moan
in the wind became louder, presaging a storm; but still he sat
or lay upon the rough, withered grass, fighting out his battle,
meeting the demons of despair and gloom, and the legions of
pain and misery, in greater armies than ever he had met them
before.</p>

<p>Again he groaned, as his ear caught the plaintive note of a
widowed partridge, which sat behind him upon a grassy knoll
of turf, crying out on the night air, an ache in every cry, the
grief and sorrow of his wounded, breaking heart.</p>

<p>It seemed to Robert that there was a strange sort of kinship
between him and the bird&mdash;a kinship and understanding which
touched a chord of ready feeling in his heart. The ominous
hoot of an owl in the wood startled him, and he rose to his feet.
He could not sit still. Idleness would drive him mad. He
strode off on to the moor, away from the track, his whole being
burning in torture, and his mind a mass of unconnected fancies
and pains.</p>

<p>Over the bogs and through the marshes, the madness of
despair within him, he heeded not the deep ditches and the
bog-pools. They were the pits of darkness, the sty-pools,
which his soul must either cross, or in which he must perish.
He tore up the hills into the mists and the rising storm, the
thick clouds, full of rain, enveloping him, and matching the
terrible fury of his breast.</p>

<p>On, ever on, in the darkness and the mire, through clumps
of whin and stray bushes of wild briar. On, always on, driven
and lashed into action by the resistless desire to get away
from himself. He knew not the direction he had taken. He
had lost his bearings on the moor; the darkness had completely
hidden the landmarks, and even had he been conscious of his
actions, he could not have told in which part of the moor he
was.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, God!&quot; he groaned again, almost falling over a bush
of broom; and sitting down, he buried his face in his hands,
and, forgetful of the wind and the rain, which now drove down
in torrents, sat and brooded and thought, his mind seeking to
understand the chaos of despair.</p>

<p>What was the meaning of life? What was beyond it after
death? Would immortality, if such there were, be worth having?
Men in countless, unthinkable millions, had lived, and
loved, and lost, and passed on. Did immortality carry with it
pain and suffering for them? If not, did it carry happiness
and balm? To hell with religions and philosophies, he
thought; they were all a parcel of fairy tales to drug men's
minds and keep them tame; and he glared impotently at the
pitiless heavens, as if he would defy gods, and devils, and
men. He would be free&mdash;free in mind, in thought, and unhampered
by unrealities!</p>

<p>No. Men had the shaping of their own lives. Pride would
be his ally. He would lock up this episode in his heart, and
at the end of time for him, there would be an end of the
pain and the regret, when he was laid among the myriad millions
of men of all the countless ages since man had
being.</p>

<p>This was immortality; to be forever robed in the dreamless
draperies of eternal oblivion, rather than have eternal life,
with all its torments&mdash;mingling with the legions of the past,
and with mother earth&mdash;the dust of success and happiness
indistinguishable from the dust of failure and despair. Time
alone would be his relief&mdash;the great physician that healed all
wounds.</p>

<p>The wind blew stronger and the rain fell heavier, the one
chasing, the other in raging gusts, and both tearing round and
lashing the form of the man who sat motionless and unaware
of all this fury. The wind god tried to shake him up by rushing
and roaring at him; but still there was no response. Then,
gathering re-inforcements, he came on in a mad charge, driving
a cloud of rain in front of him as a sort of spear-head to
break the defense of fearlessness and unconcern of this unhappy
mortal. Yet the figure moved not.</p>

<p>Baffled and still more angry, the wind god retired behind
the hills again to rest; then, driving a larger rain-cloud before
him, with a roar and a crash he tore down the slope, raging
and tearing in a wild tumult of anger, straight against the
lonely figure which sat there never moving, his head sunk
upon his breast.</p>

<p>Beaten and sullen, the god again retired to re-collect his
strength. He moaned and growled as he retired, frightening
the moor-birds and the hares, which lay closer to earth, their
little hearts quivering with fear. Young birds were tucked
safely under the parent wing, as terror strode across the moor,
striking dread into every fluttering little heart and shivering
body. Low growled the wind, as he ran around his broken
forces, gathering again new forces in greater and greater multitudes.</p>

<p>Just then, with an oath, the figure rose and faced the storm,
striding again up the slope, as if determined to carry the war
into the camp of the enemy.</p>

<p>A low growl came rumbling from the hills, as the wind god
rushed along, encouraging his legions, threatening, coaxing,
pleading, commanding them to fight, and so to overcome this
figure who now boldly faced his great army.</p>

<p>The advance guard of the storm broke upon him in wild desperation,
rushing and thundering, howling and yelling, sputtering
and hissing, spitting and hitting at him, and then the main
body struck him full in the face, all the bulk and the force
of it hurled upon him with terrible impetuous abandon, and
Robert's foot striking a tuft at the moment, he went down,
down into a bog-pool among the slush and moss, and decaying
heather-roots, down before the mad rush of the wind-god's
army, who roared and shouted in glee, with a voice that shook
the hills and called upon the elements to laugh and rejoice.</p>

<p>And the widowed partridge out upon the moor, creeping
closer to the lee side of his tuft of moss, cried out in his pain,
not because of the fury of the blast, but because of the heart
that was breaking under the little shivering body for the dead
mate, who had meant so much of life and happiness to him&mdash;cried
with an ache in every cry, and the heart of the man
responded in his great, overpowering grief.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h2>PETER MAKES A DECISION</h2>


<p>Peter Rundell often wondered what had become of
Mysie. For a day or two after the evening of the day
of the games, he had shunned the possibility of meeting
her, because of the shame that filled his heart.</p>

<p>His face burned when his thoughts went back to the evening
in the grove on the moor. He wondered how it had all happened.
He had not meant anything wrong when he suggested
the walk. He could not account for what had occurred, and so
he pondered and his shame rankled.</p>

<p>Then an uneasy feeling took possession of him and he felt
he would like to see Mysie.</p>

<p>A week slipped away and he tried to find a way of coming
in contact with her, but no real chance ever presented itself.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed and he grew still more uneasy. He grew
anxious and there was a hot fear pricking at his heart. Then
at last, one day he caught a glimpse of her, and his heart was
smitten with dread.</p>

<p>She was changed. Her appearance was altered. She was
thinner, much thinner and very white and listless. The old
air of gayety and bubbling spirits was gone. Her step seemed
to drag, instead of the bright patter her feet used to make;
and his anxiety increased and finally he decided that he must
talk with her.</p>

<p>There was something wrong and he wanted to know what
it was. He tried to make an excuse for seeing her alone but
no chance presented itself, and another week went past and he
grew desperate. Then luck almost threw her into his arms one
day in the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie,&quot; he whispered, &quot;there is something I want to
discuss with you. Meet me in the grove to-night about ten.
I must see you. Will you come?&quot;</p>

<p>She nodded and passed on, not daring to raise her eyes,
her face flaming suddenly into shame, and the color leaving it
again, gave her a deeper pallor; and so he had to be content
with that.</p>

<p>All day he was fidgety and ill at ease, torn by a thousand
dreads, and consumed by anxiety, waiting impatiently for the
evening, and puzzling over what could be the matter. He
felt that for one moment of mad indiscretion, when allowing
himself to be cast adrift upon the sea of passion, the frail
bark of his life had set out upon an adventure from which
he could not now turn back. He was out upon the great ocean
current of circumstances, where everything was unknown and
uncharted, so far as he was concerned. What rocks lay in
his track, he did not know; but his heart guessed, and sought
in many ways of finding a course that would bring his voyage
to an end in the haven of comfort and respectability. Respectability
was his god, as he knew it was the god of his
parents. Money might save him; but there was something repugnant
in the thought of leaving the whole burden of disgrace
upon Mysie. For, after all, the fault was wholly his, and it
was his duty to face the consequences. Still if a way could be
found of getting over it in an easy way it would be better.
But he would leave that till the evening when he had learned
from Mysie, whether his fears were correct or not, and then
a way might be found out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>But the day seemed long in passing, and by the time the
clock chimed nine he was in a fever of excitement, and pained
and ill with dread.</p>

<p>Yet he was late when it came the hour, and Mysie was there
first and had already met Robert before he reached the grove.</p>

<p>When Robert had gone away, and she sat crying upon the
moor, she felt indeed as if the whole world was slipping from
her and that her life was finished. Only ruin, black, unutterable,
stared her in the face. Oh, if only Robert had spoken
sooner, she thought. If only that terrible beautiful night with
its moonlight witchery had not been lived as it had been! If
only something had intervened to prevent what had happened!
And she sobbed in her despair, knowing what was before her
and learning all too late, that Robert was the man she loved
and wanted.</p>

<p>Then when her passionate grief had spent itself, she rose
as she saw Peter coming hurriedly to meet her.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter, Mysie?&quot; he asked with real concern in
his voice, noting the tear-stained face and her over-wrought
condition. &quot;What is it, Mysie?&quot;</p>

<p>But Mysie did not answer just then, and they both turned
and passed into the grove, walking separately, as if afraid of
each other's touch, and something repellent keeping them
apart.</p>

<p>They sat down, carefully avoiding the place where they had
sat on that other fateful occasion, nearly a month before, and
a long silence elapsed before words were again spoken.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Mysie,&quot; said Peter at last breaking the silence, and
bracing himself to hear unpleasant news, &quot;I want to know
what is wrong. What is the matter?&quot; and he feared to hear
her tell her trouble.</p>

<p>But again only tears&mdash;tears and sobs, terrible in their intensity
as if the frail little body would break completely under
the strain of her grief.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie,&quot; he said, and his voice had a note of tender anxiety
in it, &quot;what is it, dear? Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shouldn't need to ask,&quot; she replied between her sobs.
&quot;You shouldn't need to ask when you should ken.&quot;</p>

<p>Again a long silence, and Peter felt he had got a heavy blow.
A sickening feeling of shame smote his heart at the knowledge
hinted at&mdash;a knowledge he had feared to learn.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;am I the cause of it, Mysie? Is&mdash;is it&mdash;?&quot;
and his voice was hoarse and dry and pained.</p>

<p>She nodded, and Peter knew beyond all doubt that he was
the cause of the misery.</p>

<p>Again a long silence fell between them, in which both seemed
to live an eternity of silence and pain. Then clearing his
throat, Peter spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie,&quot; he said, &quot;there is only one thing to be done
then,&quot; and there was decision in his voice and a desire which
meant that he was going to rise to a height to which neither
he nor Mysie ever expected he would rise. &quot;We must get
married.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him, with eyes still wet, but searching his face
keenly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay. It's a' richt sayin' that now, efter the thing's done,&quot;
she said bitterly.</p>

<p>&quot;But it is the only thing, Mysie, that can be done,&quot; he replied
quickly. &quot;I can't think of anything else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should hae thought aboot that afore. It's nae use
now,&quot; she said bluntly.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Mysie,&quot; he asked in surprise. &quot;Why is it no use?
Wouldn't you like to marry me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied firmly. &quot;I would not! Do you think
I have no thought o' mysel'? If nothing had happened, you
would never hae thought aboot me for your wife. But now
that you've done something you canna get oot o' you'd like
to mak' me believe you want to help me bear the disgrace,
while a' the time you don't want to. But it's no' my disgrace,&quot;
and there was heat creeping into her voice. &quot;It is yours, an'
you should hae thocht aboot a' that afore,&quot; and her voice
was very angry as she finished.</p>

<p>&quot;You are wrong, Mysie,&quot; he replied mollifyingly. &quot;I love,
you and I told you that before it happened, and I also hinted
that I wanted to marry you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but that was just at the time. Maybe if nothing had
happened, an' I had never been in your company again, you'd
soon hae forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Mysie, you are wrong. I love you, and I've brought
you to this, for which I am sorry, so we must be married,&quot;
he said decisively.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; she asked, and her eyes met his honestly and fairly.</p>

<p>&quot;Because it is the right thing to do,&quot; he replied quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that a'?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it not enough? What else is there to do?&quot; Mysie was
silent, and after a while Peter went on;&mdash;&quot;It is a duty, dear,
but I am going to face it, and shoulder the responsibility. It
is the right thing to do, and it must be done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' you are gaun to dae it, just as a bairn tak's medicine;
because you are forced. I asked if that was a', and it
seems to be. But what if I don't have onything mair to dae
with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You would not do that, Mysie,&quot; he said hurriedly, and
incredulously. It had never entered his mind that she would
refuse to marry him, and he looked upon his offer as a great
service which he was doing her. &quot;Why, what could you do
otherwise?&quot; he asked looking blankly at her.</p>

<p>&quot;I could work as I hae always done,&quot; she said sharply.
&quot;You surely think you are a catch. Man, efter what has happened
I feel that I wudna care than I never saw you again.
You hae little o' rale manliness in you. You thocht it was gran'
to carry on wi' a workin' lassie, maybe,&quot; and there was bitter
scorn in her voice, &quot;an' now when you hae landed yourself into
a mess you are grinning like a bear with the branks an'
wantin' to dae what is richt as you call it,&quot; and Mysie was
now really in a temper.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie, you must not speak like that,&quot; he broke in, in
earnest tones. &quot;You know I love you, and loving you as I do,
I want to shield you as much&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but you want to shield yourself first,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear, it is only of you I am thinking. I love you
very much and want to do what is right. Even although this
had not happened, I was going to ask you to be my wife. Will
you marry me, Mysie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What'll your folks say?&quot; she asked bluntly. &quot;You ken
that I'm no' the wife you would have gotten nor the yin your
folk would like you to get,&quot; she said, searching his face with a
keen look. &quot;I'm no' born in your class. I'm ignorant an'
have not the fine manners your wife should have, an' I doot
neither your faither nor your mither wad consent to such a
thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I won't ask them,&quot; he replied. &quot;I am a man for myself,
and do not see why they should be asked to approve my
actions in this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, that's a' richt; but what aboot your ain feelings in the
matter? Am I the lass you wad hae ta'en, Peter, if this hadna
happened?&quot; and there was a world of hungry appeal in her
voice as she finished. It was as if she wanted to be assured
that it was for herself alone that he really wanted to marry
her.</p>

<p>&quot;Why should you not?&quot; he enquired.</p>

<p>&quot;That's no' the question,&quot; she said, noting the evasion.
&quot;You ken as weel as I dae that it wad be an ill match for you.
You've been brought up differently. You've had eddication,
an' an easy life. You've been trained faur differently, an' you
canna say that you'd no' tire o' me. I have not as muckle
learning as wad make me spell my ain name, an' I could never
fill the position o' your wife with the folk I'd have to mix
with.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's all right, Mysie,&quot; he said, ready to counter her
argument. &quot;You have not been educated, that is true, but it
is only a question of having you trained. If one woman can
be educated and trained so can another. This is what I propose
to do: I go back to Edinburgh in a fortnight to finish
my last year. My father has put the colliery into a company,
and he has a large part of the management on his shoulders.
He expects when I come home next year to gradually retire.
I shall be the controlling power then, and he will slip out of
the business and end his days in leisure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but you are thinking a' the time aboot the disgrace,&quot;
she said. &quot;Your whole thought is about your position, an'
you hae never a real thought aboot me.&quot; She was somewhat
mollified; but there was still a hard note in her voice, and not a
little distrust too. &quot;Are you sure you are no' proposin' this
just because o' the trouble? I don't want peety! I am pairtly
to blame too,&quot; this with a softer note creeping into her voice,
and making it more resigned. &quot;If it's no' oot o' peety for me,
I could bear it better. But I'll no' hae peety. I can look after
mysel' an' face the whole thing, even though I ken it'll break
my mither's heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know what it is for you, Mysie,&quot; he said. &quot;I am trying
to look at the whole thing from your point of view. That's
why I have planned to give you some sort of a training, and
make it as easy for you as possible. It is for your position
I am worrying and when I come into my father's place I will
be able to put all things right for you, and make you really
happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you have not faced the main bit yet,&quot; she said as
he ceased speaking. &quot;Where do I come in? You hae got this
to face now, an' it'll no' wait a' that time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; he replied, &quot;I'm just coming to that. At
first it won't perhaps look too nice to you, but remember,
Mysie, I want to face the matter honestly and you'll have
to help me. Very well,&quot; he went on. &quot;As I said, I go back to
Edinburgh in three weeks at most&mdash;I'll try and go in a fortnight,
and you must go with me&mdash;not traveling together. We
must keep all our affairs to ourselves, and not even your parents
or mine must know. When I go away you'll come the day
after. You can travel over the moor to Greyrigg station, take
the 4:30 train from there and I can meet you at Edinburgh.
I'll get a house next week when I go to arrange for my term.
I shall tell no one. You can live in the house I get and I can
continue perhaps in lodgings, and I shall come and visit you
as often as I can.&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped for a little and then resumed:&mdash;&quot;I shall buy
books for you and come and teach you the things you'll need
to learn, or I can get someone to do it, if you'd like that
better. Then when you are thoroughly trained, I can bring
you home to Rundell House and all will be well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' what aboot&mdash;what aboot&mdash;&quot; she paused, averting
her face. &quot;Are you no' forgettin' that it'll tak' a lang time
for me to learn a' I'll need; for I'm gey ill to learn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Mysie,&quot; he replied reassuringly. &quot;When you arrive
in Edinburgh, we can go next day to be married before the
Sheriff. It's all right, Mysie dear,&quot; he assured her as he saw
the questioning look in her eyes. &quot;Don't think I'm trying to
trap you. I want to make what amends I can for what has
happened. You'll be my wife just as surely as if the minister
married us. If you are not content with that we can easily
get married with a minister after we decide to come back here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But wad that be a true marriage?&quot; she asked, scarcely able
to credit what he told her. &quot;Wad I get marriage lines?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes. It would be legal, and you'd get marriage lines.
Now what do you say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna like the thocht o' no' tellin' my mither. Will I
hae to gang away, an' no' tell her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you must not tell anyone,&quot; he replied quickly. &quot;No
one must know or all our plans will go crash, and we'll both
be left to face the shame of the whole thing. So you must not
tell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mither will break her heart,&quot; she broke in again with a
hint of a sob. &quot;She'll wonder where I am, an' worry aboot
me, wi' nae word o' me! Am I just to disappear oot o' everybody's
kennin' altogether? Oh, dear! It'll break my mither's
heart,&quot; and she cried again at the thought of the pain and
anxiety which her parents would experience.</p>

<p>So they sat and talked, he trying to soothe and allay her
anxiety and she, at first openly skeptical, and then by and by
allowing herself to be persuaded.</p>

<p>All this time they had been too engrossed in their own
affairs to notice how the wind had risen and that a storm
was already breaking over the moor. Then suddenly realizing
it, they started for home.</p>

<p>It was nearing midnight, and the clouds being thick and
low made the mossy ground very dark. The rain was coming
down heavily and everything pointed to a wild night.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry I did not bring a coat with me,&quot; said Peter,
taking the windward side of Mysie, so as to break the storm
for her. &quot;I had no idea that it was going so rain when I
came away,&quot; and they plowed their way through the long
rough grass, plashing through the little pools they were unable
to see, while the wind raged and tore across the moor in a
high gale.</p>

<p>He had a key in his pocket and when they arrived at Rundell
House he noiselessly opened the door, and they entered,
slipping along like burglars.</p>

<p>When Mysie reached her room, she sat down to think
matters over for herself, forgetful of the fact that she was wet.
She sat a long time pondering in her slow untrained way
over the arrangements which had been come to, her mind
trying to get accustomed to the thought that she was going
to be Peter's wife and to leave Lowwood.</p>

<p>But somehow the thought of being his wife did not appeal
to her now, as it had done when she had pictured herself the
lady of the district with her dreams of everything she desired,
and fancying herself the envy of every woman who knew her.</p>

<p>The secrecy of the business she did not like; but she told
herself it would all come right; that it was necessary under
the circumstances and that afterwards when she had been
taught and trained in the ways of his people she would come
back and all would be well.</p>

<p>Then in the midst of all this looking into the future with
its doubts and promises, came the thought of Robert, and her
pulses thrilled and her blood quickened; but it had come
too late.</p>

<p>Would she rather be at Rundell House as Peter's wife or
sitting in a one-roomed apartment sewing pit clothes perhaps,
or washing and scrubbing in the slavery in which the women
folk of her class generally lived? Ah, yes, as Robert's wife
that would have been happiness. But it was all too late now.
She had turned aside&mdash;and she must pay the penalty of it all.</p>

<p>Long she sat, and cried, and at last realizing that she was
cold and shivering, she took off her clothes and crawled off
to bed, her last thought of Robert as he had left her, the
pain in his eyes and the awful agony in his voice: &quot;Oh, Mysie,
how I hae loved you! An' I thocht you cared for me!&quot;
rang in her ears as she lay and tossed in sleepless misery.</p>

<p>In the morning she was in a high fever and unable to rise
out of her bed. She had a headache and felt wretched and ill.
In her exhausted state, weakened by worry and her resistance
gone, the drenching, the chill and the long sitting in her
lonely room had overmastered her completely.</p>

<p>She raved about Robert, crying to him in her fevered excitement,
and he, all unconscious, was at that time at his
work, tired also and exhausted by his terrible night upon the
moor.</p>

<p>When he stumbled and fell into the mossy pool, his mind
became more collected and, scrambling out, he stood to consider
where he was, trying to find his bearings in the thick
darkness.</p>

<p>The low whinnying of a horse near by gave him a clew and
he started in the direction of the cry, concluding that it was
some of the horses sheltering behind a dyke which ran across
the moor from the end of the village.</p>

<p>He crawled and scrambled along, and after going about
twenty yards he came to the dyke, at the other side of which
stood the cowering horses.</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa, Bob,&quot; he said soothingly, and one of them whinnied
back in response as if glad to know that a human being was
near. He moved nearer to them, and began to stroke their
manes and clap their necks, to which they responded by rubbing
their faces against him and cuddling an affectionate return
for the sympathy in his voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Puir Bob,&quot; he said, tenderly, as he patted the neck of the
animal which rubbed its soft nose against his arm. It seemed
so glad of the companionship and reached nearer as Robert
put out his other hand to stroke sympathetically the nose of
the other horse, as he also drew near.</p>

<p>&quot;Puir Rosy,&quot; he said. &quot;Was you feart for the wind and
the rain? Poor lass! It's an awfu' nicht to be oot in!&quot; and
they rubbed themselves against him and whinnied with a low
pleased gurgle, grateful for his kindness and company as he
patted and stroked the soft velvet skins, and they rubbed
themselves against him as if each were jealous lest his attentions
be not equally divided.</p>

<p>He stood for a short time, thus fondling and patting them,
then keeping to the dyke, he made his way along it and he
thus came out right at the end of the village, and knowing his
way now with confidence, he was soon at the door of his
home. Cautiously opening it, afraid he would awaken the
inmates, whom he concluded must all be asleep, he slipped
in quietly, bolting the door behind him, and reached the
fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me, Rob,&quot; said his mother. &quot;Where in the name o'
goodness hae you been the nicht! I sat up till after midnight
aye expectin' you'd be in, sae I gaed awa' to my bed
to lie wauken till you should come in. You are awfu' late.&quot;</p>

<p>He did not answer but stooped to take off his boots, and
Mrs. Sinclair was soon out of bed and upon the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Michty me, laddie! You are wringin' wet! Where have
you been? Rain and glaur to the e'en holes! Get thae wet
claes off you at yince, an' I'll get dry shirts for you, an'
then awa' till your bed!&quot; she rattled on, running to the chest
in the room and coming back with dry clothes in her arms.
&quot;My, I never kent you oot o' the hoose as late as this in a'
your life! Have you been oot in a' that rain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he answered, but venturing nothing more, as he went
on changing.</p>

<p>&quot;It's been an awfu' nicht o' wind and rain,&quot; she again observed,
glancing at his dripping clothes, and conveying a hint
that explanations were desirable.</p>

<p>&quot;I canna understand at a' what way you hae bidden oot
in a' that rain, Lod's sake? It's enough to gie you your
daeth o' cauld. You are wet to the skin, an' there's no a
dry steek on you? Hae you been oot in it a'?&quot; and her
curiosity she felt was too crudely put to be answered.</p>

<p>Robert knew that she was bent on having an explanation,
and that if he gave her any encouragement at all she'd soon
have the whole story out of him.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said curtly, &quot;but I'm no' gaun to talk ony the
nicht. I'm gaun to my bed for an oor before risin' time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll never gaun till your work the day,&quot; she said in
warm concern. &quot;You'll never be able. You'd better tak' a
rest, my laddie. A day will no' mak' muckle difference noo.
We're no sae ill aff, an' I wadna like to hae onything gaun
wrang. Gang away till your bed, an' dinna bother aboot
your work. A guid rest'll maybe keep you frae getting the
cauld.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a' richt, mither,&quot; he replied as airily as he could.
&quot;Dinna worry; an' be sure an' wauken me for my work. I'm
na gaun to bide in when there is naething wrang. You gang
awa' to your bed,&quot; and she knowing that was the last word,
did not speak further, and as he withdrew to his room, she
went back to bed wondering more and more at the mystery
of it all.</p>

<p>But he did not sleep. Torn by worry and in spite of his
earlier resolution to think no more about it he lay and thought
and wondered about Mysie, and the man he saw, joining her
at the end of the grove; and when Nellie opened the door to
call him that it was &quot;rising time,&quot; Robert answered to the
first cry, and his mother was more amazed than ever; for
he generally took a good many cries, being a heavy sleeper.
But being sensible she kept her wonder to herself, knowing if
it were anything which she had a right to know he'd tell her
in his own good time.</p>

<h2>A STIR IN LOWWOOD</h2>


<p>&quot;My! Div you ken what has happened?&quot; asked Mrs.
Johnstone, bursting in upon Mrs. Sinclair one day
about two weeks later. &quot;My, it's awfu'!&quot; she continued
in breathless excitement, her head wagging and nodding
with every word, as if to emphasize it, her eyes almost
jumping out with excitement, and her whole appearance
showing that she had got hold of a piece of information which
was of the first importance. &quot;My, it's awfu',&quot; she repeated
again lifting her hands up to a level with her breast, and then
letting them fall again, &quot;Mysie Maitland has ran away frae
her place, an' naebidy kens where she has gane to. An' Mrs.
Rundell, mind you, has been that guid to her too, givin'
her her caps an' aprons, an' whiles buyin' her a bit dress length
forby, an' she gi'ed her boots and slippers, an' a whole lot o'
ither things to tak' hame for the bairns&mdash;things that were owre
wee for the weans at Rundell Hoose but were quite guid to
wear. My, it's awfu'! Isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie Maitland!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Sinclair in astonishment.
&quot;When did this happen? Where has she gane? Are you sure
you hinna made a mistake?&quot; and Mrs. Sinclair was all excitement,
hanging in breathless anxiety upon the tidings her
neighbor brought.</p>

<p>&quot;I hae made nae mistake, Nellie Sinclair,&quot; returned Leezie,
&quot;for it was her ain mother wha telt me the noo. I was at the
store, an' when I was comin' hame I met Jenny hersel' gaun
awa' tae Rundell Hoose. She was greetin' an' I couldna' get
oot o' spierin' at her what was wrang, an' she telt me her ain
self.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You dinna mean tae tell me that Mysie Maitland has
disappeared? In the name o' a' that's guid, what has happened
to bring aboot sic news?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, it's true, Nellie,&quot; replied Mrs. Johnstone, feeling very
important now that she knew Mrs. Sinclair had not heard the
news.</p>

<p>&quot;When did this happen?&quot; asked the latter, still incredulous.
&quot;Are you sure that's true? Dear me! I dinna ken what the
world's comin' to at a'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's awfu'! But it's true. You never ken what thae
quate kin' o' modest folk will dae. They look that bashfu'
that butter wadna' melt in their mouths; an' a' the time they
are just as like to gang wrang as ither folk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But wha said Mysie Maitland has gang wrang?&quot; enquired
Mrs. Sinclair, flaring up in Mysie's defense. &quot;I wadna' believe
it, though you went down on your bended knees to tell
me. A modester, weel-doin' lassie never lived in this place!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, I dinna ken whether she has gane wrang or not;
but she has ran awa', an' it is gey suspeecious conduct that
for ony lassie that is weel-doin'. She is jist like the rest of
folk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It canna' be true,&quot; said Mrs. Sinclair, still unable to believe
the news. &quot;I canna' take it in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but it is true,&quot; persisted her neighbor with assurance.
&quot;For I tell you, it was her ain mother what telt me hersel'.
It seems she has been missing since the day afore yesterday.
She gaed awa' in the afternoon to see her mither, an' as she
hadna been keepin' very weel for a day or two an' no comin'
back that night, Mrs. Rundell jist thought that Jenny had
keepit her at home for a holiday. But she didna turn up
yesterday, an' thinkin' maybe that the lassie had turned worse,
Mrs. Rundell sent owre word jist the noo, to ask how she was
keepin'; an' Jenny was fair thunder-struck when the man
came to the door to ask. Puir body! Jenny's awfu' puttin'
aboot owre the matter. I hope,&quot; she added, with the first show
of sympathy, &quot;that naething has happened to the lassie. That
wad be awfu'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear keep us!&quot; exclaimed Nellie. &quot;I hope nothing has
happened to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God knows!&quot; replied Mrs. Johnstone piously, for want of
something else to say. &quot;It's awfu'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do they ken naething at a' aboot her at Rundells'?&quot; again
enquired Mrs. Sinclair.</p>

<p>&quot;No' a thing they ken, ony mair than you or me. She left
her bits o' claes, jist as if she meant to come back. Her new
frock was in her drawer jist as she had put it by efter tryin'
it on. An' a braw frock it is. She has nothing except what
she was wearin' at the time she gaed oot. Her guid boots
jist yince on her feet are in her room, a' cleaned jist as she
took them off the last time she had them on. I canna' believe
it yet. My! it's awfu'! It'll be a sair, sair heart her faither'll
hae when he hears about it. He had aye an' awfu' wark wi'
Mysie, an' thought the world o' her. If he got Mysie richt
he ay seemed to think that a' else was richt. I hope nae harm
has come to her. I dinna ken what the world's comin' to at
a', I'm sure? My, it's awfu', isn't it?&quot; and Mrs. Johnstone
went out to spread the news, leaving Mrs. Sinclair more mystified
and astonished than ever she had been in her life.</p>

<p>Mysie missing! She could not understand it, and always
she tried to crush back the suggestion which was plainly evident
in Leezie's statement that Mysie had &quot;gang wrang.&quot; It
could not be that, for Mysie was never known to have dealings
with anyone likely to betray her like that. It was a
hopeless puzzle altogether, and she could not account for it.</p>

<p>It was nearing &quot;lousing time&quot; and Mrs. Sinclair was busy
getting the dinner ready, and water boiled to wash the men
coming in from the pit, and she wondered how Robert would
take the news.</p>

<p>She knew, having guessed, as most mothers do guess, that
Mysie held a sacred corner in Robert's heart; though noticing
the silence during the last two weeks, and his renewed attention
to books and study, she wondered if anything had come
between Mysie and himself. Had he at last spoken to her
and been discouraged? She could hardly harbor that thought,
for she felt also that Mysie's heart enshrined but one man,
and that was Robert. Yet what could be the meaning of all
this mystery?</p>

<p>It was true Mysie and Robert had never walked out as
young men and women of their class do; but she knew in their
hearts each regarded the other with very warm affection, and
thinking thus she worked about the house preparing things and
running occasionally over to Maitland's house, to see that the
dinner was cooking all right, and giving little attentions wherever
they were needed, in Mrs. Maitland's absence.</p>

<p>She did not mention the news to Robert when he came in,
but she watched him furtively as she worked about the house
getting the water into the tub for him to wash, before placing
the dinner on the table; but she guessed from his face
that he must have already heard of it on his way home.</p>

<p>He was silent as he pulled off his rough blue flannel shirt
and stooping over the well-filled tub of hot water, he began
to lave the water over his arms, and the upper part of his
body.</p>

<p>At last, Mrs. Sinclair could hold herself in no longer, and
looking keenly at the half-naked young man as he straightened
himself, having washed the coal-dust from his hands and arms,
he began to rub his breast and as much of his back as he could
reach, she said, &quot;Did you hear aboot Mysie, Rob?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he returned simply, trying to hide his agitation and
his blanching face. &quot;I heard that she had disappeared frae
her place, an' that nae news o' her could be got. Is it true,
mither?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's true, Rob,&quot; she replied. &quot;But I hinna got ony
richt waye o' it yet. Jenny's awa' owre to Rundell Hoose, an'
we'll no' ken onything till she comes back. It's an awfu'
business, an' will pit her faither an' mither a guid lot aboot.
I wonder what'll hae ta'en her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's hard to ken,&quot; he replied in a non-committal voice.
&quot;Hae you ony idea, mither, as to what has brought this aboot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Rob, I canna' say; but folks' tongues will soon be
busy, I hae nae doot, an' there will be a lot o' clip-clash, an'
everybody kennin' nothing, will ken the right way o't, an'
every yin will hae a different story to tell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, I hae nae doot,&quot; he said, again stooping over the tub
flinging some water over his head, and beginning to rub
the soap into a fine lather upon his hair. &quot;Everybody will
ken the right wye o' it, and will claver and gossip, when they
wad 'a be better to mind their ain affairs, an' let ither folk
alane.&quot;</p>

<p>His mother did not speak for a little, but went on with her
work. There was something on her mind about which she
wanted to speak, and she bustled about and washed, and clattered
the dishes; and every plate and spoon, as they were laid
dripping from the basin of warm water, plainly indicated that
something troubled her.</p>

<p>Finally, when the last steaming dish had been laid upon the
table, and she had begun to wipe them dry, she cleared her
throat, and in a somewhat strained sort of voice asked, &quot;Dae
you ken, Rob, onything aboot Mysie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, mither,&quot; he replied at once, as he ceased rubbing the
white foaming lather on his hair, and again straightened
himself up to look at her, as she spoke; his head looking as if
a three inch fall of snow had settled upon it, giving the black
dirty face and the clean eyes shining through the dust, a weird
strange appearance. &quot;What makes you ask that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I dinna ken, Rob, but jist thought you micht hae kent
something,&quot; she answered evasively.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I dinna ken onything at all aboot her, mither,&quot; he
said. &quot;If I had kent onything, dae you think I'd hae kept
quiet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I dinna mean that, Rob,&quot; she replied with relief in
her voice, &quot;but I thought that you might hae heard something.
That Leezie Johnstone was in here the day, an' you
ken hoo she talks. She was makin' oot that Mysie had gane
wrang, and had ran awa' tae hide it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leezie Johnstone had little to do sayin' onything o' the
kind,&quot; he said with some heat in his voice. &quot;There never
was a dirty coo in the byre but it liket a neighbor. I suppose
she'll be thinkin' that a' lasses were like her. These kind
of folk hae dam'd strange ideas aboot things. They get it
into their heads it is wrang to do certain things when folk
are no married, but the cloak of marriage flung aboot them
mak's the same things richt. They hinna the brains o' a sewer
rat in their noddles, the dam'd hypocrites that they are!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna swear, Rob!&quot; said Mrs. Sinclair, interrupting him.
&quot;Do you ken,&quot; she went on, her astonishment plainly evident
in her face and voice, &quot;that is the first time I ever heard you
swear in a' my life!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, mither, I am sorry; but I couldna' help it. Folk like
that get my temper up gey quick; because they get it into
their heids that marriage makes them virtuous, even though
they may be guilty o' greater excesses after than they were
before marriage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, that's true, Rob!&quot; she agreed. &quot;But it is a sad business
a' thegether. I wonder what has come owre the bit lassie.
God knows where she may be?&quot;</p>

<p>But Robert was silent, and no matter how much she tried
to get him to speak, he would not be drawn into conversation,
but answered merely in short grunts; but she could see that
he was very much disturbed at what had happened. After
a few days the sensation seemed to pass from the minds of
most of the villagers, who soon found something new to occupy
them, in connection with their own affairs.</p>

<p>About this time much interest was being manifested in mining
circles. The labor movement was beginning to shape itself
into solidarity towards political as well as industrial activity.
Robert Smillie and the late J. Keir Hardie, and many other
tireless spirits, had succeeded in molding together the newly
created labor party, infecting it with an idealism which had
hitherto not been so apparent, and this work was making a
deep impression upon the minds of the workers, especially
among the younger men.</p>

<p>The Miners' Union had been linked up into national organizations;
and a consolidating influence was at work molding
the workers generally, and the miners particularly, imbuing
them with a newer hope, a greater enthusiasm and a wider
vision.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the news of Mysie's disappearance,
Keir Hardie paid a visit to Lowwood, and a large crowd gathered
to hear him in the village hall. Smillie also was advertised
to speak, and great interest was manifested, and much criticism
passed by the miners.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't give in wi' this dam'd political business,&quot; said Tam
Donaldson, who was frankly critical. &quot;I've aye stood up for
Smillie, but I dinna' like being dragged intae this Socialist
movement. A dam'd fine nest o' robbers an' work-shy vermin.
Trade Union officials should attend tae Trade Union affairs.
That's what we pay them for. But it looks to me as if they
were a' that dam'd busy trying to get intae Parliament, thet
they hinna time to look after oor affairs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm kind o' suspeecious aboot it mysel', Tam,&quot; said Robert
quietly, as they made their way to the hall that night. &quot;I'm
no' sure jist yet as to what this Socialism is, it looks frae the
papers to be a rotten kind o' thing an' I'm no' on wi' it. But
I'll wait an' hear what Hardie an' Smillie say aboot it, afore
a' make up my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To hell wi' them an' their Socialism,&quot; said Tam with some
heat. &quot;I want a shillin' or twa on my day. It's a' yin damn
to me hoo mony wives they gie me. I canna' keep the yin I
hae. What the hell wad a workin' man dae wi' three wives?
An' they tell me they're goin' to abolish religion too. Not
that I'm a religious man mysel', but I'm damn'd if I'd let
them interfere wi' it. If I want religion I've a guid richt to
hae it; an' forby, if they abolish religion, hoo wad folk do
wi' the funerals? I can see hoo they'll do wi' marriages, for
there's to be nane. You've to get your wife changed every
two-three years, an' the weans brought up by the State as they
call it. But the puirhouse is a dam'd cauld step-mother, an'
I'd be up against that.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus discussing the subject, they reached the hall to find
it packed, everyone being keen to see and hear this man,
who was making such an uproar in the country with his
advocacy of Socialism.</p>

<p>Robert was chairman, and had labored hard to prepare a
few remarks with which to open the meeting. He wanted to
be non-committal, and his reading and self-teaching had been
of immense service to him. His mother's influence in the
molding of his character, unconsciously to himself, had made
his mind just the sort of soil for the quick rooting of the seed
to be sown that night.</p>

<p>It was certainly a great occasion. Robert thought as he
looked at this man, that he had never seen anyone who so
typefied the spirit of independence in his bearing. His figure
was straight, the eyes fearless, yet kindly and gentle; but the
proud erect head, the straight stiff back which seemed to say
&quot;I bend to no one&quot; impressed Robert more than anything else
in all his make up.</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing aggressive about him with it all;
but on the contrary, an atmosphere of kindliness exuded from
him, creating a wonderful effect upon those with whom he
came in contact. The wild stories of this turbulent agitator,
which everyone seemed to hear, and be acquainted with,
made the audience hostile to begin with. It was not a demonstrable
hostility; but one felt it was there, ready to break
out, and overwhelm this stormy petrel of the political world.</p>

<p>Yet they patiently waited for Hardie to begin, tolerating
Smillie, and even applauding his ringing denunciations of the
wrongs they suffered, but critically waiting on his attempts to
switch them on to Socialism. Then came Hardie, halting and
stammering a little as he began his address. The audience
thinking this was due to his searching for a way to delude
them, became more suspicious and critical, and ready to stop
him, if he tried any tricks upon them; but broad-minded
enough and fair enough to give him a hearing, until he trespassed
upon them too much.</p>

<p>So it was in this atmosphere that Socialism first was heard
in Lowwood; but soon the speaker became less halting as he
warmed to his subject, until not only was he fluent, but eloquent,
and powerful, winning his audience in spite of themselves.</p>

<p>They sat and listened, and were soon under his sway, watching
his every gesture and thawing under his spell, as they
watched the fine head thrown back with its inimitable poise,
the back straight and stiff, the eyes aglow with the light of
the seer, and the hands gracefully rising and falling to emphasize
some point.</p>

<p>What a change soon came over them! Gradually as the
speaker developed his subject the faces changed, and they
were soon responsive to his every demand upon them. The
clear ringing voice, insistent, strong, yet catching a cadence
of gentleness and winsomeness that moved them to approval
of everything he said.</p>

<p>There was deep humanity about him, that was strangely in
contrast with the monster he had been to their fancy before
they saw and heard him. This was not the politics of the
vulgar kind, of which the newspapers had told; on the contrary,
every man in the hall felt this was the politics to
which every reasonable man subscribed. It was the politics
of the fireside, of sweetness and light, of justice and
truth, of humanity and God.</p>

<p>In burning words he denounced the wrongs under which
the people suffered, winning them by his warm-blooded championship
of their cause, appealing to them to forsake the other
parties, form an independent party for themselves; and sketching
in glowing words the picture of the world as it might be,
if only a saner and more human view were taken by those
who ruled.</p>

<p>It made an indelible impression on Robert's mind. The
way was so simple, so clear, so sure, that if only men like
Hardie could go round every town and village in the land,
he believed that a Utopia might be brought into being in a
very few years; that even the rich people, the usurpers, would
agree that this state of affairs might be brought about, and
that they'd gladly give up all they had of power over the
lives of others, to work cooperatively for the good of all;
and already he was deciding in youth's way, he would give his
life, every moment of it, to help Hardie and Smillie, and all
those other great spirits to win the world to this state of
affairs. Body and soul he would devote to it, and so help to
make the world a brighter and happier place for all human
beings.</p>

<p>His was the temperament that having found an ideal would
storm the gates of Heaven to realize it; or wade through hell,
suffering all its penalties to gaze upon the face of that he sought.</p>

<p>So the meeting ended in great enthusiasm, and the audience
was amazed and pleased to find that this man Hardie was not
the vulgar-minded, loud-mouthed ignorant agitator of which
the press had told them; but was just one of themselves, burning
with a sense of their wrongs, with ability to express their
thoughts in their own words, and with an uncompromising
hatred of the system which bred these wrongs in their lives.</p>

<p>Tam Donaldson and Robert compared notes after the meeting
was over in the following conversation:</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think o' it, Tam?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Christ! but it was great,&quot; was the reply.</p>

<p>&quot;What aboot the three wives noo, Tam?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, for ony sake, dinna rub it in, Rob. I feel that small
that I could hide myself in the hole of my back tooth. Man,
do you ken, I jist felt as if we were a' back in the Bible
times again, wi' auld Isaiah thundering oot his charges and
tellin' the oppressors o' the people what he thought of them.
The white heid o' Hardie maun hae been gey like Isaiah's.
Or sometimes it was like John the Baptist, comin' to tell us
o' the new world that was ready to dawn for the folk! Man,
it was hellish guid, and frae this day I'm a Socialist. I've
always been fightin' the oppressors o' the workers, an' only
wish I had a tongue like Hardie, so that I could gang roon'
the hale country tellin' folk the rale God's truth aboot things.
Guid God! Rob, it was better than goin' to the kirk!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it was gran', Tam. I'm goin' to read up this Socialism;
for it seems to me to be worth it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So will I. I hae got twa or three bits o' books that I
bought, an' I'll swallow them as quick as I can. Lod! It
seems as if a new world had opened up a' thegether the night.
I'm that dam'd happy, I could rin roon' an' tell everybody
aboot it! But I suppose we maun gang awa' hame to bed;
for we'll hae to gang to oor work the morn, though it's dam'd
cauld comfort to think o' gaun oot to the pit, when we could
hae better conditions to work in if only folk had the sense
to do right.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus they parted, full of the subject which had stirred
them so much that night.</p>

<p>Robert went home, full of vision of an emancipated world,
his whole heart kindled and aglow with the desire to be a
spokesman like Hardie on behalf of the workers, and thoroughly
determined to devote the rest of his life to it.</p>

<p>&quot;There's nae word o' Mysie yet,&quot; said Nellie, when he
came in, and her words seemed to shock him with their unexpectedness.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there no'?&quot; he replied, trying hard to bring his mind
back to the realities. &quot;What kind o' word did Jenny get frae
the polis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they ken naething aboot her,&quot; said Nellie. &quot;A' that
is kenned is jist what we heard already. The polis hae
been searchin' noo for a fortnight an' nae trace o' her can be
got. Mr. Rundell has pit it in the papers; but I hae my
doots aboot ever seeing her again. Mysie wasna' the lassie
that wad keep her folk in suspense. She wad ken fine that
they'd be anxious. Matthew an' Jenny are in an awfu' way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay. I believe they will,&quot; he replied, and a deep silence
followed.</p>

<p>After a time, as the silence seemed to become oppressive,
and for the sake of saying something, Mrs. Sinclair said:
&quot;What kin o' a meetin' had you the night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My! we had an awfu' meeting, mither,&quot; he said in reply,
his eyes kindling with enthusiasm at the memory of it. &quot;Smillie
was askin' for you, an' he's comin' owre to see you the morn
afore he goes awa'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he had mind o' me then,&quot; she said, pleased at this
information.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, an' he talked rale kindly aboot my faither to Hardie,
mither. Smillie's a fine man, an' I like him,&quot; he said with
simple enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&quot;He is that, Rob. I've aye liked Bob for the way he has
had to fecht. Lod, I dinna ken hoo he has managed to come
through it a'. He's been a gran' frien' to the miners. What
kin' o' a man is Hardie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's yin o' the finest men I ever met,&quot; he answered in
quick enthusiasm. &quot;You would hae enjoyed hearin' him,
mither. It's an awfu' peety that the weemin dinna gang to
the meetin's. I'm shair there's no' a woman in the place but
wad hae liket him. My! if you had jist heard him, strong,
sturdy, and independent. Efter hearin' him, it fair knocked
the stories on the heid aboot him bein' oot to smash the
hame, an' religion an' sic like. He's clean and staunch, an'
a rale man. Nae sham aboot him, but a rale human bein',
an' after listenin' to him tellin' what Socialism is, it mak's
you feel ashamed that you ever believed things that you did
believe aboot it. It's that simple an' Tam Donaldson is fair
carried awa' wi' it the night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad you had a guid meetin',&quot; she said, her interest
kindled too. &quot;Tell me a' aboot it,&quot; and Robert told her,
sketching the fine picture which Hardie had given to his memory
to carry, as long as life lasted for him.</p>

<p>&quot;I've been appointed delegate to the Miners' Council,&quot; he
said after a while. &quot;I'll hae to gang to Hamilton once a month
to attend the conferences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she said in surprise, and with pride in her voice.
&quot;What way hae they sent you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't ken,&quot; he answered, &quot;but I was a wee bit feart to
take it. It's only the very best men that should be sent
there to represent the branches, an' I thought they might hae
sent an older man, wi' mair kind o' thought about him, an'
mair experience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, weel, Rob,&quot; she said with pride, &quot;ye are maybe as
guid as ony o' them, and a hantle better than some o' them.
I hope you'll dae well and aye act fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll dae my best,&quot; he said simply. &quot;Mony a time we hae
been selt wi' place-seekers, an' maybe there are some still at
it,&quot; he went on, &quot;but I can say this, mither, if ever I get an
inklin' o' it, I'll expose them to every honest man. We want
men who can look at things withoot seem' themsel's as the
center o' a' things. My, if you had only seen Hardie,&quot; he
broke off. &quot;He was grand.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus they talked for an hour before retiring, but all the
time Robert's mind occasionally kept wondering about Mysie,
and he went to bed, his heart troubled and aching to know
the fate that had overtaken the girl he had loved and lost.</p>

<p>All night long he tossed unable to sleep, as he tried to think
what had happened to her, his mind and heart pained at the
thought of something that boded no good to her.</p>

<p>He again lived over in his mind all that had happened that
night upon the moor, when he saw the man going to meet
her after his own meeting with Mysie.</p>

<p>He was pained and puzzled what to do. Had the stranger
any connection with her disappearance, he asked himself?
Should he tell of that? And yet she had been to her father's
house since then, so that it would be of little value to mention
it, he thought.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had run away with the man. That was quite
a likely thing to happen, and if Mysie wanted him no one else
had anything to do with it. Still, she might have told her
people, he thought. But perhaps she might do that later on.</p>

<p>But Mysie and her fate would not be banished from his
mind, and he lay and tumbled and tossed, a terrible anxiety
within him, for youth is apt to pity its own sufferings, and
give them a heroic touch under the spell of unrequited love.</p>

<p>Thus the night passed and morning came, and he had not
slept, and he went to his work debating as to whether he should
inform the police or not about the man he had seen in the
company of Mysie. But no decision was ever come to.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h2>MYSIE RUNS AWAY</h2>


<p>It was a gray, sultry summer night, with one small patch
of red near the western horizon when Mysie, making the
excuse of going to the village to visit her parents, had stolen
over the moorland path on her way to join the evening train
for Edinburgh at a neighboring village station.</p>

<p>She had left early, so as to have plenty of time on the way,
and also because she was really ill, and could not hurry.</p>

<p>She had forced herself to work, so as not to attract attention
to her weak state during the past few weeks. Peter, who had
already gone some days before, had now everything ready for
her, and this was her final break with the old life.</p>

<p>She knew she was ill, but thought that when she got to
Edinburgh, with good medical attention and treatment, she
would soon be all right again. Perhaps a rest and the change
would help her as much as anything; and she'd soon get well
and strong, and she would work hard to fit herself for the
position she was to occupy as Peter's wife.</p>

<p>But her legs did feel tired, as she trudged over the moor,
and her steps dragged heavily. She sank down for a few
moments upon a thyme-strewn bank to rest; the scent of the
wild moorland bloom brought back the memory of that evening
in the copse. She shut her eyes for a moment, and heard
again the alarmed protest of the whaup, and the grumble of
the burn; saw again the moonlight patterns upon the ground,
as it flittered through the trees, like streams of fairy radiance
cast from the magic wand of night and, above all, heard Peter's
voice, praising her eyes, her hair, her figure.</p>

<p>Her cheeks burned again, and her heart throbbed anew&mdash;she
heard his tones, hoarse, vibrant and warm, as his breath
scorched her cheek. She felt his arms about her, the contact
of his burning lips upon her own.</p>

<p>Then the calm which follows the wake of the storm, the
consciously averted eyes, and the very conscious breathing,
which had in it something of shame; the almost aversion to
speak or touch again, and over all, the deep silence of the
moor, broken only by the burn and the whaup, and the thick
cloud, kindly dark, that came over the moon.</p>

<p>But, behind it all, the remorse and the agony that would
never die; the anxiety and uncertainty, and the secret knowledge
for which each had paid so high a price.</p>

<p>She rose from the bank and went slowly along the lovely
moorland path. Her breath was labored and the cough
troubled her. She was hot, and besides the tired sensation in
her limbs, there was a griping feeling about her chest that
made breathing difficult.</p>

<p>She reached the station just a minute before the train was
due, and entered an almost empty compartment, glad to be
seated and at rest.</p>

<p>The train soon moved out of the station, and an intense
desire took hold of her to go back. The full consciousness
of her action only seemed to strike her now that she had cut
the last tie that bound her to the old life, and involuntarily
she rose to her feet, as if to get out. A man sitting in the
opposite corner, thinking she was going to close the carriage
window, laid a restraining hand upon her.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't close it,&quot; he said, &quot;fresh air is what we all need,
though we may not in our ignorance think so. But you take
it from me, miss, that you can't get too much fresh air. Let
it play about you, and keep it always passing through your
room, or the railway carriage when traveling, and you'll never
be ill. Look at me,&quot; he continued aggressively, almost fiercely,
and very pompously, &quot;the very picture of health&mdash;never had a
day's illness in my life. And what is the reason? Why, fresh
air. It is the grand life-giver. No, miss, leave the window
open. You can't get too much of it. Let it play about you,
draw it deeply into your lungs like this,&quot; and he took a great
deep draught, until Mysie thought he was going to expand
so much that he might fall out of the carriage window, or
burst open its sides. Then, he let it out in a long, loud blast,
like a miniature cyclone, making a noise like escaping steam;
while his eyes seemed as if they had made up their minds
to jump out, had the blast and the pressure not eased them at
the last critical moment.</p>

<p>Then he stood panting, his shoulders going up and down,
and his chest going out and in, like a pair of bellows in a
country blacksmith's shop.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing like fresh air, miss,&quot; he panted. &quot;You take my
tip on that. I've proved it. Just look at me. I'm health itself,
and might make a fortune by sitting as an advertisement
for somebody's patent pills, only I feel too honorable for that;
for it is fresh air that has done it. Fresh air, and plenty of
it!&quot; and he turned his nose again in the direction of the window,
as if he would gulp the air down in gallons&mdash;a veritable
glutton of Boreas.</p>

<p>Mysie could not speak. She was overwhelmed by the blast
of oratory upon air, and a woman who sat on the far side
of a closed window, with tight-drawn lips and smoldering
eyes, looked challengingly at this fresh air fanatic, observing
with quiet sarcasm: &quot;A complexion like that might make a
fortune, if done with colors to the life, in advertising some
one's 'Old Highland'!&quot;</p>

<p>The fresh air apostle gasped a little, looking across at the
grim set mouth and the quiet, steady eyes, as if he would like
to retort; but, finding no ready words, he merely wiped his
forehead, and then subsided helplessly in his corner seat, as
the lady rose, and, going over to the window, said to Mysie,
as she closed it: &quot;It is a little cold to-night, after the scorching
heat of the daytime, and one is apt to catch cold very
readily in a draught at an open carriage window. There,
we'll all feel more comfortable now, I fancy. It is a little
chilly.&quot; The poor worm who had always lived and thrived
upon fresh air felt himself shriveling up in the corner, and
growing so small that he might easily slip through the seam
at the hinges of the carriage door.</p>

<p>Mysie merely lay back in her corner without speaking. She
had never traveled much in the train; and this journey,
apart from its eventfulness, was sufficient in itself to stupefy
her with its newness and immensity. She had never before
had a longer journey than to the county town, which cost sixpence;
and here she was going to Edinburgh! a great city,
of which she had all the dread of the inexperienced, unsophisticated
country girl. A slight shiver soon began to creep down
her back, and gradually she became cold; but she sat never
speaking, and the other two occupants were so engrossed
in thinking out maledictions against each other, that they had
no thoughts to bestow upon her.</p>

<p>The wild, bleak moors rolled past, as the train rushed onward,
and the telegraph poles seemed to scamper along, as if
frightened by the noise of the train. She gazed away to the
far horizon, where the sun had left a faint glow upon the
western clouds, and she tried to think of something that
would not betray her nervousness, but her mind was all chaos
and excitement, and strange expectation.</p>

<p>What would be waiting for her at the end of the journey?
Suppose Peter failed to be at the station, what would she
do in a strange city? What if he were ill, and would not
come? Or if he was doing this deliberately, and did not mean
to meet her? Thus, torn by anxiety, and worried almost to
death by nameless other fears, she spent the hour-long journey
which seemed like a day, making herself ill, so that she
could scarcely leave the carriage when the train steamed into
Princes Street Station.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any luggage that I can assist you with?&quot; asked
the fresh air man, as Mysie seemed reluctant to get out, now
that she had arrived at her destination.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied simply, forgetting to thank him for his
kind consideration, and rising slowly to her feet, she followed
the stream of passengers down the platform, keeping a keen
look-out for Peter.</p>

<p>&quot;Here we are, Mysie,&quot; he said cheerily, striding towards
her, with real welcome in his voice, and she clung to him like
a child, so glad that he had been true to his word. &quot;I have a
cab waiting,&quot; he rattled on brightly. &quot;Just come along, and
we'll soon be at your digs, and we'll talk as we drive along,&quot;
and he piloted her to a waiting cab; and getting in beside
her, it moved off, as she heard him say &quot;Grassmarket&quot; to
the driver.</p>

<p>But she had little interest in anything, now that Peter was
here. She felt a sense of security in his company that she
had never felt before. She trusted him, now that all her
bearings were lost. The fear of the city, and the strangeness
of her experiences, made her turn to him as her only prop
upon which she could lean; and she clung to his arm as they
drove along, the cab rattling over the stones and through
what seemed to Mysie interminable streets of houses.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you manage to get away all right, without anyone
knowing?&quot; he asked, as he felt her trembling hands upon his
arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I think sae,&quot; she replied. &quot;I never saw onybody.
I jist let on that I was gaun hame, an' gaed owre the muir,
an' got the train. I didna see onybody that I kent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was right, Mysie,&quot; he said. &quot;I was afraid you might
decide at the last moment not to come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did feel awfu' frightened,&quot; she confessed, &quot;an' I could
fain hae bidden at hame; but I can never gang hame noo,&quot;
she added with a slight tremor in her voice, at the realization
of all it meant. &quot;I can never gang hame noo!&quot; and the tears
gathered in her eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p>What a noise, and what a multitude of houses, she thought.
She would never be able to go out and find her way back. She
would get lost in all this noise and hurry and confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;I have taken a little house for you, Mysie,&quot; said Peter, in
explanation of his plans. &quot;I have also a woman engaged to
help you for a time, to look after you till you get acquainted
with the place; and I'll come home to you every evening,
and spend as much of my time with you as I can, superintending
your lessons. I am going to teach you myself for a while,
and we'll live together and be as happy as we can. But first
of all, you must get better,&quot; he said, as a fit of coughing
seized her. &quot;You've got a bad cold. Luckily, the old man
allows me plenty of money, so that we need not worry.&quot;</p>

<p>Mysie sat lost in wonder at it all, and presently the cab
stopped, and Peter helped her out, paid the fare and, taking
her arm, led her up a long flight of stairs&mdash;stairs that seemed
to wind up and up till she felt dizzy, before he came to a
halt at one of the many doors opening on the landing, entering
which she found herself in a neat little room and kitchen,
simply furnished, but clean and tidy.</p>

<p>&quot;This is Mrs. Ramsay, my landlady,&quot; he said as they
entered, leading Mysie forward to where a middle-aged woman
of kindly demeanor stood with a smile of welcome for them.
Mrs. Ramsay stepped forward and began to help Mysie to
take off her hat. With a few words she soon made the girl
feel more at ease, and then left them to get tea ready.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that the woman you stay wi'?&quot; asked Mysie, as Mrs.
Ramsay went to the other room.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she's my landlady,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>&quot;An' does she bide here too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she'll stay just as long as you think necessary.
Whenever you think you can get on without her, let me know.
Her daughter is looking after her own house till she returns.
She's a good, kindly soul, and will do anything to help you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you gaun to stay here now, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that is for you to say, Mysie,&quot; he said seriously.
&quot;Certainly I should like to stay with my wife, for we'll be
married to-morrow. But if you would rather stay alone, I
can easily remain in my digs, and just attend to your lessons
In the evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you stay here, will she need to stay too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course that will all lie with you, Mysie,&quot; he replied.
&quot;Perhaps it might be better for her to stay and help you for
a few weeks, and by that time your cold may be better. But
you can think it over to-night and tell me your decision in
the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ramsay's return cut short any further conversation,
and they all sat down to tea, a strange little party. Mysie
did not eat much. She was too tired, and felt that she would
rather go to bed. She looked ill and very wretched, and at
last Peter went out, leaving the women together.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be round for you by half-past ten in the morning,
Mysie,&quot; he said, as he was going. &quot;So you must be up, and
be as bright as you can. So take a good long sleep, and you'll
feel ever so much better in the morning. Mrs. Ramsay will
see you all right,&quot; and he was off before Mysie realized he
was going.</p>

<p>It was all so strange for Mysie. She was lost in wonder at
it all, as she sat quietly pondering the matter while Mrs.
Ramsay washed the dishes and cleared the table. The noises
outside; the glare of the street, lamps, the tier upon tier of
houses, piled on top of each other, as she looked from the
window at the tall buildings, and the Castle Rock, grim and
gray, looking down in silence upon the whole city, but added
to Mysie's confusion of mind.</p>

<p>Shouts from a drunken brawl ascended from the street; the
curses of the men, and the screams of women, were plainly
audible; while over all a woman's voice, further down the
street, broke into a bonnie old Scots air which Mysie knew,
and she could not help feeling that this was the most beautiful
thing she had heard so far.</p>

<p>The voice was clear, and to Mysie very sweet, but it was
the words that set her heart awandering among her own moors
and heather hills.</p>

<p>
Ca' the yowes tae the knowes,<br />
Ca' them where the heather grows,<br />
Ca' them where the burnie rows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">My kind dearie, O!</span><br />
</p>

<p>This was always the song her father sang, if on a Saturday
night he had been taking a glass. It was not that he was
given to drinking; but sometimes, on the pay night, he would
indulge in a glass with Andrew Marshall or Peter Pegg&mdash;just
a round each; sufficient to make them happy and forgetful of
their hard lot for a time. She had seen her father drunk on
very few occasions, as he was a very careful man; but sometimes,
maybe at New Year's time, if things were going more
than usually well, he might, in company with his two cronies,
indulge in an extra glass, and then he was seen at his best.</p>

<p>On such occasions Mysie's mother would remonstrate with
him, reminding him with wifely wisdom of his family responsibilities;
but under all her admonishings Matthew's only
reply was:</p>

<p>
As I gaed doon the water side,<br />
There I met my bonnie lad,<br />
An' he rowed me sweetly in his plaid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">An' ca'd me his dearie, O!</span><br />
</p>

<p>and as he sang, he would fling his arms around Mysie's mother
and turn her round upon the floor, in an awkward dance, to
the tune of the song, and finally stopping her flow of words
with a hug and a kiss, as he repeated the chorus:</p>

<p>
Ca' the yowes tae the knowes,<br />
Ca' them where the heather grows,<br />
Ca' them where the burnie rows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">My kind dearie, O!</span><br />
</p>

<p>So that, when the words of the old song floated up through
the noise of the street, Mysie's heart filled, and her eyes
brimmed with tears; for she saw again the old home, and all
it meant to her.</p>

<p>&quot;There now,&quot; said Mrs. Ramsay, noticing her tears, and
stroking her hair with a kindly hand. &quot;Mr. Rundell has told
me all about it, and I am your friend and his. I deeply sympathize
with you, my dear, for I know how much you must
feel your position; but Mr. Rundell is a good-hearted young
man, and he'll be good to you, I know that. Don't cry, dearie.
It is all right.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus the words of an old song, sung by a drunken street
singer, brought a stronger and deeper stab to the heart of this
lonely girl, than to the exile in the back-blocks of Maori-land,
or on the edge of the golden West, eating his heart out over a
period of years for a glint of the heather hills of home, or the
sound of the little brook that had been his lullaby in young
days, when all the world was full of dreams and fair romance.</p>

<p>In a sudden burst of impulsiveness, Mysie flung her arms
round the neck of the older woman, pouring out her young
heart and all its troubles in an incoherent flood of sorrow and
vexation.</p>

<p>&quot;There now, dearie,&quot; said Mrs. Ramsay, again stroking
Mysie's hair and her soft burning cheek. &quot;Don't be frightened.
You must go to your bed, for you are tired and upset, and
will make yourself ill. Come now, like a good lass, and go
to your bed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear, I wonner what my mither will say aboot it,&quot;
wailed the girl, sobbing. &quot;She'll hae a sair, sair heart the
nicht, an' my faither'll break his heart. Oh, if only something
could tell them I am a' richt, an' safe, it would mak'
things easier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There now. Don't worry about that any more, dearie.
You'll only make yourself ill. Try and keep your mind off
it, and go away to bed and rest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it'll kill my mither!&quot; cried Mysie wildly. &quot;Her no'
kennin' where I am! If she could only ken that I am a'
richt! She'll be worryin', an' she'll be lyin' waken at nicht
wonderin' aboot me, an' thinkin' o' every wild thing that has
happened to me. Oh, dear, but it'll break her heart and
kill my faither.&quot;</p>

<p>It needed all Mrs. Ramsay's tact and patience to quieten
and allay her fears; but gradually the girl was prevailed upon
to go to bed, and Mrs. Ramsay retired to the next room. But
all night she heard Mysie tossing and turning, and quietly
weeping, and she knew that despair was torturing and tearing
her frightened little heart, and trying her beyond endurance.</p>

<p>Mysie lay wondering how the village gossips at home would
discuss her disappearance. She knew how Mag Robertson, and
Jean Fleming, and Leezie Johnstone and all the other &quot;clash-bags,&quot;
as they were locally called, would talk, and what stories
they would tell.</p>

<p>But her mother would be different&mdash;her mother who had
always loved her&mdash;crude, primitive love it was, but mother
love just the same, and she felt that she would never be able
again to go back and take up her old life&mdash;the old life which
seemed so alluring, now that it was left forever behind.</p>

<p>Thus she tossed and worried, and finally in the gray hours
of the morning her thoughts turned to Robert, who had loved
her so well, and had always been her champion. She saw
him looking at her with sad eyes, eyes which held something
of accusation in them and were heavy with pain&mdash;eyes that
told he had trusted her, had loved her, and that he had always
hoped she would be his&mdash;eyes that told of all they had been
to each other from the earliest remembered days, and which
plainly said, as they looked at her from the foot of her bed:
&quot;Mysie! Oh, Mysie! What way did you do this!&quot;</p>

<p>Unable to bear it any longer, she screamed out in anguish,
a scream which brought good Mrs. Ramsay running to her
bedside, to find Mysie raving in a high fever, her eyes wildly
glowing, and her skin all afire. The good lady sat with her
and tried to soothe her, but Mysie kept calling on Robert and
her mother, and raving about matters of which Mrs. Ramsay
knew nothing; and in the morning, when Peter arrived expecting
to find his bride ready, he found her very ill, and his
good landlady very much frightened about the whole matter.</p>

<h2>MAG ROBERTSON'S FRENZY</h2>


<p>&quot;I want to ken what has gone wrong with you?&quot; said Mag
Robertson, speaking to Black Jock, whom she had called
into her house one morning as he returned from the pit
for his breakfast.</p>

<p>&quot;There's naething wrang wi' me,&quot; he said with cool reserve.
&quot;What dae you think is wrang?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's a' right, Jock,&quot; she said, speaking as one who
knew he understood her question better than he pretended.
&quot;I can see as far through a brick wall as you can see through
a whinstone dyke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe a bit farther, Mag,&quot; he said with a forced laugh,
eyeing her coolly. &quot;But what are you driving at?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll no' ken, I suppose?&quot; she retorted. &quot;Sanny has told
me a' aboot it this morning afore he gaed to his work. My!
I'd hardly hae looked for this frae you,&quot; she went on, her
voice suddenly becoming softer and more soothing as if she
meant to appeal to his sense of gratitude if any remained
within him. &quot;Efter what we've been to yin anither, I never
expected you'd dae this. I aye thocht that you'd be loyal
as we hae been tae you. We hae made oursel's the outcasts
o' the district for you, an' noo you wad turn on us like this.
No, I never thocht it o' you at a'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you ravin' at this morning?&quot; he asked, in a
quiet voice, as if he meant to force her into being more definite.
&quot;I don't ken I'm sure what you are drivin' at.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dae you no?&quot; she broke in quickly, loosing hold of herself
as she saw that her method of attack was not going to
succeed. &quot;I hae been suspectin' something for a while. You
hinna been in owre my door for three weeks an' that's no
your ordinar. But I have seen you gaun in tae Tam Granger's
nearly every nicht in that time. An' I can put twa
an' twa together. Dae you think we dinna ken the reason
that Sanny has lost his contracts an' the reason why Tam
Granger has stepped into them? Oh, ay,&quot; she cried, her voice
rising as she continued. &quot;I can see hoo things are workin'!
I ken a' aboot it. Wee Leebie, I suppose, will be afore some
o' us noo. The stuck-up limmer that she is. She gangs by
folk as brazened as you like, wi' her head in the air, as if
she was somebody. You wad think she never had heard o'
Willie Broonclod, the packman, that she sloped when she left
doon the country. Nae wonder she has braw claes to glaik
aboot in; for they were gey easy paid. The dirty glaiket
limmer that she is. I wonder she disna think shame o' hersel'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell's a' this to me?&quot; asked Walker abruptly
breaking in upon her tirade.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it'll no' mean onything to you,&quot; she returned.
&quot;But I just wanted to tell you, that you're no her first, for
Willie Broonclod gaed to her lang afore she cam' here, an'
she's left him wi' a guid penny that he'll never get. But her
man's a contractor noo, makin' big money, an' Jock Walker
ca's in to see her whenever he's needfu' an' there's naething
sae low as a packman noo for her. The brazen-faced stuck-up
baggage that she is. Does she think I dinna ken her? Her,
with her hair stuck up in a 'bun' an' her fancy blouses an'
buckled shoon, an' a'!&quot; Mag was now very much enraged
and she shouted and swore in her anger.</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, gang to hell,&quot; he said with brutal callousness. &quot;You're
no' hauf a woman like Leebie. She's a tippy wee lass, an' has
a way wi' her. She has some spirit, an' is aye snod and nate,&quot;
and there was a tantalizing smile about his lips that was
plainly meant to irritate Mag.</p>

<p>&quot;I was guid enough a gey lang while, an'&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but you've haen a damn'd guid innins,&quot; he interrupted.
&quot;A dam'd guid innins, an' I canna see what the hell
you hae to yowl at.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A guid innins, you muckle black-hearted brute!&quot; she cried.
&quot;By heavens, an' I'll see that you get yours afore I hae done
wi' you. Dinna think though I hae been saft wi' you a'
along, that I'll ay be like that. Oh, no, I can stand a lot; but
you'll find oot that Mag Robertson hasna selt her a' tae you,
without driving a hard bargain afore she lets you alone. You
can gang back to your tippy wee baggage! Gang to hell, baith
you an' her, an' joy be wi' you baith! But I'll put a sprag
in your wheel afore you gang far. Mind that! By &mdash;&mdash; I
will! She'll nae toss her heid as she gangs past me as if
I was dirt. Her, an' her fine dresses that she never payed
for wi' money an' her fal-lals. By heaven! But you hae
a fine taste!&quot; She finished up exasperated beyond all control
by his coolness.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it wad seem so,&quot; he laughed brutally. &quot;When I look
at you, I begin to wonder what the hell I was lookin' at.
You're like a damnationed big lump o' creesh,&quot; and he laughed
in her face, knowing this would rouse her more than ever.
Then as she choked and spluttered in her anger he said: &quot;But
what the hell odds is't to you, you baggage?&quot; and his eyes
and voice were cold and brutal beyond expression. &quot;Leebie
Granger is young,&quot; he went on insultingly, in a collected even
voice which he strove to make jaunty in tone. &quot;She's as fresh
an' young. An' you're auld, an' fat an' as ugly as hell, an'
if I dae gang to Leebie you hae damn all to dae wi' it. As
I said, you've had your innin's, an' been gey well paid for it,
an' I dinna gie a damn for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dae you no'?&quot; she cried now livid with anger and losing
all control over her words and actions, her eyes flashing with
maddened rage and the froth working from her lips. &quot;I'll let
you ken or no'. I'll tear the pented face off your new doll;
and I'll sort you too, you dirty black brute that you are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gang to hell!&quot; he shouted, starting out of the door so
suddenly that he almost ran into the next door neighbor who
hearing the noise had crept noiselessly on tiptoe to the door
the better to hear all that was going on.</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell's wrang wi' you?&quot; he demanded turning in
rage upon the eavesdropper. &quot;Have you naething else to dae
than that? Gang in an' get your dirty midden o' a hoose
cleaned an' I'll see that you don't stay lang in Lowwood to
spy on ony mair folk!&quot; and cowering in shame the poor
woman backed into the door and shut it, making up her mind
that her man would be sacked that day, and wondering where
they would flit to, so as to find work and a house.</p>

<p>Walker strode up the row with Mag Robertson shouting behind
him and the neighbors all coming to the doors as they
passed, and craning their necks, while keeping their bodies
safe hidden within the doorways of their homes.</p>

<p>&quot;We're surely gettin' an entertainment the day,&quot; observed
one fat old woman to another woman two doors away, as they
both looked after Mag as she followed Walker up the row,
shouting her worst names at him, and vowing what she'd do
with Leebie Granger, when she got hands on her.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; replied the other woman stealing along the wall to
the doorway of the older woman, and slipping inside as if she
were afraid of being detected. &quot;It's a hell o' a business when
blackguards cast oot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wheest, Annie, dinna swear,&quot; remonstrated the old woman.
&quot;I dinna like to hear folk swearin' at a'. I wonner the Lord
disna open the grun' to swallow the half o' the folk noo-a-days;
for I never heard sic swearin' a' my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Och, there's nae harm meant,&quot; returned Annie, taken aback
by the old woman's admonition. &quot;It's jist a habit that folk
get into an' they canna help it. But listen to her,&quot; she broke
off, alluding to Mag Robertson again. &quot;She micht think shame
o' hersel', the shameless lump that she is. She'd hae been faur
better to hae keepit her mouth shut, Phemie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true, Annie,&quot; replied Phemie. &quot;Listen to her. My,
she's no' canny an' she's fairly givin' him a bellyfu'. But
they're a' yae swine's pick an' no' yin o' them decent. I
wadna be in her shoon for a' the money that ever was made in
Lowwood. She micht hae kent hoo it wad end. Hark at
her. My, but it's awfu'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keep in, Annie,&quot; Phemie admonished as they both craned
their necks to look up the row as she saw Walker turning to
face Mag. &quot;Dinna let him see you or your man will get the
sack. My! but she's layin' it in tae' him. What a tongue.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lord bless us! He's strucken her, Phemie,&quot; said Annie,
clutching her neighbor's shoulder as she spoke. &quot;My, he's
gaen her an awfu' blow on the mouth an' knocket her doon.
Come inside for as sure as daith it'll end in a coort case, an'
I'm no wanting to be mixed up in it,&quot; and they went inside
and shut the door, looking at each other with frightened eyes.
Then Annie, stealing to the window and lifting the curtain a
little at the side, gazed sideways up the row, reporting to
Phemie everything that happened.</p>

<p>&quot;He's kicking her, Phemie. Eh, the muckle beast that he
is. My God, he'll kill her afore he's finished wi' her. He's
hitting her on the face every time she tries to rise an' gaein'
her anither kick aye when she fa's doon again. Oh! my God,
will naebody interfere. He'll kill her as sure as death,&quot; and
she stepped back with blanched face sickened at the spectacle
she had described.</p>

<p>&quot;Here she comes, Annie,&quot; said her neighbor after a few
moments. &quot;My! what a face. Dinna look you at her,&quot; cried
Phemie in alarm pushing back Annie who had moved near to
the window to get a better view. &quot;In God's name, woman,
dinna you look at her. You shouldna ha' looked at onything
that has taken place. If onything is wrang wi' your bairn
when it is born I'll never forgi'e' mysel' for lettin' you look
at this business at a'. Gang awa' back an' sit down an' try
an' forget a' aboot what you hae seen. Dinna look up till
she gangs back intae the hoose,&quot; and the old woman kept
Annie sitting back at the bedside in the corner farthest from
the window until Mag staggered to her home, her face streaming
with blood.</p>

<p>Not a soul was in sight as Mag returned; but many a pair
of eyes watched her from behind curtained windows, and expressions
of sympathy were common even though her relations
with Walker were common knowledge in the village, and
had been censured by everyone in consequence for her misdeeds.
They all knew why Mag had &quot;opened out&quot; on Walker
that morning and the reason she had been set aside for another
who pleased his fancy.</p>

<p>Tam Granger and his wife had recently come into the district
from a neighboring village, where Leebie's name had
been coupled with a local draper's or packman's in some
scandal. Black Jock had soon got into contact with them and
finding them willing tools he had deserted Sanny and Mag
Robertson. All the contracts were taken from Sanny and given
to Tam, and it was this that had made Mag watch for Walker
coming in for his breakfast, determined to have it out with
him, with the result which is chronicled above.</p>

<p>The encounter between Mag and Black Jock was the talk
of the village. Mag was mad with rage, and having washed
her bruised face, she ramped out and in all day, washing the
floor, clattering among dishes and scouring pots and pans.
She was working off her anger and swearing and threatening,
until most of the other women in the row grew afraid, and
kept as much as possible within doors the rest of the day.</p>

<p>When the men returned from work the whole episode had
to be gone through and described to them by their wives.</p>

<p>When Sanny Robertson came home that afternoon, he found
Mag with swollen lips and half closed eyes and a face bruised
all over. He did not have to wait long for explanations. She
railed and swore and raged until one wondered from where
she got all the energy, and all the strength. It was amazing
why she did not collapse altogether.</p>

<p>Sanny sat quietly listening without comment, then washed
himself and sat smoking by the fire for a time. He was a quiet
go-as-you-please man, not given much to talking. But finally
he could stand it no longer, and he took hold of his wife by the
shoulder, saying.</p>

<p>&quot;Noo, jist you listen, an' for God's sake shut your mooth.
It'll no dae a bit o' guid ravin' like that. We are in a bigger
hole noo than ever we hae been in a' oor lives, an' mind that.
I've made up my mind what I am gaun tae dae. Sae listen.
I'm gaun straucht awa' ower to Rundell's the morn, at the
time when Mr. Rundell gangs hame frae the office for his
breakfast, an' I'll tell him everything aboot the contracts.
Then I'm gaun awa' doon the country tae look for work, an'
I'll flit oot o' here an' tae hell wi't. Noo shut up an' gae me
peace and quateness for an hoor, so that I can think oot things.
You get awa' tae bed. Maybe by richt I should gang doon
tae Black Jock an' stap a knife in him&mdash;if for nae ither thing
than the way he has treated you the day, I should dae that.
But I'm no gaun to dae it the noo. I'm no' blaming you for
what has happened; for I'm mair to blame than you are.
But I'll be even wi' that black beast, an' put an end to his
rotten career, someway or another. Sae aff you gang to your
bed, an' gie me a quate hoor tae mysel',&quot; and there was such
a quiet authoritative ring in his voice that Mag dared not
disobey it, and she went quietly off to bed while he sat by
the fireside smoking and thinking, and feeling that his home
that night must surely be the most unhappy place on God's
earth.</p>

<p>About midnight he knocked the ashes from his pipe, and
placing it on the mantelpiece, went to bed and soon fell
asleep, but Mag, an insane decision taking shape in her brain,
lay and brooded and tossed till well on in the morning, when
she rose, kindled the fire, &quot;redd up&quot; the house, prepared the
breakfast and awoke her husband to partake of the meal she
had prepared.</p>

<p>Never a word was spoken between them, and at last Sanny,
after washing and dressing, walked out without a word, but
fully determined in his heart to get equal with Walker before
the day was over.</p>

<p>He went straight to Rundell House, and ringing the bell
asked to see the mine owner.</p>

<p>He was shown into a room and Mr. Rundell came to him
almost before he had been comfortably seated.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Sanny,&quot; he began genially. &quot;What brings you here
this morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A business that I'd rather no' been comin' on,&quot; replied
Sanny uneasily shifting on his chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, nothing serious, I hope, is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's serious enough,&quot; returned Sanny. &quot;Mair serious
than you think, Mr. Rundell; an' I dinna ken what you'll think
o' me after I hae telt you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well, in that case,&quot; said the mine owner, becoming
serious, and speaking with slow deliberation. &quot;Just let me
hear what it is all about, and we'll see how matters stand
after you have told me,&quot; and he sat down in a chair opposite
Robertson as he spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;I hae lost my contracts, sir,&quot; began Sanny, not knowing
how else to open up the subject. &quot;But I'm gaun to tell you
the hale story just in my ain way, so I want you to sit quate
and no' interrupt me; for I hinna jist the knack of puttin'
things maybe as they should be put. But I'll tell you the
hale story an' then leave you to do as you like, an' think what
you like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, Sanny. Just go on. I did not know you had
lost them. But just let me hear about the trouble in your
own way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For gey near twenty year,&quot; began Sanny, &quot;I've had maist
feck o' the contracts in your pits back and forrit&mdash;me an'
Tam Fleming. Walker an' us were aye gey thick, an' though
it maybe was putten doon to you that oor offer to work ony
special job was the cheapest, I may tell you that I never put
in an offer in my life for yin o' them. Walker an'&mdash;an'&quot;
here Sanny stammered a little, &quot;Walker an' oor Mag were gey
thick, an' I'm ashamed o' this part o' the story; for I should
hae been man enough to protect her frae him. But the money
was the thing that did it, Mr. Rundell, an' I'm no' gaun to
mak' excuses noo aboot it. But every bargain I had, I had
to share the pay, efter the men was payed, penny aboot, wi'
Walker. That was ay the bargain. He gaed us the job at
his ain feegure, an' we shared the profits wi' him.</p>

<p>&quot;Noo, jist keep yoursel' cool a bit,&quot; he said, holding up his
hand as Rundell made to speak. &quot;We did gey well,&quot; he resumed
in his even monotone, like a man who was repeating
something he had learned by heart. &quot;But gey soon I found
that I was expected to spend a good share o' my pay in
drink, while Walker took a', an' never spent a penny. So
it was, that for a' the money we made we've been gey little
the better o't, an' very much the worse o' it. Without exception
we shared penny aboot with Walker on every bargain we
got, an' I ken he has a guid bank balance, while I hae nane.</p>

<p>&quot;Noo, this is a rotten story frae end to end o't,&quot; he went
on after a short pause to wipe his face with a handkerchief.
&quot;I allowed him to ruin my wife's character. I kent it was
gaun on a' the time; but like mony mair I hae kent, a manager's
favor was mair to me than the honor o' a wife. I let
him tak' a share o' the money I made, an' spent my ain to
keep him up on drink. But noo it's ended a'. A wheen o'
weeks syne, a man ca'd Tam Granger came to the place and
his wife being young an' fresh, an' guid-looking, besides being
free, Walker's fancy was ta'en wi' her. So you ken what it
means, when a gaffer carries on like that, an' the man is saft
enough as weel as the woman being willin'. Tam got my
contracts this week, an' I have to gang back into a common
place and howk coals.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, the wife couldna' stand being slighted like thet,
an' Granger's wife had been tantalizin' her too, you ken hoo
women rave when they are slighted. So she opened oot on
Walker yesterday mornin' an' followed him up the row, the
hale place being turned oot to hear her exposure o' him. She
fair gaed mad wi' anger I think, an' lost a' control o' hersel'
an' she followed him shouting so that a' the neighbors could
hear her tauntin' an' jibin' at him, till he could staun it nae
langer, an' he turned an' struck her, knockin' her doon on
the green, an' then kickin' her, till she's a' bruised ower the
body. She has an' awfu' lookin' face too, an' she came in
bleeding like a sheep.</p>

<p>&quot;So that's the hale ugly story, Mr. Rundell. As I said I'm
gaun to mak' nae excuses. There's nane tae mak'; an' I'm
cheap served for it a'. I should hae stood by the wife and
protected her. But I'll dae it noo. She's mine, an' if she's no
guid it is me that is to blame. I'm leavin', an' I'm gaun awa'
doon the country the morn to look for work; but I thocht I'd
tell you the whole rotten story first, then I'll get Walker, an'
hae a reckonin' wi' him an' be off the morn. I'll pay off that
black-hearted brute this day afore I leave Lowwood an' then
my conscience will be easier.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Rundell sat stupefied and amazed at the story just told
him by Robertson, and just as both men sat staring at each
other and before another word could be said, a miner burst
into the room, almost exploding with excitement, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mr. Rundell, you've to come to the pit at once. A woman
has flung herself doon the shaft.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guid God! That'll be oor Mag,&quot; cried Sanny, starting
up and out at the door, running in the direction of the pit and
stumbling every few yards in his excitement.</p>

<p>When Sanny had left the house that morning to go and
interview Mr. Rundell, Mag, with the insane decision she
had made overnight still holding her mind, dressed herself in
her best clothes, and without hesitation set off to the pit.</p>

<p>On her way down the row she stepped into Leebie Granger's
house very excited though she had been fairly quiet all morning;
so quiet in fact that Phemie Grey and Annie Watson
could not help remarking upon it.</p>

<p>&quot;She's been awfu' quate a' mornin', Phemie,&quot; said Annie,
going into her neighbor's house. &quot;She has worked away there
as if she was gaun to clean the hale place, scrubbing oot the
floor, although she washed yesterday; an' noo, she has on her
Sunday best, wi' her new hat on too, an' she's awa' into
Leebie Granger's. I wonner what'll hae ta'en her noo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guid kens,&quot; replied Phemie, &quot;but she's fair off her heid.
Dae ye ken she's just like a daft body. Did you see the look in
her e'en?&quot; and so they discussed poor Mag, who had drawn
their attention by the strangeness of her behavior.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dinna be feart, Leebie,&quot; began Mag as she saw Leebie's
apprehensive look. &quot;I'm no' gaun to meddle wi' you, although
I swore yesterday that I would. You've only done what
I did before you. You are young, an' mair pleasin' than
I am noo, an', as he said, I hae had a good innins. But, Leebie,
you'll hae to look for another fancy man. He'll no' be lang
yours. I'll see to that. Him an' me will gang oot thegither,
if I can manage it. We've baith been rotten, an' it's richt that
we should gang baith at once, an' rid the place o' a dam'd bad
sore. Guid day, Leebie. It's a dam'd puir life to leave, an'
while it maybe is a woman's lot in life to sell hersel' for ease
and comfort, it's a' bad for her when she does it in a way that
the world says is a wrang way; for she soon finds that her life
isna worth a tinker's curse. She sells hersel' an' it's no worth
while complainin' if the bargain turns oot a rotten yin.</p>

<p>&quot;If every woman had plenty of honest work, there wad be
nae fancy women, for they wadna ned do it. Guid day, Leebie.
Maybe you'll think I'm strange a wee an' maybe so I am.
You micht think I'm daft; an' maybe so I am. But after
a while when you get time to think, you'll maybe feel that
you hae heard mair soond sense oot o' Mag Robertson when
she was mad than ever she spoke when she was supposed to
be wise. Guid day, Leebie. Think ower a' I have said. I'm
no gaun to hurt you; but I'm gaun to tak' Black Jock oot o'
your clutches as shair as daith. You've had your innins too;
but it has been a dam'd short yin. I've had mine, an' the
game is feenished noo. It's time the hale thing was totaled up
so that we can see wha is the winner. I've been maybe playin'
a losin' game, Leebie, but noo we'll ken afore lang. Guid
day, Leebie. I'm off,&quot; and she was out of the door leaving
Leebie speechless with fear and amazement.</p>

<p>Mag flew down the brae to the pit almost running, while
Leebie and other neighbors looked after her with a strange
dread at their hearts.</p>

<p>When Mag arrived at the pit she asked a boy if Walker
was up the pit yet for his breakfast.</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna' think so,&quot; replied the boy. &quot;He's kind o' late
this mornin'; but there's the bell chappit three,&quot; he said as
the signal was made from the bottom that men were about
to come up. &quot;That'll likely be him coming up.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy had no sooner spoken, than with a mad rush Mag
darted forward, and opening the gates at the &quot;low scaffold,&quot;
where no one was near, being situated below the pit-head
proper, with a loud scream she hurled herself down the shaft.</p>

<p>&quot;God Almichty!&quot; roared the engineman who saw all from
the engine house, as he rushed out of the door, calling to
the pit-head workers. &quot;Mag Robertson has flung hersel' doon
the shank!&quot; and immediately all was consternation.</p>

<p>The engine keeper had just been in the act of signaling
down to Walker, who was ready to ascend when he saw the
flying figure dart forward and fling herself into the yawning
abyss.</p>

<p>Walker, standing at the foot of the shaft waiting for the
answering signal from above, heard the noise and the rush of
Mag's body as it bumped from side to side in its mad descent,
and starting back, he was just in time to get clear as the mangled
mass of rags and blood and pulpy flesh fell with a loud
splashy thud at the bottom, the blood spattering and &quot;jauping&quot;
him and the bottomer, and blinding their eyes as it flew all
over them.</p>

<p>&quot;In the name o' Heavens what's that?&quot; yelled Walker,
screaming in terror and jumping aside from the bloody upturned
face, with the wide, staring eyes, which he seemed to
recognize, as the other parts of the body lay about, still quivering
and twitching, and a horrible sickness came over him and
terror flooded his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Bell, three, quick!&quot; cried Walker, frantic with desperation
in his voice. &quot;Bell three, dammit. An' let us up out o' here.
Hurry up, hell to you,&quot; and he drew the bell himself, and without
waiting on the signal back from above, jumped into the
cage, averting his face from those horrible eyes, which lay
staring at him out of the darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;Chap it awa', man!&quot; he yelled at the bottomer, his voice
rising to a scream. &quot;Chap it, an' let us up to hell oot o' this,&quot;
and the bottomer, no less frightened than he, tore at the bell,
and jumping in himself just as the cage began slowly to ascend,
clung to the bar, shivering with terror.</p>

<p>When Walker reached the surface, he was like a madman.
He raved and swore and frothed like a churn,
running here, there and everywhere nearly collapsing
with rage, which sprang from terror.</p>

<p>Usually cool and calculating, steady and active-minded, he
seemed to have lost all grip upon himself. He had been drinking
heavily the night before and was none too sober in the
morning when he was called upon to go to work. Mag Robertson's
attack the night before had sent him to the drink, and
being a heavy drinker he was in a bad state the following
morning. Mr. Rundell found him swearing and raving in a
great passion, sacking men and behaving like a maniac.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, Walker,&quot; he began at once, his quick temper
rising anew as he thought of the story Sanny Robertson had
told him. &quot;I'll give you twenty-four hours to get out of here
and away from the place; and if you are not gone in that time
I shall inform the police. I know the whole story regarding
the setting of the contracts. Sanny has told me, and if I was
doing right I would not give you a single minute.&quot;</p>

<p>Walker seemed to calm down all at once, and his eyes became
cringing as those of a kicked cur as he stood before the
angry mine-owner.</p>

<p>&quot;But I hinna telt you a' he has done,&quot; said Sanny Robertson,
who came up just then in time to hear Mr. Rundell's words.
&quot;The dirty black-hearted brute murdered Geordie Sinclair.
He telt me himsel' one nicht at the time when we were drinkin'
together. He kent a' aboot Geordie workin' on the boss ground
an' sent him to his death to get rid of him because in a soft
moment I had telt Geordie hoo the contracts were set. He was
feart Geordie wad tell you. He's a black-hearted murderer,
an' noo he has added Mag's death to his list o' damnation.
Tak' that! an' that! you dirty villain! I'll save the hangman
the bother o' feenishin' you!&quot; and Sanny was upon Walker
tearing at him like a cat, and clawing his face with his nails,
punching, biting and kicking him as hard as he could drive his
hands and feet.</p>

<p>The attack was so sudden that Walker went down, and
Sanny was on top of him before anyone could intervene.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tear the thrapple oot o' you, you dirty swine!&quot; he
squealed, as he tugged at Black Jock's throat.</p>

<p>Mr. Rundell and a couple of laborers soon pulled Sanny up,
though he struggled to maintain his hold upon the throat of
his adversary.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me at him,&quot; he yelled, striving to get free. &quot;Let me at
him, an' I'll save the hangman a guid lot o' bother stretchin'
his dirty neck! Oh, you swine! You dirty murderin' beast!&quot;
he shrieked, as he tried to break away from the restraining
hands which held him.</p>

<p>But Sanny was soon overpowered, and Walker, bounding
to his feet, was off up the railway towards his home, terror filling
his heart, and his mind reeling with fear.</p>

<p>Mr. Rundell quickly organized a band of men to descend
the shaft and recover Mag's body, and soon the whole village
was in possession of the news, and the excitement was intense.</p>

<p>They gathered her up, a mass of dirty, pulpy flesh, scraping
the remains together and shoveling them into a rude improvised
box, the head and eyes being the only part of the body
that resembled anything like a human being.</p>

<p>&quot;Hell to my sowl, but this is the warst job that ever I got,&quot;
said Archie Braidhurst, as he scraped a mass of blood and
bones, mud and rags, together. &quot;It's a hell o' a daith to
dee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, puir lassie,&quot; replied Adam Lindsay. &quot;She's made a
splash at the hinner end. Mag ay cried that it was best to
mak' a splash aboot the things you did; but, by sirs, she has
made yin this time. What an awfu' mess!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Splash!&quot; echoed Archie with a grim laugh. &quot;She's gane
a' into jaups. She maun hae thocht she was a juck-pool. I
would like to dee like a Christian when I dee, and no' shuffle
oot like a scattered explosion, or a humplick o' mince.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, for Heaven's sake shut your mooth, an' let us get
her gathered up an' get oot o' here. Dammit, hae ye nae
common sense, swearin' an' jokin' about sic a thing! It's
enough to tempt Providence, an' had it no' been for the
tumblerful o' whisky that Mr. Rundell gied us I dinna think
I could hae faced it. It's awfu'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell are ye girnin' at?&quot; asked Archie, turning
round on him. &quot;Are ye feart Mag bites ye? Man, she's got
a' her bitin' by noo, although I admit she's made a hell o' a
mess at the end. Pit your shovel in here an' lift this pickle,
an' no' stand there gapin' like a grisly ghost at the door o'
hell! Fling it into her gapin' mouth, if you think she's goin'
to bite you!&quot; and the others laughed uneasily at Archie's sardonic
humor.</p>

<p>It was a nerve-trying experience for most of them, and
they felt sick with horror of it, in spite of the whisky and their
grim jokes. The pit was put idle, and the men went home.
A gloom brooded over the whole place.</p>

<p>Black Jock saw Mag Robertson's eyes staring at him, as
he hurried over the moor. He had not even stopped to wash
himself, but merely stowing some money into his pocket, was
off, not deigning to answer his daughter's enquiries as to what
was wrong, or where he was going. Every wild bird upon the
moor seemed to shout at him in accusation; every living thing
seemed to scream out in terror as he approached.</p>

<p>He laughed a harsh laugh, like the cry of a wild beast, and
the sheep scampered away in fear. The wind moaned out of
the gray clouds, which lay thick upon the hidden hills, and
there was an early iciness in its breath as it groaned past;
A soft, slushy sound rose from the moor at every step, until
it seemed that even earth protested. Eerie and sad the moor
was, gray and threatening the hills. Laughing at intervals that
low gurgle which sprang from fear, as some wild bird would
start up at his approach, he plodded on.</p>

<p>He did not know where he was going. He had no particular
objective. He did not know what line he would pursue. He
only wanted to get away from the scene of the tragedy, and
those terrible eyes staring, which seemed to follow him from
behind every bush or clump of heather, till in the gray mist
it seemed as if the moor were alive with them.</p>

<p>Eyes everywhere. Eyes that never winked or moved. Eyes
that never trembled with recognition or glimmered with life.
Dead eyes, cold eyes, immovable and clear&mdash;horribly clear they
were&mdash;eyes that simply stared, neither showing accusation nor
denunciation; but there they were at every tuft of yellow
grass, behind every moss-hag, and staring like pools of clear
silent death, which struck horror to his heart. He bounded
sideways as a partridge on whirring wing flew away at his
approach, and almost dropped dead with fright as a muircock,
with loud protesting voice, seemed to scream: &quot;'way back!
'way back! 'way back!&quot; and then, drawing out into a low
grumbling command, as it came to earth a few hundred yards
away, still muttering its orders to him, as he momentarily
stood to recover from his fright.</p>

<p>The whinny of a horse upon the hillside, the low cry of a
young cow, the bleat of a sheep, all added to his feeling of
dread, until the sweat streamed down his body, as he swung
along the moor.</p>

<p>At last he came to a little village, about six miles from
Lowwood, and, entering the inn, he called for a supply of
whisky.</p>

<p>&quot;It's kind o' cauld the day,&quot; the landlady said in an affable
way, as he stepped into the bar.</p>

<p>&quot;Warm enough where I have been,&quot; he replied bluntly.
&quot;Gie's something to drink in whusky!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it wad seem,&quot; she said in reply, noting his beaded forehead,
as he wiped it with a colored handkerchief.</p>

<p>&quot;You've surely been gey hard ca'd wherever you hae been,&quot;
and there was a note of curiosity in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I want a drink,&quot; he broke in abruptly, &quot;an' it doesna matter
a damn to you whether I hae been hard ca'd or no'. You're
surely hellish keen to hae news. Dis a' your customers get the
Catechism when they come in here?&quot; he queried. &quot;If they
do, I may as well tell you to begin with, that I came in for
whusky, an' no' to staun' an examination.&quot;</p>

<p>She saw at once that he resented her leisurely way and her
attempt at affability, and she hastened to apologize.</p>

<p>&quot;Look dam'd sharp,&quot; he growled, as she attended to his order.
&quot;I want whusky and plenty o' it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are in an unco' hurry,&quot; she replied, getting nettled, as
she filled a glass. &quot;It doesna' do to be so snottery as a'
that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, dammit, look alive. I'm dying for a drink. Bring in
a bottle,&quot; as she placed a glass before him filled with whisky,
&quot;an' tak' the price o' your dam'd poison aff that!&quot; and he
flung down a sovereign upon the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; said the landlady, &quot;I'll tak' nane o' your snash,
so mind that. If folk come in here to be served, they've got
to be ceevil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there's nae harm,&quot; he said apologetically, with a forced
laugh, &quot;but I'm in a hurry, and I want a drink.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, I maun hae ceevility. So if you don't gi'e the yin,
you'll no' get the ither.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's all right,&quot; he said. &quot;Keep the sovereign. I may
need more. Tell me when it is all spent,&quot; and he filled a
bumper and drained it without a halt.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, ye may be dirty at many a thing,&quot; she observed, as
she noted his action, &quot;but you're a gey clean drinker o' whusky
anyway,&quot; and she left him with his bottle to fuddle alone.</p>

<p>&quot;A gey queer body that,&quot; she mused, as she returned to the
bar. &quot;Lod! he's like a wannert thunder-storm, growlin' and
grumblin', as if he had got lost frae the rest o' his company.
But he seems to hae plenty o' siller anyway,&quot; she concluded,
&quot;an' he can drink whusky wi' anybody I ever seen try it.&quot;</p>

<p>By and by a village worthy came in, and he was at once
hailed by Black Jock, and invited to have a glass.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you drinkin', chappie?&quot; he enquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Same as you,&quot; was the reply, while a smile of pleased anticipation
hovered round the worthy's face at this unexpected
good fortune. &quot;I jist ay tak' a moothfu' o' whusky. As a
maitter o' fact, I was brocht up on the bottle, and I hae never
been spained yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right you are, cocky! Drink up! You're the man I am
lookin' for to help me to spend an hour or twa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That'll suit me a' to bits,&quot; was the reply, &quot;an' you are jist
the man I hae been lookin' for. It's a guid thing we hae met,
or we'd baith hae been unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p>So the hours passed, and each newcomer was invited to join
the company, until it grew so large that the &quot;big room&quot; was
requisitioned, and it soon held a laughing, joking, drinking,
good-natured set of as drouthy individuals as ever met together
in company. Every worthy for miles around seemed to get
the news of the free drinks, and whisky and beer flowed like
water, and the company grew more and more cheerful and
happy.</p>

<p>Bottle after bottle of drink was consumed, and as the company
got hilarious, a song was sung or a story was told, until
the whole place had the air of a fair day about it.</p>

<p>Jock spent his money freely, and his company drank his
health as freely as he paid for the drinks. So the merry hours
went past, and the darkness came on. Yet for all the whisky
that Walker consumed, he never seemed to get drunk. He was
certainly a bit intoxicated, but was in that condition described
by one of the company next day as being &quot;sensibly drunk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, damn you, you son of a tinkler,&quot; he urged.
&quot;Drink up, an' let us mak' a nicht o't,&quot; and thus urged they
drained their glasses, and had them refilled again and again.</p>

<p>&quot;Gie's a sang, Geordie,&quot; cried one of the company across
the room to an old shaggy-faced individual, who sat and
laughed and drank with happy demeanor, rubbing his bristly
chin, which resembled the back of a hedgehog, with dirty
gnarled fingers which seemed made for lifting glasses, having
a natural crook in them, into which the glass as naturally fitted.
&quot;You hinna sung anything yet. Gie's yin o' your ain makin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lodsake, I canna sing,&quot; said Geordie, with the air of a
man who wanted to be told he could sing.</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, you can sing fine,&quot; was the chorused reply from
nearly everyone in the company.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Geordie, you ken you can sing fine. Man, there's
no' a better singer in the place, auld and a' as ye are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Och, I canna sing noo, Charlie,&quot; replied Geordie, clearing
his throat, &quot;but I'll confess that I hae seen the day when I
could lilt it wi' the best o' them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but we a' ken fine that you can sing. Man, it's a treat
to hear him,&quot; said Charlie, turning to Black Jock. &quot;He could
wile the bird aff the bush. Gie's yin o' your ain, Geordie.
It's aye best to hear you at yin o' your ain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, weel,&quot; said Geordie with a show of reluctance, as he
rose to his feet, making a noise in his throat, like the exhaust
pipe of an engine, &quot;seein' that you are all so pressin' on the
maitter, I'll gi'e ye a bit verse or twa.&quot;</p>

<p>A roar of applause greeted Geordie as he sat down, and
words of appreciation broke from everyone in the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Dam'd guid, Geordie! Fill up your glass. That deserves
a richt guid dram!&quot; cried Black Jock, as he reached across the
table and poured a bumper for Geordie. &quot;Wha's gaun to sing
next? Come on, chaps; let us mak' a nicht o't!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear, hear,&quot; said Geordie. &quot;I'm just feelin' in gran' fettle
for a nicht. Tammas Fairly will gie's a bit verse maybe. He
can sing a fair guid song.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me sing!&quot; exclaimed Tam. &quot;Gae awa'! Ye ken fine I
canna sing like you, Geordie,&quot; and there was a hint of assumed
bashfulness in Tam's voice as he spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Tam. There's to be nae jookin' oot o' it. It's
to be a sang roon' aboot, so you micht as weel begin noo, an'
get your turn by.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, come on,&quot; chimed in Walker. &quot;Let us enjoy oorsel'
the nicht, when we are in a mood for it. Guid kens when we
may ever spend a nicht thegither again. Come on, Tam,
get up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, weel,&quot; said Tam with bashful reluctance, &quot;I'll do my
best,&quot; and clearing his throat, Tam sang.</p>

<p>&quot;Hear, hear!&quot; roared Black Jock. &quot;That deserves a bumper
too, Tammas. Fill up your glass. An honest dram's afore a'
the simperin' Judies that ever held up their gabs to be kissed!&quot;
and filling another round, they drank, and roared, and cried
their appreciation.</p>

<p>The fun waxed fast and furious, as song after song was
sung, which sometimes were capped by a rough story or a questionable
joke from someone in the company.</p>

<p>&quot;But you havena gi'en us a sang yoursel'!&quot; observed Charlie,
turning to Black Jock, after most of the company had obliged
with an effort.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I havena gi'en you a sang,&quot; he replied with a coarse
laugh, &quot;but I hae paid for a' the drinks, an' I suppose that'll
please the maist o' you better than a dizzen sangs frae me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite true,&quot; said Geordie. &quot;You're a gentleman, an' I
never met a better. I only hope we'll hae the pleesure o'
meetin' you here again afore lang. It's been yin o' the best
nichts I hae spent for a lang time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true, Geordie,&quot; said Charlie. &quot;He has gi'en us yin
o' the best nichts I hae ever spent. In fact I never min' o'
haein' a better, an' to celebrate it, if nane of you hae ony objections,
I'll sing anither sang.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear, hear,&quot; cried Walker heartily. &quot;Order for the sang,&quot;
and he tapped the table loudly with a bottle, as he called for
quietness amid the din.</p>

<p>&quot;Order for the sang, boys!&quot; bawled Geordie, &quot;Charlie is gaun
to favor the company,&quot; and as the noise immediately ceased,
Charlie sang a song about the fascinating women.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a guid yin, Charlie,&quot; roared Walker, thumping the
table as he roared. &quot;I hae had a lang experience o' weemin'
bodies,&quot; and he winked across to Geordie as he spoke, &quot;an'
I can say they are rale blood-suckers. They're like whisky,
gran' at the time, but you sing sorry next day, an' fin' oot what
a fool you hae been. They hing on to you like leeches, an'
mak' a mess o' things at the en'. Though you had a face like
a crocodile as long as you had plenty of cash, they'd lick your
feet; when your money's done, they're awa' like swallows at
the first nip o' autumn frost!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it's a dam'd funny world,&quot; he went on in a lower tone,
as if half speaking to himself. &quot;A fu' purse an' you've plenty
o' frien's, an' a woman when you need her, but if your purse
is toom, your heart may grien a hell o' a lang while afore yin
wad ever come near you.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus the evening passed till some were lying below the
table, unable to sit up and take their round; and finally the
closing hour arrived, and all had to disperse.</p>

<p>Black Jock, again left to himself, deserted by all his company,
and in spite of all the drink he had consumed walking
fairly steadily, stepped out upon the country road, neither
caring nor knowing in which direction he went. His head bent
forward upon his breast, or rolling occasionally from side to
side, seemed too heavy for his neck to support, as he swayed
from the center of the road to its margin.</p>

<p>The horrible staring eyes began again to infest his journey,
and seemed to accompany him wherever he went. He could
not get away from them. Out in the lonely night, the whole
sky merry with stars, was alive with staring eyes, that glared
down upon him from above with a cold sinister light. They
looked at him from the hedgerows; they glared at him from
behind every bush or knoll by the wayside; they glowered at
him from behind the trees; and they even perched upon his
shoulders and peeped at him in accusation.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn you!&quot; he growled, striking at them as if he would
brush them from his sight; but still they followed and accused
no matter where he turned. He grew more and more irritated
and alarmed, as they seemed to multiply with every minute
that passed; and he quickened his pace, but in spite of his
speed, they still pursued and multiplied.</p>

<p>Driven mad by the persistence of their stare, he rushed from
side to side of the road, striking at them, hitting out with his
hands, and kicking with his feet; but still they grew in numbers
and in immensity.</p>

<p>He shook himself as if to free his body from them; he rushed
ahead, swearing and muttering; he growled and shouted, sometimes
pleading to be let alone, and sometimes roaring defiance
to the night air; but still the eyes held him relentlessly, implacably,
and ever growing in numbers, until it seemed as if
the whole countryside were alive with them. They came nearer
and receded again; they swarmed round him in legions, then
withdrew behind the hedges to stare at him with wide-open
lids. They drew him onward, and he advanced cautiously.
Then they rushed at him, and retired again, as if driven back;
but still they were there, just round the bend of the road,
just behind that bush, just over that hedge, and behind that
tree, glaring and looking at him, and ready to rush forth again
as soon as they thought he was sufficiently off his guard.</p>

<p>&quot;Back!&quot; he roared again, striking out with his fist as they
rose only a couple of yards ahead. &quot;Back! an' be damned to
you,&quot; as a whole swarm larger and larger, so that they lighted
up the night, came rushing round him.</p>

<p>They were hissing and roaring at him this time. They had
hitherto been silent, and he seemed to hear at first a low
murmuring whisper, as if they consulted together as to the
best way to attack him. Then the whisper grew to a louder
swishing sound like the noise Mag had made as her body
hurtled from side to side on falling down the shaft. It grew
louder and louder, like the wind coming through far-off trees,
gradually swelling to a roar. The eyes grew in numbers and
got larger with the noise; and finally, with terror clutching at
his heart and an oath upon his lips, he turned to run back,
only to find that they had all merged into two wide, horribly
glaring fiery eyes which were bearing down upon him with the
speed and noise of an express train. They were on him before
he could turn, as if they now realized that he was fully at
their mercy, and with the courage of desperation he flung himself
bodily upon them and went down crushed beneath the
heavy mass of a motor driven with reckless speed by a young
man rushing to catch a train.</p>

<p>Walker was down before the young man realized what had
happened and the hoot of the horn had merely spurred Black
Jock to the last desperate leap to death, the lights of the
motor having taken on the shape of all the pursuing eyes that
had followed him that night.</p>

<p>When he was taken from beneath the wheels, his neck broken
and his body smashed, Black Jock had paid the last penalty,
and the eyes which destroyed him flashed out accompaniment
to his departing soul. And the winking skies, still merry with
the stars of night, looked down unmoved, while the night-birds
on the moor answered one another in their flight, and called
a last farewell to the spirit of Black Jock.</p>

<h2>THE CONFERENCE</h2>


<p>The storm which had been brewing in the industrial
firmament grew more threatening and the clouds grew
blacker until it seemed as if nothing could prevent a
commotion on a big scale.</p>

<p>The demand for a fuller life and more security was being
made by the miners all over the country. Organization was
proceeding apace, and a new idea was being glimpsed by the
younger men especially, which filled their hearts and fired
their imagination.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think the time has come now, Bob?&quot; asked Robert
Sinclair, speaking to Smillie one day, as they proceeded by rail
to a conference together, &quot;when the whole Federation can try
its power in a demand for something real?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by something real, Robert?&quot; asked
Smillie, with a keen look at the young, eager face turned towards
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Some guarantee of comfort in our lives,&quot; was the reply.
&quot;You know that we have none now. You and others of us
have been teaching the miners to work towards the day when
a standard of ease and comfort will be assured to all. We have
worked for it, and the miners now are looking for something
tangible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know; but do you think, Robert, that the time has
come to put it to the test?&quot; and Smillie had gone on to tell of
some of the difficulties they were faced with.</p>

<p>So they talked and discussed, exchanging opinions and
hopes; and all over the mining world their dreams were being
voiced, and had helped to make the coming crisis.</p>

<p>Conferences were held, and the whole matter threshed out
from every angle. The miners were united as they had never
been before and the whole of the British miners were determined
to use their organization to enforce their demands.</p>

<p>It was a triumph for Smillie's genius, the climax of his
dream, to have them united as one body to fight what he called
their real enemies. One federation linked together by common
ideals, with common interests bound by common ties,
united by traditions, by creed, by class, by common tastes
shared, by suffering and hardship. It was his monument, and
perhaps he regarded it with no little pride.</p>

<p>When Robert was appointed delegate to the council of his
Union from his branch, he set himself to master thoroughly,
in every detail, its machinery, and very soon his voice was
raised in the debates, and it amazed even himself to find what
a power he seemed to possess over his fellows. He soon learned
to state his case in simple unaffected language which took a
marvelous hold upon his hearers, while at times his warm
glowing imagination would conjure up a living picture that
hit with irresistible force, and made a lasting impression upon
those who listened.</p>

<p>He gradually became more fluent, and studied how best to
impress his comrades. His earnestness and enthusiasm were
unquestioned, and sometimes were even found to be a serious
obstacle to the older type of leader, men for the most part
lacking imagination, and whose older and more prosaic outlook
could not understand the younger man, whose zeal they regarded
with impatience.</p>

<p>But Smillie soon recognized Robert's talent and his worth,
and gave him more scope than he otherwise might have done.</p>

<p>Robert's admiration for his chief was unbounded, though
it did not keep him from differing from Smillie at times on
matters of detail. On principles they were generally at one
with each other and while it was rarely that they differed,
the occasions upon which they did so were remembered by all
who heard. Smillie soon realized that there was an unshakable
will behind the young man, and watched him under every difficult
occasion with a certain amount of pride, as he grew in
individuality and resource. Robert was not a frequent speaker,
but was always listened to with respect when he did speak.</p>

<p>An industrial crisis was upon the country and everyone
was expectant, and wondering how it would all end. Keir
Hardie's preaching of the working class gospel was a big factor
in Robert's development and the latter was soon in demand
for platform lectures, stirring up the workers and pleading
with them to organize, and teaching them economics through
historical allusion and industrial evolution until he soon became
recognized as one of the coming forces in the working-class
movement. He was as yet very impulsive, and while
such a trait had generally a powerful appeal on the average
audience of the working class type, it often put him into somewhat
compromising situations, when dealing with the more
sober and serious work of the organization. Still he was showing
up well, and only time and experience were needed to
cure his defects. So the year ended, and the cloud grew more
and more threatening.</p>

<p>January brought the crisis to a head, and the Government,
recognizing that nothing could avert a strike and as the foreign
situation was passing through a critical period, requested that
a conference should be called in London, and invited the
miners and the mine-owners to come together so that the
Prime Minister and other statesmen could be present to try
and adjust the grievance. It was a historic gathering and one
that marked an epoch in the history of the industrial movement.</p>

<p>Delegates were present from almost every Miners' Lodge in
Great Britain, while the owners were also fully represented.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister acted as chairman of the gathering and
he was supported on the platform by other members of the
Government, while Smillie and other well-known leaders represented
the men and a number of the owners represented
the Coal Masters' Association.</p>

<p>The platform party was an imposing one. Men of big reputation
were there, and Robert felt himself wondering, as he
looked at them, how ordinary they looked after all, and he
began to speculate as to the qualities they possessed which
had given them such importance.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the Chancellor o' the Exchequer,&quot; said one of the
delegates to Robert, pointing out the individual named. &quot;He's
a wee eatin'-an'-spued' lookin' thing when you see him sittin'
there, isn't he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; answered Robert casually, as he surveyed the group.
&quot;I was just wondering how it was they had a' gained such
reputations. In appearance they are not much to boast about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, they're jist a lot o' oily tongued wheedlers,&quot; was the
reply, &quot;an' that wee ferrit-eyed yin is the worst o' them a'.
Just wait till he begins to speak, an' you'll think he's a showman.
He can fairly pit on the butter, an' he'll send us a'
away hame in the belief that we're the finest set o' men he
ever met, an' mak' us feel that if we decide to do anything
against what he recommends, the hale country will gang to
ruin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Robert, as his fellow delegate paused, &quot;I've
read aboot him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, but wait till you hear him. We can a' come up here
as angry as hell, ready to string him up to the nearest lamp-post;
but after he has spoken an' slaivered ower us for a while,
we begin to feel differently, an' finally gang awa hame wi' our
minds made up that we are the salt o' the earth. Man, it tak's
a' the sting oot o' bein' dune, to be dune sae well an' sae completely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but when you know that why do you allow yourselves
to be wheedled?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, man; it's a' right askin' that question; but efter thae
chaps get round aboot you, wi' their greasy tongues, an' their
flatterin' ways, you jist begin to think that it's nae use to
bother ony mair aboot resistin'. Look at that auld fermer-collier
lookin' chiel, wi' his white heid an' his snipe-nose an'
a smile on his face that wad mak' you believe he was gaun to
dae you some big service. That's the smile that has made him
Prime Minister. You'd think frae his face that he was just
a solid easy-gaun kindly auld fermer, who took a constant joy
in givin' jeelie-pieces to hungry weans. But when he speaks,
and gets a grip o' you, he's yin o' the sooplest lawyers that
ever danced roun' the rim o' hell withoot fallin' in. He'd do
his faither, that yin. He wad that.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert looked at the various individuals as they were described,
keenly interested and feeling that this comrade of his
was describing much of what he himself had felt about these
men, and wondered more and more as to what it was that
had given them their power.</p>

<p>&quot;They're a fine rogues' gallery when you see them a' sittin'
there,&quot; went on the other. &quot;They ken we are up here the
day determined to demand our terms, an' that's the way they
are a' turned out. Just you wait till they begin, an' you'll see
a fine bit o' play actin'. They'll play us aboot as auld Tom
Tervit wad play a trout in the Clyde. They hae ony amount o'
patience, an' they'll gae you onything but the thing you want.
They'd promise us the kingdom o' Heaven; an' they'll give us
plenty o' line to run wi'; but a' the time they'll be lookin' for
a chance to land us. An' they'll do it. Jist you wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it will be our own fault if we let them,&quot; said Robert,
shortly, as he listened. &quot;I would not let any of them do that.
If we have our minds made up on what we want, I can't see
why we should be wheedled like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Neither do I,&quot; was the reply. &quot;But it is aye done for all
that. Then there's that ither chiel&mdash;I think he's on the Local
Government Board or something. He's a corker, wi' a face
like yin o' they pented cupids that the lasses send to the young
men on picture postcards. Look at his nice wee baby's mooth,
an' the smile on it too. It wad dazzle a hungry crocodile
lookin' for its denner. His e'en are aye brighter than ony I
ever saw&mdash;an' speak! Guid God! He could speak for a hale
June day. He's gran' at makin' your flesh creep. He blinds
you wi' sparks, an' fire-works, his words are that hot an'
glowin', an' he fair dumbfounders you wi' fine soundin' sentences
an' lang words. He's a corker I can tell you! But
here, they are gaun to begin,&quot; he broke off hurriedly as the
Prime Minister rose to his feet. Then in a sly whisper, he
added:&mdash;&quot;Just you pay attention, an' tell me after if you can
tell how we hae been dune. They are here to do us the day, as
sure as daith.&quot;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's speech was a masterly plea for compromise;
but through it all, it seemed as if he was laying the
blame upon the miners for the critical stage which had been
reached. He appealed and cajoled, asked them to take long
views, and talked fine platitudes about self-sacrifice, and the
spirit of brotherhood, which could alone bring peace and contentment.
The country was in danger, and it would be a terrible
crime if the miners forced a strike; for only upon the
great white solitudes of self-sacrifice and mutual help, whose
peaks towered away into the realms of eternity, could real
satisfaction be gained, and much more of a like kind.</p>

<p>Then followed other ministers, who took their cue from
their chief; but there was no hint that any of them had ever
made a serious attempt to understand the problem which has
arisen to confront them so seriously.</p>

<p>They talked, or so at least it seemed to Robert, who sat in
the body of the hall with the rest of the delegates, to the
miners as if they were children, naughty and spoilt; and of
course such an attitude could never bring about any form of
agreement to sensible men, who deal every day with the life
at the rough, raw edges of things.</p>

<p>So it was, when four of them had spoken after the Prime
Minister, and none of them had shown any attempt to grapple
with the subject under dispute, Robert felt more and more
the truth of his fellow-delegates' description. It was all a
masterly bit of wheedling and the Chancellor's effort especially
was designed to win them over to a compromise settlement.</p>

<p>He began jocularly with a broad jest which set the delegates
all rocking with laughter, telling how glad he was to be there
to talk over with them the difficulties which had arisen. It
always gave him pleasure to meet them and to get to know
their point of view; because usually their good sense and their
large stock of prudence made them amenable to listening to
a reasoned argument.</p>

<p>He was glad they always recognized there were two sides
to most disputes, and he felt sure whatever the outcome of
this conference might be they would not allow their good sense
to stand in the way of a possible settlement. Gradually he
worked into more serious lines, and with vivid language, putting
the case for the opposite side, gently bringing their minds
by degrees further and further away from the point&mdash;the real
point of issue.</p>

<p>Then finally when sufficiently developed, he gathered all
the threads together, and in a great burst of poetic eloquence
and fiery fervor he swept along like a tornado in a grand
burst of superb oratory, his eyes rolling and flashing, his hands
and head poised into beautifully effective gesture, and appealed
to them in great rolling, fiery sentences that completely swept
the conference like a whirlwind, and sat down amid a great
burst of applause which broke with splendid spontaneity from
the assembled delegates, and the winning golden smile upon his
face which Robert's companion had described earlier in the
day.</p>

<p>Robert could hardly analyze his feelings. He felt he did
not know whether to admire or condemn, but all the time he
felt a slow rising indignation within him, and that the Conference
was being swung away from what they had met to discuss.
Perhaps it was his companions' conversation that did it.
He could not tell; but unable to contain himself longer his
impulsive nature getting the upper hand, he bounced to his
feet, pale and excited, though trying hard to curb and control
himself, and in a low tense voice, which at first halted a little,
electrified the gathering by a speech wrung from his very soul.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Chairman,&quot; he began, in this unexpected incident, &quot;I
have listened very attentively to the speeches just delivered
by yourself and the other honorable gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p>Here some of the other delegates intervened to tell him
that he was not expected to speak, but the Prime Minister, for
some reason unknown, told him to go on and so he proceeded.</p>

<p>Then Robert proceeded to pour out his soul, stating the
miners' grievances and their rights as men. How they were
always put off with promises, and defeated in dialectics and the
game of wits. As he spoke he felt the assembly gradually
thaw, then become liquid, finally it seemed to join the torrent
of his eloquence, and sweep on, blotting out all resistance.</p>

<p>When at last he sat down a wild burst of applause rent the
air, as he sat down pale and excited; but glad that he had got
the chance at last of speaking what he felt to the enemies of
his class.</p>

<p>For fully five minutes the delegates went wild in their cheering
and applause. Again and again it broke out afresh, when
it had spent itself a little, and seemed to be dying down, but
the memory of it always stirred them to fresh outbursts until
at last, taking advantage of a lull, the Prime Minister suggested
that he and his colleagues would prefer that the conference
should stand adjourned till the next day, and this was
agreed to by the delegates, who were not averse to the holiday.</p>

<p>Congratulations were showered upon Robert from all sides.
Even men who differed from him on most things grasped his
hand and shook it, and told him how proud they were of his
little speech.</p>

<p>Robert heard and saw all their pleased enjoyment but was
vaguely troubled in his heart, wondering how Smillie would
have taken it, and this pained him more than the pleasant
things the other delegates said to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Man, Sinclair,&quot; said the one who had sat next to Robert
in the Conference, when they got out on to the street, &quot;you've
fairly upset the hale jing bang o' them the day. Lod! But I
was like a balloon in a high wind, fair carried away wi' you.
I never thocht you could have done that. I was in the opinion
that Smillie was the only yin that could stand up to that set
o' rogues. It was great. It was that.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert laughed uneasily and bashfully as he answered, &quot;I
couldn't help it, Davie,&quot; then adding as an afterthought,
&quot;Maybe I hae put my fit in it. I wonder how Smillie took
it a'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, well, it disna matter a damn, onyway. You did fine,
an' I canna see how Smillie has onything ado wi' it. However,
we hae a hale day to oorsel's now, what dae you say to gaun
to the length of Kew Gardens? It's a gran' place, an' I hae
a sister oot there in service.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I don't mind. I don't know onything aboot London
and as you are nae stranger, I might as well gang wi' you, as
bother onybody else to show me roun'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's some of thae chaps'll fairly enjoy this,&quot; said Davie,
nodding in the direction of some of the delegates. &quot;That's the
way they agreed to adjourn sae already. They jist leeve for
the conferences. It's the time they like. They booze and get
their horns oot for a day or two, an' I can tell you, Rab, it's
maybe jist as well that they dinna bring their weemin folks
wi' them. However, it tak's a' kinds of folk to mak' a world,
I suppose, so let's off, and see as muckle o' London as possible,&quot;
and they set off and were soon swallowed up in the
great Metropolis.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h2>THE MEETING WITH MYSIE</h2>


<p>When the London Conference ended, the delegates hurried
back to put the terms of the suggested agreement
before the men, and as they journeyed the whole
topic of conversation was of the Conference, and of the terms
which had been suggested as a basis for settlement of the dispute.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you can a' say what you like,&quot; put in Davie Donaldson,
who had sat beside Robert in the Conference, &quot;but in my
opinion we hae been diddled again. The wee showman wi'
the ferret een was too mony for us, an' he jist twisted us round
his wee finger as he liked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ach, but you are never content,&quot; replied another who was
of an opposite opinion. &quot;It doesna matter what kind o' terms
you get, you're never content.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm no' content wi' thae terms ony way,&quot; persisted Davie
stubbornly. &quot;What the hell's the use o' makin' a demand for
something, an' sayin' afore you gang that you mean to hae
it, an' then to tamely tak' the hauf o' it, an' gang awa' hame
as pleased as a wheen weans wha have been promised a penny
to tak' castor oil? I'd be dam'd afore I'd tak' that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're owre ill to please,&quot; said the other. &quot;You're never
satisfied wi' a fair thing. Didn't you hear as weel as me that
there was a danger o' war breakin' oot at the present time, an'
we couldna possibly hae a strike at a time like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;War!&quot; retorted Davie, heatedly. &quot;They'll aye hae a war
or something else to fricht you wi', when you show that you
mean business. Wha the hell hae we to quarrel wi' onyway,
I'd like to ken?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it micht be France, or Germany, or Russia, or some
ither o' thae cut-throat foreign nations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An' what are you gaun to quarrel aboot?&quot; yelled Davie
still more heatedly.</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell do I ken?&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, if you don't ken, why the damn should you quarrel?
It's a dam'd silly thing to fecht at ony time, but it's a dam'd
sicht sillier to fecht withoot haein' a quarrel at a',&quot; cried
Davie, now fairly roused. &quot;That's jist hoo they diddle us.
They diddle the workers o' France an' ither countries in
the same way. Maybe the French Government is telling the
French colliers that there is a danger o' a war wi' Britain at
this minute, to keep them quate; an' if they are, do you an' me
ken anything aboot what the war will be for? No' a thing
does yin o' us ken. Wars are no' made by workin' folk at all!
They are made wi' the ither crowd, an' they laugh in their
sleeves when they hae sent us awa' back to our work an' oor
hames as quate as mice,&quot; and Davie looked round in triumph,
asking with his eyes, and in the tones of his voice, for confirmation
of his views from the others.</p>

<p>Thus they talked and discussed, exchanging opinions about
all things in strong but expressive language, as the train sped
northwards bearing them home. District meetings were organized,
and the leaders put persuasively the arguments for
the acceptance of the terms laid down. All through the crisis
the men had behaved admirably, for they had learned to trust
Smillie, even when they felt doubtful of his policy. Robert
took a big share in the organizing of these meetings and in addressing
them. He flung himself into this work whole-heartedly.
The terms certainly did not please him; but, as the
majority at the London Conference had decided to recommend
them to the men, he thought it his duty to sink his personal
opinions, and in the interests of discipline and the unity of the
organization&mdash;as he had already had his say and had been
found in the minority&mdash;he put all his efforts into trying to get
the men to accept the suggested terms, and go forward as one
united body. His persuasive powers of appeal, and his straight,
direct way of argument, commended him to his comrades. By
the time that the ballot had been carried through in the various
districts, it was mid-February, and the Scottish delegates
met in Edinburgh to give the result of the voting among the
rank and file.</p>

<p>Robert attended the Conference, and while he had appealed
to the men to accept the terms of the London Conference, he
secretly hoped that the ballot vote of the men would decide
to fight; for, like Davie Donaldson, he believed they had again
been side-tracked. He wondered how Smillie regarded the
matter. He had not had an opportunity of talking with Smillie
to learn his opinion, but he felt sure that his leaders did not
like the terms either.</p>

<p>If, however, the men had agreed on acceptance, he could
not help matters; but a direct refusal from the rank and file
would, he thought, be an intimation to the more reactionary
leaders that the spirit of revolt was growing, and would give
the rebels the chance for which they were looking. But he
would soon know, he thought, as he hastened to the Synod
Hall, where the Conference was to be held; for the result
of the ballot was to be announced at the end of the first part
of the Conference.</p>

<p>There was some routine business to get over when it opened,
and after a while the President rose and gave the result of
the ballot, which showed a considerable majority for acceptance,
and this brought the adjournment for dinner.</p>

<p>Robert felt that he wanted to spend a quiet five minutes or
so before the Conference resumed; so he hurried through with
his dinner and then strolled out into Princes Street Gardens,
which attracted him very much. His mind seemed to want
peace and quietness, and as he walked along, turning over the
situation and examining it from all points of view, the fluttering
of early mating birds among the shrubs soon shifted his
thoughts to other things; and, as they romped and courted,
and fought among the bushes, his thoughts went back to the
moor at home, and the little wood, and the memories of other
things.</p>

<p>The vague stirrings of power within him had become more
pronounced during the last six months, and he felt conscious
of a growing sense of importance. It was not that he was conceited,
but his mental muscles, as it were, seemed to have
gained in power from the strenuous exertions which they had
lately undertaken.</p>

<p>He knew that he possessed talents far above the average
of his class. He was sensible of a certain superiority, yet it
was not from the contemplation of this that he drew his elation.
He saw the issue quite clearly and knew the pathway
which must be trodden. He was not personally ambitious for
the sake of making an impression or gaining power. He knew
that in too many cases men had in the past made their position
a sinecure in the Labor Movement and he condemned their
action. The Movement must be served and not lived on. Not
personal betterment, but the betterment of the whole lot.
Whatever it demanded of service from anyone should be given
willingly, no matter in what direction the call were made.</p>

<p>Musing thus, he strolled along among his hopes of the future.
His life's work lay here, working for his own class&mdash;for
humanity. There was nothing else to win him; for like
most young men in like circumstances he had already concluded
that now, since Mysie was not to be his, there was
nothing else to which he could better devote his life.</p>

<p>Where was Mysie, he wondered? What had happened to
her? She had completely gone out of everybody's knowledge,
and no one seemed to know anything about her.</p>

<p>He moved slowly along and at the thought of Mysie his
former decision seemed a cold one and he felt that she still
held a big place in his life. Moving towards a seat a little
way ahead so that he might enjoy this mood, the figure of a girl
started up as if to go, and immediately he rushed forward, all
his pulses afire, and his whole being stirred beyond words.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie!&quot; he exclaimed, jumping forward, &quot;Guid God!
where have you come from? Where have you been?&quot; and
his hands were holding hers, and his eyes greedily scanning her
face as if he would look into her very soul, and read the story
of the last few months.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Rob,&quot; she said, with a gasp, &quot;I didna think I wad
meet you here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sit down,&quot; he said hurriedly, as he recovered himself. &quot;Sit
down and rest. You're ill. What's the matter? Where have
you been? Tell me all about it!&quot; There were tears in Mysie's
eyes too, as she weakly sat down, unable to do anything else.
She had recognized him as he approached, and had started up
to get away; but he had also recognized her, and she was too
late.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoo is my mither an' my faither?&quot; she enquired, after a
short silence, as she tried to recover herself. &quot;Hoo are they a'
at hame?&quot; the greedy heart hunger for loved ones drove her
to the impatient enquiry. &quot;Did they miss me muckle, Rob?
Were they awfu' vexed at what I did? Tell me a' aboot it
then, I want to ken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you must tell me first aboot yoursel', Mysie,&quot; he replied
evasively, searching in his mind the best way to adopt in
telling her of the things he knew would wound her. &quot;Come,
Mysie,&quot; he urged, &quot;you surely can trust me. I have always
been your friend, and I only wish now to hear all about you.
Why did you go away?&quot;</p>

<p>She saw him look at her, and a quick flush overspread her
thin, pale cheeks as she detected his look. He had no need to
ask further.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Rob, I wish&mdash;I wish I had died a year syne!&quot; and a
wild burst of sobbing came over her as she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna greet, Mysie,&quot; he said, as his hand reached out and
began to stroke her hair tenderly. Then after a short pause,
&quot;Wha was he, Mysie? Tell me, an' I'll tear the black heart
oot o' him!&quot;</p>

<p>But Mysie only cried, uncontrollably, and hid her face in
her hands; for the homely doric on Robert's tongue touched
her and it came readier to him in moments like these, and the
tender touch of his hand upon her head gave her comfort,
soothing her, and staying her grief, as a child is quieted by the
loving hand of a mother.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell you a' aboot it, Rob,&quot; she said at last after a short
time. &quot;An' I hope you'll no' tell onybody. There's naebody
to blame but mysel' for a' that has happened, an' I maun bear
the punishment if there is punishment gaun,&quot; and bit by bit,
with many an effort to compose herself as she spoke, she told
him the whole sad story from beginning to end.</p>

<p>&quot;There was naebody to blame, Rob&mdash;naebody but mysel'!
I should hae kent better. But I never thocht it wad hae turned
oot as it has done. I hae been gey ill, an' I maun say that
Peter has been awful guid to me. He's done his best to get
me better, so that he can marry me afore it happens. I lay
for nearly six months, an' I wasna carin' whether I died or
no'! I was fair heartbroken, an' didna mind what happened.
This is the first day I hae been oot. He cam' this mornin'
frae his lodgings tae ask me tae gang oot a wee while in the
sunshine, seein' that it was sic a guid day, and Mrs. Ramsay
brocht me oot here, and warned me to sit till she cam' back.
When I saw you comin' I got up to run awa', but I dinna
ken whaur to run to; for this big toon is a' strange to me, an'
I'm feart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, if I had only kent! You maun keep yoursel' as free
frae worry as possible, an' try an' get better,&quot; he went on,
trying to speak as lightly as possible. &quot;Keep up your spirits,
an' you'll maybe soon be a' better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, Rob,&quot; she said, &quot;but it's no' easy. An' I hae been
gettin' waur instead o' better. I ken mysel' that I'm no' improvin',
an' I often think it wad hae been better if I had died.
When folk don't want to live&mdash;when they've nothing to be
happy aboot they are better to dee!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you maunna talk like that, Mysie,&quot; he said again.
&quot;You'll get better yet, an' be as happy as ever you were. It
is only because you are ill noo an' you sae weak, that mak's
you talk like that. An' forby you maun mind that there are
ither folk wha'll be vexed if you dinna get better. Your
faither and your mither wad like to see you weel an' happy,
an' oh, Mysie, Mysie, I want you to get weel!&quot; he broke out
passionately&mdash;pleadingly, the misery in his voice going to her
heart as it cried to her, ached for her, and suffered for her.
&quot;Wad you hae married me, Mysie, if I had asked you afore
you went awa'?&quot; and his hands were again stroking tenderly
the brown hair and patting the thin cheeks as he spoke and
plead.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Rob,&quot; she answered simply, &quot;I wad hae married you.
I sometimes think yet that I'll never marry onybody else. As
a lassie I aye dreamed in my ain mind that I'd be your wife.
It's awfu' hoo the things that folk want maist are aye the
things they never get!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie, wad you marry me yet?&quot; he asked, impulsively.
&quot;Jist this minute? An' I'll tak' you hame, an' naebody will
ken onything. I'll take a' the blame, an' you can say that it
was me. I'll nurse you back to health again wi' my mither's
help an' naebody need ken the richt wye o' it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Rob,&quot; she said after a short pause. &quot;I couldna dae
that. It wad neither be fair to you or me, nor to onybody
else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Mysie,&quot; he went on in the low tender voice that was
so difficult to withstand, &quot;you don't like Peter weel enough
to be his wife. You say you never intended to be onybody's
wife but mine; an' what wye should you no' do as I propose?
You ken I'll never do onything else but love you. You ken
that, Mysie!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Rob,&quot; she answered, &quot;I ken a' that. Naebody kens
it better than me noo; and that's what mak's it sae awfu' hard
to refuse. But it wadna be richt at a', an' that's a' that can
be thocht aboot it. You maunna ask me ony mair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I will ask you,&quot; he cried in another burst of passion,
&quot;an' I'll keep on askin' you. You ken you are mine, an' naebody
else has a richt to you. I love you, Mysie! Oh, can you
no' see, lassie, that it wad be a' richt if you'd do as I want
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, Rob. Dinna say that. It wadna be richt at a',
an' I'd be doin' anither wrang thing if I did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you said jist the noo, that you sometimes thocht you
wadna marry onybody else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I ken I said that,&quot; she replied. Then with pain in her
voice as it grew more pitiful, &quot;Dinna ask me, Rob, to do that.
I ken it wadna be richt, an' you munna ask me ony mair; for
though I said that I sometimes thocht I wadna marry onybody
else, I canna marry you noo. Oh! if only my mither kent, it
would break her heart, an' my faither wad dee o' the disgrace!
What do they think o' me, Rob? Tell me a'&mdash;hoo are
they, an' if they miss me very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your faither and mither nearly broke their hearts,&quot; he
said simply, &quot;an' at nicht your mother lies an' thinks an' wonders
what has come owre you. You ken hoo a mither grieves
an' worries aboot her bairns. She never thocht o' sic a thing
happening in her family. She was aye sae prood o' them a'.
I heard her say ane day to my mither that she dootit you
maun be deid, or you wad hae sent her word; and that you
wadna hae gane wrang. She never, she said, kent o' you takin'
up wi' men, an' was sure that naething o' that kind had happened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did she really think that, Rob?&quot; asked Mysie, glad to
know that her mother had believed in her virtue, yet pained.
&quot;Rob, if only mithers wad be mair open wi' their lassies an' tell
them o' the things they shouldna' do, an' the dangers that lie
afore them. But tell me aboot them a'. What did my faither
say aboot it? How are they a' keepin'?&quot;</p>

<p>This was the question which Robert had feared most, for
although Matthew Maitland had said very little, everybody
knew that he grieved sorely over his daughter's disappearance,
and at the time was lying very ill. He was fast nearing the
end, which most colliers of the day reached&mdash;cut off in middle
life, made old by bad ventilation in the mines, and black
damp. His condition was almost despaired of by the doctor,
and when Robert left Lowwood that evening for Edinburgh, he
was in a very critical state. Two months before, the oldest
boy, who was some two years younger than Mysie, had been
taken suddenly ill, and had died after a few days' illness.</p>

<p>How was he to tell Mysie of this? How tell her that John
was dead, and her father perhaps dying? How tell of her
mother eating out her heart in the hungry longing for news
of the missing girl, and killing herself with work and worry?</p>

<p>&quot;Your faither's no' very weel, Mysie,&quot; he began evasively,
his eyes turned away from her, in an attempt at hiding what he
felt.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrang wi' him, Rob?&quot; she asked, the quick alarm
in her voice cutting his heart as she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;He hasna been workin' for fully a fortnicht,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>&quot;But what's wrang?&quot; she persisted. &quot;Is he ill?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie, I'd raither onything than be the means o' painin'
you, for you are no' in a fit state to be worried.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You maun tell me, Rob,&quot; she cried fiercely, her face showing
excitement. &quot;What is it that is wrang? Is he awfu' ill?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's lyin' gey bad, Mysie, an' when I cam' awa' this
mornin', I didna like the look o' him at a'. He was kind o'
wanderin' in his mind, an' speakin' to you an' John, jist as he
used to speak when we were a' bairns thegither. He was liltin'
some o' thae auld sangs he used to sing to us. But dinna
greet, Mysie, you'll mak' yoursel' waur. You are no very
strong, you ken, an' if you worry it'll mak' you waur. You
should raither try an' bear up, an' get strong, an' maybe gang
an' see him. He'd be awfu' prood to see you, an' so wad your
mither.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; she cried. &quot;I canna gang. It wad kill them to
see me noo, an' I couldna bear't, if they should be angry wi'
me. I couldna face their anger, Rob.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, Mysie,&quot; he said, drawing a long breath, as if to face
a stiff proposition, &quot;there is no other way out of it, but that
you'll hae to marry me now&mdash;just this minute, an' gang back
wi' me. If you do that, I can tak' you back wi' me, an' gang
to your faither an' say that it was me that was responsible.
It can be done, Mysie, if only you'll agree to it. Come,
Mysie!&quot; he cried in a burst of passionate pleading. &quot;I want
you. Mysie, Mysie! Say that you'll come.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert looked at her pale, thin, emaciated face with greedy
pleading in his eyes. He saw the thin-looking, hungry body as
it shook with her sobs, and that terrible cough, which seemed
as if it would carry her away before his eyes. &quot;Say you'll
come, Mysie!&quot; he pleaded, his hands held out appealingly.
&quot;Say you'll come, an' it'll be so easy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; she sobbed vehemently, &quot;I canna do that. Dinna
ask me ony mair, Rob, I canna do that. It wadna be fair.&quot;</p>

<p>A hopeless look came into his eyes as he listened to her
words, for he knew that Mysie could never consent to his proposal.
Frail as she was, and torn by her wish to agree, yet he
knew she meant it, when she said no.</p>

<p>&quot;Where do you live, Mysie?&quot; he enquired at last, thinking
to find some way of helping her. &quot;Wad you gie me your address,
so that I'll ken where you bide?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I dinna want to tell you, Rob. You'd better gang
awa' noo. Mrs. Ramsay will soon be comin' for me. Gang
awa' an' leave me. I want to be a wee while by mysel'. Oh,
dear! Oh, dear! I wish I could dee an' leave it a'!&quot;</p>

<p>Robert stole away on tiptoe, as if he were afraid longer to
intrude upon her grief&mdash;his mind in a whirl, and his heart
heavy with sorrow. He returned to the Conference to find
that the debate was in full swing, and that Davie Donaldson,
was laying about him in vigorous style, denouncing the leaders
for recommending the terms to the men, and telling them that
the &quot;wee chocolate-moothed Chancellor had again diddled
them.&quot;</p>

<p>But he felt no interest in Davie's denunciation, and could
not smile at his picturesque language. His mind would revert
to the gardens in Princes Street, and he saw the thin white
figure on the seat, the picture of hopeless misery, her frail
form torn with sobs; and heard the wail in her voice as she
moaned, &quot;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I wish I could dee an' leave
it a'!&quot;</p>

<p>Some of the young delegates wondered why Sinclair remained
silent in such an important debate. They had succeeded
in raising a question which at any other time would
have brought him to his feet; but he sat impassive and silent,
and above all the clash and glamor, above the applause and the
interruptions, above all the witty sallies which brought unexpected
laughter, he saw only the thin, white lonely figure&mdash;the
dejected and outcast, the poor plaything of fate, and heard
the heart-breaking cry, &quot;Oh, dear! I wish I could dee an'
leave it a'!&quot; and in every syllable there was a stab of pain.</p>

<p>The Conference ended, and the delegates made homeward.
The terms had been agreed to, so far as Scotland was concerned,
and all pointed to peace.</p>

<p>&quot;You didna speak the day, Sinclair, and I fairly thocht you
wad hae been into the fecht,&quot; said one delegate to Robert, as
the train moved away from the station.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I wasna feelin' up to the mark,&quot; he returned, in a
tone that hinted that he did not want to be troubled, and he
sat back in his corner in silence. In the gray quick gloaming
the moors and the hills, viewed from the train, seemed to him a
country without hope. There was sadness in it, and pain, and
the gray wintry sky brooded of sorrows to come.</p>

<p>Occasionally a few sheep would start away from where they
had been grazing close to the railway, startled by the noise of
the train. Thin wisps of gray ragged clouds hung low, as if
softly descending upon the hills, in fateful sinister storms, and
a fiery flash of yellow left a strip of anger on the western horizon,
where the sun had gone down a short time ago.</p>

<p>Gray mists and grayer moors, with occasionally a solitary
tree standing out in the distance, as if to accentuate the loneliness
and the sorrow of the world in their ragged branches,
which seemed ready to pierce the sky in defiance of the anger
of the, as yet, unleashed storm.</p>

<p>On rushed the train, and through the mists there kept coming
before his eyes the white lonely figure, moaning in fatal
grief&mdash;grief inexorable and unrelenting, while the flying wheels
groaned and sobbed and clicked, with the regular beat of a
breaking heart, as if they were beating out the sorrows of the
world, and over all they sang the dirge of the broken life of
a maid. &quot;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I wish I could dee an' leave
it a'!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h2>MYSIE'S RETURN</h2>


<p>When Mrs. Ramsay returned she found Mysie in a
fainting condition, thoroughly exhausted, and on the
point of collapse. Mrs. Ramsay saw, by her red swollen
eyes, that she had been weeping. With the help of her
daughter the kind woman, who had done so much for Mysie
during the past few months, got her to the street, and procuring
a cab, got her back to the house, much alarmed by the
patient's condition.</p>

<p>All night Mysie tossed and raved in a high fever and delirium,
while Mrs. Ramsay sat by her bedside, trying to soothe
and quieten the stricken girl. As she seemed to get no better
the older woman grew more alarmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my puir faither!&quot; moaned the girl. &quot;Oh, mither, I
am vexed at what has happened. Oh, dear, I wonder what I'll
do!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There now, dearie!&quot; said Mrs. Ramsay in warm sympathetic
tones, as she stroked the burning hands and brow. &quot;Try
and quieten down and go to sleep. You were getting on very
well, you know, and making fine progress, but you'll make
yourself worse than ever if you carry on like that. There now,
dearie! Try and get to sleep, and you'll soon be better again!&quot;</p>

<p>But Mysie was silent only for a moment, and the low
moan soon broke from her lips again, like the wail of some
stricken thing at night upon the moor, and still she tossed
and tumbled feverishly in her bed.</p>

<p>In the morning the doctor came and shook his head. Mysie
was ill, very ill. Her condition was serious, and it was little
he could do. Only care and good nursing and try to keep
her from worrying. He left a prescription, and Peter soon
had the necessary medicine, and later the patient grew calmer,
and finally sank into a deep sleep; and so the old fight had
to be fought over again, to get her strength restored and her
vitality increased.</p>

<p>Mysie did not mention another word of home. She lay
quiet, hardly even moving and seldom speaking; but the burning
fire that consumed her was apparent in her hectic cheeks
and glowing eyes, and one could see that her mind was away,
never dwelling upon her surroundings, but was wandering
among the heather hills and quiet valleys, where the call of the
curlew and the shout of the lapwing stir the primitive impulses
of those who love the haunts of the moorland life, and weave
so much romance into the lives and souls of the country bred
people, who never grow to love the ugly towns, but whose
hearts remain with their first love&mdash;the moors, and the hills,
and the mountain brooks for ever.</p>

<p>She seemed to grow a little stronger as the days passed.
She took her medicines regularly and without protest; but
deep down in her heart she felt that she would never get
better, and her only desire, that had been shaping itself ever
since Robert had told her of her father's condition, was to be
strong enough, to go home to Lowwood, just to see her parents,
her brothers and sisters, once more; then she could die in
peace. If only she could do that, she would not care what
happened. Nothing else mattered; but she must get home.
Nothing would prevent her from doing that.</p>

<p>It was the instinct of the wounded animal, dragging itself
home to die&mdash;home to its home in the kindly earth, away
from contact with other things&mdash;just to be alone, to nurse its
suffering and its misery, till the last shred of strength had
gone, and the limbs stiffened out, while the glazing eyes looked
forward as the pain increased, across the barriers of other
worlds to a land of plenty&mdash;a land of green shrubs, and sweet
waters bubbling from scented hillsides, overhung with blue
skies which never brewed storms. A land of bud and bloom
and blossom, scented and sweet, with every desirable weed
and tasty herb&mdash;a land of life full and beautiful, of warm
suns, calling up dreams from a blossoming mist of bluebells,
creating the freshness and the happiness of youthfulness in
every living thing. A land where far vistas and wide horizons,
bounded by green hills, brought visions from the inner
self, with joyous abundance through lusty life, and glorious
passionate being&mdash;a land sweet and fruitful, and never-ending
in its beauty and its means of happiness!</p>

<p>Slowly the days passed, and her strength gradually increased
little by little, until a month had gone past, and she was able
to be about the house again; but this determination in her
heart to go home grew stronger with every day that passed,
and it seemed to give her strength and vitality, and her hope
became more definite and more sure.</p>

<p>She pictured her home again, as she had known it; the
little kitchen, with its white scrubbed floor and a few newspapers
spread over its newly washed surface to keep it clean
from muddy feet; the white-washed jambs of the fireside,
and the grate polished with blacklead; the clear-topped fender,
with its inscription done in brass in the center, &quot;Oor ain fireside&quot;;
the half-dozen strong sturdy, well-washed chairs; the
whitewood dresser, with its array of dog ornaments and cheap
vases, and white crocheted cover; and the curtains over the
two beds in the kitchen. All these things she loved to think
about, and she saw them pictured in her mind as real as
they'd ever been to her when her own life was centered in
them, and her fancy took delight in these secret joys. It was
her home she saw always, the humble &quot;but and ben&quot; with the
primitive conditions of life, the crude amenities, the sweet joys
of simple unaffected people; but it was her home.</p>

<p>One day, Mrs. Ramsay had gone out on an errand that
detained her some time, Mysie seized suddenly again in a more
intense form by her desire to go home, feverishly dressed herself,
and hastily scribbling a note of thanks to her good friend
and nurse, she stole out on to the street, a poor, forlorn, weak
girl, but thoroughly determined to go home to where her
heart called her.</p>

<p>Out upon the street, she grew frightened. She did not
know anything about the city, nor in which direction to turn.
She had no idea how far it was to the station. She was helpless
and alone, and very much excited.</p>

<p>A boy passed her, whistling as she had often heard her
own brothers whistling, and hastily calling to him she accosted
him thus:</p>

<p>&quot;Could you tell me hoo far it is to the station?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whit station?&quot; asked the boy, and she suddenly remembered
it was Princes Street, and mentioned it. &quot;Oh, ay; it's
no' faur,&quot; he said airily, as he pointed in the direction of it.
&quot;Jist gang alang that way,&quot; and he turned away as if to leave
her.</p>

<p>&quot;Wad you tak' me to it, an' I'll gie you a shillin'?&quot; she
asked, and he eagerly turned at once to close the bargain.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ay,&quot; he agreed, &quot;I'll soon tak' you there,&quot; and the
two set off; and guided by the boy, whose knowledge of the
city seemed to her wonderful in one so young, they arrived
at the station, with Mysie very tired and half-fainting with
excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;Hae you a ticket?&quot; asked the boy, judging from her appearance
that she needed to be reminded of such things.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I forgot I hadna got yin,&quot; replied Mysie. &quot;I wonder
where I'll hae to gang to get yin. Hoo much will it be, think
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I dinna ken,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Come alang here to the
bookin' office, an' ask a ticket for the place you want to
gang to, an' the clerk will soon tell you the price o't.&quot;</p>

<p>Luckily Mysie had a few pounds in a purse which Peter
had given her some time ago, in case she might want to go
out, he said, and buy something she might want. Going to
the booking office, and guided by her little friend, she timorously
made known her wants, and a ticket was given her;
and she returned under her youthful escort, who enquired the
time of the trains leaving of a porter, and conducted her to
the platform, and helped her into the train, which soon started
off on the homeward journey.</p>

<p>&quot;Thenk you,&quot; said the boy, his eyes glowing with pleasure
at the two shining half-crowns which Mysie had given him,
and he waved his hand to her as the train steamed out of the
platform.</p>

<p>&quot;Going home, going home,&quot; sang the wheels as the train
rushed along. &quot;Going home,&quot; with every beat of her heart
they answered her with their cheery monotone. &quot;Going home,&quot;
they gurgled, as they freely ran down the gradients. &quot;Going
home, going home,&quot; as they ran along the flat moor. &quot;Going
home, going home,&quot; they panted up the inclines, but still joyous
in the thought of getting there.</p>

<p>Home, aye, home, they were taking her. Home to the
cheery fireside, with the homely fare and the warm hearts!
To the cosy corner by the fender at her father's feet, to the
music of her mother's clicking needles as she knitted; to the
sweet comfort of the love and kindness of brothers and sisters;
to the warmth of glowing smiles and loving hearts. Home!
Home! Oh, God! Comfort of weary and battered humanity,
dragging its wounded and broken life to the shelter and the
sanctity of love. So rose her hopes, and her heart sang as
the brooding night lowered and the wind rose, bringing the
rain lashing from the spring clouds to burnish the moor with
storms. Home to the hearts that loved her first, and would
love her to the end.</p>

<p>At last the train steamed into the little station from which
she had first gone to the great city, and everything looked
just the same as upon that night, when she had stolen across
the moor to run away where she expected to hide her shame,
and try and redeem that one mistaken impulse, which had
been so thoughtlessly indulged, and so terribly paid for in
suffering and tears. The station-master looked at her keenly
as she passed. She seemed so frail and weak looking to be
abroad in such a night; but she passed on and out upon the
country road that ran across the moor, where the darkness
always lay thickest, and where the terrors of the timid were
greatest, and the storms raged fiercest.</p>

<p>On she battled, already feeling weak and tired; but always
the thought of home waiting for her impelled her onward.
Home was waiting over there&mdash;waiting just two miles off,
where she could see the twinkling of the lights from the pithead
at which she had worked, and where she had been so
happy at the dreams conjured by six and sixpence per week.
Down rushed the wind from the hills, careering along the wide
moor, driving the rain and hail in front, as if he would burst
the barriers of the world and go free.</p>

<p>She halted and turned her back upon the blows, as if she
would fall; but there were light and warmth, and love and
cheerfulness over there, if only she could hold out till she
reached them.</p>

<p>She turned again, and a sheep scampered across the moorland
path just in front, and the soft bleat of an early lamb
soothed the quick excited leap in her heart. The rain ceased,
and a pale glitter of the rim of a moon, like the paring of a
giant's nail in the sky, glinted from behind the dark cloud,
and flung a silver radiance over the bog-pools around,
which glittered like patches of fairy silver upon a land of
romance.</p>

<p>She was wet, but not cold. The fever in her blood raged
and she staggered forward again, slowly and tottering. A
smile was playing about her lips and eyes. Her lips were
parted, and her breast rose and fell like the heaving beat of
an engine. But home beckoned and lured her onward, and
the hope of a long dream filled her soul. Again a sharp scurry
in front drove her heart to her mouth, as two hares battled
and tore at each other for the love of the female which sat
close by, watching the contest.</p>

<p>The sharp swish of the wings of lapwings, as they dived
towards her, filling the moors with their hard rasping double
note, and also battling for possession of a mate, stirred her
frightened blood; and at every step some new terror thrilled
her, and kept her continually in a state of fear.</p>

<p>Still she plodded on, and another squall of rain and hail
followed, giving place soon to the glory of the cold moon, and
again obscuring it in a quick succession of showers and calm
moonshine. But there was home in front, and she was always
drawing nearer. Just a little while now, a few hundred yards
or so, and she would be there.</p>

<p>Weak and exhausted, stumbling and rising again, driven
by that unrelenting, irresistible desire, this poor waif of humanity,
impelled by sheer force of will, staggered and crawled
towards its hope, forward to its dream, and at last stood by
the window of the home it had sought.</p>

<p>Panting and utterly worn out, she stood holding on to the
window ledge, her will now weakened, her strength of mind
gone, and her desire forsaking her now that she was there.</p>

<p>The wind fell to a mere whisper, and she stooped to look in
at a chink in the shutter, the tears running in hot, scalding
streams from her eyes and blinding her vision. The soft
stirring of little limbs beneath her heart brought back the
old desire to hide herself from everyone she had known.</p>

<p>Oh, God! It was terrible thus to be torn; for she had sung
the song of all motherhood in her own simple way&mdash;the song
of the love that recreates the world. The same song that
enables motherhood to commune with God. &quot;I will walk in
the pure air of the uplands, so that your life shall be sweet
and clean. I shall bathe my body in the sweet waters of the
earth, so that you shall be pure; I shall walk in meditation
and solitude, so that your thoughts shall be worthy thoughts;
I shall dwell on the hillsides, so that your mind shall be lofty;
I shall love all living things, so that you shall be godly in the
love of your kind; I shall be humble, so that you shall not be
proud; I shall be tender, wandering among the sweet flowers,
so that you shall never be rough or unkindly; I shall serve,
so that you shall be kingly in your service to others.</p>

<p>&quot;Down in the valleys I shall linger, drinking in the music
of sweet streams; and the songs of the morning and the eventide
shall make you gentle and happy. The tender grass shall
be my couch upon the moor, so that you can know the restfulness
and comfort of love. The grateful trees shall shade me
from the fierce heat of the sun, so that you shall be restful,
yet active in kind deeds. Oh, I shall clothe me in the sweetest
thoughts, and sing the sweetest songs, speak the kindliest
words, and do the friendliest deeds&mdash;I shall lie down in gratitude
for all that has ever been rendered to me, and shall keep
faith with love, so that you&mdash;you who are me, you who are
my heart and mind, my body and soul shall be ushered into
the world as a savior of the race; and the lyrics of the dawn
and the dayfall, of the golden, glorious day, and the silver
radiant night, shall all be thine to interpret, in spirit and in
word and service.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus had motherhood sung in all ages, weaving the dreams
of hope about the soul which she had called from eternity,
after having gone upon that long perilous journey into the
land of Everywhere to bring back a new life to the world.
Mysie dashed the warm tears from her eyes, and looked again
through the chink in the shutter.</p>

<p>She had a full view of the kitchen. It was the same cosy,
bright place it had always been, when she had sat there on
the corner of the fender o' nights, her head against her father's
knee, as he read out the news from the evening paper, while
her mother sewed, or darned, or knitted.</p>

<p>Her father sat in the easy chair, pale and thin and weak.
He looked ill, and it seemed as if he were merely out of his
bed, so that her mother might change the linen, for she was
busy pulling off pillow-cases and putting clean ones on, and
turning the chaff-filled tick to make it easier for his poor bones
to lie on.</p>

<p>He lay back in his chair, his eyes half closed, as if tired.</p>

<p>&quot;The wind has surely gane doon noo,&quot; Mysie heard her
mother observe, as she spread out the clean white sheet upon
the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it seems to hae quietened,&quot; returned Matthew weakly.
&quot;It has been an awfu' nicht, and gey wild.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, it has that. Peety ony puir body that has been oot in
it,&quot; said her mother, with a deep sigh, as she folded back
the blankets. &quot;It's an awfu' nicht for the homeless to be oot
in.&quot;</p>

<p>Silence reigned for a short time, and only the whisper of
the wind outside prevented the sobs of the poor waif at the
window being heard.</p>

<p>&quot;You are lookin' a wee better the nicht, Matthew,&quot; said
Mrs. Maitland after a long thoughtful pause, as she drew in
her chair beside his.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, I'm feelin' no' sae bad,&quot; he answered feebly. Then,
as if having made up his mind about something, he went on,
as he looked into the glowing fire, &quot;Do you ken, wife, I
hae been thinkin' a lot aboot oor Mysie a' day. I wonder
what'll be the cause o't? But a' day she has been in my
mind, an' I only hope naething has come to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dinna ken, Matthew,&quot; she said; for this was the first
time he had spoken about their missing daughter since the
day they had learned of her disappearance. He had always
remained silent when she had given expression to her thoughts
regarding Mysie; but thinking this an encouragement, she
spoke about her, and he too, in a way that made her wonder;
for he was never talkative at any time, and it seemed as if
his heart was hungering to talk of their bairn.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what wad hae come owre her, that nae spierin's
o' her could be got. Puir Mysie! I liket that wean, wife&mdash;liket
her maybe owre weel; an' my heart has been sair for
her mony a time, wonderin' what has come o' her!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Maitland lifted a corner of her rough apron and wiped
her eyes, as she cried softly at hearing her husband thus speak
of their missing daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think she'll be living, Matthew?&quot; she asked looking
through her tears at her husband anxiously.</p>

<p>&quot;That's hard to say, wife,&quot; he replied, a break in his voice.
&quot;Sometimes I think she maun be deid, or she wad hae come
back to us in some way. I think we liket her weel enough,
an' she kent it, and she was ay a guid lassie at a' times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, she was,&quot; replied the mother, &quot;a guid bairn, an' a clever
yin aboot the hoose; an' I never had an angry word frae her
a' my days. Oh, Matthew,&quot; she cried out, again bursting into
tears, and sobbing pitifully, &quot;what is't we hae done to be
tried like this? Mysie gane, an' guid kens where she is, an'
John ta'en awa' jist when oor battle was beginnin' to get
easier. Noo you hae been laid aside yoursel', an' God kens
hoo we are to do, for hinna a penny left in the hoose! Oh,
dear, but it's a hard lot we hae to suffer!&quot; and she sobbed in
silence, while her husband stroked her pale, thin, toil-worn
hands that hid her weeping eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Wheesht, lassie!&quot; he said brokenly. &quot;Dinna you break
doon noo, for you hae been the mainstay o' us a', when we
wad hae lost heart often. I used to think that oor lot couldna
be harder, when the bairns were a' wee, an' we were struggling
frae haun' to mooth, to see them fed an' cled. But wi' a'
the hardships, thae days were happy. We were baith young,
an' I was aye fairly healthy an' when we locked the door
at nicht, we were satisfied that a' that belanged to us were
inside, an' in safety, even though their wee stomachs maybe
werena' ower fu'. But noo we canna do that, wife. Some hae
gane to where want an' poverty canna hurt them, an' that is
a consolation; but where will oor lassie be, that never gi'ed
us a wrang word a' her days? Is she in want this nicht,
the same as we are oorsels? Will she be hungry an' homeless,
ill clad, an' oot in the storm? If she is, then God peety
her. If only we had her aside us, hunger wad be easier tholed
for us a',&quot; and Matthew, unable to control himself longer,
completely broke down and wept, mingling his tears with those
of his wife, because of their misery and poverty and suffering.</p>

<p>The girl outside could hardly restrain herself at thus hearing
her parents speak. She sobbed and held on to the
window ledge, her eyes fixed greedily upon the open chink in
the shutter, listening to, and looking at her parents in their
misery, as they sat and talked so kindly and anxiously about
her&mdash;talked so that every word was a stab at her heart; for
she had never heard them open their hearts like this before.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, wife,&quot; he said after a time, &quot;it was a sair blow to
me. I could hae fain dee'd at the time; I was fair heartbroken.
It's a gey queer world that brings the keenest pangs
frae them that yin likes best. I could hae dee'd gladly to
hae saved that bairn frae the slightest hurt!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Matthew,&quot; said the mother, speaking with all her soul in
her eyes, as she looked at him, &quot;if by ony chance it should
turn oot that Mysie gaed wrang an' fell into disgrace, wad
ye tak' her back, if she should come hame again?&quot; and there
was a world of pleading in the mother's voice as she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Tak' her back! Oh, God, I'd dae onything to hae her
here at this meenit, nae matter though it should be proved
that she was guilty o' the warst sin under the sun. Tak' her
back! Oh, wife! my heart is breakin' for her!&quot; and he lifted
his thin worn hand to his eyes and sobbed in his grief.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, Matthew,&quot; returned the wife, &quot;if ever she does come
back, nae matter when it may be, or hoo it may be, I'm glad
you'll no be harsh wi' her. You'll just speak to her as if
naething had happened; for I ken she'll be mair feart to face
you than onybody else. Jist try an' mak' her believe, when
you speak, that she had gane awa' to the store a message, or
to the well for watter, an' that she had bidden owre lang, as
she an' ither weans used to do when they got started the
play, an' forget to come hame. Jist speak to her that way,
Matthew, an' the hame-comin', if ever it comes, will no' be
sae hard for the puir bairn. For God knows, it micht be hard
enough for her!&quot;</p>

<p>The girl outside, listening eagerly to every word, tried to
cry out with the pain of all this talk by her parents, but
her tongue clove to her parched mouth, and her lips were stiff
and dry.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll never be harsh wi' a bairn o' mine, wife,&quot; he replied
brokenly. &quot;I liket Mysie owre weel ever to be harsh wi' her.
Oh, if only I could see her afore me this nicht, I wad gie a'
I ever had in the world. To hae her sittin' here, as she used
to sit, her wee heid wi' its soft hair against my knee, an' my
haun clappin' it, an' her bonnie een lookin' up at me, as if
I was something she aye looket up to, as bein' better than ony
living being she ever kenned, wad be mair pleasure for me
this minute than if I got a' the money in the world. I'd swap
heaven and my chances o' salvation, wife, jist to hae her sittin'
here on the fender, as she used to sit. Hunger an' a' the rest
wad be easy borne for that.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a soft rustling sound at the window as he spoke,
and a slow step was heard, which seemed to drag along towards
the door, then a fumbling at the sneck, the handle lifted, and
the door opened slowly inwards, as if reluctant to reveal its
secret.</p>

<p>It was a tense poignant moment for all; for both the father
and mother, weak as the former was, rose to their feet expectantly,
their eyes searching the slowly opening door, as a thin
pale draggled figure entered and staggered forward with a
low pitiful cry of &quot;Faither! Mother! I've come hame!&quot; and
tottering forward, fell at Matthew's feet, clasping his knees
with the thin fragile hands, while the tears of a heart-breaking
sorrow flowed from the appealing eyes, upturned to the
amazed parents.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie! Mysie!&quot; he sobbed, clasping her to his thin worn
knees, and kissing the bent head, as she sobbed and cried.
&quot;Oh, Mysie! Mysie! but you hae been a lang time at the
store!&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h2>HOME</h2>


<p>&quot;Oh my puir wean! My bonnie bairn!&quot; crooned Mrs.
Maitland, as she bent over the figure of her daughter
who, clinging to Matthew's knees, was looking up into
his face, as he lay back in his chair where he had fallen, when
Mysie fell at his feet. &quot;Oh, my puir lamb, you're wet to the
skin, an' fair done; for God knows its an' awfu' mess you
hae cam' hame in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Puir thing,&quot; she wailed and crooned, again breaking out
after having kissed and fondled Mysie's wet face. &quot;We hae
lang hungered for you&mdash;hungered for you for a gey lang time,
an' noo you hae cam' hame, near to daith's door. But we'll
nurse you back. We'll mak' you strong and healthy again.
Oh, Mysie, my puir lassie. What ails you? Where hae you
been? What has happened to you a' this time? But what am
I thinking aboot,&quot; she broke off, &quot;sitting here, when I should
be gettin' some dry claes for you, an' a bed ready.&quot;</p>

<p>She rose and began to busy herself shaking up a bed and
diving into drawers, bringing clean clothes forth and hanging
them over a piece of rope which stretched across the fireplace,
so as to air and heat them, the tears streaming from her eyes
and occasionally a low moan breaking from her as if forced
by some inward pain; while Matthew, nearly overcome with
excitement, could only lie back in his chair, his eyes closed and
his hands stroking tenderly the wet young head that lay
against his knee.</p>

<p>&quot;Faither,&quot; murmured Mysie, brokenly and weakly, &quot;oh,
faither, I've come back. Jist let me lie here near you. I
jist want you to clap my held, to lean against you, an' gang
to sleep. Are you angry wi' me, faither? Are you&mdash;&quot; and
Mysie's eyes closed in a faint, as she lay limp against his knee.</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and Mrs. Sinclair came in. She
always came in, after she had got everyone in the house
to bed, to see how Matthew felt. It was her first errand in
the morning and her last before retiring at night. She was
generally the last visitor, and the door was always locked
and barred when she went away.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Nellie, come awa' in,&quot; said Matthew. &quot;You're a God's
send this nicht. I'm glad to see you. Mysie's jist cam' back,
an' she has fented. Gie's a bit haun' wi' her to get her into
bed. Puir thing. She's fair done up,&quot; and Matthew tried to
raise up the prostrate figure of his bairn; but sank back too
weak, and too overcome to do anything.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna you trouble yourself, Matthew,&quot; said Mrs. Sinclair,
gathering the prostrate girl in her arms and raising her up
on her knee like a child. &quot;Bring some dry claes. Jenny, an'
get some warm watter bottles in the bed. Puir thing, she's
in an awfu' state. She's a' tremblin' an' maun hae been awfu'
ill,&quot; and she worked with and stripped the wet clothes from
the girl and soon had her in bed, but in spite of all her efforts
Mysie remained unconscious. She then left to get the doctor
summoned, leaving the sorrowing parents to look after the girl
till she returned.</p>

<p>When she did come back, Matthew was in bed and his condition
very much worse. The excitement had been too much
for him in his weakened state and he lay exhausted, crying
like a child.</p>

<p>Soon the doctor came and did all in his power. At the end
of an hour Mysie's eyes opened and she looked about her.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's my faither?&quot; she asked weakly. &quot;Oh, I'm gled
I'm hame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's in bed,&quot; answered Mrs. Sinclair. &quot;An' you're no' to
talk the nicht, Mysie. Jist lie still, like a good lass, an' drink
this, an' in the mornin' you'll may be a bit better.&quot; And
Mysie drank, and with a sigh of happy contentment, she
turned her face to the wall, glad she was now at home&mdash;home
with her wounded spirit and broken life.</p>

<p>The soft easy chaff bed gave her more of rest and satisfaction
than if it had been eiderdown. She traced as of old
the roses upon the cheap paper with which the box bed was
papered, and which had been her mother's pride when it was
put on. Mysie watched the twining and intertwining of the
roses, as they reached upward toward the ceiling through a
maze of woodbine and red carnations, and noted that the curtains
upon the bed were the same as they were when she had
last slept there.</p>

<p>The old wag-at-the-wa' clock which had belonged to her
grandfather, wheezed wearily from the corner and the shrill
eerie call of a courting cat outside broke familiarly upon her
ear. Thus surrounded by the sights and sounds of old, a glad
contentment in her heart, she soon dozed off into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Sinclair went home just as midnight was striking
she found Robert sitting by the fire wondering at her
absence. He had just returned from a meeting at a neighboring
village, and finding his brothers and sisters all in bed
and his mother not in the house with his tea ready for him as
usual, he wondered what was the matter.</p>

<p>&quot;I was owre at Matthew's,&quot; she replied in answer to the
question she knew he was going to ask.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he waur the nicht?&quot; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, it's no' him, although he's gey upset too; but Mysie
has cam' hame the nicht, an' puir lassie she is in an awfu'
state,&quot; and she was quick to note the soft blanching of his
cheek as she spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie hame,&quot; he echoed with quick interest.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, puir lassie; but I doot if I'm no' cheated that Mysie'll
no' be lang anywhere. The doctor says she's to be keepit
quate; for she's gey low. In fact he felt me at the door that
he dinna think she could last a week.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert sat a long time looking into the fire, while his
mother got ready his tea, and described to him all that she
knew of Mysie's return and of her sad condition.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd hardly ken her,&quot; she went on. &quot;She's that thin
and white and faur gane lookin', forby havin' a boast that
wad fricht you. Puir lassie, I was vexed for her an' Matthew
too is gey upset aboot it. Dae you ken, Rob, I believe they
mun be gey hard gruppit. Wi' Matthew being off work, and
John deein' an' a' the ither troubles they had this while, I
think they canna be ower weel off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he said, &quot;they canna be ower weel off; for they hae
had a lot to dae this while. You micht look to them, mither.
We are no sae ill off noo, an' we can afford tae help them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weel, Rob, I've been aye givin' them a bit hand, buying
beef for soup an' that' an' daein' a' I could. But I'm awfu'
puttin' aboot ower puir Mysie. She's gey faur gane, an'
wherever she has been she's been haein a bad time of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw her at Edinburgh,&quot; he said quietly, as she paused
to pour out the tea.</p>

<p>&quot;In Edinburgh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he replied. &quot;Last month when I was at the conference,&quot;
and Robert told his mother the whole story of his
meeting with Mysie and of her disappearance and all that
had happened to her from the time she had gone away.</p>

<p>&quot;But you never telt yin o' us, Rob,&quot; she said after he had
come to the end of the story.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I never telt ony o' you; for Mysie made me promise
no' to tell; an' forby she wadna' gi'e me her address. But
I was that upset that day that I couldn't collect mysel' an' I
minded o' a lot o' things I should hae done an' said after I
left her. It was terrible,&quot; and he relapsed into silence again,
as he went on with his supper.</p>

<p>His mother saw all the pain in his heart that night, though
neither spoke much of the state of his feelings for Mysie;
but it was evident to her who saw all the cross currents of fate,
perhaps more clearly than Robert knew.</p>

<p>She looked at him with furtive pride. There was no showy
parading of what he felt, but only the set of the mouth was
a little firmer perhaps than usual and the eyes a little softer
and glistening. That was all.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Robin,&quot; she said brokenly, unable to hide her pride
and weakness. &quot;I ken a' that you hinna telt me. I guessed
it years syne; but I'm sure noo. An' I'm awfu' vexed, laddie;
ay, I'm awfu' vexed,&quot; and with that he withdrew to his room,
more touched with her simple words of sympathy than anything
she had ever said to him in all her previous life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair went to bed, but she knew her laddie had
not done so. She heard him in his room and knew that in
the silence of the night and in the privacy and secrecy of his
own room he was fighting out his battle with fate, and she
knew that no one could help him&mdash;that only the fiber of his
own soul could help him through.</p>

<p>In the morning he rose early and went for a walk, for it
was Sunday. Returning, he found his mother with the latest
news of Mysie's condition. She waited until the other members
of the house had gone out, and then with a sigh observed
very quietly but with a world of tender sympathy in her voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Mysie's sinkin' fast, Robin. I think you should gang ower
and see her. She canna' last very lang, puir thing, an' she
was askin' aboot you when I was ower. I think she wad like
to see you. You'll gang ower and see her, Rob,&quot; she entreated,
a sob in her throat as she spoke. &quot;She'll be awfu'
pleased to see you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, I'll gang ower, mither,&quot; he replied simply. &quot;I'll gang
ower efter a wee while.&quot;</p>

<p>But it was drawing near to the darkness when he managed
to summon sufficient resolution to face the ordeal.</p>

<p>Mysie was lying in the room and he went in to see her&mdash;her
whom he would have given his own life to restore to activity
and health again. A low moan occasionally escaped
her as she panted and battled for breath and the color came
and faded from her cheeks in quick fleeting waves.</p>

<p>Oh God! Was this Mysie&mdash;this faint apparition of the girl
whom he had loved? Even in the short month when he had
seen her in Edinburgh a very great change had been wrought
upon her. The eyes, softly glowing with a quiet radiance as
they rested upon his face, were sunk, and the voice faint and
weak. A thin white hand lay upon the coverlet and the great
waves of brown hair which had been his pride, were tumbled
about the thin face framing it in a tangled oak brown frame
of deepest beauty.</p>

<p>She lifted her hand as he approached, a sweet smile breaking
through her pain, caught him in radiance of love. &quot;I'm
glad you've come, Rob,&quot; she panted. &quot;I jist wanted to see
you again&mdash;an'&mdash;an' tak' good-by wi' you,&quot; and the quick
catch in her words gripped his heart as he knelt beside the bed,
taking the thin hand between his while the tears started from
his eyes and fell upon the white bed cover.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mysie,&quot; he said brokenly. His voice refused to go
further and he bent his head upon the bed, trying hard to control
himself and keep from breaking down before her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm awfu' vexed, Rob,&quot; she said, after a while. &quot;It was
a' a mistak' an' naebody's to blame. I ought to hae kent
better mysel',&quot; and she paused again for breath. &quot;I&mdash;I should
hae kent better, that nae guid could come&mdash;oot o' it&mdash;I was
just carried awa'. Dinna ever blame lasses&mdash;nor men either,
when things happen. They&mdash;they canna help themsel's&mdash;&quot;
and here again she paused for breath, gasping and fighting at
every word.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a' a mistake, Rob, an' I think it's a' in the way folk
look at thae things.&quot; Another pause, while her chest heaved
and panted. &quot;Maybe we dinna look at thae things richt,&quot;
she again resumed. &quot;We&mdash;we mak' mistak's and canna help
oorsel's; but God dinna mean it as&mdash;as a mistak'. It's a' because
we think it is. Everything's richt&mdash;but we mak' them
wrang in the way we look at them. It wad hae&mdash;been a' richt&mdash;in
oor mind, if I had been married afore&mdash;afore it happened&mdash;but
because we werena married&mdash;it was wrang. It's a' a
mistak' Rob, a' a&mdash;&quot; and a burst of coughing nearly choked
her and a flood of blood began to gurgle in her mouth.</p>

<p>Robert grew alarmed and lifting a cloth began to wipe the
blood from her mouth, looking on her so concerned and anxious
that she tried to smile to him to reassure him.</p>

<p>Presently she lay back with eyes closed and her hand limp
in his. A wild fear took possession of him as he looked upon
the scarcely moving breast, a fear which seemed to communicate
itself to the sufferer, and she opened her eyes again, but
the voice was weak and very far away.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna be angry wi' onybody, Rob. It was you I liket, it
was you I wanted&mdash;but it was a' a mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm no' angry, Mysie,&quot; he said stifling his sobs, his tears
falling upon the white thin face. &quot;Oh, Mysie, I'm only vexed.
I'm only vexed aboot the hale sad business. There now,
dearie,&quot; he said bending low over her and kissing and stroking
the pallid brow and caressing the face so dear to him. &quot;There
noo, I'm no' angry. You're mine, Mysie. You've always
been mine, an' I'm no' angry. But oh, I love you, Mysie,
an' it's breaking my heart to part frae you. Oh, God!&quot; he
groaned in agony. &quot;What does it a' mean? I canna' bear
it,&mdash;I canna' bear't,&quot; and a wild burst of grief swept over him
as he flung his head and arms upon the bed in a vain attempt
to control his sobbing sorrow.</p>

<p>A long pause&mdash;then the white hand was raised and crept
slowly over his shoulder, working its way among the thick
shaggy hair of his head as the fingers strayed from curl to
curl, patting him and soothing him as a child is soothed by
a mother's hand. It rested upon his bent head and the eyes
opened again.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, Rob, I'm vexed for your sake&mdash;but it was a' a mistake.&quot;
She went on halting and very weak. &quot;It was a' a
mistak'&mdash;an' naebody is to blame. We are just&mdash;driven alang,
an'&mdash;we canna help oorsel's&mdash;it's awfu' to hae&mdash;sic feelin's&mdash;an'&mdash;an'
no' hae any poo'er&mdash;to guide them richt&mdash;it's ay
the things we want maist&mdash;that we dinna get. Kiss me, Rob&mdash;kiss
me, as you kissed me&mdash;yon&mdash;nicht on the muir. Haud
me like you&mdash;an' I think I can&mdash;gang content. Oh, Rob,&mdash;ay
liket you&mdash;it was you I wanted a' the time!&quot;</p>

<p>He clasped her tenderly in his arms as he kissed her mouth,
her eyes, her brow, her hair, stroking her and fondling the
dear face, catching hungrily the smile that came to the pale
lips, and lingered there like a blink of sun upon a hillside
after the rest of the landscape is clothed in shadow.</p>

<p>Again there was a pause while he searched the pale face
with the lingering smile, noting the veined, almost discolored
eyelids, transparent and closed over the tired suffering eyes.
Then a burst of coughing again and the blood in thick clots
gurgled up from the throat. Then after a little she spoke
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Rob, you hae made me very happy. But I'm vexed
aboot you&mdash;an'&mdash;an' Peter. He tried to dae what was richt;
but it wasna to be&mdash;I hope you'll&mdash;no'&mdash;be angry wi' him. He
was like me&mdash;he couldna' help it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mysie, I'm no' angry wi' him,&quot; he replied brokenly,
trying hard to make his voice sound dearly. &quot;I'm no' angry
wi' onybody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad o' that, Rob,&quot; she said, her hand caressing his
head. &quot;You was ay a guid hearted laddie&mdash;I'm awfu' glad.&quot;
Then her mind began to wander and she was back in Edinburgh
speaking of her father and John.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, faither,&quot; she rambled on. &quot;Dinna be angry wi' me.
There's naebody to blame. Dinna be angry.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Robert was conscious that others were in the room,
and looking up he beheld his mother and Jenny Maitland and
behind them with anxious face and frightened eyes stood Peter
Rundell, the picture of misery and despair.</p>

<p>&quot;She's kind o' wanderin', puir thing,&quot; he heard the mother
say in explanation to the others. &quot;She's kind o' wanderin'
in her mind.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a sad little group which stood round the dying
girl, all anxious and alarmed and watchful. Then after a
while she opened her eyes again and there was a look of
startled surprise as if she were looking at something in the
distance. Then she began to recognize each and all of them
in turn, first Robert, who still held her hand, then her mother
and Nellie, and Peter. A faint smile came into her eyes and
he stepped forward. Her lips moved slowly and a faint sound
came falteringly from them.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinna be angry wi' onybody,&quot; she panted. &quot;It was a'&mdash;a&mdash;mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>Then raising her hand she held it out to Peter, who advanced
towards the bedside and placing his hand on Robert's
she clasped them together in her own. &quot;There noo&mdash;dinna
be angry&mdash;it was a' a mistake. It was Rob I liket&mdash;it was
him&mdash;I wanted. But it&mdash;was&mdash;a' a mistak'. Dinna be&mdash;&quot;
and the glazed sunken eyes closed forever, never to open again,
a faint noise gurgled in her throat, and the dews of death
stood out in beads upon the pale brow. A tiny quiver of the
eyelids, and a tremor through the thin hands and Mysie&mdash;poor
ruined broken waif of the world&mdash;was gone.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my God! She's deid,&quot; gasped Robert, clasping the
thin dead hands in a frenzy of passionate grief. &quot;Oh, Mysie!
Mysie! Oh God! She's deid,&quot; and his head bent low over
the bed while great sobs tore through him, and shook his young
frame, as the storm shakes the young firs of the woods. Then
suddenly recollecting himself as his mother put her hand upon
his bent head saying: &quot;Rise up, Robin, like a man. You
maun gang oot noo.&quot; He rose and with tears in his eyes that
blinded him so that he hardly saw where he was going, he
stumbled out into the darkness under the pale stars&mdash;out into
the night to the open moor, his grief so burdening that he felt
as if the whole world had gone from his reckoning.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my poor Mysie,&quot; he groaned. &quot;It was all a horrible
mistake,&quot; and the darkness came down in thick heavy folds
as if the whole world were mourning for the loss of the young
girl's soul, but it brought no comfort to him.</p>

<h2>A CALL FOR HELP</h2>


<p>It was a quiet night in early April, full of the hush which
seems to gather all the creative forces together, before the
wild outburst of prodigal creation begins in wild flower
and weed and moorland grasses, and Robert Sinclair, who had
walked and tramped over the moors for hours, until he was
nearly exhausted, his heart torn and his mind in an agony of
suffering, sat down upon a little hillock, his elbows on his knees
and his hands against his cheeks.</p>

<p>The moor-birds screamed and circled in restless flight around
him. They were plainly protesting against his intrusion into
their domain. They shrilled and dived in their flight, almost
touching the bent head, with swooping wing, to rise again,
cleaving the air and sheering round again; but still the lonely
figure sat looking into darkness, becoming numbed with cold,
and all unconscious of the passage of time.</p>

<p>Gradually the cold began to tell upon him, and he started
to his feet, plodding up the hill, through the soft mossy yielding
soil. Back again he came after a time, his limbs aching
with the long night's tramping; but yet he never thought of
going home or turning towards the village.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mysie!&quot; he groaned again and again, and all night
long only these two words escaped his lips. They came in a
low sad tone, like the wind coming through far-off trees; but
they were vibrant with suffering, and only the moor-birds
cried in answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mysie!&quot; and the winds sighed it again and again, as
they came wandering down out of the stillness between the
hills, to pass on into the silence of the night again, like lost
souls wandering through an uncreative world, proclaiming to
other spheres the doom that had settled upon earth.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mysie!&quot; groaned a moorland brook close by, which
grumbled at some obstruction in its pathway, and then sighed
over its mossy bed, like a tired child emerging exhausted
from a long fever, to fall asleep as deeply as if the seal of
death had been planted upon the little lips. Occasionally he
shifted his position, as his limbs grew cramped, or rose to pace
the moor again to bring himself more exhaustion; but always
he came back to the little knoll, and sat down again, groaning
out the sad plaintive words, that were at once an appeal and
a cry, a defiance and a submission. By and by the first gray
streaks of dawn came filtering through the curtains of the
cloudy east, touching the low hills with gray nimble fingers,
or weaving a tapestry of magic, as they brightened and grew
clearer, over the gray face of the morn.</p>

<p>Soon the birds leapt again from every corner, climbing upon
the ladders of light and tumbling ecstasies of mad joy to welcome
the day, as if they feared to be left in the darkness
with this strange figure, which merely sat and groaned softly,
and looked before it with silent agony in its eyes; and now
that the light had again come, they shouted their protest in
a louder, shriller note; they mounted upon the waves of light
and swooped down into the trough of the semi-darkness, expostulating
and crying, not so much in alarm now, as in anger.
For with the light comes courage to birds as well as men, and
fear, the offspring of ignorance, which is bred in darkness,
loses its power when its mystery is revealed.</p>

<p>But even with the coming of the day the still silent figure
did not move. It continued to sit until the birds grew tired
of protesting, and even the mountain hare wandered close by,
sniffing the breeze in his direction, and cocking its ears and
listening, as it sat upon its hind legs, only to resume its leisurely
wandering again, feeling assured that there was nothing
to fear in the direction of this quiet, bent figure of sorrow,
that sat merely staring at the hills, and saw naught of anything
before him. The things he saw were not the things
around him. He was moving in a multitude again. He was
walking among them with pity in his heart&mdash;a great pity for
their ignorance, their lack of vision; and he was giving them
knowledge and restoring light to their eyes, to widen their
range of vision, so that they could take things in their true
perspective. He was full of a great sympathy for their shortcomings,
recognizing to the full that only by sowing love could
love be reaped, only in service could happiness be found&mdash;that
he who gave his life would save it.</p>

<p>The great dumb mass of humanity needed serving&mdash;needed
love. It passed on blindly, wounding itself as it staggered
against its barriers, bruising its heart and soul in the darkness,
and never learning its lessons. Saviors in all ages had lifted
the darkness a bit, and given knowledge, and sometimes it
had profited for a while till false prophets arose to mislead.</p>

<p>It was a seething feverish mass, stamping and surging
towards every blatant voice which cried the false message to
it, rousing it to anger, and again misleading, until it often
rose to rend its saviors instead of those who had duped it so
shamelessly.</p>

<p>All the tragic procession filed past, and he gave them peace
and knowledge. By and by they grew to a long thin stream,
feverish and agitated, seemingly all converging towards a point&mdash;pain
and anxiety in every quick movement, and suffering
in every gesture. He looked with still more and more compassion
upon them, with a greater love in his breast, but it
did not calm them as before, and at last in desperation he
stretched out his hands in appealing pity for them, his whole
being aglow with the desire to help and pity and love, and
he found that the scene changed. He was on the moor, and
there was the discomfort of cold in his limbs; but&mdash;yes, he
was looking at the pit, and there was a long stream of men,
women and children, principally women and children, running
frantically across the moor towards the pit, and he could hear
the faint sound of their voices, which clearly betokened suffering,
anxiety and alarm. Something had happened. He must
have been looking at that procession for a long time, he realized,
and pulling himself together, he bounded to his feet and
was off in a long striding race through the moor towards the
pit, his heart telling him that something had happened which
was out of the ordinary kind of accident that regularly happened
at a coal mine. He bounded along, knowing as he
went that there was something more of sorrow for his mother
in this, whatever it was. He felt so, but could not account
for the feeling, and as this thought grew in intensity in his
mind, he changed his course a bit, and made for home, to
ascertain what had really happened. It was something big,
he felt, but whatever it was, his mother must again be called
upon to suffer, and his alarm grew with his pace, until he
arrived breathless at the house. One look at her face, and
he knew his instincts had told him the truth.</p>

<p>She was white and strained, though tearless, but her eyes
were full of an awful suffering.</p>

<p>&quot;What has happened, mother?&quot; he demanded, as if he could
hardly wait for her to answer.</p>

<p>&quot;The moss has broken in, an' twenty-three men are lost.
Jamie an' Andra are among them. They gaed oot themselves
this morning, telling me they could work fine, even though
you werena there. Oh, Rob! What will I do! Oh, dear!
Oh, dear! My bonnie laddies!&quot; and with a sob in her voice
she turned away, and Robert was again out of the house, and
running through the moor to the pit, as hard as desperation
could drive him. His two brothers were down there, and they
must be got out. Even as he ran he wondered what strange
freak of fate it was, that had kept him out there on the moor
all night and so saved him from this terrible fate.</p>

<p>He could understand how his brothers would feel at the
chance of working one day by themselves. He had always
been their guide and protector. They had gone into the pit
with him when they left school, and had just continued working
with him since, learning their trade from his greater experience,
and trusting always to his better judgment when
there was danger to avoid. They would go out that day with
the intention of working like slaves to produce an extra turn
of coal. Even though it were but one extra hutch, they would
fill it, and slave all day with never a rest, so that they could
have the satisfaction of seeing approval in his eyes, when they
told him at night how many they had turned out, and how
well things had gone generally with them in his absence.</p>

<p>He reached the pit, to find that the moss was already rising
in the shaft, and that there was no possibility of getting down
to try and save these twenty-three men and boys who were
imprisoned in the darkness beneath.</p>

<p>He came across Tam Donaldson, who was the last to get up.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me aboot it, Tam,&quot; he said. &quot;Is there no chance of
getting down? Do you think any of them will be safe so far?&quot;
and a whole lot of other anxious questions were rattled off,
while Tam, dripping wet from having to wade and fight the
last fifty fathoms toward the pit bottom, through the silent,
sinister, creeping moss that filled the roadways and tunnels,
stood to give him an account of what had taken place.</p>

<p>&quot;They were a' sitting at their piece, Rob&mdash;a' but James
and Andra. They were keen to get as muckle work done as
possible, an' they had some coal to get to fill oot a hutch,
when a' at yince we heard Andra crying on us to rin. Had
they a' ran doon the brae we'd a' hae been safe, for we could
hae gotten to the bottom afore the moss; but some ran into
the inside heading, an' hadna time to realize that their outlet
was cut off, an' there they are; for the moss was comin' doon
the full height of the road when I ran back to try an' cry on
them to come back. So I had to rin for't too, an' jist got oot
by the skin o' my teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;I kent fine it wad happen,&quot; he went on, as Robert stood,
the tears in his eyes, as he realized how hopeless the position
was of ever being able to restore these men and boys again
to their homes. There was anger in Tam's voice as he spoke.
&quot;It's a' to get cheap coal, an' they ought to hae known, for
they were telt, that to open oot that seam into long well workings
so near the surface, an' wi' sic a rotten roof, was invitin'
disaster, wi' as muckle rain as we hae had lately. They are
a lot o' murderers&mdash;that's what they are! But what the hell
do they care, sae lang as they get cheap coal!&quot;</p>

<p>Robert turned away sick at heart. It was certainly a foolish
thing, he had thought at the time, for the management to
change their method of working the coal; for even though the
seam had grown thinner, he felt that it could have still been
worked at a profit under the old system. He knew also that
the men were all upset at the time by this change, but the
management had assured them that there was no danger, and
that it would mean more money for the men, as they would
be enabled to produce more coal.</p>

<p>This certainly had happened for a week or two, but the rates
were soon broken, because they were making too high wages;
and the men found, as usual, that their increased output had
merely meant increased work for them, and increased profits
for the owners.</p>

<p>Was there nothing to be done? Robert wondered, as he
paced restlessly back and forth, his mind busy, as the mind
of every man present, and anxious to make any sacrifice, to
take any risk, if by so doing they might save those imprisoned
in the mine. Even while his mind was working, he could not
help listening to the talk of those around him. There were
strange opinions expressed, and wild plans of rescue were suggested
and discussed and disputed. Everyone condemned the
coal company for what had happened, but over all there were
the white-faced women and the silent children; the muffled
sobs, the tears, and the agony of silent wet eyes that spoke
more pain than all the tragedies that had ever been written.</p>

<p>Robert could not help listening to one man&mdash;a big, raw,
loosely-built fellow, who stood in the midst of a group of
women laying off his idea of a rescue.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm rale glad to be out of it,&quot; he said, &quot;for Jean's sake,
an' the bairns; but for a' that I'd gang doon again an' try an'
get them oot if there was ony chance o' doin' it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoo is Jean?&quot; one woman interposed to enquire about his
wife, who had been ill a long time.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, she's gettin' on fine noo, an' the doctor has a hopeful
word o' her,&quot; he answered. &quot;In fact, I was just feeding the
birds the last time he was in, an' asked him hoo she was
doin'.&quot;</p>

<p>This man, Dugald McIntosh, had one god&mdash;his canaries.
He read all he could get to read about them, and studied the
best conditions under which to rear them, sacrificed everything
he could to breed better birds, and this was always a topic
for him to discourse upon.</p>

<p>&quot;I was just busy feedin' them when he cam' in, and after
he had examined her, I asked him hoo she was gettin' on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; he said, &quot;gi'e her plenty o' sweet milk noo, and
fresh eggs, an' she'll sune be on her feet again. Fresh eggs!
mind you, an' me canna get yin for my canaries! I thocht
it was a guid yin!&quot;</p>

<p>Robert turned away; but there was working in his mind
an idea, and he ran round to the colliery office to the manager,
who was nearly mad with grief and anxiety at what had
happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Come in, Sinclair,&quot; he said simply. &quot;Can you suggest anything
to help us? Whatever is done, it can only be done
quickly; for the moss is rising rapidly in the shaft, and even
though some of the men are safe in the upper workings, it is
only a question of a very short time till the moss will rise
and suffocate them, or until the black damp does so. If you
have any idea that can help, out with it and let us make a
trial, for the inactivity is killing me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been thinking, Mr. Anderson,&quot; replied Robert, &quot;that
we might go down the old air-shaft over in the moss there,
and run along the top level, which is not far from the surface,
and try and blast it through on the heading into which the
moss broke.&quot;</p>

<p>It might be full of moss too, for no one knew the extent
of the breakage in the metals, and even though it were clear,
the damp would be lying in it; but surely they might make an
attempt on it. Robert remembered working this level to within
about nine feet from going through on the heading. If he
had plenty of hands, just to go down and drill a hole in anywhere,
and blast out the coal with a shot or two wherever he
could best place them, he might succeed in getting through
to the men. It might be that after the first rush filling the
roadways, the flood of moss had drained off, and was not now
running so thickly down the heading.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me go and try, sir,&quot; he pleaded eagerly. &quot;I think I
can manage, if the level is still unbroken. We can work
in short turns, so as not to be overcome with the damp. Will
you let me have a try? I believe it's the only chance we
have, and if we do succeed, look what it will mean to the
women in the village. Will you let me try?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Anderson, reaching for his lamp, &quot;and I shall
be one of the triers too. Go out and pick seven or eight
men. I'll get the necessary tools and get off over the moor
to the old air shaft. It may still be open. It is a pity we
let it go out of repair, but we can have a trial.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert ran out, a hope filling his heart, telling his news to
those round about, and the first man to step forth, before he
had finished, was Dugald McIntosh, the man who had put
more value on his canaries than on his wife's health, who
quietly lifted up the drills the manager had brought, and
slinging them lightly over his shoulder, was off across the moor
at a run, with a dozen men at his heels, all eager to get to
grips with the danger, and try to rescue their imprisoned
comrades.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h2>A FIGHT WITH DEATH</h2>


<p>Robert Sinclair seemed to be the one man who
knew what to do&mdash;at least, he seemed to be the only
one who had a definite aim in view and as if by some
natural instinct everyone was just ready to do his bidding.
He was the leader of the herd towards whom everyone looked
ready for a new order to meet any new situation which might
arise. Initiative and resource were a monopoly in his hands.
He was silent, and worked to get ready to descend the old air-shaft,
with grim set lips. Yet there seemed to be no sense of
bustle, only the work was done quickly and orderly, his orders
being issued as much by signs as by speech, and soon a windlass
was erected with ropes and swing chair fastened, into
which he at once leaped, followed by another man. Tools and
explosives were packed in and lamps lit and the order given
to lower the chair.</p>

<p>Robert felt a queer sort of feeling as he stood waiting on
the first motion of the little drum round which the rope wound.
He was cool and clear brained&mdash;in fact he wondered why he
was so collected. He felt he was standing out of all this maelstrom
of suffering and terror. Not that he was impervious to
anxiety for the men below, not that he was unmoved by all
that it meant to those standing round; but after that first
wild throb of terror that had clutched at his heart when his
mother had told him the dread news and that his two brothers
were imprisoned in the mine, something seemed suddenly to
snap within him, the load and the intensity of the pain lifted,
and from that moment he had been master of the situation.</p>

<p>He glanced round him as he waited quietly in his swinging
seat. He felt as he looked, no sense of fear or impending
doom. He knew that black damp probably lay in dense
quantities down in that yawning gulf below him, he knew that
the sides of the shaft were in a bad state of disrepair, and
that they might give way at any time as the swinging rope
must inevitably touch them, and bring the whole thing in
upon him, with hundreds of tons of d&eacute;bris and moss.</p>

<p>Yet it was not of these things he thought. Perhaps he did
not think of anything particularly, but a far-off lilt of a children's
game which was played at school, kept iterating and
reiterating through his brain, and everything seemed done to
that tune.</p>

<p>
&quot;Don't take a laddie, oh,<br />
Laddie oh, laddie oh,<br />
Don't take a laddie oh,<br />
Take a bonnie wee lassie.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>It sang continually within him and men seemed to move
to its regular beat, as they hurried to get ready. He looked
at the hills, and noted how quiet everything seemed, their
curving outlines gave such a sense of eternal rest. There
was a patch of lovely blue sky above him, he noticed where
the clouds opened up and a glint of golden glorious sunshine
came through; but it looked garish and it closed again and
the white clouds trailed away, their lower fringes clinging to
the hill tops like veils of gossamer woven by time to deck
the bride of Spring. A lark rose at the edge of the crowd of
weeping women and children as if unmindful of the tragedy
over which it sang so rapturously, and he noted its fluttering
wings and swelling throat as it soared in circles of glad song.</p>

<p>All these things and more he noted though it was but a
momentary pause.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you right?&quot; came the question from the men at the
windlass, far away it seemed and unconnected with the scene.</p>

<p>&quot;Right,&quot; he answered with a start, and looking round he
seemed to become aware of the white-faced, red-eyed women
among whom his mother's face seemed to stand out. She was
not weeping, he noticed, but oh God! her face seemed to
turn him with the intensity of the suffering in her eyes. He
realized that he had not noticed her before, and now with a
wild throb of pity he stretched out his hands towards her, a
look of suffering in his eyes, as if he were feeling the pains of
humanity crucified anew, and the chair began to drop slowly
below the surface, swinging down into the darkness and the
evil dangers that lurked below. Her face was the last thing
he saw&mdash;a face full of agony yet calm with a great renunciation
coming to birth in her eyes, her lips drawn thin like a
slit in her face and all the color gone from them, the head
bent a little as if a great blow had fallen upon her&mdash;an island
of agony set in a sea of despair.</p>

<p>A wild impulse seized him to go back. It was too much to
ask of a woman, he felt. Too great a burden of tragedy to
heap upon one soul, as he cast his mind back through the
suffering years and viewed all the pain she had borne, and the
terrible Gethsemane which her life had been; but as the chair
swung round he clutched the swaying rope and with the other
hand steadied it from crashing against the side of the shaft
as they slowly dropped lower and lower into the darkness and
the evil smells which hung around.</p>

<p>&quot;Things look bad here,&quot; said his comrade as they passed
down where at some time a huge portion from the side had
fallen out and down into the bottom of the old shaft.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; answered Robert, &quot;everything seems just ready to
collapse,&quot; and they dropped lower and lower, swaying from
side to side, cautiously guiding their swinging chair from the
moss-oozing side, their nerves strained as they listened to
the creeking rope as it was paid out from above.</p>

<p>&quot;Holy God,&quot; cried his mate, &quot;that was a near thing,&quot;
as a huge mass of rocks and slimy moss lunged out a little
below them and hurtled away in a loud rumbling noise.</p>

<p>Robert pulled the signal cord to stop and looked up to see
the white clouds passing over the narrow funnel-like shaft
in which they hung. Then he gave the signal to let out again
noting how thick with damp the atmosphere was becoming,
and having difficulty with his light.</p>

<p>Lower and lower they swung and dropped down into the
old shaft and as the rope creaked and crazed above them it
lilted:</p>

<p>
&quot;Choose, choose, wha' you'll tak',<br />
Wha' you'll tak', wha' you'll tak',<br />
Choose, choose wha' you'll tak',<br />
A laddie or a lassie.&quot;<br />
</p>

<p>And the memory of the old lilt brought back other scenes
again and he found himself guiding the chair from the shaft
side steering it off with his hand at every rhythmic beat of
the child song.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the bottom of the shaft, for it was not
very deep, and found a mass of d&eacute;bris, almost choking up the
roadways on either side of the bottom. But they got out of
their chair and soon began to &quot;redd&quot; away the stones though
they found very great difficulty in getting the lamps to burn.
Occasionally, as they worked, little pieces came tumbling from
the side of the shaft, telling its own tale, and as soon as
Robert got a decent sized kind of opening made through the
rocks which blocked the roadway he sent up the other man
to bring down more help and to get others started to repair
the old shaft by putting in stays and batons to preserve the
sides and so prevent them from caving in altogether.</p>

<p>He found his way along the level which had been driven
to within nine feet of going through on the heading in which
the inbreak of moss had taken place. He noticed the roof
was broken in many places and that the timber which had
been put in years before was rotten. Strange noises seemed
to assail his senses, and stranger smells, yet the lilt of that
old childish game was ever humming in his brain and he saw
himself with other boys and girls with clasped hands linked
in a circle and going round in a ring as they sang the old ditty.</p>

<p>&quot;Three breakings should dae it,&quot; he said as he looked at
the face of the coal dripping with water from the cracks in
the roof. &quot;If only they were here to put up the props. I
could soon blow it through,&quot; and he began to prepare a place
for batons and props, pending the arrival of more help from
those who were only too eager to come down to his aid.</p>

<p>It was almost an hour before help came in the shape of two
men carrying some props. Then came another two and soon
more timber began to arrive regularly and the swinging blows
of their hammers as they drove in the fresh props were soon
echoing through the tunnels, and Robert set up his boring
machine and soon the rickety noise of it drowned all others.
He paused to change a drill when a faint hullo was heard
from the other side.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo,&quot; he yelled, then held his breath in tense silence to
hear the response which came immediately. &quot;Are you all
safe?&quot; he roared, his voice carrying easily through the open
coal.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; came the faint answer; &quot;but the moss is rising in
the heading and you'll have to hurry up.&quot;</p>

<p>Robert knew this, and one of his helpers had gone down an
old heading to explore and had returned to say that it was
rising steadily and was now within two hundred feet from
the old shaft down which he had descended.</p>

<p>&quot;Where away did the roof break?&quot; roared Robert as he
changed his second drill.</p>

<p>&quot;Half way doon the cousie brae,&quot; came the answer, &quot;an'
we're all shut in like rats. Hurry up and get us oot,&quot; and
again the rickety, rackety noise of the boring machine began
and drowned all other noises.</p>

<p>He soon drilled his holes and he could hear them on the
other side singing now some ribald song to keep up their
courage, while others who were religiously inclined chanted
hymns and psalms, but all were wondering whether Robert
and his men would be able to break through the barrier in
time to save them before the persistently rising moss claimed
them.</p>

<p>He charged his shots and called them to go back, telling
them the number of his charges, then lit his fuse and ran out of
the old level to wait in a place of safety while the explosion
took place.</p>

<p>Soon they boomed out and the concussion put them all in
darkness; but they soon had the lamps re-lit and were back
in among the thick volumes of powder smoke, groping about
and shading their lamps and peering in to see what their shots
had done to lessen the barrier between them and their imprisoned
comrades.</p>

<p>Then the shovels set to work and tossed the coal which the
shots had dislodged back into the roadway and soon the boring
machines were busy again, eating into the coal; for those
tireless arms of Robert's never halted. He swung the handle
or wielded the pick or shovel, never taking a, rest, while the
sweat streamed from his body working like some mechanical
product for always in his mind he was calculating his chances
for being able to blast it through the barrier before the moss
rose.</p>

<p>&quot;It has only a stoop length an' a half to rise now,&quot; reported
one of the men. &quot;It's creeping up like the doom o' the
day o' judgment. But I think we'll manage. If these shots
do as well as the last ones we should be within two feet of
them, an' surely to God we can bite the rest of it, if we canna
blaw it. Let me stem the shots, Rob, an' you take a rest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You go to hell,&quot; was the unexpectedly astounding reply;
for no one had ever heard Robert Sinclair use language like
this before. &quot;As soon as thae shots are off an' if they blaw
as well as the others we'll turn out the coal an' then you can
gang up the pit, every yin o' you. I'll soon blow through the
rest of it, and if you are all up by then it will make for speed
in getting the others out. We're going to have a race for it
even though we manage as I'm thinking to. So get out of
the way and don't talk. Again the air's getting too dam'd
thick for you all remaining here. There's hardly as muckle
as would keep a canary living,&quot; and again he called to those
on the other side to beware of the shots, and again ran out
to a place of safety while the explosions took place.</p>

<p>Once more the result of the shots was good; but the smoke
choked and blinded them and one man was overcome by the
fumes. They carried him out the road a bit and after he
showed signs of coming round, Robert gave instructions for
him to be taken to the surface.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Lod, but it's nippin' my e'en,&quot; said one as he rubbed
his eyes and blew his nose, sneezed and finally expectorated.
&quot;It's as thick as soor milk, be dam'd!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, get him up, and I'll away back and redd out the shots
and try and get it through again. The moss is rising quicker
noo an' it has only aboot eighty feet to come.&quot;</p>

<p>So back he went among the thick choking volume of smoke,
tripping and stumbling and staggering from side to side as
he scrambled on. Would he be in time to blast the barrier
down before the steadily creeping moss rose to cut off his only
avenue of escape?</p>

<p>&quot;My God! What's that?&quot; he asked himself as he paused
while a rumble and crash behind him told him that the old
shaft had caved in burying his comrades in rocks and moss and
water.</p>

<p>He ran back but could get no further than within a stoop
length of the old shaft. There were hundreds of tons of
d&eacute;bris and all was finally lost. For the first time terror seized
him and he tore desperately at the bowlders of stone, cutting
his fingers and lacerating his body all over with cuts and
bruises. He raved and swore and shouted in desperation, the
sweat streaming from every pore, his eyes wild and glaring,
but he was soon driven back by the moss which was oozing
and percolating through the broken mass of bowlders and
gradually it forced him back with a rush as it burst through
with a sudden slushing sound as if suddenly relieved from a
barrier which held it. Back he rushed, his light again becoming
extinguished, the flood pursuing him relentlessly, the
air now so heavy that he could hardly breathe, but groping
his way he reached the first end roadway down which for the
moment the flood ran to meet the rising moss creeping up relentlessly
from below.</p>

<p>Choking and only half conscious he staggered on with all sense
of disaster gone from his mind, with no thought of his comrades
on the other side waiting so impatiently to be released,
and singing their frothy songs in the hope that all was well,
his legs doubling below him, and his lungs heaving to expel
the poison which the thick air contained. Down at last he
fell, his head striking against the side of the roadway, and he
lay still.</p>

<p>The moss might rise hungrily over him now, the rotten
roof might fall upon him, all the dangers of the mine might
conspire together against him; but nothing they might do
could ever again strike terror into the young heart that lay
there, feebly throbbing its last as it was being overcome with
the deadly poison of the black damp.</p>

<p>He was proof against all their terrors now, the spirit could
evade them yet; for though the old shaft might collapse and
imprison his body and claim it as a sacrifice to the King
Terror of the Underworld, no prison was ever created that
could contain the indomitable spirit of man as God. He was
free&mdash;free, and was happy and could cry defiance to the dangers
of the mine, to the terrors of time itself. He could clutch
the corners of the earth, and play with it as a toy of time,
among the Gods of Eternity.</p>

<p>&quot;Choose, choose wha' you'll tak',&quot; throbbed the young heart
and a smile of triumph played upon the lips as the pictures
of bygone times flitted across his dying brain. He was again
the happy infant, hungry it may be, and ill-clad, but Heaven
contained no happier soul. The little stomach might not be
filled with sufficient food; but the spirit of him as it was in
younger years knew no material limits to its laughter in the
childish ring games of youth. Again he was waiting in the
dark wintry mornings on Mysie, so that she would not be
afraid to go to work on the pit-head; ay, and he was happy to
take the windward side of her in the storm, and shield her
from the winter's blast, tying her little shawl about her ears
and making her believe he did not feel the cold at all.</p>

<p>He was back again at his mother's knee, listening to her
glorious voice singing some pitiful old ballad, as she crooned
him to sleep; or lying trying to forget the hunger he felt
as the glorious old tune seemed to drown his senses while he
waited to say his prayer at night.</p>

<p>
&quot;Jesus, tender shepherd, hear me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bless Thy little lamb to-night,</span><br />
In the darkness be Thou near me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Keep me safe till morning light.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then there was the &quot;good-night&quot; to everyone and the fond
kiss of the best of all mothers, the sinking into sleep that
billowed and rocked the weary young spirit of him, crushed
and bruised by the forces of the world, and finally the sweet
shy smile of a young girl blushing and awkward, but flooding
his soul with happiness and thrilling every fiber of him with her
magic as she stood upon the hill crest, outlined against the
sunset with a soft breeze blowing, kissing the gray hill side,
bringing perfumes from every corner of the moor and beckoning
him as she rose upward, he followed higher and higher,
the picture taking shape and becoming more real until it
merged into spirit.</p>

<p>And the creeping moss moved upward, hungry for its
prey and greedy to devour the fine young body so fresh and
strong and lusty; but it was balked, for it claimed only the
empty shell. The prize had gone on the wings of an everlasting
happiness and the spirit of the moor, because there is
no forgetting, triumphed over the spirit of destruction, so that
in the records of the spirit he shall say:</p>

<p>
&quot;I shall remember when the red sun glowing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sinks in the west, a gorgeous flare of fire;</span><br />
How then you looked with the soft breeze blowing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cool through your hair, a heaving living pyre</span><br />
Fired by the sun for the sweet day's ending;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I still shall hear the whirring harsh moor-hen,</span><br />
Roused from her rest among the rushes bending<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I shall remember then.</span><br />
<br />
&quot;I shall remember every well-loved feature,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How, on the hill crest when the day was done,</span><br />
Just how you looked, dear, God's most glorious creature,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heaven's silhouette outlined against the sun;</span><br />
I shall remember just how you the fairest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dearest and brightest thing that God e'er made,</span><br />
Warmed all my soul with holy fire the rarest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That vision shall not fade.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>But pain and tragedy forever seem to have no limit to
their hunger; and in the clear spring air above the place where
the bodies of her boys lay, Mrs. Sinclair's heart was again the
food upon which the tragedy of life fed. All the years of her
existence were bound up in the production of coal, and the
spirits of her husband and of her sons call to-day to the world
of men&mdash;men who have wives, men who have mothers, men
who have sweethearts and sisters and daughters, stand firm
together; and preserve your women folk from these tragedies,
if you would justify your manhood in the world of men.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
