<p class='small-caps'>My dear Mennell,</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>It</span> has been my fortune to see
something of the practice of the art of healing under widely
different conditions, and I know none who better represents the
most humane and most exacting of all professions than yourself. The
good doctor of this story&mdash;the born surgeon and healer, the
ever young and alert, the self-forgetful, the faithful friend,
gifted with "that exquisite charity which can forgive all
things"&mdash;is studied from you.</p>

<h2 id='julius'>Chapter I.</h2>

<p class='argument'>Julius Courtney.</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>The</span> Hyacinth Club has the
reputation of selecting its members from among the freshest and
most active spirits in literature, science, and art. That is in a
sense true, but activity in one or another of those fields is not a
condition of membership; for, just as the listening Boswell was the
necessary complement of the talking Johnson, so in the Hyacinth
Club there is an indispensable contingent of <a name='007.png' id=
'p007.png'></a> passive members who find their liveliest
satisfaction in hearing and looking on, rather than in speaking and
doing. Something of the home principle of male and female is
necessary for the completeness even of a club.</p>

<p>The Hyacinth Club-house looks upon Piccadilly and the Green
Park. The favourite place of concourse of its members is the
magnificent smoking-room on the first floor, the bow-windows of
which command a view up and down the fashionable thoroughfare, and
over the trees and the undulating sward of the Park to the gates of
Buckingham Palace. On a Monday afternoon in the beginning of May,
the bow-windows were open, and several men sat in leather lounges
(while one leaned against a window-sash), luxuriously smoking, and
noting the warm, palpitating life <a name='008.png' id='p008.png'>
</a> of the world without. A storm which had been silently and
doubtfully glooming and gathering the night before had burst and
poured in the morning, and it was such a spring afternoon as
thrills the heart with new life and suffuses the soul with
expectation&mdash;such an afternoon as makes all women appear
beautiful and all men handsome. The south-west wind blew soft and
balmy, and all nature rejoiced as the bride in the presence of the
bridegroom. The trees in the Park were full of sap, and their lusty
buds were eagerly opening to the air and the light. The robin sang
with a note almost as rich and sensuous as that of the thrush; and
the shrill and restless sparrows chirped and chattered about the
houses and among the horses' feet, and were as full of the joy of
life as the men and women who <a name='009.png' id='p009.png'></a>
thronged the pavements or reclined in their carriages in the
sumptuous ease of wealth and beauty.</p>

<p>Of the men who languidly gazed upon the gay and splendid scene
from the windows of the Club, none seemed so interested as the man
who leaned against the window-frame. He appeared more than
interested&mdash;absorbed, indeed&mdash;in the world without, and
he looked bright and handsome enough, and charged enough with
buoyant health, to be the ideal bridegroom of Nature in her
springtide.</p>

<p>He was a dark man, tall and well built, with clear brown eyes.
His black hair (which was not cropped short, as is the fashion) had
a lustrous softness, and at the same time an elastic bushiness,
which nothing but the finest-tempered health can give; and his
complexion, though tanned <a name='010.png' id='p010.png'></a> by
exposure, had yet much of the smoothness of youth, save where the
razor had passed upon his beard. Thus seen, a little way off, he
appeared a young man in his rosy twenties; on closer view and
acquaintance, however, that superficial impression was contradicted
by the set expression of his mouth and the calm observation and
understanding of his eye, which spoke of ripe experience rather
than of green hope. He bore a very good English
name&mdash;Courtney; and he was believed to be rich. There was no
member of whom the Hyacinth Club was prouder than of him: though he
had done nothing, it was commonly believed he could do anything he
chose. No other was listened to with such attention, and there was
nothing on which he could not throw a fresh and fascinating light.
He <a name='011.png' id='p011.png'></a> was a constant spring of
surprise and interest. While others were striving after income and
reputation, he calmly and modestly, without obtrusion or
upbraiding, held on his own way, with unsurpassable curiosity, to
the discovery of all which life might have to reveal. It was this,
perhaps, as much as the charm of his manner and conversation, that
made him so universal a favourite; for how could envy or malice
touch a man who competed at no point with his fellows?</p>

<p>His immediate neighbours, as he thus stood by the window, were a
pair of journalists, several scientific men, and an artist.</p>

<p>"Have you seen any of the picture-shows, Julius?" asked the
painter, Kew.</p>

<p>Courtney slowly abstracted his gaze from without, and turned on
his shoulder with the lazy, languid grace of a cat.<a name=
'012.png' id='p012.png'></a></p>

<p>"No," said he, in a half-absent tone; "I have just come up, and
I've not thought of looking into picture-galleries yet."</p>

<p>"Been in the country?" asked Kew.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been in the country," said Courtney, still as if his
attention was elsewhere.</p>

<p>"It must be looking lovely," said Kew.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;exquisite!" said Courtney, waking up at length to a
full glow of interest. "That's why I don't want to go and stare at
pictures. In the spring, to see the fresh, virginal, delicious
green of a bush against an old dry brick wall, gives a keener
pleasure than the best picture that ever was painted."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Kew, "you had a taste for Art; I thought you
enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"So I do, my dear fellow, but not now,&mdash;not <a name=
'013.png' id='p013.png'></a> at this particular present. When I
feel the warm sun on my back and breathe the soft air, I want no
more; they are more than Art can give&mdash;they are Nature, and,
of course, it goes without saying that Art can never compete with
Nature in creating human pleasure. I mean no disparagement of your
work, Kew, or any artist's work; but I can't endure Art except in
winter, when everything (almost) must be artificial to be
endurable. A winter may come in one's life&mdash;I wonder if it
will?&mdash;when one would rather look at the picture of a woman
than at the woman herself. Meantime I no more need pictures than I
need fires; I warm both hands and heart at the fire of life."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Kew, with a wistful lack of comprehension.</p>

<p>"That's why I believe," said Courtney, <a name='014.png' id=
'p014.png'></a> with a sudden turn of reflection, "there is in warm
countries no Art of our small domestic kind."</p>

<p>"Just so," said Kew; while Dingley Dell, the Art critic, made a
note of Courtney's words.</p>

<p>"Look here!" exclaimed Dr. Embro, an old scientific man of
Scottish extraction, who, in impatience with such transcendental
talk, had taken up 'The St. James's Gazette.' "What do you make of
this queer case at the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu in Paris? I see it's taken
from 'The Daily Telegraph;'" and he began to read it.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Kew, "we all read that this morning."</p>

<p>"Dr. Embro," said Courtney, again looking idly out of window,
"is like a French journal: full of the news of the day before
yesterday."<a name='015.png' id='p015.png'></a></p>

<p>"Have you read it yourself, Julius?" asked Embro, amid the
laughter of his neighbours.</p>

<p>"No," said Julius carelessly; "and if it's a hospital case I
don't want to read it."</p>

<p>"What!" said Embro, with heavy irony. "You say that? You, a
pupil of the great Dubois and the greater Charbon! But here comes a
greater than Charbon&mdash;the celebrated Dr. Lefevre himself. Come
now, Lefevre, you tell us what you think of this Paris hospital
case."</p>

<p>"Presently, Embro," said Lefevre, who had just perceived his
friend Courtney. "Ha, Julius!" said he, crossing to him and taking
his hand; "you're looking uncommonly well."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Julius, "I am well."</p>

<p>"And where have you been all this while?" asked the doctor.<a
name='016.png' id='p016.png'></a></p>

<p>"Oh," said Julius, turning his gaze again out of window, "I have
been rambling everywhere, between Dan and Beersheba."</p>

<p>"And all is vanity, eh?" said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Well," said Julius, looking at him, "that depends&mdash;that
very much depends. But can there be any question of vanity or
vexation in this sweet, glorious sunshine?" and he stretched out
his hands as if he burgeoned forth to welcome it.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Lefevre. "Come and sit down and let us
talk."</p>

<p>They were retiring from the window when Embro's voice again
sounded at Lefevre's elbow&mdash;"Come now, Lefevre; what's the
meaning of that Paris case?"</p>

<p>"What Paris case?"<a name='017.png' id='p017.png'></a></p>

<p>Embro answered by handing him the paper. He took it, and read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"About a month ago a strange case of complete mental collapse
was received into the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu. A fresh healthy girl, of
the working class, about twenty years of age, and comfortably
dressed, presented herself at a police-station near the
Od&eacute;on and asked for shelter. As she did not appear to be in
full possession of her mental faculties, she was sent to the
H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, where she remained in a semi-comatose condition.
Her memory did not go farther back than the hour of her application
at the police-station. She was entirely ignorant of her previous
history, and had even forgotten her name. The minds of the medical
staff of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu were very much exercised with her
condition; but it was not till about a week ago that they succeeded
in restoring to any extent her mental consciousness and her memory.
She then remembered the events immediately preceding her
application to the police. It had come on to rain, she said, and
she was hurrying along to escape from it, when a gentleman in a
cloak came to her side and politely offered to give her the shelter
of his umbrella. She accepted; the gentleman seemed old and ill. He
asked her to take his arm. She did so, and very soon she felt as if
her strength had gone from her; a cold shiver <a name='018.png' id=
'p018.png'></a> crept over her; she trembled and tottered; but with
all that she did not find her sensations disagreeable exactly or
alarming; so little so, indeed, that she never thought of letting
go the gentleman's arm. Her head buzzed, and a kind of darkness
came over her. Then all seemed to clear, and she found herself
alone near the police-station, remembering nothing. Being asked to
further describe the gentleman, she said he was tall and dark, with
a pleasant voice and wonderful eyes, that made you feel you must do
whatever he wished. The police have made inquiries, but after such
a lapse of time it is not surprising that no trace of him can be
found."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Well?" asked Embro, when Lefevre had raised his eyes from the
paper. "What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Curious," said Lefevre. "I can't say more, since I know nothing
of it but this. Have you read it, Julius?"</p>

<p>"No," said Julius; "I hate what people call news; and when I
take up a paper, it's only to look at the Weather Forecasts."
Lefevre handed him the paper, <a name='019.png' id='p019.png'></a>
which he took with an unconcealed look of repulsion. "If it's some
case of disease," said he, "it will make me ill."</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Lefevre; "it's not painful, but it's curious;" and
so Julius set himself to read it.</p>

<p>"But come," said Embro, posing the question with his forefinger;
"do you believe that story, Lefevre?"</p>

<p>"Though it's French, and from the 'Telegraph,'" said Lefevre, "I
see no reason to disbelieve it."</p>

<p>"Come," said Embro, "come&mdash;you're shirking the
question."</p>

<p>"I confess," said Lefevre, "I've no desire to discuss it. You
think me prejudiced in favour of anything of the kind; perhaps I
think you prejudiced against it: where, then, is the good of
discussion?"<a name='020.png' id='p020.png'></a></p>

<p>"Well, now," said the unabashed Embro, "I'll tell you what I
think. Here's a story"&mdash;Julius at that instant handed back the
paper to him&mdash;"of a healthy young woman mesmerised,
hypnotised, or somnambulised, or whatever you like to call it, in
the public street, by some man that casually comes up to her, and
her brain so affected that her memory goes! I say it's
inconceivable!&mdash;impossible!" And he slapped the paper down on
the table.</p>

<p>The others looked on with grim satisfaction at the prospect of
an argument between the two representatives of rival schools; and
it was noteworthy that, as they looked, they turned a referring
glance on Courtney, as if it were a foregone conclusion that he
must be the final arbiter. He, however, sat abstracted, with <a
name='021.png' id='p021.png'></a> his eyes on the floor, and with
one hand propping his chin and the other drumming on the arm of his
chair.</p>

<p>"I'm not a scientific man," said the journalist who was not an
Art critic, "and I am not prejudiced either way about this story;
but it seems to me, Embro, that you view the thing through a very
ordinary fallacy, and make a double mistake. You confound the
relatively inconceivable with the absolutely impossible: this story
is relatively inconceivable to you, and therefore you say it is
absolutely impossible."</p>

<p>"Is there such a thing as an absolute impossibility?" murmured
Julius, who still sat with his chin in his hand, looking as if he
considered the "thing" from a long way off as one of a multitude of
other things.<a name='022.png' id='p022.png'></a></p>

<p>"I do not believe there is," said the journalist;
"but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't let us lose ourselves in metaphysics," broke in Embro.
Then, turning to Courtney, whose direct intelligent gaze seemed to
disconcert him, he said, "Now, Julius, you've seen, I daresay, a
good many things we have not seen,&mdash;have you ever seen or
known a case like this we're talking about?"</p>

<p>"I can't say I have," said Julius.</p>

<p>"There you are!" quoth Embro, in triumph.</p>

<p>"But," continued Julius, "I don't therefore nail that case down
as false."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," exclaimed Embro, "that you have lived all
your years, and studied science at the
Salp&eacute;tri&egrave;re,&mdash;or what they call science
there,&mdash;and studied and seen God knows what <a name='023.png'
id='p023.png'></a> else besides, and you can't pronounce an opinion
from all you know on a case of this sort?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Julius, quietly, "I can pronounce an opinion; but
what's the use of that? I think that case is true, but I don't know
that it is; and therefore I can't argue about it, for argument
should come from knowledge, and I have none. I have a few opinions,
and I am always ready to receive impressions; but, besides some
schoolboy facts that are common property, the only thing I
know&mdash;I am certain of&mdash;is, as some man says, '<i>Life's a
dream worth dreaming</i>.'"</p>

<p>"You're too high-falutin for me, Julius," said Embro, shaking
his head. "But my opinion, founded on my knowledge, is that this
story is a hallucination of the young woman's noddle!"<a name=
'024.png' id='p024.png'></a></p>

<p>"And how much, Embro," laughed Julius, rising to leave the
circle, "is the argument advanced by your ticketing the case with
that long word?"</p>

<p>"To say 'hallucination,'" quoth Lefevre, "is a convenient way of
giving inquiry the slip."</p>

<p>"My dear Embro," said Julius,&mdash;and he spoke with an
emphasis, and looked down on Embro with a bright vivacity of eye,
which forewarned the circle of one of his eloquent flashes: a smile
of expectant enjoyment passed round,&mdash;"hallucination is the
dust-heap and limbo of the meanly-equipped man of science to-day,
just as witchcraft was a few hundred years ago. The poor creature
of science long ago, when he came upon any pathological or
psychological manifestation he did not understand, used to say,
'<i>Witchcraft</i>! <a name='025.png' id='p025.png'></a> Away with
it to the limbo!' To-day he says, '<i>Hallucination</i>! Away with
it to the dust-heap!' It is a pity," said he, with a laugh, "you
ever took to science, Embro."</p>

<p>"And why, may I ask?" said Embro.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'd have been great as an orthodox theologian of the
Kirk; the cocksureness of theology would have suited you like your
own coat. You are not at home in science, for you have no
imagination."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the peculiar regard in which Julius was
held that whatever he said or did appeared natural and
pleasant,&mdash;like the innocent actions and the simple, truthful
speech of a child. Not even Embro was offended with these last
words of his: the others laughed; Embro smiled, though with a
certain sourness.</p>

<p>"Pooh, Julius!" said he; "what are you <a name='026.png' id=
'p026.png'></a> talking about? Science is the examination of facts,
and what has imagination to do with that? Reason, sir, is what you
want!"</p>

<p>"My dear Embro," said Julius, "there are several kinds of facts.
There are, for instance, big facts and little facts,&mdash;clean
facts and dirty facts. Imagination raises you and gives you a high
and comprehensive view of them all; your mere reason keeps you
down in some noisome corner, like the man with the muck-rake."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried the journalist and the artist heartily.</p>

<p>"You're wrong, Julius," said Embro,&mdash;"quite wrong. Keep
your imagination for painting and poetry. In science it just leads
you the devil's own dance, and fills you with delusions."</p>

<p>Julius paused, and bent on him his <a name='027.png' id=
'p027.png'></a> peculiar look, which made a man feel he was being
seen through and through.</p>

<p>"I am surprised, Embro," said he, "that one can live all your
years and not find that the illusions of life are its best part. If
you leave me the illusions, I'll give you all the realities. But
how can we stay babbling and quibbling here all this delicious
afternoon? I must go out and see green things and beasts. Come with
me, Lefevre, to the Zoological Gardens; it will do you good."</p>

<p>"I tell you what," said Lefevre, looking at the clock as they
moved away; "my mother and sister will call for me with the
carriage in less than half an hour: come with us for a drive."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Julius; "that's a good idea."</p>

<p>"And I," said Lefevre, "must have a <a name='028.png' id=
'p028.png'></a> cup of tea in the meantime. Come and sit down, and
tell me where you have been."</p>

<p>But when they had sat down, Julius was little inclined to
divagate into an account of his travels. His glance swept round and
noted everything; he remarked on a soft effect of a shaft of
sunshine that lit up the small conservatory, and burnished the
green of a certain plant; he perceived a fine black Persian cat,
the latest pet of the Club, and exclaimed, "What a beautiful,
superb creature!" He called it, and it came, daintily sniffed at
his leg, and leaped on his lap, where he stroked and fondled it.
And all the while he continued to discuss illusion, while Lefevre
poured and drank tea (tea, which Julius would not share: tea, he
said, did not agree with him).</p>

<p>"It bothers me," he said, "to imagine <a name='029.png' id=
'p029.png'></a> how a man like Embro gets any satisfaction out of
life, for ever mumbling the bare dry bones of science. Such a life
as his might as well be passed in the receiver of an air-pump."</p>

<p>"Still the old Julius!" said the doctor, with a smile. "Still
dreaming and wandering, interested in everything, but having
nothing to do!"</p>

<p>"Nothing to do, my dear fellow?" said Julius. "I've all the
world to enjoy!" and he buried his cheek in the soft fur of the
cat.</p>

<p>"A purpose in life, however," said Lefevre, "gives an
extraordinary zest to all enjoyment."</p>

<p>"To live," said Julius, "is surely the purpose of life. Any
smaller, any more obvious purpose, will spoil life, just as it
spoils Art."<a name='030.png' id='p030.png'></a></p>

<p>"I believe, my boy, you are wrong in both," said Lefevre. "Art
without a purpose goes off into all sorts of madness and
extravagance, and so does life."</p>

<p>"You really think so?" said Julius, his attention fixed for an
instant, and looking as if he had set up the point and regarded it
at a distance. "Yes; perhaps it does." But the next moment his
attention seemed given to the cat; he fondled it, and talked to it
soothingly.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," said Lefevre. "Just listen to me, Julius. You
have wonderful intelligence and penetration in everything. You are
fond of science; science needs men like you more than the dull
plodders that usually take to it. When you were in Charbon's class
you were his favourite and his best pupil,&mdash;don't I
remember?&mdash;and <a name='031.png' id='p031.png'></a> if you
liked you could be the greatest physician of the age."</p>

<p>"It is treason to yourself to say such a thing."</p>

<p>"Your fame would soon eclipse mine."</p>

<p>"Fame! fame!" exclaimed Julius, for an instant showing
irritation. "I would not give a penny-piece for fame if all the
magicians of the East came crying it down the streets! Why should I
seek fame? What good would it do me if I had it?"</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Lefevre; "let fame alone: you might be as
unknown as you like, and do a world of good in practice among the
poor."</p>

<p>Julius looked at him, and set the cat down.</p>

<p>"My dear Lefevre," said he, "I did not think you could urge such
common <a name='032.png' id='p032.png'></a> twaddle! You know well
enough,&mdash;nobody knows better,&mdash;first of all, that there
are already more men waiting to do that kind of thing than can find
occupation: why should I go down among them and try to take their
work? And you know, in the next place, that medical philanthropy,
like all other philanthropy, is so overdone that the race is fast
deteriorating; we strive with so much success to keep the sickly
and the diseased alive, that perfect health is scarcely known. Life
without health can be nothing but a weariness: why should it be
reckoned a praiseworthy thing to keep it going at any price? If
life became a burden to me, I should lay it down."</p>

<p>"But," said Lefevre, earnestly, "your life surely is not your
own to do with it what you like!"<a name='033.png' id=
'p033.png'></a></p>

<p>"In the name of truth, Lefevre," answered Julius, "if my life is
not my own, what is? I get its elements from others, but I fashion
it myself, just as much as the sculptor shapes his statue, or the
poet turns his poem. You don't deny to the sculptor the right to
smash his statue if it does not please him, nor to the poet the
right to burn his manuscript;&mdash;why should you deny me the
right to dispose of my life? I know&mdash;I know," said he, seeing
Lefevre open his mouth and raise his hand for another observation,
"that your opinion is the common one, but that is the only sanction
it has; it has the sanction neither of true morality nor of true
religion! But here is the waiter to tell you the carriage is come.
I'm glad. Let us get out into the air and the sunshine."<a name=
'034.png' id='p034.png'></a></p>

<p>The carriage was the doctor's own; his mother, although the
widow of a Court physician, was too poor to maintain much equipage,
but she made what use she pleased of her son's possessions. When
Lady Lefevre saw Julius at the carriage-door, she broke into smiles
and cries of welcome.</p>

<p>"Where have you been this long, long while, Julius?" said she.
"This is Julius Courtney, Nora. You remember Nora, Julius, when she
was a little girl in frocks?"</p>

<p>"She now wears remarkable gowns," chimed in the doctor.</p>

<p>"Which," said Julius, "I have no doubt are becoming."</p>

<p>"My brother," said Nora, with a sunny smile, "is jealous;
because, being a doctor, he must wear only dowdy clothes of dingy
colours."<a name='035.png' id='p035.png'></a></p>

<p>"We have finished at school and college, and been presented at
Court," laughed Lady Lefevre.</p>

<p>"And," broke in the brother, "we have had cards engraved with
our full name, <i>Leonora</i>."</p>

<p>"With all this," said Lady Lefevre, "I hope you won't be afraid
of us."</p>

<p>"I see no reason," said Julius. "For, if I may say so, I like
everything in Nature, and it seems to me Nature has had more to do
with the finishing you speak of than the schoolmistress or the
college professor."</p>

<p>"There he is already," laughed Lady Lefevre, "with his equivocal
compliments. I shouldn't wonder if he says that, my dear, because
you have not yet had more than a word to say for yourself."</p>

<p>By that time Lefevre and Julius were <a name='036.png' id=
'p036.png'></a> seated, and the carriage was rolling along towards
the Park. Julius sat immediately opposite Lady Lefevre, but he
included both her and Nora in his talk and his bright glances. The
doctor sat agreeably suffused with delight and wonder. No one, as
has been seen, had a higher opinion of Courtney's rare powers, or
had had more various evidence of them, than Lefevre, but even he
had never known his friend so brilliant. He was instinct with life
and eloquence. His face shone as with an inner light, and his talk
was bright, searching, and ironical. The amazing thing, however,
was that Julius had as stimulating and intoxicating an influence on
Nora as, it was clear, Nora had on him. His sister had not appeared
to Lefevre hitherto more than a beautiful, healthy, shy girl of
tolerable intelligence; now she <a name='037.png' id='p037.png'>
</a> showed that she had brilliance and wit, and, moreover, that
she understood Julius as one native of a strange realm understands
another. When they entered the Park, they were the observed of all.
And, indeed, Leonora Lefevre was a vision to excite the worship of
those least inclined to idolatry of Nature. She was of the noblest
type of English beauty, and she seemed as calmly unconscious of its
excellence and rarity as one of the grand Greek women of the
Parthenon. She had, however, a sensuous fulness and bloom, a
queenly carriage of head and neck, a clearness of feature, and a
liquid kindness of eye that suggested a deep potentiality of
passion.</p>

<p>They drove round the Row, and round again, and they talked and
laughed their fill of wisdom and frivolity and folly. To <a name=
'038.png' id='p038.png'></a> be foolish wisely and gracefully is a
rare attainment. When they had almost completed their third round,
Julius (who had finished a marvellous story of a fairy princess and
a cat) said, "I can see you are fond of beasts, Miss Lefevre. I
should like to take you to the Zoological Gardens and show you my
favourites there. May we go now, Lady Lefevre?"</p>

<p>"By all means," said Lady Lefevre, "let us go. What do you say,
John?"</p>

<p>"Oh, wherever you like, mother," answered her son.</p>

<p>Arrived in the Gardens, Julius took possession of his
companions, and exerted all his arts to charm and fascinate. He led
the ladies from cage to cage, from enclosure to enclosure, showed
himself as familiar with the characters and habits of their wild
denizens as a farmer is with <a name='039.png' id='p039.png'></a>
those of his stock, and they responded to his strange calls, to his
gentleness and fearlessness, with an alert understanding and
confidence beautiful to see. His favourites were certain creatures
of the deer species, which crowded to their fences to sniff his
clothes, and to lick his hands, which he abandoned to their
caresses with manifest satisfaction. His example encouraged the
queenly Nora and her sprightly mother to feed the beautiful
creatures with bread and buns, and to feel the suffusion of
pleasure derived from the contact of their soft lips with the palm
of the hand. After that they were scarcely astonished when, without
bravado, but clearly with simple confidence and enjoyment, Julius
put his hand within the bars of the lion's cage and scratched the
ears of a lioness, murmuring the while in a strange tongue <a name=
'040.png' id='p040.png'></a> such fond sounds as only those use who
are on the best terms with animals. The great brute rose to his
touch, closing its eyes, and bearing up its head like a cat.</p>

<p>Then came an incident that deeply impressed the Lefevres. Julius
went to a cage in which, he said, there was a recent
arrival&mdash;a leopard from the "Land of the Setting Sun," the
romantic land of the Moors. The creature crouched sulking in the
back of the cage. Julius tapped on the bars, and entreated her in
the language of her native land, "Ya, dudu! ya, lellatsi!" She
bounded to him with a "<i>wir-r-r</i>" of delight, leaned and
rubbed herself against the bars, and gave herself up to be stroked
and fondled. When he left her, she cried after him piteously, and
wistfully watched him out of sight.<a name='041.png' id=
'p041.png'></a></p>

<p>"Do you know the beautiful creature?" asked Lady Lefevre.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Julius quietly; "I brought her over some months
ago."</p>

<p>Lefevre had explained to his mother that Julius had always been
on friendly or fond terms with animals, but never till now had he
seen the remarkable understanding he clearly maintained with
them.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Lady Lefevre to her son as they turned to leave the
Gardens. "He seems to have fascinated Nora as much as the
beasts."</p>

<p>Nora stood a little aloof, regarding Julius in an ecstasy of
admiration. When she found her mother was looking at her, her eyes
sank, and as it were a veil of blushes fell over her. Mother and
son walked on first, and Julius followed with Nora.<a name=
'042.png' id='p042.png'></a></p>

<p>"He is a most charming and extraordinary man," said the
mother.</p>

<p>"He is," said the son, "and amazingly intelligent."</p>

<p>"He seems to know everything, and to have been
everywhere,&mdash;to have been a kind of rolling stone. If anything
should come of this, I suppose he can afford to marry. You ought to
know about him."</p>

<p>"I believe I know as much as any one."</p>

<p>"He has no profession?" queried the lady.</p>

<p>"He has no profession; but I suppose he could afford it," said
Lefevre musingly.</p>

<p>"You don't like the idea," said his mother.</p>

<p>"Not much. I scarce know why. But I somehow think of him as not
having enough sense of the responsibility of life."<a name=
'043.png' id='p043.png'></a></p>

<p>"I suppose his people are of the right sort?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they are; though I don't know if he has any people,"
said he, with a laugh. "He is the kind of man who does not need
parents or relations."</p>

<p>"Still, hadn't you better try to find out what he may have in
that line?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lefevre; "perhaps I had."<a name='044.png' id=
'p044.png'></a></p>

<h2 id='case'>Chapter II.</h2>

<p class='argument'>A Mysterious Case.</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>The</span> two friends returned, as
they had arranged, to the Hyacinth Club for dinner. Courtney's
coruscating brilliancy sank into almost total darkness when they
parted from Lady and Miss Lefevre, and when they sat down to table
he was preoccupied and silent, yet in no proper sense downcast or
dull. Lefevre noted, while they ate, that there was clear
speculation in his eye, that he was not vaguely dreaming, but with
alert intelligence examining some question, or facing some
contingency; and <a name='045.png' id='p045.png'></a> it was
natural he should think that the question or contingency must
concern Nora as much as Julius. Yet he made no overture of
understanding, for he knew that Courtney seldom offered confidence
or desired sympathy; not that he was churlish or reserved, but
simply that he was usually sufficient unto himself, both for
counsel and for consolation. Lefevre was therefore surprised when
he was suddenly asked a question, which was without context in his
own thought.</p>

<p>"Have you ever found something happen or appear," said Julius,
"that completely upsets your point of view, and tumbles down your
scheme of life, like a stick thrust between your legs when you are
running?"</p>

<p>"I have known," said Lefevre, "a new fact arise and upset a
whole scientific <a name='046.png' id='p046.png'></a> theory.
That's often a good thing," he added, with a pointed glance; "for
it compels a reconstruction of the theory on a wider and sounder
basis."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Julius; "that may be. But I should think it does
not often happen that the new fact swallows up all the details that
supported your theory,&mdash;as Aaron's rod, turned into a serpent,
swallowed up the serpent-rods of the magicians of Egypt,&mdash;so
that there is no longer any theory, but only one great, glorious
fact. I do admire," he exclaimed, swerving suddenly, "the
imagination of those old Greeks, with their beautiful, half-divine
personifications of the Spirits of Air and Earth and Sea! But their
imagination never conceived a goddess that embodied them all!"</p>

<p>"I have often thought, Julius," said <a name='047.png' id=
'p047.png'></a> Lefevre, "that you must be some such embodiment
yourself; for you are not quite human, you know."</p>

<p>The doctor said that with a clear recollection of his mother's
request. He hoped that his friend would take the cue, and tell him
something of his family. Julius, however, said nothing but
"Indeed." Lefevre then tried to tempt him into confession by
talking about his own father and mother, and by relating how the
French name "Lefevre" came to be domiciled in England; but Julius
ignored the temptation, and dismissed the question in an eloquent
flourish.</p>

<p>"What does a man want with a family and a name? They only tie
him to the earth, as Gulliver was tied by the people of Lilliput.
We have life and health,&mdash;<i>if</i> we have them,&mdash;and it
is only veiled <a name='048.png' id='p048.png'></a> prurience to
inquire whence we got them. A man can't help having a father and a
mother, I suppose; but he need not be always reminding himself of
the fact: no other creature on earth does. For myself, I wish I
were like that extraordinary person, Melchizedek, without father
and without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of
days nor end of life."</p>

<p>In a little while the friends parted. Lefevre said he had work
to do, but he did not anticipate such work as he had to turn to
that night. Though the doctor was a bachelor, he had a professional
residence apart from his mother and sister. They lived in a small
house in Curzon Street; he dwelt in Savile Row. Savile Row was a
place of consequence long before Regent Street was thought of, but
now they are few who know of <a name='049.png' id='p049.png'></a>
its existence. Fashion ignores it. It is tenanted by small clubs,
learned societies, and doctors. It slumbers in genteel decorum,
with its back to the garish modern thoroughfare. It is always
quiet, but by nine o'clock of a dark evening it is deserted. When
Dr Lefevre, therefore, stepped out of his hired hansom, and
prepared to put his latch-key in his own door, he was arrested by a
hoarse-voiced hawker of evening news bursting in upon the repose of
the Row with a continuous roar of
"Special&mdash;Mystery&mdash;Paper&mdash;Railway&mdash;Special&mdash;Brighton&mdash;Paper&mdash;Victoria&mdash;Special!"
It was with some effort, and only when the man was close at hand,
that he interpreted the sounds into these words.</p>

<p>"Paper, sir," said the man; and he bought it and went in. He
entered his <a name='050.png' id='p050.png'></a> dining-room, and
read the following paragraph;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A Mysterious Case.</p>

<p>"A report has reached us that a young man, about two or four and
twenty years of age, whose name is at present unknown, was found
yesterday (Sunday) to all appearance dead in a first-class carriage
of the 5 P.M. train from Brighton to Victoria. The discovery was
only made at Grosvenor Road Station, where tickets are taken before
entering Victoria. At Victoria the body was searched for purposes
of identification, and there was found upon him a card with the
following remarkable inscription:&mdash;'<i>I am not dead. Take me
to the St. James's Hospital.</i>' To St. James's Hospital
accordingly the young man was conveyed. It seems probable he is in
a condition of trance&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;since he
was provided with the card, and knew the hospital with which is
associated in all men's minds the name of Dr Lefevre, who is so
famous for his skill in the treatment of nervous disorders."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In matters of plain duty Dr Lefevre had got into the excellent
habit of acting first and thinking afterwards. He at once rang the
bell, and ordered the responsible <a name='051.png' id='p051.png'>
</a> serving-man who appeared to call a cab. The man went to the
door and sounded his shrill whistle, grateful to the ears of
several loitering cabbies. There was a mad race of growlers and
hansoms for the open door. Dr Lefevre got into the first hansom
that drew up, and drove off to the hospital. By that time he had
told himself that the young man must be a former patient of his
(though he did not remember any such), and that he ought to see him
at once, although it is not customary for the visiting physician of
a hospital to appear, except between fixed hours of certain days.
He made nothing of the mystery which the newspaper wished, after
the manner of its kind, to cast about the case, and thought of
other things, while he smoked cigarettes, till he reached the
hospital. The house-physician <a name='052.png' id='p052.png'></a>
was somewhat surprised by his appearance.</p>

<p>"I have just read that paragraph," said Lefevre, handing him the
paper.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir," said the house-physician. "The man was brought in
last night. Dr Dowling" [the resident assistant-physician] "saw
him, and thought it a case of ordinary trance, that could easily
wait till you came, as usual, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Lefevre, "let me see him."</p>

<p>Seen thus, the physician appeared a different person from the
cheerful, modest man of the Hyacinth Club. He had now put on the
responsibility of men's health and the enthusiasm of his
profession. He seemed to swell in proportions and dignity, though
his eye still beamed with a calm and kindly light.<a name='053.png'
id='p053.png'></a></p>

<p>The young man led the way down the echoing flagged passage, and
up the flight of stone stairs. As they went they encountered many
silent female figures, clean and white, going up or down (it was
the time of changing nurses), so that a fanciful stranger might
well have thought of the stairway reaching from earth to heaven, on
which the angels of God were seen ascending and descending. A
stranger, too, would have noted the peculiar odours that hung about
the stairs and passages, as if the ghosts of medicines escaped from
the chemist's bottles were hovering in the air. Opening first an
outer and then an inner door, Lefevre and his companion entered a
large and lofty ward. The room was dark, save for the light of the
fire and of a shaded lamp, by which, within a screen, the
night-nurse <a name='054.png' id='p054.png'></a> sat conning her
list of night-duties. The evening was just beginning out of
doors,&mdash;shop-fronts were flaring, taverns were becoming noisy,
and brilliantly-lit theatres and music-halls were settling down to
business,&mdash;but here night and darkness had set in more than an
hour before. Indeed, in these beds of languishing, which stretched
away down either side of the ward, night was hardly to be
distinguished from day, save for the sunlight and the occasional
excitement of the doctor's visit; and many there were who cried to
themselves in the morning, "Would God it were evening!" and in the
evening, "Would God it were morning!" But there was yet this other
difference, that disease and doctor, fear and hope, gossip and
grumbling, newspaper and Bible and tract, were all forgotten in <a
name='055.png' id='p055.png'></a> the night, for some time at
least, and Nature's kind restorer, sleep, went softly round among
the beds and soothed the weary spirits into peace.</p>

<p>Lefevre and the house-physician passed silently up the ward
between the rows of silent blue-quilted beds, while the nurse came
silently to meet them with her lamp. Lefevre turned aside a moment
to look at a man whose breathing was laboured and stertorous. The
shaded light was turned upon him: an opiate had been given him to
induce sleep; it had performed its function, but, as if resenting
its bondage, it was impishly twitching the man's muscles and
catching him by the throat, so that he choked and started. Dr
Lefevre raised the man's eyelid to look at his eye: the upturned
eye stared out upon him, but the man slept on. He put his hand on
the <a name='056.png' id='p056.png'></a> man's forehead (he had a
beautiful hand&mdash;the hand of a born surgeon and
healer&mdash;fine but firm, the expression of nervous force), and
with thumb and finger stroked first his temples and then his neck.
The spasmodic twitching ceased, and his breath came easy and
regular. The house-doctor and the nurse looked at each other in
admiration of this subtle skill, while Lefevre turned away and
passed on.</p>

<p>"Where is the man?" said he.</p>

<p>"Number Thirteen," answered the house-doctor, leading the
way.</p>

<p>The lamp was set on the locker beside the bed of Thirteen,
screens were placed round to create a seclusion amid the living,
breathing silence of the ward, and Lefevre proceeded to examine the
unconscious patient who had so strangely put himself in his
hands.<a name='057.png' id='p057.png'></a></p>

<p>He was young and well-favoured, and, it was evident from the
firmness of his flesh, well-fed. Lefevre considered his features a
moment, shook his head, and murmured, "No; I don't think I've seen
him before." He turned to the nurse and inquired concerning the
young man's clothes: they were evidently those of a gentleman, she
said,&mdash;of one, at least, who had plenty of money. He turned
again to the young man. He raised the left arm to feel the heart,
but, contrary to his experience in such cases, the arm did not
remain as he bent it, nor did the eyes open in obedience to the
summons of the disturbed nerves. The breathing was scarcely
perceptible, and the beating of the heart was faint.</p>

<p>"A strange case," said Lefevre in a low voice to his young
comrade&mdash;"the <a name='058.png' id='p058.png'></a> strangest
I've seen. He does not look a subject for this kind of thing, and
yet he is in the extreme stage of hypnotism. You see." And the
doctor, by sundry tests and applications, showed the peculiar
exhausted and contractive condition of the muscles. "It is very
curious."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the other, "he has been&mdash;&mdash;" and he
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Been what?" asked Lefevre, turning on him his keen look.</p>

<p>"Enjoying himself."</p>

<p>"Having a debauch, you mean? No; I think not. There would then
have probably been some reflex action of the nerves. This is not
that kind of exhaustion; and it is more than mere trance or
catalepsy; it seems the extremest suspensory condition,&mdash;and
that in a young man of such apparent health <a name='059.png' id=
'p059.png'></a> is very remarkable. It will take a long time for
him to recover in the ordinary way with food and sleep," he
continued, rather to himself than to his subordinates. "He needs
rousing,&mdash;a strong stimulant."</p>

<p>"Shall I get some brandy, sir?" asked the nurse.</p>

<p>"Brandy? No. That's not the stimulant he needs."</p>

<p>He was silent for a little, moving the young man's limbs, and
touching certain muscles which his exact anatomical knowledge
taught him to lay his finger on with unerring accuracy. The effect
was startling and grotesque. As a galvanic current applied to the
proper nerves and muscles of a dead body will produce expressions
and actions resembling those of life, so the touch of Lefevre's
finger made the unconscious young man scowl or smile or <a name=
'060.png' id='p060.png'></a> clench his fist according to the
muscles impressed.</p>

<p>"The brain," said Lefevre, "seems quite sound,&mdash;perfectly
passive, you see, but active in its passivity. You can leave us,
nurse," said he; then, turning to the house-physician, he
continued: "I am convinced this is such a peculiar case as I have
often imagined, but have never seen. This nervous-muscular
suspension is complicated with some exhaustive influence. I want
your assistance, and I ask for it like this, because it is
necessary for my purpose that you should give it freely, and
without reserve; I am going to try the electrode."</p>

<p>This was a simple machine contrived by Lefevre, on the model of
the electric cylinder of Du Bois-Reymond, and worked on the theory
that the electricity stored in <a name='061.png' id='p061.png'></a>
the human body can be driven out by the human will along a prepared
channel into another human body.</p>

<p>"I understand," said the assistant promptly. He apprehended his
chief's meaning more fully than the reader can; for he was deeply
interested and fairly skilled in that strange annex of modern
medical science which his chief called psycho-dynamics, and which
old-fashioned practitioners decline to recognise.</p>

<p>"Get me the machine and the insulating sheet," said Lefevre.</p>

<p>While his assistant was gone on his errand, Lefevre with his
right hand gently stroked along the main lines of nerve and muscle
in the upper part of his patient's body; and it was strange to note
how the features and limbs lost a certain constriction and rigidity
which it was manifest <a name='062.png' id='p062.png'></a> they had
had only by their disappearance. When the house-physician returned,
the sheet (a preparation of spun-glass invented by Lefevre) was
drawn under the patient, and the machine, with its vessels of
chemical mixture and its conducting wires, was placed close to the
bed. The handles attached to the wires were put into the patient's
hands.</p>

<p>"Now," said Lefevre, "this is a trying experiment. Give me your
hand&mdash;your left; you know how to do; yes, the other hand on
the machine, with the fingers touching the chemicals. When you feel
strength&mdash;virtue, so to say&mdash;going out of you, don't be
alarmed: let it go; use no effort of the will to keep it back, or
we shall probably fail."</p>

<p>"I understand," repeated the assistant.</p>

<p>Then, holding his hand,&mdash;closely, but <a name='063.png' id=
'p063.png'></a> not so as to constrain the muscles,&mdash;Lefevre
put his own left on the machine according to the direction he had
given his assistant,&mdash;with his fingers, that is, dipping into
the chemicals from plates in the bottom of which the wires
conducted to the patient's hands. A shiver ran through the frame of
both Lefevre and his companion, a convulsive shudder passed upon
the unconscious body, and&mdash;a strange cry rang out upon the
silence of the ward, and Lefevre withdrew his hands. He and the
house-physician looked at each other pale and shaken. The nurse
came running at the cry. Lefevre looked out beyond the screen to
reassure her, and saw in the dim red reflection of the firelight a
sight which struck him gruesomely, used though he was to hospital
sights; all about the ward pale scared figures were <a name=
'064.png' id='p064.png'></a> sitting up in bed, like corpses
suddenly raised from the dead. He bent over his patient, who
presently opened his eyes and stared at him.</p>

<p>"Get some brandy and milk," said Lefevre to his companion.</p>

<p>"Who? Where am I?" murmured the patient in a faint voice.</p>

<p>"I am Dr Lefevre, and this is St. James's Hospital."</p>

<p>"Doctor?&mdash;hospital?&mdash;oh, I'm dreaming!" murmured the
patient.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about that when you have taken some of this," said
Lefevre, as the house-physician reappeared with the nurse, bearing
the brandy and milk.</p>

<p>Lefevre presently told him how he had been found in the train,
and taken for dead till the card&mdash;"this card," said he, taking
it from the top of the locker&mdash;was <a name='065.png' id=
'p065.png'></a> discovered on him. The young man listened in open
amazement, and looked at the card.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of this!" said he. "I never saw the card before!
I never heard your name or the hospital's till a minute ago."</p>

<p>"Your case was strange before," said Lefevre; "this makes it
stranger. Who journeyed with you?"</p>

<p>"A man,&mdash;a nice, strange, oldish fellow in a fur coat." And
the young man wished to enter upon a narrative, when the doctor
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"You're not well enough to talk much now. Tell me to-morrow all
about it."</p>

<p>The doctor returned home, his imagination occupied with the
vision of a train rushing at express speed over the metals, and of
a compartment in the train in <a name='066.png' id='p066.png'></a>
which a young man reclined under the spell of an old man. The young
man's face he saw clearly, but the old man's evaded him like a
dream, and yet he felt he ought to know one who knew the peculiar
repute of the St. James's Hospital. Next day the young man told his
story, which was in effect as follows: He was a subaltern in a
dragoon regiment stationed in Brighton. On Sunday afternoon he had
set out for London on several days' leave. He had taken a seat in a
smoking-carriage, and was preparing to make himself comfortable
with a novel and a cigar, when an elderly gentleman, who looked
like a foreigner, came in as the train was about to move. He
particularly observed the man from the first, because, though it
was a pleasant spring day, he looked pinched and shrunken with cold
in his <a name='067.png' id='p067.png'></a> great fur overcoat, and
because he had remarked him standing on the platform and
scrutinizing the passengers hurrying into the train. The gentleman
sat down in the seat opposite the young officer, and drew his fur
wrap close about him. The young officer could not keep his eyes off
him, and he noted that his features seemed worn thin and arid, as
by passage through terrific peril,&mdash;as if he had been
travelling for many days without sleep and without food, straining
forward to a goal of safety, sick both in stomach and
heart,&mdash;as if he had been rushing, like the maniac of the
Gospel, through dry places, seeking rest and finding none. His
hair, which should have been black, looked lustreless and bleached,
and his skin seemed as if his blood had lost all colour and
generosity, as if nothing but serum flowed in his veins. <a name=
'068.png' id='p068.png'></a> His eyes alone did not look bloodless;
they were weary and extravasated, as from anxious watching. The
young officer's compassion went out to the stranger; for he thought
he must be a conspirator, fleeing probably from the infamous
tyranny of Russian rule. But presently he spoke in such good
English that the idea of his being a Russian faded away.</p>

<p>"Excuse the liberty I take," said he, with a singularly winning
smile; "but let me advise you not to smoke that cigar. I have a
peculiarly sensitive nose for tobacco, and my nose informs me that
your cigar, though good as cigars go, is not fit for you to
smoke."</p>

<p>The young officer was surprised that he was rather charmed than
offended by this impertinence.</p>

<p>"Let me offer you one of these instead," <a name='069.png' id=
'p069.png'></a> said the strange gentleman; "we call them&mdash;I
won't trouble you with the Spanish name&mdash;but in English it
means 'Joys of Spain.'"</p>

<p>The officer took and thanked him for a "Joy of Spain," and found
the flavour and aroma so excellent that, to use his own phrase, he
could have eaten it. He asked the stranger what in particular was
his objection to the other cigar.</p>

<p>"This objection," said he, "which is common to all ill-prepared
tobaccos, that it lowers the vital force. You don't feel that yet,
because you are young and healthy, and gifted with a superabundance
of fine vitality; but you may by smoking one bad cigar bring the
time a day nearer when you must feel it. And even now it would take
a little off the keen edge of the appetite for pleasure. How
little," said <a name='070.png' id='p070.png'></a> he, "do we
understand how to keep ourselves in condition for the complete
enjoyment of life! You, I suppose, are about to take your pleasure
in town, and instead of judiciously tickling and stimulating your
nerves for the complete fulfilment of the pleasures you
contemplate, you begin&mdash;you were beginning, I mean, with your
own cigar&mdash;to dull and stupefy them. Don't you see how foolish
that is?"</p>

<p>The young officer admitted that it was very foolish and very
true; and they talked on thus, the elder exercising a charm over
the younger such as he had never known before in the society of any
man. In a quarter of an hour the young man felt as if he had known
and trusted and loved his neighbour all his life; he felt, he
confessed, so strongly attracted that he could have hugged him. He
told him about his <a name='071.png' id='p071.png'></a> family, and
showed him the innermost secrets of his heart; and all the while he
smoked the delicious "Joy of Spain," and felt more and more
enthralled and fascinated by the stranger's eyes, which, as he
talked, lightened and glowed more and more as their glance played
caressingly about him. He was beginning to wonder at that, when
with some emphatic phrase the stranger laid his fingers on his
knee, upon which a thrill shot through him as if a woman had
touched him. He looked in the stranger's face, and the wonderful
eyes seemed to search to the root of his being, and to draw the
soul out of him. He had a flying thought&mdash;"Can it be a woman,
after all, in this strange shape?" and he knew no more ... till he
woke in the hospital bed.</p>

<p>That was the patient's story.<a name='072.png' id=
'p072.png'></a></p>

<p>"Just look over your property here," said the doctor. "Have you
lost anything?"</p>

<p>The young man turned over his watch and the contents of his
purse, and answered that he had lost nothing.</p>

<p>"Strange&mdash;strange!" said Lefevre&mdash;"very strange! And
the card&mdash;of course the stranger must have put it in your
pocket."</p>

<p>"Which would seem to imply," said the young man, "that <i>he</i>
knows something of the hospital."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lefevre, "we must see what can be done to clear the
mystery up."</p>

<p>"Some of those newspaper-men have been here," said the
house-physician, when they had left the ward, "and they will be
sure to call again before the day is out. Shall I tell them
anything of this?"<a name='073.png' id='p073.png'></a></p>

<p>"Certainly," said Lefevre. "Publicity may help us to discover
this amazing stranger."</p>

<p>"Do you quite believe the story?" asked the house-physician.</p>

<p>"I don't disbelieve it."</p>

<p>"But what did the stranger do to put him in that condition,
which seems something more than hypnotism?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Lefevre, "I don't yet understand it; but there are
forces in Nature which few can comprehend, and which only one here
and there can control and use."<a name='074.png' id=
'p074.png'></a></p>

<h2 id='dolaro'>Chapter III.</h2>

<p class='argument'>"M. Dolaro."</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>Next</span> day men talked, newspaper
in hand, at the breakfast-table, in the early trains, omnibuses,
and tramcars, of the singular railway outrage. It was clear its
purpose was not robbery. What, then, did it mean?
Some&mdash;probably most&mdash;declared it was very plain what it
meant; while others,&mdash;the few,&mdash;after much argument,
confessed themselves quite mystified.</p>

<p>The police, too, were not idle. They made inquiries and took
notes here and there. They discovered that the five <a name=
'075.png' id='p075.png'></a> o'clock train made but two pauses on
its journey to London&mdash;at Croydon and at Clapham Junction. At
neither of those places could a man in a fur coat be heard of as
having descended from the train; and yet it was manifest that he
did not arrive at Grosvenor Road, where tickets were taken. After
persistent and wider inquiries, however, at Clapham Junction (which
was the most likely point of departure), a cabman was found who
remembered having taken up a fare&mdash;a gentleman in a fur
coat&mdash;about the hour indicated. He particularly remarked the
gentleman, because he looked odd and foreign and half tipsy (that
was how he seemed to him), because he was wrapped up "enough for
Father Christmas," and because he asked to be driven such a long
way&mdash;to a well-known hotel near the <a name='076.png' id=
'p076.png'></a> Crystal Palace, where "foreign gents" were fond of
staying. Being asked what in particular had made him think the
gentleman a foreigner, cabby could not exactly say; he believed,
however, it was his coat and his eyes. Of his face he saw little or
nothing, it was so muffled up; yet his tongue was English
enough.</p>

<p>Inquiry was then pushed on to the hotel named by the cabman. A
gentleman in a fur coat had certainly arrived there the evening
before, but no one had seen anything of him after his arrival. He
had taken dinner in his private sitting-room, and had then paid his
bill, because, he said, he must be gone early in the morning. About
half an hour after dinner, when a waiter cleared the things away,
he had gone to his room, and next morning he had left the hotel
soon after dawn. Boots, <a name='077.png' id='p077.png'></a> half
asleep, had seen him walk away, bag in hand, wrapped in his
greatcoat,&mdash;walk away, it would seem, and dissolve into the
mist of the morning, for from that point no further trace could be
got of him. No such figure as his had been seen on any of the roads
leading from the hotel, either by the early milkman, or by the
belated coffee-stall keeper, or night cabman. Being asked what name
the gentleman had given at the hotel, the book-keeper showed her
record, with the equivocal name of "M. Dolaro." The name might be
Italian or Spanish,&mdash;or English or American for that
matter,&mdash;and the initial "M" might be French or anything in
the world.</p>

<p>In the meantime Dr Lefevre had been pondering the details of the
affair, and noting the aspects of his patient's condition; but the
more he noted and pondered, <a name='078.png' id='p078.png'></a>
the more contorted and inexplicable did the mystery become. His
understanding boggled at its very first notes. It was almost
unheard of that a young man of his patient's strong and healthy
constitution and temper should be hypnotised or mesmerised at all,
much less hypnotised to the verge of dissolution; and it was
unprecedented that even a weak, hysterical subject should, after
being unhypnotised, remain so long in prostrate exhaustion. Then,
suppose these circumstances of the case were ordinary, there arose
this question, which refused to be solved: Since it was ridiculous
to suppose that the hypnotisation was a wanton experiment, and
since it had not been for the sake of robbery, what had been its
object?</p>

<p>The interest of the case was emphasised and enlarged by an
article in 'The Daily <a name='079.png' id='p079.png'></a>
Telegraph,' in which was called to mind the singular story in its
Paris correspondence a day or two before, of the young woman in the
H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, which Lefevre had forgotten. The writer remarked
on the points of similarity which the case in the Brighton train
bore to that of the Paris pavement; insisted on the probable
identity of the man in the fur coat with the man in the cloak; and
appealed to Dr Lefevre to explain the mystery, and to the police to
find the man "who has alarmed the civilised world by a new form of
outrage."</p>

<p>Lefevre was piqued by that article, and he went to see his
patient day after day, in the constant hope of finding a solution
of the puzzle that perplexed him. The direction in which he looked
for light will be best suggested by remarking what were <a name=
'080.png' id='p080.png'></a> his peculiar theory and practice.
Lefevre was not a materialistic physician; indeed, in the opinion
of many of his brethren, he erred on the other side, and was too
much inclined to mysticism. It may at least be said that he had an
open mind, and a modest estimate of the discoveries of modern
medical science. He had perceived while still a young man (he was
now about forty) that all medical practice&mdash;as distinct from
surgical&mdash;is inexact and empirical, that, like English common
law, it is based merely on custom, and a narrow range of
experience; and he had therefore argued that a wider experience and
research, especially among decaying nations, might lead to the
discovery of a guiding principle in pathology. That conviction had
taken him as medical officer to Egypt and India, where, amid the
relics of civilisations <a name='081.png' id='p081.png'></a> half
as old as time, he found traditions of a great scientific practice;
and thence it had brought him back to study such foreign medical
writers as Du Bois-Reymond, Nobili, Matteucci, and M&uuml;ller, and
to observe the method of the famous physicians of the
Salp&eacute;tri&egrave;re. Like the great Charbon, he made nervous
and hysterical disorders his specialty, in the treatment of which
he was much given to the use of electricity. He had very pronounced
"views," though he seldom troubled his brethren with them; for he
was not of those who can hold a belief firmly only if it is also
held by others.</p>

<p>More than a week had passed without discovery or promise of
light, when one afternoon he went to the hospital resolved to
compass some explanation.</p>

<p>He walked at once, on entering the <a name='082.png' id=
'p082.png'></a> ward, to the bedside of his puzzling patient, who
still lay limp as a dish-clout and drowsy as a sloth. He
tested&mdash;as he had done almost daily&mdash;his nervous and
respiratory powers with the exact instruments adapted for the
purpose, and then, still unenlightened, he questioned him closely
about his sensations. The young officer answered him with tolerable
intelligence.</p>

<p>"I feel," he ended with saying, "as if all my energy had
evaporated,&mdash;and I used to have no end,&mdash;just as a spirit
evaporates if it is left open to the air."</p>

<p>The saying struck Lefevre mightily. "Energy" stood then to
Lefevre as an almost convertible term for "electricity," and his
successful experiments with electricity had opened up to him a vast
field of conjecture, into which, on the smallest inflaming hint, he
was wont to make an <a name='083.png' id='p083.png'></a> excursion.
Such a hint was the saying of the young officer now, and, as he
walked away, he found himself, as it were, knocking at the door of
a great discovery. But the door did not open on that summons, and
he resolved straightway to discuss the subject with Julius
Courtney, who, though an amateur, had about as complete a knowledge
of it as himself, and who could bring to bear, he believed, a finer
intelligence.</p>

<p>He first sought Julius at the Hyacinth Club, where he frequently
spent the afternoon. Failing to find him there, he inquired for him
at his chambers in the Albany. Hearing nothing of him there, and
the ardour of his quest having cooled a little, he stepped out
across the way to his own home in Savile Row.</p>

<p>There he found a note from his mother, <a name='084.png' id=
'p084.png'></a> with a touch of mystery in its wording. She said
she wanted very much to have a serious conversation with him; she
had been expecting for days to see him, and she begged him to go
that evening to dinner if he could. "Julius," said she, "will be
here, and one or two others."</p>

<p>The mention of Julius as a visitor at his mother's house
reminded him of his promise to that lady to find out how the young
man was connected: engrossed as he had been with his strange case,
he had almost forgotten the promise, and he had done nothing to
fulfil it but tap ineffectually for admission to his friend's
confidence. He therefore considered with some anxiety what he
should do, for Lady Lefevre could on occasion be exacting and
severe with her son. He concluded nothing could be <a name=
'085.png' id='p085.png'></a> done before dinner, but he went
prepared to be questioned and perhaps rated. He was pleased to find
that his mother seemed to have forgotten his promise as much as he
had, and to see her in the best of spirits with a tableful of
company.</p>

<p>"Oh, you have come," said she, presenting her cheek to her son;
"I thought that after all you might be detained by that mysterious
case you have at the hospital. Here's Dr. Rippon&mdash;and Julius
too&mdash;dying to hear all about it;" but she gave no hint of the
serious conversation which she said in her note she desired.</p>

<p>"Not I, Lady Lefevre," Julius protested. "I don't like medical
revelations; they make me feel as if I were sitting at the
confessional of mankind."</p>

<p>Noting by the way that Julius and his sister seemed much taken
up with each <a name='086.png' id='p086.png'></a> other, and that
Julius, while as fascinating as ever, and as ready and apt and
intelligent of speech, seemed somewhat more chastened in manner and
less effervescent in health,&mdash;like a fire of coal that has
spent its gas and settled into a steady glow of heat,&mdash;he
turned to Dr Rippon, a tall, thin old gentleman of over seventy,
but who yet had a keen tongue, and a shrewd, critical eye. He had
been an intimate friend of the elder Lefevre, and the son greeted
him with respect and affection.</p>

<p>"Who is the gentleman?" said Dr Rippon, aside, when their
greeting was over. "It does an old man's heart good to see and hear
him," and the old doctor straightened himself. "But he'll get old
too; that's the sad thing, from my point of view, that such beauty
of person and swift <a name='087.png' id='p087.png'></a>
intelligence of mind <i>must</i> grow old and withered, and slow
and dull. What did you say his name is, John?"</p>

<p>"His name is Courtney&mdash;Julius Courtney," said Lefevre.</p>

<p>"Courtney," mused the old man, stroking his eyebrow; "I once
knew a man of that name, or, rather, who took that name. I wonder
if this friend of yours is of the same family; he is not unlike the
man I knew."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Lefevre, immediately interested, "he may be of the
same family, but I don't know anything of his relations. Who was
the man, may I ask, that you knew?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the old gentleman, settling down to a story, which
Lefevre was sure would be full of interest and contemporary
allusion, for the old physician had in his <a name='088.png' id=
'p088.png'></a> time seen many men and many things&mdash;"it is a
romantic story in its way."</p>

<p>He was on the point of beginning it when dinner was
announced.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear the story when we return to the
drawing-room," said Lefevre.</p>

<p>Over dinner, Lefevre was beset with inquiries about his
mysterious case:&mdash;Was the young man better? Had he been very
ill? Was he handsome? What had the foreign-looking stranger done to
him? and for what purpose had he done it? These questions were
mostly ignorant and thoughtless, and Lefevre either parried them or
answered them with great reserve. When the ladies retired from
table, however, more particular and curious queries were pressed
upon him as to the real character of the outrage upon the young <a
name='089.png' id='p089.png'></a> man. He replied that he had not
yet discovered, though he believed he was getting "warm."</p>

<p>"Is it fair," said Julius, "to ask you in what direction you are
looking for an explanation or revelation?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite fair," said Lefevre, welcoming the question. "To put
it in a word, I look to <i>electricity</i>,&mdash;animal
electricity. I have been for some time working round, and I hope
gradually getting nearer, a scientific secret of enormous&mdash;of
transcendent value. Can you conceive, Julius, of a universal
principle in Nature being got so under control as to form a
universal basis of cure?"</p>

<p>"Can I conceive?" said Julius. "And is that electricity
too?"</p>

<p>"I hope to find it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, how slow!" exclaimed Julius,&mdash;"oh, <a name='090.png'
id='p090.png'></a> how slow you professional scientific men become!
You begin to run on tram-lines, and you can't get off them! Why fix
yourself to call this principle you're seeking for 'electricity'?
It will probably restrict your inquiry, and hamper you in several
ways. I would declare to every scientific man, 'Unless you become
as a little child or a poet, you will discover no great truth!'
Setting aside your bias towards what you call 'electricity,' you
are really hoping to discover something that was discovered or
divined thousands of years ago! Some have called it 'od'&mdash;an
'imponderable fluid'&mdash;as you know; you and others wish to call
it 'electricity.' I prefer to call it 'the spirit of life,'&mdash;a
name simple, dignified, and expressive!"</p>

<p>"It has the disadvantage of being poetic," said Dr Rippon, with
grave irony; <a name='091.png' id='p091.png'></a> "and doctors
don't like poetry mixed up with their science."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> poetic," admitted Julius, regarding the old doctor
with interest, "and therefore it is intelligible. The spirit of
life is electric and elective, and it is 'imponderable:' it can
neither be weighed nor measured! It flows and thrills in the nerves
of men and women, animals and plants, throughout the whole of
Nature! It connects the whole round of the Cosmos by one glowing,
teasing, agonising principle of being, and makes us and beasts and
trees and flowers all kindred!"</p>

<p>"That is all very beautiful and fresh," said Lefevre,
"but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," interrupted Julius, "it is not a new truth: the poet
divined it ages ago! Buddha, thousands of years ago, perceived it,
and taught that 'all life is linked and <a name='092.png' id=
'p092.png'></a> kin;' so did the Egyptians and the Greeks, when
they worshipped the principle of life everywhere; and so did our
own barbaric ancestors, when the woods&mdash;the wonderful, mystic
woods!&mdash;were their temples. Life&mdash;the spirit of
life!&mdash;is always beautiful; always to be desired and
worshipped!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said old Dr Rippon, who had listened to this astonishing
rhapsody with evident interest, with sympathetic and intelligent
eye; "but a time will come even to you, when death will appear more
beautiful and friendly and desirable than life."</p>

<p>Courtney was silent, and looked for a second or two deadly sick.
He cast a searching eye on Dr Rippon.</p>

<p>"That's the one thought," said he, "that makes me sometimes feel
as if I were <a name='093.png' id='p093.png'></a> already under the
horror of the shade. It's not that I am afraid of dying&mdash;of
merely ceasing to live; it is that life may cease to be delightful
and friendly, and become an intolerable, decaying burden."</p>

<p>He filled a glass with Burgundy, and set himself attentively to
drink it, lingering on the bouquet and the flavour. Lefevre beheld
him with surprise, for he had never before seen Julius take wine:
he was wont to say that converse with good company was intoxicating
enough for him.</p>

<p>"Why, Julius," said Lefevre, "that's a new experience you are
trying,&mdash;is it not?"</p>

<p>Julius looked embarrassed an instant, and then replied, "I have
begun it very recently. I did not think it wise to postpone the
experience till it might become an absolute necessity."<a name=
'094.png' id='p094.png'></a></p>

<p>Old Dr Rippon watched him empty the glass with a musing eye. "'I
sought in mine heart,'" said he, gravely quoting, "'to give myself
unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom.'"</p>

<p>"True," said Julius, considering him closely. "But, for
completeness' sake, you ought to quote also, 'Whatsoever mine eyes
desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any
joy.'"</p>

<p>Lefevre looked from the one to the other in some darkness of
perplexity.</p>

<p>"You appear, John," said the old doctor, with a smile, "not to
know one of the oldest and greatest of books: you will find it
included in your Bible. Mr Courtney clearly knows it. I should not
be surprised to hear he had adopted its philosophy of 'wisdom and
madness and folly.'"<a name='095.png' id='p095.png'></a></p>

<p>"Surely you cannot say," remarked Julius, "that the writer of
that book had what is called a 'philosophy.' He was moved by an
irresistible impulse, of which he gives you the explanation when he
uses that magnificent sentence about having 'the world set in his
heart.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old doctor, in a subdued, backward voice,
regarding Julius with the contemplative eyes of memory. "You will,
I hope, forgive me when I say that you remind me very much of a
gentleman who took the name of Courtney. I knew him years ago: was
he a relation of yours, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Julius, seeming scarcely interested; "though
the name of Courtney, I believe, is not very uncommon." Then,
turning to Lefevre, he said, "I hope you don't think I wish to make
light of your <a name='096.png' id='p096.png'></a> grand idea. I
only mean that you must widen your view, if you would work it out
to success."</p>

<p>With that Lefevre became more curious to hear Dr Rippon's story.
So when they went to the drawing-room he got the old gentleman into
a secluded corner, and reminded him of his promise.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor, "it is a romantic story. About forty
years ago,&mdash;yes, about forty: it was immediately after the
fall of Louis Philippe,&mdash;I went with my friend Lord Rokeby to
Madrid. He went as ambassador, and I as his physician. There was
then at the Spanish Court a very handsome hidalgo, Don
Hernando&mdash;I forget all his names, but his surname was De
Sandoval. He was of the bluest blood in Spain, and a marquis, but
poor as a church mouse. He had a great reputation <a name='097.png'
id='p097.png'></a> for gallant adventures and for mysterious
scientific studies. On the last ground I sought and cultivated his
acquaintance. But he was a proud, reserved person, and I could
never quite make out what his studies were, except that he read a
great deal, and believed firmly in the Arabic philosophers and
alchemists of the middle ages; and he would sometimes talk with the
same sort of rhapsodical mysticism as this young man delights you
with. We did not have much opportunity for developing an intimacy
in any case; for he fell in love with the daughter of our Chief
Secretary of Legation, a bright, lovely English girl, and that
ended disastrously for his position in Madrid. He made his
proposals to her father, and had them refused; chiefly, I believe,
on account of his loose reputation. The girl, too, was <a name=
'098.png' id='p098.png'></a> the heiress of an uncle's property on
this curious condition, it appeared,&mdash;that whoever should
marry her should take the uncle's name of <i>Courtney</i>. Don
Hernando and the young lady disappeared; they were married, and he
took the name of Courtney, and was forbidden to return to Madrid.
He and his wife settled in Paris, where I used to meet them
frequently; then they travelled, I believe, and I lost sight of
them. I returned to Paris on a visit some few years ago, and I
asked an old friend about the Courtneys; he believed they were both
dead, though he could give me no certain news about them."</p>

<p>"Supposing," said Lefevre, "that this Julius were their son, do
you know of any reason why he should be reserved about his
parentage?"<a name='099.png' id='p099.png'></a></p>

<p>"No," said the old man, "no;&mdash;unless it be that Hernando
was not episcopal in his affections; but I should think the young
man is scarcely Puritan enough to be ashamed of that."</p>

<p>Lefevre and the old man both looked round for Julius. They
caught sight of him and Leonora Lefevre standing one on either side
of a window, with their eyes fixed upon each other.</p>

<p>"The young lady," said the old doctor, "seems much taken up with
him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lefevre; "and she's my sister."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the old doctor; "I fear my remark was rather
unreserved."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Lefevre.</p>

<p>He left Dr Rippon, to seek his mother. He found her excited and
warm, and without a word to spare for him.<a name='100.png' id=
'p100.png'></a></p>

<p>"You wanted," said he, "some serious talk with me, mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said she; "but I can't talk seriously now: I can
scarcely talk at all. But do you see how Nora and Julius are taken
up with each other? I never before saw such a pair of moonstruck
mortals! I believe I have heard of the moon having a magnetic
influence on people: do you think it has? But he is a charming
man!"&mdash;glancing towards Julius&mdash;"I'm more than half in
love with him myself. Now I must go. Come quietly one afternoon,
and then we can talk."</p>

<p>Her son abstained from recounting, as he had proposed to
himself, what he had heard from Dr Rippon: he would reserve it for
the quiet afternoon. He took his leave almost immediately, bearing
with him a deep impression&mdash;like a strongly <a name='101.png'
id='p101.png'></a> bitten etching wrought on his memory&mdash;of
his last glimpse of the drawing-room: Nora and Julius set talking
across a small table, and the tall, pale, gaunt figure of Dr Rippon
approaching and stooping between them. It seemed a sinister
reminder of the words the old doctor had addressed to
Julius,&mdash;"<i>A time will come when death will appear more
beautiful and friendly and desirable than life!</i>"<a name=
'102.png' id='p102.png'></a></p>

<h2 id='man'>Chapter IV.</h2>

<p class='argument'>The Man of the Crowd.</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>In</span> a few days Dr Lefevre found a
quiet afternoon, and went and told his mother the story of the
Spanish marquis which he had got from Dr Rippon. She hailed the
story with delight. Courtney was a fascinating figure to her
before: it needed but that to clothe him with a complete romantic
heroism; for, of course, she did not doubt that he was the son of
the Spanish grandee. She wished to put it to him at once whether he
was not, but she was dissuaded by her son from mentioning the
matter yet to either Julius or her daughter.<a name='103.png' id=
'p103.png'></a></p>

<p>"If he wishes," said Lefevre, "to keep it secret for some
reason, it would be an impertinence to speak about it. We shall,
however, have a perfect right to ask him about himself if his
attentions to Nora go on."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards (it was really a fortnight; but in a busy life
day melts into day with amazing rapidity), Lefevre was surprised at
dinner, and somewhat irritated, by a letter from his mother. She
wrote that they had seen nothing of Julius Courtney for three or
four days,&mdash;which was singular, since for the past three or
four weeks he had been a daily visitor; latterly he had begun to
look fagged and ill, and it was possible he was confined to his
room,&mdash;though, after all, that was scarcely likely, for he had
not answered a note of inquiry which she had sent. She <a name=
'104.png' id='p104.png'></a> begged her son to call at his
chambers, the more so as Nora was pining in Julius's absence to a
degree which made her mother very anxious.</p>

<p>With professional suspicion Lefevre told himself that if Julius,
with his magnificent health, was fallen ill, it must be for some
outrageous reason. But even if he was ill, he need not be
unmannerly: he might have let his friends who had been in the habit
of seeing him daily know what had come to him. Was it possible, the
doctor thought, that he was repenting of having given Nora and her
mother so much cause to take his assiduous attentions seriously? He
resolved to see Julius at once, if he were at his chambers.</p>

<p>He left his wine unfinished (to the delight of his grave and
silent man in black), hastily took his hat from its peg in <a name=
'105.png' id='p105.png'></a> the hall, and passed out into the
street, while his man held the door open. In two minutes he had
passed the northern gateway of the Albany, which, as most people
know, is just at the southern end of Savile Row. Courtney's door
was speedily opened in response to his peremptory summons.</p>

<p>"Is your master at home, Jenkins?" asked Lefevre of the
well-dressed serving-man, who looked distinguished enough to be
master himself.</p>

<p>"No, doctor," answered Jenkins; "he is not."</p>

<p>"Gone out," said Lefevre, "to the club or to dinner, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, doctor," repeated Jenkins; "he is not. He went away four
days ago."</p>

<p>"Went away!" exclaimed Lefevre.</p>

<p>"He do sometimes go away by himself, <a name='106.png' id=
'p106.png'></a> sir. He is so fond of the country, and he likes to
be by himself. It is the only thing that do him good."</p>

<p>"Becomes solitary, does he?" said Lefevre. "Yes; intelligent,
impulsive persons like him, that live at high pressure, often have
black moods." That was not quite what he meant, but it was enough
for Jenkins.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jenkins; "he do sometimes have 'em black. He
don't seem to take no pride in himself, as he do usual&mdash;don't
seem to care somehow if he look a gentleman or a common man."</p>

<p>"But your master, Jenkins," said Lefevre, "can never look a
common man."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Jenkins; "he cannot, whatever he do."</p>

<p>"He is gone into the country, then?" asked Lefevre.<a name=
'107.png' id='p107.png'></a></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I packed his small port-mantew for him four days
ago."</p>

<p>"And where is he gone? He told you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; he do not usual tell me when he is like that."</p>

<p>It did not seem possible to learn anything from Jenkins, in
spite of the apparent intimacy of his conversation, so Lefevre left
him, and returned to his own house. He had sat but a little while
in his laboratory (where he had been occupying his small intervals
of leisure lately in electrical studies and experiments) when, as
chance would have it, the last post brought him a note from Dr
Rippon. Its purport was curious.</p>

<p>"<i>I think</i>," the letter ran, "<i>you were sufficiently
interested in the story I told you some week or two ago about one
Hernando <a name='108.png' id='p108.png'></a> Courtney, not to be
bored by a note on the same subject. Last night I accompanied my
daughter and son-in-law to the Lyceum Theatre. On coming out we had
to walk down Wellington Street into the Strand to find our
carriage, and in the surging crowd about there I am almost sure I
saw the Hernando Courtney whom I believed to be dead</i>. Aut
Courtney aut Diabolus. <i>I have never heard satisfactory evidence
of his death, and I should very much like to know if he is really
still alive and in London. It has occurred to me that, considering
the intimacy of yourself and your family with the gentleman who was
made known to me at your mother's house by the name of Courtney,
you may have heard by now the rights of the case. If you have any
news, I shall be glad to share it with you."</i><a name='109.png'
id='p109.png'></a></p>

<p>Considering this in association with the absence of Julius,
Lefevre found his wits becoming involved in a puzzle. He could not
settle to work, so he put on overcoat and hat, and sallied out
again. He had no fixed purpose: he only felt the necessity of
motion to resolve himself back into his normal calm. The air was
keen from the east. May, which had opened with such wanton warmth
and seductiveness, turned a cold shoulder on the world as she took
herself off. It was long since he had indulged in an evening walk
in the lamp-lit streets, so he stepped out eastward against the
shrewd wind. Insensibly his attention forsook the busy and anxious
present, and slipped back to the days of golden and romantic youth,
when the crowded nocturnal streets were full of the mystery of
life. He recalled the sensations of those <a name='110.png' id=
'p110.png'></a> days&mdash;the sharp doubts of self, the frequent
strong desires to drink deep of all that life had to offer, and the
painful recoils from temptation, which he felt would ruin, if
yielded to, his hope of himself, and his ambition of filling a
worthy place among men.</p>

<p>Thus musing, he walked on, taking, without noting it, the most
frequented turnings, and soon he found himself in the Strand. It
was that middle time of evening, after the theatres and restaurants
have sucked in their crowds, when the frequenters of the streets
have some reserve in their vivacity, before reckless roisterers
have begun to taste the lees of pleasure, and to shout and jostle
on the pavements. He was walking on the side of the way next the
river, when, near the Adelphi, he became aware of a man before <a
name='111.png' id='p111.png'></a> him, wearing a slouch-hat and a
greatcoat&mdash;a man who appeared to choose the densest part of
the throng, to prefer to be rubbed against and hustled rather than
not. There was something about the man which held Lefevre's
attention and roused his curiosity&mdash;something in the swing of
his gait and the set of his shoulders. The man, too, seemed urged
on by a singular haste, which permitted him to be the slowest and
easiest of passengers in the thick of the crowd, but carried him
swiftly over the less frequented parts of the pavement. The doctor
began to wonder if he was a pickpocket, and to look about for the
watchful eye of a policeman. He kept close behind him past the door
of the Strand Theatre, when the throng became slacker, and the man
turned quickly about and returned the way he had come. Then <a
name='112.png' id='p112.png'></a> Lefevre had a glimpse of his
face,&mdash;the merest passing glimpse, but it made him pause and
ask himself where he had seen it before. A dark, foreign-looking
man, with a haggard appeal in his eye: he tried to find the place
of such a figure in his memory, but for the time he tried in
vain.</p>

<p>Before the doctor recovered himself the man was well past, and
disappearing in the throng. He hurried after, determined to
overtake him, and to make a full and satisfying perusal of his face
and figure. He found that difficult, however, because of the man's
singular style of progression. To maintain an even pace for
himself, moreover, Lefevre had to walk very much in the roadway,
the dangers of which, from passing cabs and omnibuses, forbade his
fixing his attention on the man alone. Yet he was more and more
piqued to look <a name='113.png' id='p113.png'></a> him in the
face; for the longer he followed him the more he was struck with
the oddity of his conduct. He had already noted how he hurried over
the empty spaces of pavement and lingered sinuously in the thronged
parts; he now remarked further that those who came into immediate
contact with him (and they were mostly young people who were to be
met with at that season of the night) glanced sharply at him, as if
they had experienced some suspicious sensation, and seemed inclined
to remonstrate, till they looked in his face.</p>

<p>Lefevre could not arrive at a clear front view till, by Charing
Cross Station, the man turned on the kerb to look after a handsome
youth who crossed before him, and passed over the road. Then the
doctor saw the face in the light of a street-lamp, and the sight
sent the blood <a name='114.png' id='p114.png'></a> in a gush from
his heart. It was a dark hairless face, terribly blanched and
emaciated, as if by years of darkness and prison, with the impress
of age and death, but yet with a wistful light in the eyes, and a
firm sensuousness about the mouth that betrayed a considerable
interest in life. He turned his eyes away an instant, to bring
memory and association to bear. When he looked again the man was
moving away. At once recognition rushed upon him like a wave of
light. The terribly worn, ghastly features resolved themselves into
a kind of death-mask of Julius! The wave recoiled and smote him
again. Who could the man be, therefore, who was so like Julius, and
yet was not Julius?&mdash;who could he be but Julius's
father,&mdash;that Hernando Courtney whom Dr Rippon believed he had
seen the evening before?<a name='115.png' id='p115.png'></a></p>

<p>Here was a coil to unravel! Julius's father&mdash;the Spanish
marquis that was&mdash;supposed to be dead, but yet wandering in
singular fashion about the London streets, clearly not desiring,
much less courting, opportunities of being recognised; Julius not
caring to speak of his father, apparently ignoring his continued
existence, and yet apparently knowing enough of his movements to
avoid him when he came to London by suddenly removing "into the
country" without leaving his address. What was the meaning of so
much mystery? Crime? debt? political intrigue? or, what?</p>

<p>The mysterious Hernando went on his way, by the southern sweep
of Trafalgar Square and Cockspur Street, to the Haymarket, and
Lefevre followed with attention and curiosity bent on him, but yet
<a name='116.png' id='p116.png'></a> with so little thought of
playing spy that, if Hernando had gone any other way or had
returned along the Strand, he would probably have let him go. And
as they went on, the doctor could not but note, as before, how the
object of his curiosity lingered wherever there was a press of
people, whether on the pavement or on a refuge at a crossing, and
hurried on wherever the pavement was sparsely peopled or whenever
the persons encountered were at all advanced in years. Indeed, the
farther he followed the more was his attention compelled to remark
that Hernando sharply avoided contact with the weakly, the old, and
the decrepit, and wonder why the young people of either sex whom he
brushed against should turn as if the touch of him waked suspicion
and a something hostile. Thus they traversed <a name='117.png' id=
'p117.png'></a> the Haymarket, the Criterion pavement, and,
flitting across to the Quadrant, the more popular side of Regent
Street, among pushing groups, weary stragglers, and steady
pedestrians. Lefevre had a mind to turn aside and go home when he
was opposite Vigo Street, but he was drawn on by the hope of
observing something that might give him a clue to the Courtney
mystery. When Oxford Circus was reached, however, Hernando jumped
into a cab and drove rapidly off, and Lefevre returned to his own
fireside.</p>

<p>He sat for some time over a cigar and a grog, walking in
imagination round and round the mystery, which steadfastly refused
to dissolve or to be set aside. His own honour, and perhaps the
peace of his mother and sister, were involved in it. He was
resolved to ask Julius for an explanation <a name='118.png' id=
'p118.png'></a> as soon as he could come to speech with him; but
yet, in spite of that assurance which he gave himself, he returned
to the mystery again and again, and beset and bewildered himself
with questions: Why was Julius estranged from his father? What was
the secret of the old man's life which had left such an awful
impress on his face? And why was he nightly haunting the busiest
pavements of London, in the crowd, but not of it, urged on as by
some desire or agony?</p>

<p>He went to bed, but not to sleep. In the quiet and the darkness
his imagination ranged without constraint over the whole field of
his questionings. He went back upon Dr Rippon's story of the
Spanish marquis, and fixed on the mention of his occult studies. He
saw him, in fancy, without wife or son, cut off from the position
<a name='119.png' id='p119.png'></a> and activities in his native
country which his proper rank would have given him, sequester
himself from society altogether, and give himself up to the study
of those Arabian sages and alchemists in whom he had delighted when
he was a young man. He saw him shun the daylight, and sleep its
hours away, and then by night abandon himself like another
Cagliostro to strange experiments with alembic and crucible,
breathing acrid and poisonous vapours, seeking to extort from
Nature her yet undiscovered secrets,&mdash;the Philosophers Stone,
and the Elixir of Life. He saw him turn for a little from his
strange and deadly experiments, and venture forth to show his
blanched and worn face among the throngs of men; but even there he
still pursued his anxious quest of life in the midst of death. He
<a name='120.png' id='p120.png'></a> saw him wander up and down, in
and out, among the evening crowd, delighting in contact with such
of his fellow-creatures as had health and youth, and seeking,
seeking&mdash;he knew not what. From this phantasmagoria he dozed
off into the dark plains of sleep; but even there the terribly
blanched and emaciated face was with him, bending wistful worn eyes
upon him and melting him to pity. And still again the vision of the
streets would arise about the face, and the sleeper would be aware
of the man to whom the face belonged walking quickly and sinuously,
seeking and enjoying contact with the throng, and strangely causing
many to resent his touch as if they had been pricked or stung, and
yet urged onward in some further quest,&mdash;an anxious quest it
sometimes resolved itself into for Julius, who ever evaded him.<a
name='121.png' id='p121.png'></a></p>

<p>Thus his brain laboured through the dead hours of the night,
viewing and reviewing these scenes and figures, to extract a
meaning from them; but he was no nearer the heart of the mystery
when the morning broke and he was waked by the shrill chatter of
the sparrows. The day, however, brought an event which shed a lurid
light upon the Courtney difficulty, and revealed a vital connection
between facts which Lefevre had not guessed were related.<a name=
'122.png' id='p122.png'></a></p>

<h2 id='fane'>Chapter V.</h2>

<p class='argument'>The Remarkable Case of Lady Mary Fane.</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>It</span> was the kind of day that is
called seasonable. If the sun had been obscured, the air would have
been felt to be wintry; but the sunshine was full and warm, and so
the world rejoiced, and declared it was a perfectly lovely May
day,&mdash;just as a man who is charmed with the smiles and beauty
of a woman, thinks her complete though she may have a heart of ice.
Lefevre, as he went his hospital round that afternoon, found his
patients revelling in the sunlight like flies. He himself was in
excellent spirits, and he said a cheery or <a name='123.png' id=
'p123.png'></a> facetious word here and there as he passed, which
gave infinite delight to the thin and bloodless atomies under his
care; for a joke from so serious and awful a being as the doctor is
to a desponding patient better than all the drugs of the
pharmacopoeia: it is as exquisite and sustaining as a divine text
of promise to a religious enthusiast.</p>

<p>Dr Lefevre was thus passing round his female ward, with a train
of attentive students at his heels, when the door was swung open
and two attendants entered, bearing a stretcher between them, and
accompanied by the house-physician and a policeman.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked Lefevre, with a touch of severity; for it
was irregular to intrude a fresh case into a ward while the
physician was going his round.<a name='124.png' id=
'p124.png'></a></p>

<p>"I thought, sir," said the house-physician, "you would like to
see her at once: it seems to me a case similar to that of the man
found in the Brighton train."</p>

<p>"Where was this lady found?" asked Lefevre of the policeman. He
used the word "lady" advisedly, for though the dress was that of a
hospital nurse or probationer, the unconscious face was that of an
educated gentlewoman. "Why, bless my soul!" he cried, upon more
particular scrutiny of her features&mdash;"it seems to me I know
her! Surely I do! Where did you say she was found?"</p>

<p>The policeman explained that he was on his beat outside St
James's Park, when a park-keeper called him in and showed him, in
one of the shady walks, the lady set on a bench as if she had <a
name='125.png' id='p125.png'></a> fainted. The keeper said he had
taken particular notice of her, because he saw from her dress and
her veil she was a hospital lady. When he first set eyes on her, an
old gentleman was sitting talking to her&mdash;a strange, dark,
foreign-looking gentleman, in a soft hat and a big Inverness
cape.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the doctor. "The very man! That's the
meaning of it. And I did not guess!"</p>

<p>His assistant and the policeman gazed at him in surprise; but he
recovered himself and asked, with a serious and determined knitting
of the brows, if the policeman had seen the old gentleman. The
policeman replied he had not; the gentleman was nowhere to be seen
when he was called in. The keeper saw him only once; when he
returned that way <a name='126.png' id='p126.png'></a> again, in
about a quarter of an hour, he found the lady alone and apparently
asleep. She had a very handsome umbrella by her side, and therefore
he kept within eye-shot of her on this side and on that, lest some
park-loafer should seize so good a chance of thieving. He thus
passed her two or three times. The last time, he remarked that she
had slipped a little to one side, and that her umbrella had fallen
to the ground. He went to pick it up, and it struck him as he bent
that she looked strangely quiet and pale. He spoke to her; she made
no reply. He touched her&mdash;he even in his fear ventured to
shake her&mdash;but she made no sign; and he ran to call the
policeman. They then brought her straight to the hospital, because
they could see she was a hospital lady of some sort.<a name=
'127.png' id='p127.png'></a></p>

<p>"It must&mdash;it must be the same!" said Lefevre.</p>

<p>"I thought, when I first heard of it below," said the
house-physician, "that it must be the same man as was the cause of
the other case, in the Brighton train."</p>

<p>"No doubt it is the same. But I was thinking of it in
another&mdash;a far more serious sense!" Then turning to the
waiting policeman, he said, "Of course, you must report this to
your inspector?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the policeman.</p>

<p>"Give him my compliments, then, and say I shall see him
presently."</p>

<p>Yet, he thought, how could he speak to the official, with all
that he suspected, all that he feared, in his heart? With his
attention on the <i>qui vive</i> with his experiences and
speculations of the night, he was seized, as we have seen, by the
<a name='128.png' id='p128.png'></a> conclusion that the "strange,
dark, foreign-looking gentleman" of the park-keeper's story was the
same whose steps he had followed the evening before, without
guessing that the man was perambulating the pavement and passing
among the crowd in search, doubtless, of a fresh victim for occult
experiment or outrage! That conclusion once determined, shock after
shock smote upon his sense. What if the mysterious person were
really proved to be Julius's father? What if he had entered upon a
course of experiment or outrage (he passed in rapid review the
mysteries of the Paris pavement and the Brighton train, and this of
the Park)&mdash;outrage yet unnamable because unknown, but which
would amaze and confound society, and bring signal punishment upon
the offender? And what&mdash;what if Julius <a name='129.png' id=
'p129.png'></a> knew all that, and therefore sought to keep his
parentage hidden?</p>

<p>"She is ready, doctor," said the Sister of the ward at his
elbow, adding with a touch of excitement in her manner as he turned
to her, "do you know who she is? Look at this card; we noticed the
name first on her linen."</p>

<p>Dr Lefevre looked at the card and read, "Lady Mary Fane, Carlton
Gardens, S.W."</p>

<p>"I suspected as much," said he. "Lord Rivercourt's daughter.
It's a bad business. She has been learning at St Thomas's the
duties of nurse and dresser, which accounts for her being in that
uniform."</p>

<p>He went to the bed on which his new patient had been laid, and
very soon satisfied himself that her case was similar to that of
the young officer, though graver <a name='130.png' id='p130.png'>
</a> much than it. He wrote a telegram to Lord Rivercourt, sent the
house-physician for his electrical apparatus, and returned to the
bedside. He looked at his patient. He had not remarked her hitherto
more than other women of his acquaintance, though he had sometimes
sat at her father's table; but now he was moved by a beauty which
was enhanced by helplessness&mdash;a beauty stamped with a calm
disregard of itself&mdash;the manifest expression of a noble and
loving soul, which had lived above the plane of doubt and fear and
gusty passion. Her wealth of lustrous black hair lay abroad upon
her pillow, and made an admirable setting for her finely-modelled
head and neck. As he looked at this excellent presentment, and
thought of the intelligence and activity which had been wont to
animate it, resentment rose in <a name='131.png' id='p131.png'></a>
him against the man who, for whatever end, had subdued the noble
woman to that condition, and a deep impatience penetrated him that
he had not discovered&mdash;had even scarcely guessed&mdash;the
purpose or the method of the subjugation!</p>

<p>It was, however, not speculation but action that was needed
then. The apparatus described in the case of the young officer was
ready, and the house-physician was waiting to give his assistance.
The stimulation of Will and Electricity was applied to resuscitate
the patient&mdash;but with the smallest success: there was only a
faint flutter, a passing slight rigidity of the muscles, and all
seemed again as it had been. The exhausting nature of the operation
or experiment forbade its immediate repetition. Disappointment
pervaded <a name='132.png' id='p132.png'></a> the doctor's being,
though it did not appear in the doctor's manner.</p>

<p>"We'll try again in half an hour," said he to his assistant, and
turned away to complete his round of the ward.</p>

<p>At the end of the half-hour, Lefevre and the house-physician
were again by Lady Mary's bedside. Again, with fine but firm touch,
Lefevre stroked nerves and muscles to stimulate them into normal
action; again he and his assistant put out their electrical force
through the electrode; and again the result was nothing but a
passing galvanic quiver. The doctor, though he maintained his
professional calm, was smitten with alarm,&mdash;as a man is who,
walking through darkness and danger to the rescue of a friend,
finds himself stopped by an unscalable wall. While he sought fresh
means of help, his patient might pass <a name='133.png' id=
'p133.png'></a> beyond his reach. He did not think she
would&mdash;he hoped she would not; but her condition, so
obstinately resistant to his restoratives, was so peculiar, that he
could not in the least determine the issue. Imagination and
speculation were excited, and he asked himself whether, after all,
the explanation of his failure might not be of the simplest&mdash;a
difference of sex! The secrets of nature, so far as he had
discovered, were of such amazing simplicity, that it would not
surprise him now to find that the electrical force of a man varied
vitally from that of a woman. He explained this suspicion to his
assistant.</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "we must make another attempt, for her
condition may become the more serious the longer it is left. We'll
set the Sister and the nurse to try this time, and we'll turn her
bed north <a name='134.png' id='p134.png'></a> and south, in the
line of the earth's magnetism." But just then the lady's father,
the old Lord Rivercourt, appeared in response to the doctor's
telegram, and the experiment with the women had to wait. The old
lord was naturally filled with wonder and anxiety when he saw his
apparently lifeless daughter. He was amazed that she should have
been overcome by such influence as, he understood, the old
gentleman must wield. She had always, he said, enjoyed the finest
health, and was as little inclined to hysteria as woman well could
be. Lefevre told the father that this was something other than
hystero-hypnotism, which, while it reassured him as to his
daughter's former health, made him the more anxious regarding her
present condition.</p>

<p>"It is very extraordinary," said the old <a name='135.png' id=
'p135.png'></a> lord; "but whatever it is,&mdash;and you say it is
like the young man's case that we have all read
about,&mdash;whatever it is,"&mdash;and he laid his hand
emphatically on the doctor's arm,&mdash;"she could not be in more
capable hands than yours."</p>

<p>That assurance, though soothing to the doctor's self-esteem,
added gravely to his sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>While they were yet speaking, Lefevre was further troubled by
the announcement that a detective-inspector desired to speak with
him! Should he tell the inspector all that he had seen the night
before, and all that he suspected now, or should he hold his peace?
His duty as a citizen, as a doctor, and as, in a sense, the
protector of his patient, seemed to demand the one course, while
his consideration for Julius and for his own family suggested the
other. <a name='136.png' id='p136.png'></a> Surely, never was a
simple, upright doctor involved in a more bewildering <i>
imbroglio</i>!</p>

<p>The detective-inspector entered, and opened an interview which
proved less embarrassing than Lefevre had anticipated. The
detective had already made up his mind about the case and his
course regarding it. He put no curious questions; he merely
inquired concerning the identity and the condition of the lady.
When he heard who she was, and when he caught the import of an
aside from Lord Rivercourt that it would be worth any one's while
to discover the mysterious offender, professional zeal sparkled in
his eye.</p>

<p>"I think I know my man," said he; and the doctor looked the
lively interest he felt. "I am right, I believe, Dr Lefevre, in
setting this down to the author of that other case you
had,&mdash;that from the <a name='137.png' id='p137.png'></a>
Brighton train?" Lefevre thought he was right in that. "'M.
Dolaro:' that was the name. I had charge of the case, and was
baffled. I shan't miss him this time. I shall get on his tracks at
once; he can't have left the Park in broad daylight, a singular man
like him, without being noticed."</p>

<p>"It rather puzzles me," said the doctor, "what crime you will
charge him with."</p>

<p>"It is an outrage," said Lord Rivercourt; "and if it is not
criminal, it seems about time it were made so."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll class it, my lord," said the detective; "never
fear."</p>

<p>The detective departed; but Lord Rivercourt seemed not inclined
to stir.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me," said Lefevre; "but I must perform a very
delicate operation."</p>

<p>"To be sure," said the old lord; "and <a name='138.png' id=
'p138.png'></a> you want me to go. How stupid of me! I kept waiting
for my daughter to wake up; but I see that, of course, you have to
rouse her. It did not occur to me what that machine meant.
Something magneto-electric&mdash;eh? Forgive one question, Lefevre.
I can see you look anxious: is Mary's condition very
serious?&mdash;most serious? I can bear to be told the complete
truth."</p>

<p>The doctor was touched by the old gentleman's emotion. He took
his hand. "It is serious," said he&mdash;"most serious, for this
reason, that I cannot account for her obstinate lethargy; but I
think there is no immediate danger. If necessity arises, I shall
send for you again."</p>

<p>"To the House," said Lord Rivercourt. "I shall be sitting out a
debate on our eternal Irish question."<a name='139.png' id=
'p139.png'></a></p>

<p>Lefevre was left seriously discomposed, but at once he sent for
the house-physician, summoned the Sister and the nurse, and set
about his third attempt to revive his patient. He got the bed
turned north and south. He carefully explained to the two women
what was demanded of them, and applied them to their task; but,
whatever the cause, the failure was completer than before: there
was not even a tremor of muscle in the unconscious lady, and the
doctor was suffused with alarm and humiliation.
Failure!&mdash;failure!&mdash;failure! Such a concatenation had
never happened to him before!</p>

<p>But failure only nerves the brave and capable man to a supreme
effort for success. Still self-contained, and apparently unmoved,
the doctor gave directions for some liquid nourishment to be
artificially administered <a name='140.png' id='p140.png'></a> to
his patient, said he would return after dinner, and went his way.
The society of friends or acquaintances was distasteful to him
then; the thought even of seeing his own familiar dining-room and
his familiar man in black, whose silent obsequiousness he felt
would be a reproach, was disagreeable. All his thought, all his
attention, all his faculties were drawn tight to this acute
point&mdash;he must succeed; he must accomplish the task he had set
himself: life at that hour was worth living only for that purpose.
But how was success to be compelled?</p>

<p>He walked for a while about the streets, and then he went into a
restaurant and ordered a modest dinner. He broke and crumbled his
bread with both hands, his mind still intent on that one
engrossing, acute point. While thus he sat he heard <a name=
'141.png' id='p141.png'></a> a voice, as in a dream, say, "The very
doctor you read about. That's the second curious case he's got in a
month or so.... Oh yes&mdash;very clever; he treats them, I
understand, in the same sort of way as the famous Dr Charbon of
Paris would.... I should say so; quite as good, if not better than
Charbon. I'd rather have an English doctor any day than a
French.... His name's in the paper&mdash;<i>Lefevre</i>." Then the
doctor woke to the fact that he was being talked about. He
perceived his admirers were sitting at a table a little behind him,
and he judged from what had been said that his fresh case was
already being made "copy" of in the evening papers. The flattering
comparison of himself with Dr Charbon had an oddly stimulating
effect upon him, notwithstanding that it had been uttered by he
knew not whom,&mdash;a <a name='142.png' id='p142.png'></a> mere
<i>vox et pr&aelig;terea nihil</i>. He disclaimed to himself the
truth of the comparison, but all the same he was encouraged to bend
his attention with his utmost force to the solution of his
difficult problem&mdash;what to do to rouse his patient?</p>

<p>He sat thus, amid the bustle and buzz of the restaurant, the
coming and going of waiters, completely abstracted, assailing his
difficulty with questions on this side and on that,&mdash;when
suddenly out of the mists that obscured it there rose upon his
mental vision an idea, which appealed to him as a solution of the
whole, and, more than that, as a secret that would revolutionise
all the treatment of nervous weakness and derangement. How came the
idea? How do ideas ever come? As inspirations, we say, or as
revelations; and truly they come upon us with such amazing and
inspiriting <a name='143.png' id='p143.png'></a> freshness, that
they may well be called either the one or the other. But no great
idea had ever yet an epiphany but from the ferment of more familiar
small ideas,&mdash;just as the glorious Aphrodite was born of the
ferment and pother of the waves of the sea. Lefevre's new idea
clothed itself in the form of a comparative question&mdash;<i>Why
should there not be Transfusion of Nervous Force, Ether, or
Electricity, just as there is Transfusion of Blood?</i></p>

<p>He pushed his dinner away (he could scarcely have told what he
had been eating and drinking), called for his bill, and returned
with all speed to the hospital. He entered his female ward just as
evening prayers were finished, before the lights were turned out
and night began for the patients. He summoned his trusted
assistant, the house-physician, again.<a name='144.png' id=
'p144.png'></a></p>

<p>"I am about to attempt," said he, "an altogether new operation:
the patient has remained just as I left her, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Just the same."</p>

<p>"Nervous Force, whether it be Electricity or not, is manifestly
a fluid of some sort: why should it not be transfused as the other
vital fluid is?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, when you put it so," said the house-physician,
suddenly steeled and brightened into interest, "I should say, 'why
not?' The only reason against it is what can be assigned against
all new things&mdash;it has not, so far as I know, been done."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I am going to try. I think, in case we need a current,
so to say, to draw it along, that we shall use the apparatus too;
we shall therefore need the women."<a name='145.png' id=
'p145.png'></a></p>

<p>"You mean, of course," said the young man, "you will cut a main
nerve."</p>

<p>"I shall use this nerve," said Lefevre, indicating the main
nerve in the wrist,&mdash;upon which the young man, in his ready
enthusiasm, began to bare his arm.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Lefevre, "do you consider what you are so
promptly offering? Do you know that my experiment, if successful,
might leave you a paralytic, or an imbecile, or even&mdash;a
corpse?"</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk, sir," said the young man.</p>

<p>"I can't permit it, my boy," said Lefevre, laying his hand on
his arm, and giving him a look of kindness. "Nobody must run this
risk but me. I don't mean, however, to cut the nerve."</p>

<p>"What then, sir?"<a name='146.png' id='p146.png'></a></p>

<p>"Well," said Lefevre, "this Nervous Force, or Nervous Ether, is
clearly a very volatile, and at the same time a very searching
fluid. It can easily pass through the skin from a nerve in one
person to a nerve in another. There is no difficulty about that;
the difficulty is to set up a rapid enough vibration to whirl the
current through!" He said that in meditative fashion: he was
clearly at the moment repeating the working out of the problem.</p>

<p>"I see," said the young man, looking thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Now, you are a musician, are you not?"</p>

<p>"I play a little," said the young man, with a bewildered
look.</p>

<p>"You play the violin?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<a name='147.png' id='p147.png'></a></p>

<p>"And, of course, you have it in your rooms. Would you be so good
as to bring me the bow of your violin, and borrow for me anywhere a
tuning-fork of as high a note as possible?"</p>

<p>The young man looked at Dr Lefevre in puzzled inquiry; but the
doctor was considering the electrical apparatus before him, and the
young man set off on his errands. When he returned with the
fiddle-bow and the tuning-fork, he saw Lefevre had placed the
machine ready, with fresh chemicals in the vessels.</p>

<p>"Do you perceive my purpose?" asked Lefevre. He placed one
handle of the apparatus in the unconscious patient's right hand,
while he himself took hold of her left arm with his right hand, so
that the inner side of his wrist was in contact with the inner side
of hers; and then, to <a name='148.png' id='p148.png'></a> complete
the circle of connection, he took in his left hand the other handle
of the apparatus. "You don't understand?"</p>

<p>"I do not," answered the young man.</p>

<p>"We want a very rapid vibration&mdash;much more rapid than
usual," said the doctor. "I can apply no more rapid vibration at
present than that which the note of that tuning-fork will produce.
I want you to sound the tuning-fork with the fiddle-bow, and then
apply the fork to this wire."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the young man, "I understand!"</p>

<p>"Now," said Lefevre, "you'd better call the Sister to set the
electricity going."</p>

<p>The Sister came and took her place as before
described&mdash;with her hands, that is, on the cylinder of the
electrode, her fingers dipping over into the vessels of chemicals.
<a name='149.png' id='p149.png'></a> She opened her eyes and smiled
at sight of the fiddle-bow and tuning-fork.</p>

<p>"I am trying a new thing, Sister," said Lefevre, with a touch of
severity. "I do not need you, I do not wish you, to exert yourself
this time; I only wish you to keep that position, and to be calm.
Maintain your composure, and attend.... Now!" said he, addressing
the young man.</p>

<p>The fiddle-bow was drawn across the tuning-fork, and the fork
applied with its thrilling note to the conducting wire which
Lefevre held. The wire hummed its vibration, and electricity
tingled wildly through Lefevre's nerves....There was an anxious,
breathless pause for some seconds, and fear of failure began to
contract the doctor's heart.</p>

<p>"Take your hands away, Sister," said <a name='150.png' id=
'p150.png'></a> he. Then, turning to his assistant, "Apply that to
the other wire," said he; and dropping his own wire, he put his
hand over the cylinder, with his fingers dipping into the vessel
from which the other wire sprang. When the wire hummed under the
tuning-fork and the vibration thrilled again, instantly he felt as
if an inert obstruction had been removed. The vibratory influence
whirled wildly through him, there was a pause of a second or two
(which seemed to him many minutes in duration), and then suddenly a
kind of rigor passed upon the form and features of his patient, as
if each individual nerve and muscle were being threaded with quick
wire, a sharp rush of breath filled her chest, and she opened her
eyes and closed them again.</p>

<p>"That will do," said Lefevre in a <a name='151.png' id=
'p151.png'></a> whisper, and, releasing his hands, he sank back in
a chair. "It's a success," said he, turning his eyes with a thin
smile on the house-physician, and then closing them in a deadly
exhaustion.<a name='152.png' id='p152.png'></a></p>

<h2 id='bedside'>Chapter VI.</h2>

<p class='argument'>At the Bedside of the Doctor.</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>For</span> the first time since he had
come into the world Dr Lefevre was that night attended by another
doctor. The resident assistant-physician took him home to Savile
Row in a cab, assisted him to bed, and sat with him a while after
he had administered a tonic and soporific. Then he left him in
charge of the silent man in black, whom he reassured by saying that
there was no danger; that his master had a magnificent
constitution; that he was only exhausted&mdash;though exhausted
very much; and that <a name='153.png' id='p153.png'></a> all he
needed was rest, sleep, nourishment,&mdash;sleep above all.</p>

<p>Lefevre slept the night through like a child, and awoke
refreshed, though still very weak. He was bewildered with his
condition for a moment or two, till he recalled the moving and
exhausting experiences of the day before, and then he was suffused
with a glow of elation,&mdash;elation which was not all
satisfaction in the successful performance of a new experiment, nor
in a good deed well done. His friend came to see him early, to
anticipate the risk of his rising. He insisted that he should keep
his bed, for that day at least, if not for a second and a third
day. He reported that the patient was doing well; that she had
asked with particularity, and had been informed with equal
particularity, concerning the method of <a name='154.png' id=
'p154.png'></a> her recovery, upon which she was much bemused, and
asked to see her physician.</p>

<p>"It is a pity she was told," said Lefevre; "it is not usual to
tell a patient such a thing, and I meant it to be kept secret, at
least till it was better established." But for all his protest he
was again suffused with that new sense of inward joy.</p>

<p>Alone, and lying idle in bed, it was but natural&mdash;it was
almost inevitable&mdash;that the doctor's thoughts should begin to
run upon the strange events and suspicions of the past two days;
and their current setting strongly in one channel, made him long to
be resolved whether or no the Man of the Crowd, the author of
yesterday's outrage, the "M. Dolaro" of whom the detective had gone
in search, and who, if captured, would be certainly overwhelmed
with contumely, if not with punishment,&mdash;whether <a name=
'155.png' id='p155.png'></a> or not that strange creature was
Julius's father, or any relation at all of Julius. He was not clear
how he could well put the matter to Julius, since he so evidently
shrank from discourse upon it, yet he thought some kind of
certainty might be arrived at from an interview with him. On the
chance of his having returned to his chambers, he called for pen
and paper and wrote a note, asking him to look in, as he would be
resting all day. "Try to come," he urged; "I have something
important to speak about."</p>

<p>This he sent by the trusty hand of his man in black; and by
mid-day Julius was announced. He came in confident, and bright as
sunshine (Lefevre thought he had never seen him looking more
serene); but suddenly the sunshine was beclouded, and Julius ceased
to be himself, and became <a name='156.png' id='p156.png'></a> a
restless, timorous kind of creature, like a bird put in a cage
under the eye of his captor.</p>

<p>"What?" he cried when he entered, with an eloquent gesture.
"Lazying in bed on such a day as this? What does this mean?" But
when he observed the pallor and weakness of Lefevre's appearance,
he paused abruptly, refrained from the hand stretched out to greet
him, and exclaimed in a tone of something like terror, "Good
heavens! Are you ill?" A paleness, a shudder, and a dizziness
passed upon him as if he sickened. "May I," he said, "open the
window?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Julius," said Lefevre, in surprise and alarm. "Do
you feel ill?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," said Julius from the window, where he stood
letting the air play upon his face, and speaking as if he had to
put <a name='157.png' id='p157.png'></a> considerable restraint
upon himself. "I&mdash;I am unfortunately, miserably constituted: I
cannot help it. I cannot bear the sight of illness, or lowness of
health even. It appals me; it&mdash;it horrifies me with a quite
instinctive horror; it deadens me."</p>

<p>Lefevre, whose abundant sympathy and vitality went out
instinctively to succour and bless the weak and the ill, was
inexpressibly shocked and offended by this confession of what to
his sense appeared selfish cowardice and inhumanity. He had again
and again heard it said, and he had with pleasure assented to the
opinion, that Julius was a rare, finely-strung being, with such
pure and glowing health that he shrank from contact with, or from
the sight of, pain or ill-health, and even from their discussion;
but now that the singularity of Julius's organization impinged <a
name='158.png' id='p158.png'></a> upon his own experience, now that
he saw Julius shrink from himself, he was shocked and offended.
Julius, on his part, was pitiably moved. He kept away from the bed;
he fidgeted to and fro, looking at this thing and that, without a
sparkle of interest in his eye, yet all with his own peculiar
grace.</p>

<p>"You wanted to speak to me," he said. "Do you mind saying what
you have to say and letting me go?"</p>

<p>"I reckoned upon your staying to lunch," said Lefevre.</p>

<p>"I can't!&mdash;I can't!... Very sorry, my dear Lefevre, but I
really can't! Forgive what seems my rudeness. It distresses me that
at such a time as this my sensations are so acute. But I cannot
help it!&mdash;I cannot!"</p>

<p>"You have been in the country,&mdash;have <a name='159.png' id=
'p159.png'></a> you not?" said Lefevre, beginning with a resolve to
get at something.</p>

<p>"I have just come back," said Julius. "My man told me you had
called."</p>

<p>"Yes. My mother wrote in a state of great anxiety about you, and
asked me to go and look at you. She said that she and my sister had
seen a good deal of you lately; that you began to look unwell, and
then ceased to appear, and she was afraid you might be ill."</p>

<p>This was put forth as an invitation to Julius to expound not
only his own situation, but also his relations with Lady and Miss
Lefevre, but Julius took no heed of it. He merely said, "No; I was
not ill. I only wanted a little change to refresh me,"&mdash;and
walked back to the window to lave himself in the air.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Lefevre, "since I <a name='160.png' id=
'p160.png'></a> called to see you, I have had an adventure or two.
You never look at a newspaper except for the weather, and so it is
probable you do not know that I had brought to me yesterday
afternoon another strange case like that of the young officer a
month ago,&mdash;a similar case, but worse."</p>

<p>"Worse?" exclaimed Julius, dropping into the chair by the
window, and glancing, as a less preoccupied observer than the
doctor would have remarked, with a wistful desire at the door.</p>

<p>"Much worse&mdash;though, I believe, from the same hand," said
Lefevre. "A lady this time,&mdash;titularly and really a
lady,&mdash;Lady Mary Fane, the daughter of Lord Rivercourt."</p>

<p>"Oh, good heavens!" exclaimed Julius, and there were manifest so
keen a note of apprehension in his voice and so deep a <a name=
'161.png' id='p161.png'></a> shade of apprehension on his face,
that Lefevre could not but note them and confirm himself in his
suspicion of the intimate bond of connection between him and the
author of the outrage. He pitied Julius's distress, and hurried
through the rest of his revelation, careless of the result he had
sought.</p>

<p>"It may prove," said he, "a far more serious affair than the
other. Lord Rivercourt is not the man to sit quietly under an
outrage like that."</p>

<p>Julius astonished him by demanding, "What is the outrage? Has
the lady given an account of it? What does she accuse the man
of?"</p>

<p>"She has not spoken yet,&mdash;to me, at least," said Lefevre;
"and I don't know what the outrage can be called, but I am sure
Lord Rivercourt&mdash;and he is a man <a name='162.png' id=
'p162.png'></a> of immense influence&mdash;will move heaven and
earth to give it a legal name, and to get it punishment. There is a
detective on the man's track now."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Julius. "Well, it will be time enough to discuss the
punishment when the man is caught. Now, if that is all your news,"
he added hurriedly, "I think&mdash;&mdash;" He took up his hat, and
was as if going to the door.</p>

<p>"It is not quite all," said the doctor, and Julius went back to
the window, with his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he broke out, "if we shall ever be simple enough and
intelligent enough to perceive that real wickedness&mdash;the
breaking of any of the laws of Nature, I mean (or, if you prefer to
say so, the laws of God)&mdash;is best punished by being left to
itself? Outraged nature exacts a <a name='163.png' id='p163.png'>
</a> severe retribution! But you were going to
say&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The night before last," continued Lefevre, determined to be
brief and succinct, "I was walking in the Strand, and I could not
help observing a man who fulfilled completely the description given
of the author of this case and my former one."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"That is not all. When I caught sight of his face I was
completely amazed; for&mdash;I must tell you&mdash;it looked for
all the world like you grown old, or, as I said to myself at the
time, like a death-mask of you."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you saw that?" exclaimed Julius, leaning against the
window with a sudden look of terror which Lefevre was ashamed to
have seen: it was like catching a glimpse of Julius's poor naked <a
name='164.png' id='p164.png'></a> soul. "And you thought&mdash;?"
continued Julius.</p>

<p>"You shall hear. Dr Rippon&mdash;you remember the old
doctor?&mdash;had a sight of a man in the Strand the night before,
who, he believes, was his old friend Courtney that he thought dead,
and who, I believe, was the man I saw."</p>

<p>Lefevre stopped. There was a pause, in which Julius put his head
out of the window, as if he had a mind to be gone that way. Then he
turned with a marked control upon himself.</p>

<p>"Really, Lefevre," said he, "this is the queerest stuff I've
heard for a long time! This is hallucination with a vengeance! I
don't like to apply such a tomfool word to anything, but observe
how all this has come about. An excellent old gentleman, who has
been dining out or something, <a name='165.png' id='p165.png'></a>
has a glimpse at night, on a crowded pavement, of a man who looks
like a friend of his youth. Very well. The excellent old gentleman
tells you of that, and it impresses you. <i>You</i> walk on the
same pavement the next evening&mdash;I won't emphasise the fact of
its being after dinner, though I daresay it was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;<i>You</i> have a glimpse of a man who
looks&mdash;well, something like me; and you instantly conclude,
'Ah! the Courtney person&mdash;the friend of Dr Rippon's
youth!&mdash;and, surely, some relative of my friend Julius!' Next
day this hospital case turns up, and because the description of its
author, given by more or less unobservant persons, fits the person
you saw, <i>argal</i>, you jump to the conclusion that the three
are one! Is your conclusion clear upon the <a name='166.png' id=
'p166.png'></a> evidence? Is it inevitable? Is it necessary? Is it
not forced?"</p>

<p>"Well," began Lefevre.</p>

<p>"It is bad detective business," broke in Julius, "though it may
be good friendship. You have thought there was trouble in this for
me, and you wished to give me warning of it. But&mdash;<i>que
diable vas-tu faire dans cette gal&egrave;re?</i> You are the best
friend in the world, and whenever I am in trouble&mdash;and who
knows? who knows? 'Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly
upward'&mdash;I may ask of you both your friendship and your skill.
One thing I ask of you here: don't speak of me as you see me now,
thus miserably moved, to any one! Now I must go. Good-bye." And
before Lefevre could find another word, Julius had opened the door
and was gone.<a name='167.png' id='p167.png'></a></p>

<p>"If it moves him like that," said the doctor to himself, through
his bewilderment, "there must be something worse in it&mdash;God
forgive me for thinking so!&mdash;than I have ever imagined."<a
name='168.png' id='p168.png'></a></p>

<h2 id='interlude'>Chapter VII.</h2>

<p class='argument'>Contains a Love Interlude.</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>Next</span> day Lefevre learned that
the police had been again baffled in their part of the inquiry. The
detective had contrived to trace his man&mdash;though not till the
morning after the event&mdash;to the St Pancras Hotel, where he had
dined in private, and gone to bed early, and whence he had departed
on foot before any one was astir, to catch, it was surmised, the
first train. But wherever he had gone, it was just as in the former
case: from the time the hotel door had closed on his cloaked
figure, all trace of him was lost.<a name='169.png' id=
'p169.png'></a></p>

<p>Nor could Lady Mary Fane add anything of moment to what Lefevre
already knew or guessed. Her account of her adventure (which she
gave him in her father's house, whither she had been removed on the
third day) was as follows: She was returning home from St Thomas's
Hospital, dressed according to her habit when she went there; she
had crossed Westminster Bridge, and was proceeding straight into St
James's Park, when she became aware of a man walking in the same
direction as herself, and at the same pace. She casually noted that
he looked like a distinguished foreigner, and that he had about him
an indefinable suggestion of death clinging with an eager, haggard
hope to life,&mdash;a suggestion which melted the heart of the
beholder, as if it were the mute appeal of a drowning sailor. She
<a name='170.png' id='p170.png'></a> was stirred to pity; and when
he suddenly appeared to reel from weakness, she stepped out to him
on an overwhelming impulse, laid a steadying hand on his arm, and
asked what ailed him. He turned on her a pair of wonderful dark
eyes, which were animal-like in their simple, direct appeal, and
their moist softness. He begged her to lead him aside into a path
by which few would pass: he disliked being stared at. Thinking only
of him as a creature in sickness and distress, she obeyed without a
thought for herself. She helped him to sit down upon a bench, and
sat down by him and felt his pulse. He looked at her with an open,
kindly eye, with a simple-seeming gratitude, which held her
strangely (though she only perceived that clearly on looking back).
He said to her suddenly,&mdash;<a name='171.png' id=
'p171.png'></a></p>

<p>"There was a deep, mystical truth in the teaching of the Church
to its children&mdash;that they should prefer in their moments of
human weakness to pray to the Virgin-mother; for woman is always
man's best friend."</p>

<p>She looked in his face, wondering at him, still with her finger
on his pulse, when she felt an unconsciousness come over her, not
unlike "the thick, sweet mystery of chloroform;" and she knew no
more till she opened her eyes in the hospital bed. "Revived by
you," she said to Lefevre.</p>

<p>He inquired further, as to her sensations before
unconsciousness, and she replied in these striking words: "I felt
as if I were strung upon a complicated system of threads, and as if
they tingled and tingled, and grew tighter to numbness." That
answer, he saw, was kindred to the description <a name='172.png'
id='p172.png'></a> given by the young officer of his condition. It
was clear that in both cases the nerves had been seriously played
upon; but for what purpose? What was the secret of the stranger's
endeavour? What did he seek?&mdash;and what find? To these
questions no satisfactory answer would come for the asking, so that
in his impatience he was tempted to break through the severe
self-restraint of science, and let unfettered fancy find an
answer.</p>

<p>But, most of all, he longed to see close to him the man whom the
police sought for in and out, to judge for himself what might be
the method and the purpose of his strange outrages. He scarcely
desired his capture, for he thought of the possible results to
Julius, and yet&mdash;&mdash; Day after day passed, and still the
man was unfound, and very soon a change came over <a name='173.png'
id='p173.png'></a> Lefevre's life, which lifted it so far above the
plane of his daily professional experience, that all speculation
about the mysterious "M. Dolaro," and his probable relation to
Julius, fell for a time into the dim background. The doctor had
been calling daily in Carlton Terrace to see his patient, when, on
a certain memorable day, he intimated to her father that she was so
completely recovered that there was no need of his calling on her
professionally again. The old lord, looking a little flustered,
asked him if he could spare a few minutes' conversation, and led
him into his study.</p>

<p>"My dear Lefevre," said he, "I am at a loss how to make you any
adequate return for what you have done for my daughter. Money can't
do it; no, nor my friendship either, though you are so <a name=
'174.png' id='p174.png'></a> kind as to say so. But I have an idea,
which I think it best to set before you frankly. You are a
bachelor: it is not good to be a bachelor," he went on, laying his
hand affectionately on the doctor's arm, and flushing&mdash;old man
of the world though he was&mdash;flushing to the eyes.
"What&mdash;what do you think of my daughter? I mean, not as a
doctor, but as a man?"</p>

<p>Lefevre was not in his first youth, and he had had his
admirations for women in his time, as all healthy men must have,
but yet he was made as deliriously dizzy as if he were a boy by his
guess at what Lord Rivercourt meant.</p>

<p>"Why," he stammered, "I think her the most beautiful,
intelligent, and&mdash;and attractive woman I know."</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father, "I believe she is pretty well in all
these ways. But&mdash;and <a name='175.png' id='p175.png'></a> you
see I frankly expose my whole position to you&mdash;what would you
think of her for a wife?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, then," said Lefevre, "I find I have admired her from
the beginning of this, but I had no notion of letting my admiration
go farther, because I conceived that she was quite beyond my
hopes."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Lord Rivercourt, "you have relieved me
and delighted me immensely. I know no man that I would like so well
for a son-in-law. And after all, it is only fitting that the life
you have saved with such risk to yourself&mdash;oh, I know all
about it&mdash;should be devoted to making yours happy.
And&mdash;and I understand from her mother that Mary is quite of
the same opinion herself. Now, will you go and speak to her at
once, or will you wait till another day? <a name='176.png' id=
'p176.png'></a> You will have to decide that," said he, with a
smile, "not only as lover, but as doctor."</p>

<p>Lefevre hesitated for but an instant; for what true, manly lover
would have decided to withdraw till another day when the door to
his mistress was held open to him?</p>

<p>"I'll see her now," he said.</p>

<p>Lord Rivercourt led the doctor back to his daughter, and left
him with her. There were some moments of chilling doubt and cold
uncertainty, and then came a rush of warm feeling at the bidding of
a shy glance from Lady Mary. He bent over her and murmured he
scarcely knew what, but he heard clearly and with a divine ecstasy
a softly-whispered "<i>Yes!</i>" which thrilled in his heart for
days and months afterwards, and <a name='177.png' id='p177.png'>
</a> then he turned to him her face, her beautiful face illumined
with love, and kissed it: between two who had been drawn together
as they had, what words were needed, or what could poor words
convey?</p>

<p>About an hour later he walked to Savile Row to dress and return
for dinner. He walked, because he felt surcharged with life. He
desired peace and goodwill among men; he pitied with all his soul
the weary and the broken whom he met, and wondered with regret that
men should get irremediably involved in the toils of their own
misdeeds; he was profuse with coppers, and even small silver, to
the wretched waifs of society who swept the crossings he had to
take on his triumphant way; he would even have bestowed forgiveness
on his greatest enemy if he <a name='178.png' id='p178.png'></a>
had met him then;&mdash;for the divine joy of love was singing in
his heart and raising him to the serene and glorious empyrean of
heroes and gods. Oh matchless magic of the human heart, which
confounds all the hypotheses of science, and flouts all its
explanations!</p>

<p>It was that evening when he and Lady Mary sat in sweet converse
that she said to him these words, which he hung for ever after
about his heart&mdash;</p>

<p>"Surely, never before did a man win a wife as you have won me!
You made me well by putting your own life into me; so what could I
do but give you the life that was already your own!"</p>

<p>Thus day followed day on golden wings: Lefevre in the morning
occupied with the patients that thronged his consulting-room; in
the afternoon dispensing <a name='179.png' id='p179.png'></a>
healing, and, where healing was impossible, cheerfulness and
courage, in his hospital wards; and in the evening finding
inspiration and strength in the company of Lady Mary&mdash;for her
love was to him better than wine. All who went to him in those days
found him changed, and in a sense glorified. He had always been
considerate and kind; but the weakness, the folly, and the
wickedness of poor human nature, which were often laid bare to his
searching scrutiny, had frequently plunged him into a welter of
despondency and shame, out of which he would cry, "Alas for God's
image! Alas for the temple of the Holy Ghost!" But in those days it
seemed as if disease and death appeared to him mere trivial
accidents of life, with the result that no "case," however bad, was
sent away empty of hope.<a name='180.png' id='p180.png'></a></p>

<h2 id='curzon'>Chapter VIII.</h2>

<p class='argument'>Strange Scenes in Curzon Street.</p>

<p><span class='small-caps'>It</span> happened, however, that just
when all the bays and creeks of Dr Lefevre's attention were
occupied, as by a springtide, with the excellent, the divine
fortune that had come to him,&mdash;when he seemed thus most
completely divorced from anxious speculation about Julius Courtney
and "M. Dolaro," his attention was suddenly and in unexpected
fashion hurried again to the mystery. The doctor had not seen
Julius since the day he had received him in his bedroom&mdash;it
must be admitted he had not <a name='181.png' id='p181.png'></a>
sought to see him&mdash;but he had heard now and then from his
mother, in casual notes and postscripts, that Courtney continued to
call in Curzon Street.</p>

<p>On a certain evening Lady Lefevre gave a dinner and a reception,
designed to introduce Lady Mary to the Lefevre circle. Julius was
not at dinner (at which only members of the two families sat down),
but he was expected to appear later. It is probable, under the
circumstances, that Lefevre would not have remarked the absence of
Julius from the dinner-table, had it not been for Nora. He was
painfully struck with her appearance and demeanour. She seemed to
have lost much of her beautiful vigour and bloom of health, like a
flower that has been for some time cut from its stem; and she, who
had been wont to be ready and gay of <a name='182.png' id=
'p182.png'></a> speech, was now completely silent, yet without
constraint, and as if wrapt in a dream.</p>

<p>"What has come over Nora?" asked Lefevre of his mother when they
had gone to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Lady Lefevre, "you have noticed something, have you?
Do you find her very changed, then?"</p>

<p>"Very much changed."</p>

<p>"It's this attachment of hers to Julius. I want to have a talk
with you about it presently. She seems scarcely to live when he is
not with her. She sits like that always when he is gone, and
appears only to dream and wait,&mdash;wait with her life as if
suspended till he comes back."</p>

<p>"Has it, indeed, got so far as that?" said her son with concern.
"I had better have a word or two with Julius about it."<a name=
'183.png' id='p183.png'></a></p>

<p>Just then Mr Courtney was announced, and there were
introductions on this side and on that. He turned to be introduced
to Lady Mary, and for the time Lefevre forgot his sister, so
engrossed was he with the altered aspect of his friend. He looked
worn and weary, like a student when the dawn finds him still at his
books. Lady Lefevre expressed that in her question&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Julius, have you taken to hard work? You're not looking
well, and we have not seen you for days."</p>

<p>A flush rose to tinge his cheek, but it sank as soon as it
appeared.</p>

<p>"I have been out of sorts," said he; "that is all. And you have
not seen me because I have bought a yacht and have been trying it
on the river."</p>

<p>"A yacht!" exclaimed Lefevre. "I did not know you cared for the
water."<a name='184.png' id='p184.png'></a></p>

<p>"<i>You</i> know me," laughed Julius in his own manner, "and not
know that I care for everything!" So saying, he laid his hand on
Lefevre's arm. The act was not remarkable, but its result was, for
Lefevre felt it as if it were a blow, and stood astonished at
it.</p>

<p>During this interchange of words Lefevre (with Lady Mary) had
been moving with Julius, as he drew off across the room to greet
Nora, and the doctor could not help observing how the attention of
all the company was bent on his friend. Before his entrance all had
been chatting or laughing easily with their neighbours; now they
seemed as constrained and belittled as is a crowd of courtiers when
a royal personage appears in their midst. In truth, Julius at all
times had a grace, an ease, and a distinction of manner not
unworthy of a <a name='185.png' id='p185.png'></a> prince; but on
this occasion he had an added something, an indefinable attraction
which strangely held the attention. Lefevre, therefore, was
scarcely surprised (though, perhaps, a trifle disappointed,
considering that he was a lover) to note that Lady Mary was
regarding Julius with a silent, wide-eyed fascination. They
convoyed Julius to Nora, and then withdrew, leaving them
together.</p>

<p>There were several fresh arrivals and new introductions to Lady
Mary. These, Lefevre observed, she went through half-absently,
still turning her eyes on Julius in the intervals with open and
intense interest.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lefevre at length, smiling in spite of a twinge of
jealousy, "what do you think, now you have seen him, of the
fascinating Julius?"<a name='186.png' id='p186.png'></a></p>

<p>She gave him no answering smile, but replied as if she painfully
withdrew herself from abstraction,&mdash;"I&mdash;I don't know. He
is very interesting and very strange. I&mdash;I can't make him out.
I don't know."</p>

<p>Then Lefevre turned his eyes on Julius, and became aware of
something strained in the relations of his sister and his friend.
He could not forbear to look, and as he continued looking he
instinctively felt that a passionate scene was being silently
enacted between them. They sat markedly apart. Nora's bosom heaved
with suppressed emotion, and her look, when raised to Julius, plied
him with appeal or reproach&mdash;Lefevre could not determine
which. The doctor's interest almost drew him over to them, when
Lady Lefevre appeared and said to Julius&mdash;<a name='187.png'
id='p187.png'></a></p>

<p>"Do go to the piano, Julius, and wake us up."</p>

<p>Nora put out her hand with a gesture which plainly meant,
"Don't!... Don't leave me!"</p>

<p>But Julius rose, and as he turned (the doctor noted) he bent an
inscrutable look of pain on Nora. He sat down at the piano and
struck a wild, sad chord. Instantly it became as if the people in
the room were the instrument upon which he played,&mdash;as if the
throbbing human hearts around him were directly connected by
invisible strings with the ivory keys that pulsed beneath his
fingers. What was the music he played no one knew, no one cared, no
one inquired: each individual person was held and played upon, and
was allowed no pause for reflection or criticism. The music carried
all away as on the flood <a name='188.png' id='p188.png'></a> of
time, showing them, on one hand, sunshine and beauty and joy, and
all the pride of life; and on the other, darkness and cruelty,
despair, and defiance, and death. It might have been, on the one
hand, the music with which Orpheus tamed the beasts; and on the
other, that which &AElig;schylus arranged to accompany the last act
of his tragedy of "Prometheus Bound." There was, however, no clear
distinction between the joyous airs and the sombre: all were
wrought and mingled into an exciting and bewildering atmosphere of
melody, which thrilled the heart and maddened the brain. But as the
music continued, its joyous strains died out; the instrument cried
aloud in horror and pain, as if the vulture of Prometheus were
tearing at its vitals; darkness seemed to descend upon the
room&mdash;a darkness alive <a name='189.png' id='p189.png'></a>
with the sighs and groans, the disillusions and tears, of lost
souls. The men sat transfixed with agony and dread, the women were
caught in the wild clutches of hysteria, and Courtney himself was
as if possessed with a frenzy: his features were rigid, his eyes
dilated, and his hair rose and clung in wavy locks, so that he
seemed a very Gorgon's head. The only person apparently unmoved was
old Dr Rippon, whose pale, gaunt form rose in the background,
sinister and calm as Death!</p>

<p>The situation was at its height, when a black cat (a pet of Miss
Lefevre's) suddenly leaped on the top of the piano with a canary in
its mouth, and in the presence of them all, laid its captive before
Julius Courtney. The music ceased with a dissonant crash. With a
cry Julius rose <a name='190.png' id='p190.png'></a> and laid his
hand on the cat's neck: to the general amazement the cat lay down
limp and senseless, and the little golden bird fluttered away. Then
the sobs of the women, hitherto controlled, broke out, and the
murmurs of the men.</p>

<p>"O Julius! Julius! what have you done?" cried Nora, sweeping up
to him in an ecstasy of emotion.</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms, when with a strange cry&mdash;a
strained kind of laugh with a hysterical catch in it&mdash;she sank
fainting on his breast. With a sharp exclamation of pain and fear
he bore her swiftly from the room (he was near the door) and into a
little conservatory that opened upon the staircase, casting his
eyes upon Lefevre as he went, and saying, "Come! come quick!"
Lefevre then woke to the fact that he had been fixedly regarding
this last strange <a name='191.png' id='p191.png'></a> scene, while
Lady Mary clung trembling to his arm. He hurried out after Julius,
followed by Lady Mary and his mother.</p>

<p>"Take her!" cried Julius, standing away from Nora, and looking
white and terror-stricken. "Restore her! Oh, I must not!&mdash;I
dare not touch her!"</p>

<p>With nimble accustomed fingers Lady Mary undid Nora's dress,
while the doctor applied the remedies usual in hysterical fainting.
Nora opened her eyes and fixed them upon Julius.</p>

<p>"O Julius, Julius!" she cried. "Do not leave me! Come near me!
Oh!... I think I am going to die!"</p>

<p>"My love! my life! my soul!" said Julius, stretching out his
hands to her, but approaching no nearer. "I cannot&mdash;I must not
touch you! No, no! I dare not!"<a name='192.png' id=
'p192.png'></a></p>

<p>"O Julius!" said she. "Are you afraid of me? How can I harm
you?"</p>

<p>"Nora, my life! I am afraid of myself! You would not harm me,
but I would harm you! Ah, I know it now only too well!"</p>

<p>Then, as she closed her eyes again, she said, "I had better
die!"</p>

<p>"No, you must not die!" he exclaimed.
"Your time is not yet! Yes, you will live!&mdash;live! But I
must be cut off&mdash;though not for ever&mdash;from the sweetest
and dearest, the noblest and purest of all God's creatures!"</p>

<p>In the meantime Lefevre had been examining his sister with
closer scrutiny. He raised her eyelid and looked at her eye; he
pricked her on the arm and wrist; and then he turned to Julius.</p>

<p>"Julius," said he, "what does this mean?"</p>

<p>"It means," answered Julius, covering <a name='193.png' id=
'p193.png'></a> his face with his hands, "that I am of all living
things the most accurst!" Then with a cry of horror and anguish he
fled from the room and down the stairs.</p>

<p>Lady Lefevre followed him in a flutter of fear. Presently she
returned, and said, in answer to a look from her son, "He snatched
his hat and coat, and was gone before I came up with him."</p>

<p>Without a word Lefevre set himself to recover his sister, and in
half an hour she was well enough to walk with Lady Mary's
assistance to bed.</p>

<p>The guests, meanwhile, had departed, all but two or three
intimates; and in less than an hour Dr Lefevre was returning home
in the Fane carriage. Lord Rivercourt and he talked of the strange
events of the evening, while Lady Mary leaned back and
half-absently listened. They <a name='194.png' id='p194.png'></a>
were proceeding thus along Piccadilly, when she suddenly caught the
doctor's arm and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! Look! The very man I met in the Park! I am sure of it! I
can never forget the face!"</p>

<p>Lefevre, alert on the instant, looked to recognise Hernando
Courtney, the Man of the Crowd: he saw only the back of a person in
a loose cape and a slouch hat turning in at the gateway of the
Albany courtyard. In flashes of reflection these questions arose:
Who could he be but Hernando Courtney?&mdash;and where could he be
going but to Julius's chambers? Julius, therefore (whose own
conduct had been that night so extraordinary), must be familiar
with his whole mysterious course, and consequently with the peril
he was in. Before Lefevre could out of his <a name='195.png' id=
'p195.png'></a> perplexity snatch a resolution, Lord Rivercourt had
pulled the cord to stop the coachman. The coachman, however, having
received orders to drive home, was driving at a goodly pace, and it
was only on a second summons through the cord that he slackened
speed, and obeyed his master's direction to "draw up by the
kerb."</p>

<p>"I'll get out," said Lefevre, "and look after him. You'd better
get Mary home; she's not very strong yet, and she has been upset
to-night."</p>

<p>He put himself thus forward for another reason besides,&mdash;on
the impulse of his friendship for Julius, without considering
whether in the event of an arrest and an exposure, he could do
anything to shield Julius from shame and pain.</p>

<p>He got out, saying his adieus, and the <a name='196.png' id=
'p196.png'></a> carriage drove on. He found himself well past the
Albany. He hurried back, nerved by the desire to encounter Julius's
visitor, and at the same time by the hope that he would not. In his
heart was a turmoil of feeling, to the surface of which continued
to rise pity for Julius. The events of the evening had forced him
to the conclusion that Julius possessed the same singular,
magnetic, baleful influence on men and women as his putative father
Hernando; but Julius's burst of agony, when Nora lay overcome, had
declared to him that till then he had scarcely been aware of the
destructive side of his power. All resentment, therefore, all sense
of offence and suspicion which had lately begun to arise in his
mind, was swallowed up in pity for his afflicted friend. His chief
desire, now that he seemed reduced to the level of <a name=
'197.png' id='p197.png'></a> suffering humanity, was to give him
help and counsel.</p>

<p>Thus he entered the Albany, and passed the porter. The lamps in
the flagged passage were little better than luminous shadows in the
darkness, and the hollow silence re-echoed the sound of his hurried
steps. No one was to be seen or heard in front of him. He came to
the letter which marked Julius's abode. He looked into the gloomy
doorway, and resolved he would see and speak to Julius in any case.
He passed into the gloom and knocked at Julius's door. After a
pause the door was opened by Jenkins. Lefevre could not well make
out the expression of the serving-man's face, but he was satisfied
that his voice was shaken as by a recent shock.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr Courtney," said <a name='198.png' id=
'p198.png'></a> Lefevre, in the half hope that Jenkins would say,
"Which Mr Courtney?"</p>

<p>"Not at home, sir," said Jenkins in his flurried voice, and
prepared to shut the door.</p>

<p>"Not at home, Jenkins? You don't mean that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Dr Lefevre, sir. Mr Courtney is not at home, but
perhaps he will see you, sir! I hope he will; for he don't seem to
me at all well."</p>

<p>"But if he is engaged, Jenkins&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, you know what 'not-at-home' means," answered Jenkins.
"It means anything or nothing. Will you step into the drawing-room,
sir, while I inquire? Mr Courtney is in his study."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jenkins," said the doctor; "I'll wait where I
am."</p>

<p>Jenkins returned with deep concern on <a name='199.png' id=
'p199.png'></a> his face. "Mr Courtney's compliments, sir," said
he, "and he is very sorry he cannot see you to-night. It is a pity,
sir," he added, in a burst of confidence, "for he don't seem well.
He's a-settin' there with the lamp turned down, and his face in his
hands."</p>

<p>"Is he alone, then?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir," answered Jenkins, in manifest surprise.</p>

<p>"Has nobody been to see him since he came in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, nobody," said Jenkins, in wider surprise than
before.</p>

<p>It appeared to Lefevre that his friend must be sitting alone
with the terrible discovery he had that night made of himself. His
heart, therefore, urged him to go in and take him by the hand, and
give what help and comfort he could.<a name='200.png' id=

<p>"I think," said he to Jenkins, "I'll try and have a word with
him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jenkins, and led the way to the study. He
tapped at the door, and then turned the handle; but the door
remained closed.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked a weary voice within, which scarce sounded
like the voice of Julius.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;Lefevre," said the doctor, putting Jenkins aside. "May
not I come in? I want a friendly word with you."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Lefevre," said the voice, "that I do not let you
in. I am very busy at present."</p>

<p>"You are alone," said Lefevre, "are you not?"</p>

<p>"Alone," said Julius; "yes, all alone!" There was a melting note
of sadness in the words which went to the doctor's heart.<a name=
'201.png' id='p201.png'></a></p>

<p>"My dear Julius," said he, "I think I know what's troubling you.
Don't you think a talk with me might help you?"</p>

<p>"You are very good, Lefevre." (That was an unusual form of
speech to come from Julius.) "I shall come to your house in a few
minutes, if you will allow me."</p>

<p>"Do," answered Lefevre, for the moment completely satisfied.
"Do!" And he turned away.</p>

<p>But when Jenkins had closed the outer door upon him, doubts
arose. Ought he not to have insisted on seeing whether Julius was
in truth alone in the study? And why could they not have had their
talk there as well as in Savile Row? These doubts, however, he
thrust down with the promise to himself that, if Julius did not
come to him within half an hour, <a name='202.png' id='p202.png'>
</a> he would return to him. Yet he had not gone many steps before
an unworthy suspicion shot up and arrested him: Suppose Julius had
got rid of him to have the opportunity of sending a mysterious
companion away unseen? But Jenkins had said he had let no one in,
and it was shameful to suspect both master and man of lying. Yet
Lady Mary Fane had distinctly recognised the man who passed into
the Albany courtyard: had he merely passed through on his unceasing
pursuit of something unknown? or were father and son somehow aware
of each other? Between this and that his mind became a jumble of
the wildest conjectures. He imagined many things, but never
conceived that which soon showed itself to be the fact.<a name=

<p><span class='small-caps'>He</span> let himself in with his
latch-key, went into his dining-room, and sat down dressed as he
was to wait. He listened through minute after minute for the
expected step. The window was open (for the midsummer night was
warm), and all the sounds of belated and revelling London floated
vaguely in the air. Twelve o'clock boomed softly from Westminster,
and made the heavy atmosphere drowsily vibrate with the volume of
the strokes. The reverberation of the last had scarcely <a name=
'204.png' id='p204.png'></a> died away when a light, measured
footfall made him sit up. It came nearer and nearer, and then,
after a moment's hesitation, sounded on his own doorstep. With that
there came the tap of a cane on the window. With thought and
expectation resolutely suspended, Lefevre swung out of the room and
to the hall-door. He opened it, and stood and gazed. The light of
the hall-lamp fell upon a figure, the sight of which sent the blood
in a gush to his heart, and pierced him with horror. He expected
Julius, and he looked on the man whom he had followed on the
crowded pavements some weeks before,&mdash;the man whom the police
had long sought for ineffectually!</p>

<p>"Won't you let me in, Lefevre?" said the man.</p>

<p>The doctor stood speechless, with his <a name='205.png' id=
'p205.png'></a> eyes fixed: the face and dress of the person before
him were those of Hernando Courtney, but the voice was the voice of
Julius, though it sounded strange and distant, and bore an accent
as of death. Lefevre was involved in a wild turmoil and horror of
surmise, too appalling to be exactly stated to himself; for he
shrank with all his energy from the conclusion to which he was
being forced. He turned, however, upon the request for admission,
and led the way into the dining-room, letting his visitor close the
door and follow.</p>

<p>"Lefevre," said the strange voice, "I have come to show myself
to you, because I know you are a true-hearted friend, and because I
think you have that exquisite charity that can forgive all
things."</p>

<p>"<i>Show myself!</i>" ... As Lefevre <a name='206.png' id=
'p206.png'></a> listened to the strange voice and looked at the
strange person, the suspicion came upon him&mdash;What if he were
but regarding an Illusion? He had read in some of his mystical and
magical writers, that men gifted with certain powers could project
to a distance eidola or phantasms of varying likeness to
themselves: might not this be such a mocking phantasm of Julius? He
drew his hand across his eyes, and looked again: the figure still
sat there. He put out his hand to test its substantiality, and the
voice cried in a keen pitch of terror&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!&mdash;for your own sake!... Why, Lefevre, do
you look so amazed and overcome? Is not my wretched secret written
in my face?"</p>

<p>"And you are really Julius Courtney?" asked Lefevre, at length
finding utterance, <a name='207.png' id='p207.png'></a> with
measured emphasis, and in a voice which he hardly recognised as his
own.</p>

<p>"I am Julius Courtney&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, for Lefevre had put his head in his hands, shaken
with a silent paroxysm of grief. It wrung the doctor's heart, as if
in the person that sat opposite him, all that was noblest and most
gracious in humanity were disgraced and overthrown.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the voice, "I am Julius; there is no other
Courtney that I know of, and soon there will be none at all." The
doctor listened, but he could not endure to look again. "I am
dying&mdash;I have been dying for a dozen years, and for a dozen
years I have resisted and overcome death; now I surrender. I have
come to my period. I shall never enter your house again. I have
only come now <a name='208.png' id='p208.png'></a> to confess
myself, and to ask a last favour of you&mdash;a last token of
friendship."</p>

<p>"I will freely do what I can for you, Julius," said the doctor,
still without looking at him, "though I am too overcome, too
bewildered, yet to say much to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you. You will hear my story and understand. It contains a
secret which I, like a blind fool, have only used for myself, but
which you will apply for the wide benefit of mankind. The request I
have to make of you is small, but it may seem
extraordinary,&mdash;be my companion for twelve hours. I cannot
talk to you here, enclosed and oppressed with streets of houses.
Come with me for a few hours on the water; I have a fancy to see
the sun rise for the last time over the sea. I have my yacht ready
near London Bridge, and a boat waiting at the steps by Cleopatra's
<a name='209.png' id='p209.png'></a> Needle; a cab will soon take
us there. Will you come?"</p>

<p>Lefevre did not look up. The voice of Julius sounded like an
appeal from the very abode of death. Then he glanced in spite of
himself in his face, and was moved and melted to unreserved
compassion by the strained weariness of his expression&mdash;the
open, luminous wistfulness of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll go," said he. "But can't I do something for you
first? Let me consider your case."</p>

<p>"There's nothing now to be done for me, Lefevre," said Julius,
shaking his head. "You will perceive that when you have heard me
out."</p>

<p>The doctor went to find his man and tell him that he was going
out for the night to attend on an urgent case. When he returned he
stood a moment touched with <a name='210.png' id='p210.png'></a>
misgiving. He thought of Lady Mary&mdash;he thought of his mother
and sister. Ought he not to leave some hint behind him of the
strange adventure upon which he was about to embark, and which
might end he knew not how or where? Julius was observing him, and
seemed to divine his doubt.</p>

<p>"You need have no hesitation," said he. "I ask you only for
twelve hours. You can easily get back here by noon to-morrow. There
is a south-west wind blowing, with every prospect of settled
weather. I am quite certain about it."</p>

<p>Fortified with that assurance, Lefevre put on a thicker overcoat
and an old soft hat, turned out the lights in the dining-room and
in the hall, closed the door with a slam, and stood with the new,
the strange Julius in the street, fairly embarked upon <a name=
'211.png' id='p211.png'></a> his adventure. It was only with an
effort that he could realise he was in the company of one who had
been a familiar friend. They walked towards Regent Street without
speaking. At the corner of Savile Row they came upon a policeman,
and Lefevre had a sudden thrill of fear lest his companion should,
at length, be recognised and arrested. Courtney himself, however,
appeared in no wise disturbed. In Regent Street he hailed a passing
four-wheeler.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't a hansom be quicker?" said Lefevre.</p>

<p>"It is better on your account," said Julius, "that we should sit
apart."</p>

<p>When they entered the cab, Courtney ensconced himself in the
remote corner of the other seat from Lefevre; and thus without
another word they drove to the Embankment. At the foot of the steps
<a name='212.png' id='p212.png'></a> by Cleopatra's Needle, they
found a waterman and a boat in waiting. They entered the boat,
Lefevre going forward while Julius sat down at the tiller. The
waterman pulled out. The tide was ebbing, and they slipped swiftly
down the dark river, with broken reflections of lamps and lanterns
on either bank streaming deep into the water like molten gold as
they passed, and with tall buildings and chimney-shafts showing
black against the calm night sky. Lefevre found it necessary at
intervals to assure himself that he was not drifting in a dream, or
that the ghastly, burning-eyed figure, wrapped in a dark cloak in
the stern, was not a strange visitor from the nether world.</p>

<p>Soon after they had shot through London Bridge they were
alongside a yacht almost in mid-stream. It was clear <a name=
'213.png' id='p213.png'></a> that all had been prearranged for
Julius's arrival; for as soon as they were on board, the yacht
(loosed from her upper mooring by the waterman who had brought them
down the river) began to stand away.</p>

<p>"We had better go forward," said Courtney. "Are you warm
enough?"</p>

<p>The doctor answered that he was. Courtney gave an order to one
of the men, who went below and returned with a fur-lined coat which
his master put on. That little incident gave a curious shock to
Lefevre: it made him think of the mysterious stranger who had sat
down opposite the young officer in the Brighton train, and it
showed him that he had not been completely satisfied that his
friend Julius and the person he had been wont to think of as
Hernando Courtney were one and the same.<a name='214.png' id=
'p214.png'></a></p>

<p>They went forward to be free of the sail and its tackling.
Courtney, wrapped in his extra, his fur-lined coat, pointing to a
low folding-chair for Lefevre, threw himself on a heap of cordage.
He looked around and above him, at the rippling, flashing water and
the black hulls of ships, and at the serene, starlit heavens
stretching over all.</p>

<p>"How wonderful!&mdash;how beautiful it all is!" he exclaimed.
"All, all!&mdash;even the dullest and deadest-seeming things are
vibrating, palpitating with the very madness of life! He set the
world in my heart, and oh, how I loved!&mdash;how I loved the
world!"</p>

<p>"It is a wonderful world," said Lefevre, trying to speak
cheerfully; "and you will take delight in it again when this
abnormal fit of depression is over."<a name='215.png' id=
'p215.png'></a></p>

<p>"Never, Lefevre!&mdash;never, never!" said Courtney in strenuous
tones. "I regret it deeply, bitterly, madly,&mdash;but yet I know
that I have about done with it!"</p>

<p>"Julius," said Lefevre, "I have been so amazed and bewildered,
that I have found little to say: I can scarcely believe that you
are in very deed the Julius I have known for years. But now let me
remind you I am your friend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lefevre."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;And I am ready to help you to the uttermost in
this crisis, which I but dimly understand. Tell me about yourself,
and let me see what I can do."</p>

<p>"You can do nothing," said Julius, sadly shaking his head.
"Understand me; I am not going to state a case for diagnosis. Put
that idea aside; I merely wish to confess myself to my friend."<a
name='216.png' id='p216.png'></a></p>

<p>"But surely," said Lefevre, "I may be your physician as well as
your friend. As long as you have life there is hope of life."</p>

<p>"No, no, no, Lefevre! There is a depth of life&mdash;life on the
lees&mdash;that is worse than death! If I could retrace my steps to
the beginning of this, taking my knowledge with me,
then&mdash;&mdash;! But no, I must go my appointed way, and face
what is beyond.... But let me tell you my story.</p>

<p>"You have heard something of my parentage from Dr Rippon, I
believe. My father was Spanish, and my mother was English. I think
I was born without that sense of responsibility to a traditional or
conventional standard which is called Conscience, and that sense of
obligation to consider others as important as myself, <a name=
'217.png' id='p217.png'></a> which, I believe, they call Altruism.
I do not know whether the lack of these senses had been manifest in
my mother's family, but I am sure it had been in my father's. For
generations it had been a law unto itself; none of its members had
known any duty but the fulfilment of his desires; and I believe
even that kind of outward conscience called Honour had scarcely
existed for some of them. I had from my earliest recollection the
nature of these ancestors: they, though dead, desired, acted, lived
in me,&mdash;with something of a difference, due to I know not
what. Let me try to state the fact as it appears to me looking
back: I was for myself the one consciousness, the one person in the
world, all else&mdash;trees, beasts, men and women, and what
not&mdash;being the medium in which, and on which, I lived. I
conceived of nothing <a name='218.png' id='p218.png'></a> around me
but as existing to please, to amuse, to delight me, and if anything
showed itself contrary to these ends, I simply avoided it. What I
wished to do I did; what I wished to have I had;&mdash;and nothing
else. I do not suppose that in these points I was different from
most other children of wealthy parents. Where I differed, I
believe, was in having a peculiarly sensitive, and at the same time
admirably healthy, constitution of body, which induced a remarkable
development of desire and gratification. I can hardly make you
understand, I am sure I cannot make you feel&mdash;I myself cannot
feel, I can only remember&mdash;what a bright natural creature I
was when I was young."</p>

<p>"Don't I remember well," said Lefevre, "what you were like when
I first met you in Paris?"<a name='219.png' id='p219.png'></a></p>

<p>"Ah," said Julius, "the change had begun then,&mdash;the change
that has brought me to this. I contemplate myself as I was before
that with bitter envy and regret. I was as a being sprung fresh
from the womb of primitive Nature. I delighted in Nature as a child
delights in its mother, and I throve on my delight as a child
thrives. I refused to go to school&mdash;and indeed little pressure
was put upon me&mdash;to be drilled in the paces and hypocrisy of
civilised mankind. I ran wild about the country; I became
proficient in all bodily exercises; I fenced and wrestled and
boxed; I leaped and swam; I rowed for days alone in a skiff; I
associated with simple peasants, and with all kinds of animals; I
delighted in air and water, and grass and trees: to me they were as
much alive as beasts are. Oh, what an exquisite, <a name='220.png'
id='p220.png'></a> abounding, unclouded pleasure life was! When I
was hungry I ate; when I was thirsty I drank; when I was tired I
slept; and when I woke I stretched myself like a giant refreshed.
It was a pure joy to me in those days to close my fingers into a
fist and see the beauty and firmness of my muscles. When solemn,
civilised people spoke to me of duty and work, I listened like an
idiot. I had nothing in my consciousness to help me to understand
them. I knew no more of duty than Crusoe on his island; and as for
work, I had no ambition,&mdash;why, then, should I work? I read, of
course; but I read because I liked it, not because I had tasks set
me. I read everything that came in my way; and very soon all
literature and science&mdash;all good poetry and romance, and all
genuine science&mdash;came to mean for me <a name='221.png' id=
'p221.png'></a> a fine, orderly expression of nature and life. And
religion, too, I felt as the ecstasy of nature. So I fed and
flourished on the milk of life and the bread of life.</p>

<p>"But a time came when I longed to live deeper, and to get at the
pith and marrow of life. I was over twenty when it was revealed to
me in a noonday splendour and warmth of light, that the human is
unspeakably the highest and most enthralling expression of life in
all Nature. That discovery happened to me when I was in Morocco
with my father, who died there&mdash;no matter how&mdash;among
those whom he liked to believe were his own people: my mother had
died long before. I had considerable wealth at my command, and I
began to live at the height of all my faculties; I lived in every
nerve, and at every pore.<a name='222.png' id='p222.png'></a></p>

<p>"And then I began to perceive a reverse to the bounteous beauty
and the overflowing life of Nature,&mdash;a threatening quality, a
devouring faculty in her by which she fed the joyous abundance of
her life. I saw that all activity, all the pleasant palpitation and
titillation in the life of Nature and of Man, merely means that one
living thing is feeding upon or is feeding another. I began to
perceive that all the interest of life centres in this
alter-devouring principle. I discovered, moreover, this strange
point,&mdash;that the joy of life is in direct proportion to the
rapidity with which we lose or surrender life."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lefevre, "the giving of pleasure is always more
exquisite and satisfactory than the getting it."</p>

<p>"I lost life," continued Julius, without noting Lefevre's
remark,&mdash;"I lost life,&mdash;vital <a name='223.png' id=
'p223.png'></a> force, nervous ether, electricity, whatever you
choose to call it,&mdash;at an enormous rate, but I as quickly
replenished my loss. I had revelled for some time in this deeper
life of give and take before I discovered that this faculty of
recuperation also was curiously and wonderfully active in me.
Whenever I fell into a state of weakness, well-nigh empty of life,
I withdrew myself from company, and dwelt for a little while with
the simplest forms of Nature."</p>

<p>"But," asked Lefevre, "how did you get into such a low
condition?"</p>

<p>"How? <i>I lived!</i>" said he with fervour. "<i>Yes; I
lived:</i> that was how! I had always delighted in animals, but
then I began to find that when I caressed them they were not merely
tamed, as they had been wont, but completely subdued; and I felt
rapid and full accessions of life from <a name='224.png' id=
'p224.png'></a> contact with them. If I lay upon a bank of rich
grass or wild flowers, I had to a slight extent the same
revivifying sensation. The fable of Ant&aelig;us was fulfilled in
me. The constant recurrence and vigour of this recuperation not
only filled me with pride, but also set me thinking. I turned to
medical science to find the secret of it. I entered myself as a
student in Paris: it was then I met you. I read deeply, too, in the
books of the medi&aelig;val alchemists and sages of Spain, which my
father had left me. It came upon me in a clear flood of evidence
that Nature and man are one and indivisible, being animated by one
identical Energy or Spirit of Life, however various may be the
material forms; and that all things, all creatures, according to
the activity of their life, have the power of communicating, of
giving or <a name='225.png' id='p225.png'></a> taking, this
invisible force of life. It furthermore became clear to me that,
though the force resides in all parts of a body, floating in every
corpuscle of blood, yet its proper channels of circulation and
communication are the nerves, so that as soon as a nerve in any one
shape of life touches a nerve in any other, there is an instant
tendency to establish in them a common level of the Force of Life.
If I or you touch a man or woman with a finger, or clasp their
hand, or embrace them more completely, the tendency is at once set
up, and the force seeks to flow, and, according to certain
conditions, does flow, from one to another, evermore seeking to
find a common level,&mdash;always, that is, in the direction of the
greater need, or the greater capacity. I saw then that not only had
I a greater storage capacity, so to say, than <a name='226.png' id=
'p226.png'></a> most men, but also, therefore, when exhaustion
came, I had a more insistent need for replenishment, and a more
violent shrinking at all times from any weak or unhealthy person
who might even by chance contact make a demand on my store of
life."</p>

<p>"And is that your secret?" asked Lefevre. "I have arrived in a
different way at something like the same discovery."</p>

<p>"I know you have," said Julius. "But my peculiar secret is not
that, though it is connected with it. I am growing very tired,"
said he, abruptly. "I must be quick, Lefevre," he continued in a
hurried, weak voice of appeal; "grant me one little last favour to
enable me to finish."</p>

<p>"Anything I can do I will, Julius," said Lefevre, suddenly
roused out of the half-drowsiness which the soft night induced. <a
name='227.png' id='p227.png'></a> He was held between alarm and
fascination by the look which Julius bent on him.</p>

<p>"I am ashamed to ask, but you are full of life," said Julius: "I
am at the shallowest ebb. Just for one minute help me. Of your
free-will submit yourself to me for but a moment. Will you do me
that service?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lefevre, after an instant's hesitation; "certainly I
will."</p>

<p>Julius half rose from his reclining position; he turned on
Lefevre his wonderful eyes, which in the mysterious twilight that
suffused the midsummer night burned with a surprising brilliance.
Lefevre felt himself seized and held in their influence.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand," said Julius.</p>

<p>The doctor gave his hand, his eyes being still held by those of
Julius, and <a name='228.png' id='p228.png'></a> instantly, as it
seemed to him, he plunged, as a man dives into the sea, into a gulf
of unconsciousness, from which he presently emerged with something
like a gasp and with a tremulous sensation about his heart. What
had happened to him he did not know; but he felt slacker of fibre,
as if virtue had gone out of him, while Julius, when he spoke,
seemed refreshed as by a draught of wine.</p>

<p>"How are you?" asked Julius. "For heaven's sake don't let me
think that at the last I have troubled much the current of your
life! Will you have something to eat and drink? There's wine and
food below."</p>

<p>"Thank you; no," said Lefevre. "I am well enough, only a little
drowsy."</p>

<p>"I am stronger," said Julius, "but it will not last; so let me
finish my story."<a name='229.png' id='p229.png'></a></p>

<p>Then he continued. "Having explained to myself, in the way I
have told you, the ease of my unwitting replenishment of force
whenever I was brought low, I set myself to improve on my
discovery. I saw before me a prospect of enjoyment of all the
delights of life, deeper and more constant than most men ever
know,&mdash;if I could only ensure to myself with absolute
certainty a still more complete and rapid reinvigoration as often
soever as I sank into exhaustion. I was quite sure that no energy
of life is finer or fuller than the human at its best."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Lefevre, turning away with an involuntary
shudder.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake!" cried Julius, "don't shrink from me now, or
you will tempt me to be less frank than I have been. I wish to make
full confession. I <a name='230.png' id='p230.png'></a> know, I see
now, I have been cruelly, brutally selfish&mdash;as selfish as
Nature herself!&mdash;none knows that better than I. But remember,
in extenuation, what I have told you of my origin and my growth.
And I had not the suspicion of a thought of injuring any one. Fool!
fool! egregious fool that I was! I who understood most things so
clearly did not guess that no creature, no being in the
universe&mdash;god, or man, or beast&mdash;can indulge in arrogant,
full, magnificent enjoyment without gathering and living in
himself, squandering through himself, the lives of others, to their
eternal loss and his own final ruin! But, as I said, I did not
think, and it was not evident until recently, that I injured any
one. I had for a long time been aware that I had an unusual
mesmeric or magnetic influence&mdash;call it <a name='231.png' id=
'p231.png'></a> what you will&mdash;over others. I cultivated that
power in eye and hand, so that I was soon able to take any person
at unawares whom I considered fit for my purpose, and subdue him or
her completely to myself. Then after one or two failures I hit upon
a method, which I perfected at length into entire simplicity, by
which I was able to tap the nervous system and draw into myself as
much as ever I needed of the abounding force of life, without
leaving any sign which even the most skilful doctor could
detect."</p>

<p>"Julius, you sicken me!" exclaimed Lefevre. "I am a doctor, but
you sicken me!"</p>

<p>"I explain myself so in detail," said Julius, "<i>because</i>
you are a doctor. But let me finish. I lived that life of complete
wedlock with Nature for I dare not think how many years."<a name=
'232.png' id='p232.png'></a></p>

<p>"And you did not get weary of it?" asked Lefevre.</p>

<p>"Weary of it? No! I returned to it always, after a pause of a
few days for the reinvigoration I needed,&mdash;I returned to it
with all the freshness of youth, with the advantage which, of
course, mere youth can never have,&mdash;an amazingly rich
experience. I revelled in the full lap of life. I passed through
many lands, civilised and barbaric; but it was my especial delight
to strike down to that simple, passionate, essential nature which
lies beneath the thickest lacquer of refinements in our civilised
societies. Oh, what a life it was!&mdash;what a life!</p>

<p>"But a change came: it must have been growing on me for some
time without my knowledge. I commonly removed from society when I
felt exhaustion coming on <a name='233.png' id='p233.png'></a> me;
but on one occasion it chanced that I stayed on in the pleasant
company I was in (I was then in Vienna). I did not exactly feel
ill; I felt merely weary and languid, and thought that presently I
would go to bed. Gradually I began to observe that the looks of my
companions were bent strangely on me, and that the expression of
their countenances more and more developed surprise and alarm.
'What is the matter with you all?' I demanded; when they instantly
cried, 'What is the matter with <i>you?</i> Have you been
poisoned?' I rose and went and looked in a mirror; I saw, with
ghastly horror, what I was like, and I knew then that I was <i>
doomed</i>. I fled from that company for ever. I saw that, when the
alien life on which I flourished was gone out of me, I was a worn
old man&mdash;that <a name='234.png' id='p234.png'></a> the Fire of
Life which usually burned in my body, making me look bright and
young, was now none of it my own; a few hot ashes only were mine,
which Death sat cowering by! I could not but sit and gaze at the
reflection of the seared ghastliness of that face, which was mine
and yet not mine, and feel well-nigh sick unto death. After a
while, however, I plucked up heart. I considered that it was
impossible this change had come all at once; I must have looked
like that&mdash;or almost like that&mdash;once or twice or oftener
before, and yet life and reinvigoration had gone on as they had
been wont. I wrapped myself well up, and went out. I found a fit
subject. I replenished my life as theretofore; my youthful, fresh
appearance returned, and my confidence with it. I refused to look
again upon my own, <a name='235.png' id='p235.png'></a> my worn
face, from that time until tonight.</p>

<p>"But alarm again seized me about a year ago, when I chanced by
calculation to note that my periods of abounding life were
gradually getting shorter,&mdash;that I needed reinvigoration at
more frequent intervals;&mdash;not that I did not take as much from
my subjects as formerly&mdash;on the contrary, I seemed to take
more&mdash;but that I lost more rapidly what I took, as if my body
were becoming little better than a fine sieve. The last stage of
all was this that you are familiar with, when my subjects began to
be so utterly exhausted as to attract public notice. Yet that is
not what has given me pause, and made me resolve to bring the whole
weary, selfish business to an end. Could I not have gone
elsewhere&mdash;anywhere, the wide world over&mdash;and <a name=
'236.png' id='p236.png'></a> lived my life? But I was kept, I was
tethered here, to this London by a feeling I had never known
before. Call it by the common fool's name of Love; call it what you
will. I was fascinated by your sister Nora, even as others had been
fascinated by me, even as I had been in my youth by the bountiful,
gracious beauty of Nature."</p>

<p>"I have wanted to ask you," said Lefevre, "for an explanation of
your conduct towards Nora. Why did you&mdash;with your awful
life&mdash;life which, as you say, was not your own, and your
extraordinary secret&mdash;why did you remain near her, and
entangle her with your fascinations? What did you
desire?&mdash;what did you hope for?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely know for what I hoped. But let me speak of her; for
she has traversed and completely eclipsed my <a name='237.png' id=
'p237.png'></a> former vision of Nature. I have told you what my
point of view was,&mdash;alone in the midst of Nature. I was for
myself the only consciousness in the world, and all the world
besides was merely a variety of material and impression, to be
observed and known, to be interested in and delighted with. I was
thus lonely, lonely as a despot, when Nora, your sister, appeared
to me, and instantly I became aware there was another consciousness
in the world as great as, or greater than, my own,&mdash;another
person than myself, a person of supreme beauty and intelligence and
faculty. She became to me all that Nature had been, and more. She
expressed for me all that I had sought to find diffused through
Nature, and at the same time she stood forth to me as an equal of
my own kind, with as great a <a name='238.png' id='p238.png'></a>
capacity for life. At first I had a vision of our living and
reigning together, so to say, though the word may seem to you
absurd; but I soon discovered that there was a gulf fixed between
us,&mdash;the gulf of the life I had lived; she stood pure where I
had stood a dozen years ago. So, gradually, she subverted my whole
scheme of life; more and more, without knowing it, she made me see
and judge myself with her eyes, till I felt altogether abased
before her. But that which finally stripped the veil from me, and
showed me myself as the hateful incarnation of relentlessly
devouring Self, was my influence upon her, which culminated in the
event of last night. Can you conceive how I was smitten and pierced
with horror by the discovery that rose on me like a nightmare, that
even on her sweet, pure, <a name='239.png' id='p239.png'></a>
sumptuous life, I had unwittingly begun to prey? For that discovery
flung wide the door of the future and showed me what I would
become.</p>

<p>"Beautiful, calm, divine Nora! If I could but have continued
near her without touching her, to delight in the thought and the
sight of her, as one delights in the wind and the sunshine! But it
could not be. I could only appear fit company for her if I
refreshed and strengthened myself as I had been wont; but my new
disgust of myself, and pity for my victims, made me shudder at the
thought. What then? Here I am, and the time has come (as that old
doctor said it would) when death appears more beautiful and
friendly and desirable than life. Forgive me, Lefevre&mdash;forgive
me on Nora's part,&mdash;and forgive me in the name of human
nature."<a name='240.png' id='p240.png'></a></p>

<p>Lefevre could not reply for the moment. He sat convulsed with
heartrending sobs. He put out his hand to Julius.</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Julius, "I must not take your hand. You know
I must not."</p>

<p>"Take my hand," cried Lefevre. "I know what it means. Take my
life! Leave me but enough to recover. I give it you freely, for I
wish you to live. You shall not die. By heaven! you shall not die.
O Julius, Julius! why did you not tell me this long ago? Science
has resource enough to deliver you from your mistake."</p>

<p>"Lefevre," said Julius,&mdash;and his eyes sparkled with tears
and his weakening voice was choked,&mdash;"your friendship moves me
deeply&mdash;to the soul. But science can do nothing for me:
science <a name='241.png' id='p241.png'></a> has not yet sufficient
knowledge of the principle on which I lived. Would you have me,
then, live on,&mdash;passing to and fro among mankind merely as a
blight, taking the energy of life, even from whomsoever I would
not? No, I must die! Death is best!"</p>

<p>"I will not let you die," said Lefevre, rising to take a pace or
two on the deck. "You shall come home with me. I shall feed your
life&mdash;there are dozens besides myself who will be glad to
assist&mdash;till you are healed of the devouring demon you have
raised within you."</p>

<p>"No, no, no, my dear friend!" cried Julius. "I have steadily
sinned against the most vital law of life."</p>

<p>"Julius," said Lefevre, standing over him, "my friendship, my
love for you may blind me to the enormity of your sin, but I <a
name='242.png' id='p242.png'></a> can find it in me to say, in the
name of humanity, 'I forgive you all! Now, rise up and live anew!
Your intelligence, your soul is too rare and admirable to be
snuffed out like a guttering candle!'"</p>

<p>"Lefevre," said Julius, "you are a perfect friend! But your
knowledge of this secret force of Nature, which we have both
studied, is not so great as mine. Let me tell you, then, that this
mystical saying, which I once scoffed at, is the profoundest
truth:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='line'>"'Who loveth life shall lose it all;</div>

<div class='line'>Who seeketh life shall surely fall!'</div>
</div>

<p>"There is no remedy for me but death, which (who knows?) may be
the mother of new life!"</p>

<p>"It would have been better for you," said Lefevre, sitting down
again with his <a name='243.png' id='p243.png'></a> head in his
hands, "better&mdash;if you had never seen Nora."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," cried Julius, sitting up, animate with a fresh
impulse of life. "Better for her, dear, beautiful soul, but not for
me! I have truly lived only since I saw her, and I have the joy of
feeling that I have beheld and known Nature's sole and perfect
chrysolite. But I must be quick, my friend; the dawn will soon be
upon us. There is but one other thing for me to speak of&mdash;my
method of taking to myself the force of life. It is my secret; it
is perfectly adapted for professional use, and I wish to give it to
you, because you are wise enough in mind, and great enough of soul,
to use it for the benefit of mankind."</p>

<p>"I will not hear you, Julius!" exclaimed Lefevre. "I am neither
wise nor great. <a name='244.png' id='p244.png'></a> Your perfect
secret would be too much for me. I might be tempted to keep it for
my own use. Come home with me, and apply it well yourself."</p>

<p>Julius was silent for a space, murmuring only, "I have no time
for argument." Then his face assumed the white sickness of death,
and his dark eyes seemed to grow larger and to burn with a
concentrated fire.</p>

<p>"Lefevre!" he panted in amazement, "do you know that you are
refusing such a medical and spiritual secret as the world has not
known for thousands of years? A secret that would enable
you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;to work cures more wonderful than any
that are told of the greatest Eastern Thaumaturge?"</p>

<p>"I have discovered a method," answered the doctor,&mdash;"an
imperfect, clumsy method&mdash;for <a name='245.png' id='p245.png'>
</a> myself, of transmitting nervous force or ether for curative
purposes. That, for the present, must be enough for me. I cannot
hear your secret, Julius."</p>

<p>"Lefevre, I beg of you," pleaded Julius, "take it from me. I
have promised myself, as a last satisfaction, that the secret I
have guarded&mdash;it is not altogether mine: it is an old oriental
secret&mdash;that now I would hand it over to you for the good of
mankind, that at the last I might say to myself, 'I have, after
all, opened my hand liberally to my fellow-men!' For pity's sake,
Lefevre, don't deny me that small final satisfaction!"</p>

<p>"Julius," said Lefevre, firmly, "if your method is so
perfect&mdash;as I believe it must be from what I have seen&mdash;I
dare not lay on myself the responsibility of possessing its
secret."<a name='246.png' id='p246.png'></a></p>

<p>"Would not my example keep you from using it selfishly?"</p>

<p>"Does the experience of another," demanded the doctor, "however
untoward it may be, ever keep a man from making his own? I dare
not&mdash;I dare not trust myself to hold your perfect secret."</p>

<p>"Then share it with others," responded Julius, promptly; "and I
daresay it is not so perfect, but that it could be made more
perfect still."</p>

<p>"I'll have nothing to do with it, Julius; you must keep and use
it yourself."</p>

<p>"Then," cried Julius, throwing himself on his bed of cordage,
"then there will be, indeed, an end of me!"</p>

<p>There was no sound for a time, but the soft rush of the sea at
the bows of the yacht. They had left the Thames water some distance
behind, and were then in <a name='247.png' id='p247.png'></a> that
part of the estuary where it is just possible in mid-channel to
descry either coast. The glorious rose of dawn was just beginning
to flame in the eastern sky. Lefevre looked about him, and strove
to shake off the sensation, which would cling to him, that he was
involved in a strange dream. There lay Julius or Hernando Courtney
before him; or at least the figure of a man with his face hid in
his hands. What more could be said or done?</p>

<p>In the meantime light was swiftly rushing up the sky and waking
all things to life. A flock of seagulls came from the depth of the
night and wheeled about the yacht, their shrill screams strangely
softened in the morning air. At the sound of them Julius roused
himself, and raised himself on his elbow to watch their <a name=
'248.png' id='p248.png'></a> beautiful evolutions. As he watched,
one and another swooped gracefully to the water, and hanging there
an instant, rose with a fish and flew away. Julius flung himself
again on his face.</p>

<p>"O God!" he cried. "Is it not horrible? Even on such a beautiful
day as this death wakes as early as life! Devouring death is
ushered in by the dawn, hand in hand with generous life! Awful,
devilish Nature! that makes all creatures full of beauty and
delight, and then condemns them to live upon each other! Nature is
the sphinx: she appears soft and gentle and more lovely than heart
can bear, but if you look closer, you see she is a creature with
claws and teeth that rend and devour! I thought, fool that I was!
that I had found the secret to solve her riddle! But it was an
empty hope, a vain <a name='249.png' id='p249.png'></a>
imagination.... Yet, I have lived! Yes, I have lived!"</p>

<p>He rose and stood erect, facing the dawn, with his back to
Lefevre. He stood thus for some time, with one foot on the low
bulwark of the vessel, till the sun leaped above the horizon and
flamed with blinding brilliance across the sea.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he murmured. "The superb, the glorious sun! Unwearied lord
of Creation! Generous giver of all light and life! And yet, who
knows what worlds he may not have drawn into his flaming self, and
consumed during the &aelig;ons of his existence? It is ever and
everywhere the same: death in company with life! And swift, strong
death is better than slow, weak life!... Almost the splendour and
inspiration of his rising tempt me to stay! Great nourisher and
renewer of life's heat!"<a name='250.png' id='p250.png'></a></p>

<p>He put off his fur coat, and let it fall on the deck, and stood
for a while as if wrapt in ecstasy. Then, before Lefevre could
conceive his intention, his feet were together on the bulwark, and
with a flash and a plunge he was gone!</p>

<p>Amazement held the doctor's energies congealed, though but for
an instant or two. Then he threw off hat and coat, and stood alert
and resolute to dive to Julius's rescue when he rose, while those
who manned the yacht prepared to cast a buoy and line. Not a ripple
or flash of water passed unheeded; the flood of sunshine rose
fuller and fuller over the world; moments grew to minutes, and
minutes swelled to hopeless hours under the doctor's weary eyes,
till it seemed to them as if the universe were only a swirling,
greedy ocean;&mdash;but no sign appeared <a name='251.png' id=
'p251.png'></a> of his night's companion: his life was quenched in
the depths of the restless waters, as a flaming meteor is quenched
in night. At length Lefevre ordered the yacht to stand away to the
shore, his heart torn with grief and self-upbraiding. He had called
Courtney his friend, and yet until that last he had never won his
inner confidence; and now he knew that his friend&mdash;he of the gentle
heart, the peerless intelligence, and the wildly erring
life&mdash;was dead in the hour of self-redemption.</p>

<p>When he had landed, however, given to the proper authorities
such information as was necessary, and set off by train on his
return to town, the agitation of his grief began to assuage; and
when next day, upon the publication in the papers of the news of
Courtney's death by drowning, a solicitor called in Savile Row with
a will <a name='252.png' id='p252.png'></a> which he had drawn up
two days before, and by which all Julius Courtney's property was
left to Dr Lefevre, to dispose of as he thought best, "for
scientific and humane ends," the doctor admitted to his reason that
a death that could thus calmly be prepared was not lightly to be
questioned.</p>

<p>"He must have known best," he said to himself, as he bowed over
his hands&mdash;"he must have known best when to put off the
poisoned garment of life he had woven for himself."</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
