  <h2><a name="pref" id="pref">AUTHOR'S PREFACE</a></h2>

  <p>The encouraging reception of my "Development of the Feeling for
  Nature among the Greeks and Romans" gradually decided me, after some
  years, to carry the subject on to modern tunes. Enticing as it was, I
  did not shut my eyes to the great difficulties of a task whose
  dimensions have daunted many a savant since the days of Humboldt's
  clever, terse sketches of the feeling for Nature in different times
  and peoples. But the subject, once approached, would not let me go.
  Its solution seemed only possible from the side of historical
  development, not from that of <i>a priori</i> synthesis. The almost
  inexhaustible amount of material, especially towards modern times,
  has often obliged me to limit myself to typical forerunners of the
  various epochs, although, at the same time, I have tried not to lose
  the thread of general development. By the addition of the chief
  phases of landscape, painting, and garden craft, I have aimed at
  giving completeness to the historical picture; but I hold that
  literature, especially poetry, as the most intimate medium of a
  nation's feelings, is the chief source of information in an enquiry
  which may <span class="pagenum"><a name="pgvi" id=
  "pgvi">vi</a></span>form a contribution, not only to the history of
  taste, but also to the comparative history of literature. At a time
  too when the natural sciences are so highly developed, and the cult
  of Nature is so widespread, a book of this kind may perhaps claim the
  interest of that wide circle of educated readers to whom the modern
  delight in Nature on its many sides makes appeal. And this the more,
  since books are rare which seek to embrace the whole mental
  development of the Middle Ages and modern times, and are, at the same
  time, intended for and intelligible to all people of cultivation.</p>

  <p>The book has been a work of love, and I hope it will be read with
  pleasure, not only by those whose special domain it touches, but by
  all who care for the eternal beauties of Nature. To those who know my
  earlier papers in the <i>Preussische Jahrbücher</i>, the
  <i>Zeitschrift für Vergleichende Litteraturgeschichte</i>, and the
  <i>Litteraturbeilage des Hamburgischen Correspondents</i>, I trust
  this fuller and more connected treatment of the theme will prove
  welcome.</p>

  <h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p>Nature in her ever-constant, ever-changing phases is indispensable
  to man, his whole existence depends upon her, and she influences him
  in manifold ways, in mind as well as body.</p>

  <p>The physical character of a country is reflected in its
  inhabitants; the one factor of climate alone gives a very different
  outlook to northerner and southerner. But whereas primitive man, to
  whom the darkness of night meant anxiety, either feared Nature or
  worshipped her with awe, civilised man tries to lift her veil, and
  through science and art to understand her inner and outer beauty--the
  scientist in her laws, the man of religion in her relation to his
  Creator, the artist in reproducing the impressions she makes upon
  him.</p>

  <p>Probably it has always been common to healthy minds to take some
  pleasure in her; but it needs no slight culture of heart and mind to
  grasp her meaning and make it clear to others. Her book lies open
  before us, but the interpretations have been many and dissimilar. A
  fine statue or a richly-coloured picture appeals to all, but only
  knowledge can appreciate it at its true value and discover the full
  meaning of the artist. And as with Art, so with Nature.</p>

  <p>For Nature is the greatest artist, though dumb until man, with his
  inexplicable power of putting himself in her place, transferring to
  her his bodily and mental self, gives her speech. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg002" id="pg002">002</a></span> Goethe said 'man
  never understands how anthropomorphic he is.' No study, however
  comprehensive, enables him to overstep human limits, or conceive a
  concrete being, even the highest, from a wholly impersonal point of
  view. His own self always remains an encumbering factor. In a real
  sense he only understands himself, and his measure for all things is
  man. To understand the world outside him, he must needs ascribe his
  own attributes to it, must lend his own being to find it again.</p>

  <p>This unexplained faculty, or rather inherent necessity, which
  implies at once a power and a limit, extends to persons as well as
  things. The significant word sympathy expresses it. To feel a
  friend's grief is to put oneself in his place, think from his
  standpoint and in his mood--that is, suffer with him. The fear and
  sympathy which condition the action of tragedy depend upon the same
  mental process; one's own point of view is shifted to that of
  another, and when the two are in harmony, and only then, the claim of
  beauty is satisfied, and æsthetic pleasure results.</p>

  <p>By the well-known expression of Greek philosophy, 'like is only
  understood by like,' the Pythagoreans meant that the mathematically
  trained mind is the organ by which the mathematically constructed
  cosmos is understood. The expression may also serve as an æsthetic
  aphorism. The charm of the simplest lyrical song depends upon the
  hearer's power to put himself in the mood or situation described by
  the poet, on an interplay between subject and object.</p>

  <p>Everything in mental life depends upon this faculty. We observe,
  ponder, feel, because a kindred vibration in the object sets our own
  fibres in motion.</p>

  <p>'You resemble the mind which you understand.'</p>

  <p>It is a magic bridge from our own mind, making <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg003" id="pg003">003</a></span>access possible to
  a work of art, an electric current conveying the artist's ideas into
  our souls.</p>

  <p>We know how a drama or a song can thrill us when our feeling
  vibrates with it; and that thrill, Faust tells us, is the best part
  of man.</p>

  <p>If inventive work in whatever art or science gives the purest kind
  of pleasure, Nature herself seeming to work through the artist,
  rousing those impulses which come to him as revelations, there is
  pleasure also in the passive reception of beauty, especially when we
  are not content to remain passive, but trace out and rethink the
  artist's thoughts, remaking his work.</p>

  <p>'To invent for oneself is beautiful; but to recognise gladly and
  treasure up the happy inventions of others is that less thine?' said
  Goethe in his <i>Jahreszeiten</i>; and in the <i>Aphorisms</i>,
  confirming what has just been said: 'We know of no world except in
  relation to man, we desire no art but that which is the expression of
  this relation.' And, further, 'Look into yourselves and you will find
  everything, and rejoice if outside yourselves, as you may say, lies a
  Nature which says yea and amen to all that you have found there.'</p>

  <p>Certainly Nature only bestows on man in proportion to his own
  inner wealth. As Rückert says, 'the charm of a landscape lies in
  this, that it seems to reflect back that part of one's inner life, of
  mind, mood, and feeling, which we have given it.' And Ebers, 'Lay
  down your best of heart and mind before eternal Nature; she will
  repay you a thousandfold, with full hands.'</p>

  <p>And Vischer remarks, 'Nature at her greatest is not so great that
  she can work without man's mind.' Every landscape can be beautiful
  and stimulating if human feeling colours it, and it will be most so
  to him who brings the richest endowment of heart and mind to bear:
  Nature only discloses her whole self to a whole man.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg004" id="pg004">004</a></span>
  But it is under the poet's wand above all, that, like the marble at
  Pygmalion's breast, she grows warm and breathes and answers to his
  charm; as in that symbolic saga, the listening woods and waters and
  the creatures followed Orpheus with his lute. Scientific knowledge,
  optical, acoustical, meteorological, geological, only widens and
  deepens love for her and increases and refines the sense of her
  beauty. In short, deep feeling for Nature always proves considerable
  culture of heart and mind.</p>

  <p>There is a constant analogy between the growth of this feeling and
  that of general culture.</p>

  <p>As each nation and time has its own mode of thought, which is
  constantly changing, so each period has its 'landscape eye.' The same
  rule applies to individuals. Nature, as Jean Paul said, is made
  intelligible to man in being for ever made flesh. We cannot look at
  her impersonally, we must needs give her form and soul, in order to
  grasp and describe her.</p>

  <p>Vischer says<a href="#a1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> 'it is simply by an
  act of comparison that we think we see our own life in inanimate
  objects.' We say that Nature's clearness is like clearness of mind,
  that her darkness and gloom are like a dark and gloomy mood; then,
  omitting 'like,' we go on to ascribe our qualities directly to her,
  and say, this neighbourhood, this air, this general tone of colour,
  is cheerful, melancholy, and so forth. Here we are prompted by an
  undeveloped dormant consciousness which really only compares, while
  it seems to take one thing for another. In this way we come to say
  that a rock projects boldly, that fire rages furiously over a
  building, that a summer evening with flocks going home at sunset is
  peaceful and idyllic; that autumn, dripping with rain, its willows
  sighing in the wind, is elegiac and melancholy and so forth.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Nature would not prove to be this ready symbol of man's
  inner life were there no secret <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg005"
  id="pg005">005</a></span>rapport between the two. It is as if, in
  some mysterious way, we meet in her another mind, which speaks a
  language we know, wakening a foretaste of kinship; and whether the
  soul she expresses is one we have lent her, or her own which we have
  divined, the relationship is still one of give and take.</p>

  <p>Let us take a rapid survey of the course of this feeling in
  antiquity. Pantheism has always been the home of a special tenderness
  for Nature, and the poetry of India is full of intimate dealings
  between man and plants and animals.</p>

  <p>They are found in the loftiest flights of religious enthusiasm in
  the Vedas, where, be it only in reference to the splendour of dawn or
  the 'golden-handed sun,' Nature is always assumed to be closely
  connected with man's inner and outer life. Later on, as Brahminism
  appeared, deepening the contemplative side of Hindoo character, and
  the drama and historical plays came in, generalities gave way to
  definite localizing, and in the Epics ornate descriptions of actual
  landscape took independent place. Nature's sympathy with human joys
  and griefs was taken for granted, and she played a part of her own in
  drama.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Mahâbhârata</i>, when Damajanti is wandering in search
  of her lost Nala and sees the great mountain top, she asks it for her
  prince.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">Oh mountain lord!</p>

    <p>Far seen and celebrated hill, that cleav'st</p>

    <p>The blue o' the sky, refuge of living things,</p>

    <p>Most noble eminence, I worship thee!...</p>

    <p>O Mount, whose double ridge stamps on the sky</p>

    <p>Yon line, by five-score splendid pinnacles</p>

    <p>Indented; tell me, in this gloomy wood</p>

    <p>Hast thou seen Nala? Nala, wise and bold!</p>

    <p>Ah mountain! why consolest thou me not,</p>

    <p>Answering one word to sorrowful, distressed,</p>

    <p>Lonely, lost Damajanti?</p>
  </div>

  <p>And when she comes to the tree Asoka, she implores: <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg006" id="pg006">006</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Ah, lovely tree! that wavest here</p>

    <p>Thy crown of countless shining clustering blooms</p>

    <p>As thou wert woodland king! Asoka tree!</p>

    <p>Tree called the sorrow-ender, heart's-ease tree!</p>

    <p>Be what thy name saith; end my sorrow now,</p>

    <p>Saying, ah, bright Asoka, thou hast seen</p>

    <p>My Prince, my dauntless Nala--seen that lord</p>

    <p>Whom Damajanti loves and his foes fear.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In Maghas' epic, <i>The Death of Sisupala</i>, plants and animals
  lead the same voluptuous life as the 'deep-bosomed, wide-hipped'
  girls with the ardent men.</p>

  <p>'The mountain Raivataka touches the ether with a thousand heads,
  earth with a thousand feet, the sun and moon are his eyes. When the
  birds are tired and tremble with delight from the caresses of their
  mates, he grants them shade from lotos leaves. Who in the world is
  not astonished when he has climbed, to see the prince of mountains
  who overshadows the ether and far-reaching regions of earth, standing
  there with his great projecting crags, while the moon's sickle
  trembles on his summit?'</p>

  <p>In Kalidasa's <i>Urwasi</i>, the deserted King who is searching
  for his wife asks the peacock:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i10">Oh tell,</p>

    <p>If, free on the wing as you soar,</p>

    <p>You have seen the loved nymph I deplore--</p>

    <p>You will know her, the fairest of damsels fair,</p>

    <p>By her large soft eye and her graceful air;</p>

    <p>Bird of the dark blue throat and eye of jet,</p>

    <p>Oh tell me, have you seen the lovely face</p>

    <p>Of my fair bride--lost in this dreary wilderness?</p>
  </div>

  <p>and the mountain:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Say mountain, whose expansive slope confines</p>

    <p>The forest verge, oh, tell me hast thou seen</p>

    <p>A nymph as beauteous as the bride of love</p>

    <p>Mounting with slender frame thy steep ascent,</p>

    <p>Or wearied, resting in thy crowning woods?</p>
  </div>

  <p>As he sits by the side of the stream, he asks whence comes its
  charm: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg007" id=
  "pg007">007</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Whilst gazing on the stream, whose new swollen waters</p>

    <p>Yet turbid flow, what strange imaginings</p>

    <p>Possess my soul and fill it with delight.</p>

    <p>The rippling wave is like her aching brow;</p>

    <p>The fluttering line of storks, her timid tongue;</p>

    <p>The foaming spray, her white loose floating vest;</p>

    <p>And this meandering course the current tracks</p>

    <p>Her undulating gait.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Then he sees a creeper without flowers, and a strange attraction
  impels him to embrace it, for its likeness to his lost love:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Vine of the wilderness, behold</p>

    <p>A lone heartbroken wretch in me,</p>

    <p>Who dreams in his embrace to fold</p>

    <p>His love, as wild he clings to thee.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Thereupon the creeper transforms itself into Urwasi.</p>

  <p>In Kalidasa's <i>Sakuntala</i>, too, when the pretty girls are
  watering the flowers in the garden, Sakuntala says: 'It is not only
  in obedience to our father that I thus employ myself. I really feel
  the affection of a sister for these young plants.' Taking it for
  granted that the mango tree has the same feeling for herself, she
  cries: 'Yon Amra tree, my friends, points with the fingers of its
  leaves, which the gale gently agitates, and seems inclined to whisper
  some secret'; and with maiden shyness, attributing her own thoughts
  about love to the plants, one of her comrades says: 'See, my
  Sakuntala, how yon fresh Mallica which you have surnamed Vanadosini
  or Delight of the Grove, has chosen the sweet Amra for her
  bridegroom....'</p>

  <p>'How charming is the season, when the nuptials even of plants are
  thus publicly celebrated!'--and elsewhere:</p>

  <p>'Here is a plant, Sakuntala, which you have forgotten.' Sakuntala:
  'Then I shall forget myself.'</p>

  <p>Birds, clouds,<a href="#a2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and waves are
  messengers of love; all Nature grieves at the separation of lovers.
  When <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg008" id=
  "pg008">008</a></span>Sakuntala is leaving her forest, one of her
  friends says: 'Mark the affliction of the forest itself when the time
  of your departure approaches!</p>

  <p>'The female antelope browses no more on the collected Cusa grass,
  and the pea-hen ceases to dance on the lawn; the very plants of the
  grove, whose pale leaves fall on the ground, lose their strength and
  their beauty.'</p>

  <p>The poems of India, especially those devoted to descriptions of
  Nature, abound in such bold, picturesque personifications, which are
  touching, despite their extravagance, through their intense sympathy
  with Nature. They shew the Hindoo attitude toward Nature in general,
  as well as his boundless fancy. I select one example from 'The
  Gathering of the Seasons' in Kalidasa's <i>Ritusanhare</i>: a
  description of the Rains.</p>

  <p>'Pouring rain in torrents at the request of the thirst-stricken
  Chatakas, and emitting slow mutterings pleasing to the ears, clouds,
  bent down by the weight of their watery contents, are slowly moving
  on....</p>

  <p>'The rivers being filled up with the muddy water of the rivers,
  their force is increased. Therefore, felling down the trees on both
  the banks, they, like unchaste women, are going quickly towards the
  ocean....</p>

  <p>'The heat of the forest has been removed by the sprinkling of new
  water, and the Ketaka flowers have blossomed. On the branches of
  trees being shaken by the wind, it appears that the entire forest is
  dancing in delight. On the blossoming of Ketaka flowers it appears
  that the forest is smiling. Thinking, "he is our refuge when we are
  bent down by the weight of water, the clouds are enlivening with
  torrents the mount Vindhya assailed with fierce heat (of the
  summer)."'</p>

  <p>Charming pictures and comparisons are numerous, though they have
  the exaggeration common to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg009" id=
  "pg009">009</a></span>oriental imagination, 'Love was the cause of my
  distemper, and love has healed it; as a summer's day, grown black
  with clouds, relieves all animals from the heat which itself had
  caused.'</p>

  <p>'Should you be removed to the ends of the world, you will be fixed
  in this heart, as the shade of a lofty tree remains with it even when
  the day is departed.'</p>

  <p>'The tree of my hope which had risen so luxuriantly is broken
  down.'</p>

  <p>'Removed from the bosom of my father, like a young sandal tree
  rent from the hill of Malaja, how shall I exist in a strange
  soil?'</p>

  <p>This familiar intercourse with Nature stood far as the poles
  asunder from the monotheistic attitude of the Hebrew. The individual,
  it is true, was nothing in comparison with Brahma, the All-One; but
  the divine pervaded and sanctified all things, and so gave them a
  certain value; whilst before Jehovah, throned above the world, the
  whole universe was but dust and ashes. The Hindoo, wrapt in the
  contemplation of Nature, described her at great length and for her
  own sake, the Hebrew only for the sake of his Creator. She had no
  independent significance for him; he looked at her only 'sub specie
  eterni Dei,' in the mirror of the eternal God. Hence he took interest
  in her phases only as revelations of his God, noting one after
  another only to group them synthetically under the idea of Godhead.
  Hence too, despite his profound inwardness--'The heart is deceitful
  above all things and desperately wicked, who can know it?'
  (<i>Jeremiah</i>)--human individuality was only expressed in its
  relation to Jehovah.</p>

  <p>'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
  his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night
  sheweth knowledge.'--<i>Psalm</i> 19.</p>

  <p>'Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad; let the sea
  roar, and the fulness thereof.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg010" id="pg010">010</a></span>
  'Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein; then shall all the
  trees of the wood rejoice.'--<i>Psalm</i> 96.</p>

  <p>'Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful
  together.'--<i>Psalm</i> 98.</p>

  <p>'The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up
  their voice; the floods lift up their waves. The Lord on high is
  mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of
  the sea.'--<i>Psalm</i> 93.</p>

  <p>'The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. The mountains
  skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.'--<i>Psalm</i>
  114.</p>

  <p>'The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
  afraid: the depths also were troubled.'--<i>Psalm</i> 77.</p>

  <p>All these lofty personifications of inanimate Nature only
  characterise her in her relation to another, and that not man but
  God. Nothing had significance by itself, Nature was but a book in
  which to read of Jehovah; and for this reason the Hebrew could not be
  wrapt in her, could not seek her for her own sake, she was only a
  revelation of the Deity.</p>

  <p>'Lord, how great are thy works, in wisdom hast thou made them all:
  the earth is full of thy goodness.'</p>

  <p>Yet there is a fiery glow of enthusiasm in the songs in praise of
  Jehovah's wonders in creation.</p>

  <p>'0 Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour
  and majesty.</p>

  <p>'Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest
  out the heavens like a curtain.</p>

  <p>'Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh
  the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind.</p>

  <p>'Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire; who
  laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for
  ever.</p>

  <p>'Thou coveredst the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above
  the mountains.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg011" id="pg011">011</a></span>
  'At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
  away.</p>

  <p>'They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the
  place which thou hast founded for them.</p>

  <p>'Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn
  not again to cover the earth.</p>

  <p>'He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
  hills.</p>

  <p>'They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
  quench their thirst.</p>

  <p>'By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
  which sing among the branches ...</p>

  <p>'He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
  service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth.</p>

  <p>'And wine that maketh glad the heart of man ...</p>

  <p>'The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
  which he hath planted.</p>

  <p>'Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees
  are her house.</p>

  <p>'The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and the rocks for
  the conies.</p>

  <p>'He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
  down.</p>

  <p>'Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of
  the forest do creep forth.</p>

  <p>'The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
  God.</p>

  <p>'The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
  down in their dens.</p>

  <p>'Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour until the
  evening....</p>

  <p>'This great and wide sea, wherein are creeping things innumerable,
  both small and great beasts....</p>

  <p>'He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hills,
  and they smoke.</p>

  <p>'I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; I will <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg012" id="pg012">012</a></span>sing praise to my
  God as long as I have my being.'--<i>Psalm</i> 104.</p>

  <p>And what a lofty point of view is shewn by the overpowering words
  which Job puts into the mouth of Jehovah; 'Where wast thou when I
  laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast
  understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest, or
  who hath stretched the line upon it?</p>

  <p>'Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the
  corner stone thereof?</p>

  <p>'When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
  shouted for joy?...</p>

  <p>'Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
  dayspring to know his place?</p>

  <p>'That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked
  might be shaken out of it?...</p>

  <p>'Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea, or hast thou
  walked in the search of the deep?...</p>

  <p>'Declare, if thou knowest it all!...</p>

  <p>'Where is the way where light dwelleth, and as for darkness, where
  is the place thereof?' etc.</p>

  <p>Compare with this <i>Isaiah</i> xl. verse 12, etc.</p>

  <p>Metaphors too, though poetic and fine, are not individualized.</p>

  <p>'Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy water-spouts: all thy
  waves and thy billows are gone over me.'--<i>Psalm</i> 42.</p>

  <p>'Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. I sink
  in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep waters,
  where the floods overflow me.'--<i>Psalm</i> 69.</p>

  <p>There are many pictures from the animal world; and these are more
  elaborate in Job than elsewhere (see <i>Job</i> xl. and xli.).
  Personifications, as we have seen, are many, but Nature is only
  called upon to sympathise with man in isolated cases, as, for
  instance, in 2 <i>Samuel</i> i.:</p>

  <p>'Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg013" id="pg013">013</a></span>neither let there
  be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of
  the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as if he had not
  been anointed with oil.'</p>

  <p>The Cosmos unfolded itself to the Hebrew<a href=
  "#a3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> as one great whole, and the glance fixed
  upon a distant horizon missed the nearer lying detail of phenomena.
  His imagination ranged the universe with the wings of the wind, and
  took vivid note of air, sky, sea, and land, but only, so to speak, in
  passing; it never rested there, but hurried past the boundaries of
  earth to Jehovah's throne, and from that height looked down upon
  creation.</p>

  <p>The attitude of the Greek was very different. Standing firmly
  rooted in the world of sense, his open mind and his marvellous eye
  for beauty appreciated the glorious external world around him down to
  its finest detail. His was the race of the beautiful, the first in
  history to train all its powers into harmony to produce a culture of
  beauty equal in form and contents, and his unique achievement in art
  and science enriched all after times with lasting standards of the
  great and beautiful.</p>

  <p>The influence of classic literature upon the Middle Ages and
  modern times has not only endured, but has gone on increasing with
  the centuries; so that we must know the position reached by Greece
  and Rome as to feeling for Nature, in order to discover whether the
  line of advance in the Middle Ages led directly forward or began by a
  backward movement--a zigzag.</p>

  <p>The terms ancient and modern, naive and sentimental, classic and
  romantic, have been shibboleths of culture from Jean Paul, Schiller,
  and Hegel, to Vischer. Jean Paul, in his <i>Vorschule zur
  Aesthetik</i>, compares the ideally simple Greek poetry, with its
  objectivity, serenity, and moral grace, with the musical poetry of
  the romantic period, and speaks of one as the sunlight that pervades
  our waking <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg014" id=
  "pg014">014</a></span>hours, the other as the moonlight that gleams
  fitfully on our dreaming ones. Schiller's epoch-making essay <i>On
  Naive and Sentimental Poetry</i>, with its rough division into the
  classic-naive depending on a harmony between nature and mind, and the
  modern-sentimental depending on a longing for a lost paradise, is
  constantly quoted to shew that the Greeks took no pleasure in Nature.
  This is misleading. Schiller's Greek was very limited; in the very
  year (1795) in which the essay appeared in <i>The Hours</i>, he was
  asking Humboldt's advice as to learning Greek, with special reference
  to Homer and Xenophon.</p>

  <p>To him Homer was the Greek <i>par excellence</i>, and who would
  not agree with him to-day?</p>

  <p>As in Greek mythology, that naive poem of Nature, the product of
  the artistic impulse of the race to stamp its impressions in a
  beautiful and harmonious form, so in the clear-cut comparisons in
  Homer, the feeling for Nature is profound; but the Homeric hero had
  no personal relations with her, no conscious leaning towards her; the
  descriptions only served to frame human action, in time or space.</p>

  <p>But that cheerful, unreflecting youth of mankind, that naive
  Homeric time, was short in spite of Schiller, who, in the very essay
  referred to, included Euripides, Virgil, and Horace among the
  sentimental, and Shakespeare among the naive, poets--a fact often
  overlooked.</p>

  <p>In line with the general development of culture, Greek feeling for
  Nature passed through various stages. These can be clearly traced
  from objective similes and naive, homely comparisons to poetic
  personifications, and so on to more extended descriptions, in which
  scenery was brought into harmony or contrast with man's inner life;
  until finally, in Hellenism, Nature was treated for her own sake, and
  man reduced to the position of supernumerary <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg015" id="pg015">015</a></span>both in poetry and
  also--so approaching the modern--in landscape-painting.</p>

  <p>Greece had her sentimental epoch; she did not, as we have said,
  long remain naive. From Sophist days a steady process of
  decomposition went on--in other words, a movement towards what we
  call modern, a movement which to the classic mind led backward; but
  from the wider standpoint of general development meant advance. For
  the path of culture is always the same in the nations; it leads first
  upward and then downward, and all ripening knowledge, while it
  enriches the mind, brings with it some unforeseen loss. Mankind pays
  heavily for each new gain; it paid for increased subjectivity and
  inwardness by a loss in public spirit and patriotism which, once the
  most valued of national possessions, fell away before the increasing
  individuality, the germ of the modern spirit. For what is the modern
  spirit but limitless individuality?</p>

  <p>The greater the knowledge of self, the richer the inner life. Man
  becomes his own chief problem--he begins to watch the lightest
  flutter of his own feelings, to grasp and reflect upon them, to look
  upon himself in fact as in a mirror; and it is in this doubling of
  the ego, so to speak, that sentimentality in the modern sense
  consists. It leads to love of solitude, the fittest state for the
  growth of a conscious love of Nature, for, as Rousseau said 'all
  noble passions are formed in solitude,' 'tis there that one
  recognizes one's own heart as 'the rarest and most valuable of all
  possessions.' 'Oh, what a fatal gift of Heaven is a feeling heart!'
  and elsewhere he said: 'Hearts that are warmed by a divine fire find
  a pure delight in their own feelings which is independent of fate and
  of the whole world.' Euripides, too, loved solitude, and avoided the
  noise of town life by retiring to a grotto at Salamis which he had
  arranged for himself with a view of the sea; for which reason, his
  biographer tells us, most of his similes are drawn <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg016" id="pg016">016</a></span>from the sea. He,
  rather than Petrarch or Rousseau, was the father of sentimentality.
  His morbidly sensitive Hippolytos cries 'Alas! would it were possible
  that I should see myself standing face to face, in which case I
  should have wept for the sorrows that we suffer'; and in the chorus
  of <i>The Suppliants</i> we have: 'This insatiate joy of mourning
  leads me on like as the liquid drop flowing from the sun-trodden
  rock, ever increasing of groans.' In Euripides we have the first
  loosening of that ingenuous bond between Nature and the human spirit,
  as the Sophists laid the axe to the root of the old Hellenic ideas
  and beliefs. Subjectivity had already gained in strength from the
  birth of the lyric, that most individual of all expressions of
  feeling; and since the lyric cannot dispense with the external world,
  classic song now shewed the tender subjective feeling for Nature
  which we see in Sappho, Pindar, and Simonides. Yet Euripides (and
  Aristophanes, whose painful mad laugh, as Doysen says, expresses the
  same distraction and despair as the deep melancholy of Euripides)
  only paved the way for that sentimental, idyllic feeling for Nature
  which dwelt on her quiet charms for their own sake, as in Theocritus,
  and, like the modern, rose to greater intensity in the presence of
  the amorous passion, as we see in Kallimachos and the Anthology. It
  was the outcome of Hellenism, of which sentimental introspection, the
  freeing of the ego from the bonds of race and position, and the
  discovery of the individual in all directions of human existence,
  were marks. And this feeling developing from Homer to Longos, from
  unreflecting to conscious and then to sentimental pleasure in Nature,
  was expressed not only in poetry but in painting, although the latter
  never fully mastered technique.</p>

  <p>The common thoughtless statement, so often supported by quotations
  from Schiller, Gervinus, and others, that Greek antiquity was not
  alive to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg017" id=
  "pg017">017</a></span>the beauty of Nature and her responsiveness to
  human moods, and neither painted scenery nor felt the melancholy
  poetic charm of ruins and tombs, is therefore a perversion of the
  truth; but it must be conceded that the feeling which existed then
  was but the germ of our modern one. It was fettered by the specific
  national beliefs concerning the world and deities, by the undeveloped
  state of the natural sciences, which, except botany, still lay in
  swaddling-clothes, by the new influence of Christendom, and by that
  strict feeling for style which, very much to its advantage, imposed a
  moderation that would have excluded much of our senseless modern
  rhapsody.</p>

  <p>It was not unnatural that Schiller, in distaste for the weak riot
  of feeling and the passion for describing Nature which obtained in
  his day, was led to overpraise the Homeric naïvete and overblame the
  sentimentality which he wrongly identified with it.</p>

  <p>In all that is called art, the Romans were pupils of the Greek,
  and their achievements in the region of beauty cannot be compared
  with his. But they advanced the course of general culture, and their
  feeling--always more subjective, abstract, self-conscious, and
  reflective--has a comparatively familiar, because modern, ring in the
  great poets.</p>

  <p>The preference for the practical and social-economic is traceable
  in their feeling for Nature. Their mythology also lay too much within
  the bounds of the intelligible; shewed itself too much in forms and
  ceremonies, in a cult; but it had not lost the sense of awe--it still
  heard the voices of mysterious powers in the depths of the
  forest.</p>

  <p>The dramatists wove effective metaphors and descriptions of Nature
  into their plays.</p>

  <p>Lucretius laid the foundations of a knowledge of her which refined
  both his enjoyment and his descriptions; and the elegiac sentimental
  style, which we see developed in Tibullus, Propertius, Ovid, Virgil,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg018" id="pg018">018</a></span>and
  Horace, first came to light in the great lyrist Catullus. In Imperial
  times feeling for Nature grew with the growth of culture in general;
  men turned to her in times of bad cheer, and found comfort in the
  great sky spaces, the constant stars, and forests that trembled with
  awe of the divine Numen.</p>

  <p>It was so with Seneca, a pantheist through and through. Pliny the
  younger was quite modern in his choice of rural solitudes, and his
  appreciation of the views from his villa. With Hadrian and Apuleius
  the Roman rococo literature began; Apuleius was astonishingly modern,
  and Ausonius was almost German in the depth and tenderness of his
  feeling for Nature. Garden-culture and landscape-painting shewed the
  same movement towards the sympathetic and elegiac-sentimental.</p>

  <p>Those who deny the Roman feeling for Nature might learn better
  from a glance at the ruins of their villas. As H. Nissen says in his
  <i>Italische Landeskunde</i>:</p>

  <p>'It was more than mere fashion which drew the Roman to the
  sea-side, and attracted so strongly all those great figures, from the
  elder Scipio Africanus and his noble daughter, Cornelia, down to
  Augustus and Tiberius and their successors, whenever their powers
  flagged in the Forum. There were soft breezes to cool the brow,
  colour and outline to refresh the eye, and wide views that appealed
  to a race born to extensive lordship.</p>

  <p>'In passing along the desolate, fever-stricken coasts of Latium
  and Campania to-day, one comes upon many traces of former splendour,
  and one is reminded that the pleasure which the old Romans took in
  the sea-side was spoilt for those who came after them by the havoc of
  the time.'</p>

  <p>In many points, Roman feeling for Nature was more developed than
  Greek. For instance, the Romans appreciated landscape as a whole, and
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg019" id=
  "pg019">019</a></span>distance, light and shade in wood and water,
  reflections, the charms of hunting and rowing, day-dreams on a
  mountain side, and so forth.</p>

  <p>That antiquity and the Middle Ages had any taste for romantic
  scenery has been energetically denied; but we can find a trace of it.
  The landscape which the Roman admired was level, graceful, and
  gentle; he certainly did not see any beauty in the Alps. Livy's
  'Foeditas Alpinum' and the dreadful descriptions of Ammian, with
  others, are the much-quoted vouchers for this. Nor is it surprising;
  for modern appreciation, still in its youth, is really due to
  increased knowledge about Nature, to a change of feeling, and to the
  conveniences of modern travelling, unknown 2000 years ago.</p>

  <p>The dangers and hardships of those days must have put enjoyment
  out of the question; and only served to heighten the unfavourable
  contrast between the wildness of the mountain regions and the
  cultivation of Italy.</p>

  <p>Lucretius looked at wild scenery with horror, but later on it
  became a favourite subject for description; and Seneca notes, as
  shewing a morbid state of mind, in his essay on tranquillity of mind,
  that travelling not only attracts men to delightful places, but that
  some even exclaim: 'Let us go now into Campania; now that delicate
  soil delighteth us, let us visit the wood countries, let us visit the
  forest of Calabria, and let us seek some pleasure amidst the deserts,
  in such sort as these wandering eyes of ours may be relieved in
  beholding, at our pleasure, the strange solitude of these savage
  places.'</p>

  <p>We have thus briefly surveyed on the one hand, in theory, the
  conditions under which a conscious feeling for Nature develops, and
  the forms in which it expresses itself; and, on the other, the course
  this feeling has followed in antiquity among the Hindoos, Hebrews,
  Greeks, and Romans. The movement <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg020" id="pg020">020</a></span>toward the modern, toward the
  subjective and individual, lies clear to view. We will now trace its
  gradual development along lines which are always strictly analogous
  to those of culture in general, through the Middle Ages. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg021" id="pg021">021</a></span></p>

  <h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <h3>CHRISTIANITY AND GERMANISM</h3>

  <p>When the heathen world had outlived its faculties, and its
  creative power had failed, it sank into the ocean of the past--a
  sphinx, with her riddle guessed,--and mediæval civilization arose,
  founded upon Christianity and Germanism. There are times in the
  world's history when change seems to be abrupt, the old to be swept
  away and all things made new at a stroke, as if by the
  world-consuming fire of the old Saga. But, in reality, all change is
  gradual; the old is for ever failing and passing out of sight, to be
  taken up as a ferment into the ever emerging new, which changes and
  remodels as it will. It was so with Christianity. It is easy to
  imagine that it arose suddenly, like a phoenix, from the ashes of
  heathendom; but, although dependent at heart upon the sublime
  personality of its Founder, it was none the less a product of its
  age, and a result of gradual development--a river with sources partly
  in Judea, partly in Hellas. And mediæval Christianity never denied
  the traces of its double origin.</p>

  <p>Upon this syncretic soil its literature sprang up, moulded as to
  matter upon Old Testament and specifically Christian models, as to
  form upon the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg022" id=
  "pg022">022</a></span>great writers of antiquity; but matter and form
  are only separable in the abstract, and the Middle Ages are woven
  through and through with both Greco-Roman and Jewish elements.</p>

  <p>But these elements were unfavourable to the development of feeling
  for Nature; Judaism admitted no delight in her for her own sake, and
  Christianity intensified the Judaic opposition between God and the
  world, Creator and created.</p>

  <p>'Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; if
  any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him': by
  which John meant, raise your eyes to your Heavenly Father, throned
  above the clouds.</p>

  <p>Christianity in its stringent form was transcendental, despising
  the world and renouncing its pleasures. It held that Creation,
  through the entrance of sin, had become a caricature, and that
  earthly existence had only the very limited value of a thoroughfare
  to the eternal Kingdom.</p>

  <p>While joy in existence characterized the Hellenic world until its
  downfall, and the Greek took life serenely, delighting in its smooth
  flow; with Christianity, as Jean Paul put it, 'all the present of
  earth vanished into the future of Heaven, and the Kingdom of the
  Infinite arose upon the ruins of the finite.'</p>

  <p>The beauty of earth was looked upon as an enchantment of the
  devil; and sin, the worm in the fruit, lurked in its alluring
  forms.</p>

  <p>Classic mythology created a world of its own, dimly veiled by the
  visible one; every phase of Nature shewed the presence or action of
  deities with whom man had intimate relations; every form of life,
  animated by them, held something familiar to him, even sacred--his
  landscape was absorbed by the gods.</p>

  <p>To Judaism and Christianity, Nature was a fallen angel, separated
  as far as possible from her God. They only recognized one world--that
  of spirit; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg023" id=
  "pg023">023</a></span>one sphere of the spiritual, religion--the
  relation between God and man. Material things were a delusion of
  Satan's; the heaven on which their eyes were fixed was a very distant
  one.</p>

  <p>The Hellenic belief in deities was pandemonistic and cosmic;
  Christianity, in its original tendency, anti-cosmic and hostile to
  Nature. And Nature, like the world at large, only existed for it in
  relation to its Creator, and was no longer 'the great mother of all
  things,' but merely an instrument in the hands of Providence.</p>

  <p>The Greek looked at phenomena in detail, in their inexhaustible
  variety, rarely at things as a whole; the Christian considered Nature
  as a work of God, full of wonderful order, in which detail had only
  the importance of a link in a chain.</p>

  <p>As Lotze says, 'The creative artistic impulse could be of no use
  to a conception of life in which nothing retained independent
  significance, but everything referred to or symbolized something
  else.' But yet, the idea of individuality, of the importance of the
  ego, gained ground as never before through this introspection and
  merging of material in spiritual, this giving spirit the exclusive
  sway; and Christianity, while it broke down the barriers of nation,
  race, and position, and widened the cleft between Nature and spirit,
  discovered at the same time the worth of the individual.</p>

  <p>And this individuality was one of the chief steps towards an
  artistic, that is, individual point of view about Nature, for it was
  not possible to consider her freely and for her own sake alone, until
  the unlimited independence of mind had been recognized.</p>

  <p>But the full development of Christianity was only reached when it
  blended with the Germanic spirit, with the German Gemüth (for which
  no other language has a word), and intensified, by so doing, the
  innately subjective temperament of the race.</p>

  <p>The northern climate gives pause for the development <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg024" id="pg024">024</a></span>of the inner life;
  its long bleak winter, with the heavy atmosphere and slow coming of
  spring, wake a craving for light and warmth, and throw man back on
  himself. This inward inclination, which made itself felt very early
  in the German race, by bringing out the contemplative and independent
  sides of his character, and so disinclining him for combined action
  with his fellows, forwarded the growth of the over-ripe seeds of
  classic culture and vital Christianity.</p>

  <p>The Romanic nations, with their brilliant, sharply-defined
  landscape and serene skies, always retained something of the
  objective delight in life which belonged to antiquity; they never
  felt that mysterious impulse towards dreams and enthusiastic longing
  which the Northerner draws from his lowering skies and dark woods,
  his mists on level and height, the grey in grey of his atmosphere,
  and his ever varying landscape. A raw climate drives man indoors in
  mind as well as body, and prompts that craving for spring and delight
  in its coming which have been the chief notes in northern feeling for
  Nature from earliest times.</p>

  <p>Vischer has shewn in his <i>Aesthetik</i>, that German feeling was
  early influenced by the different forms of plant life around it.
  Rigid pine, delicate birch, stalwart oak, each had its effect; and
  the wildness and roughness of land, sea, and animal life in the North
  combined with the cold of the climate to create the taste for
  domestic comfort, for fireside dreams, and thought-weaving by the
  hearth.</p>

  <p>Nature schooled the race to hard work and scanty pleasure, and yet
  its relationship to her was deep and heartfelt from the first.
  Devoutly religious, it gazed at her with mingled love and fear; and
  the deposit of its ideas about her was its mythology.</p>

  <p>Its gods dwelt in mountain tops, holes in the rocks, and rivers,
  and especially in dark forests and in the leafy boughs of sacred
  trees; and the howling of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg025" id=
  "pg025">025</a></span>wind, the rustle of leaves, the soughing in the
  tree tops, were sounds of their presence. The worship of woods lasted
  far into Christian times, especially among the Saxons and
  Frisians.<a href="#b1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Wodan was the all-powerful father of gods and men--the highest
  god, who, as among all the Aryan nations, represented Heaven. Light
  was his shining helmet, clouds were the dark cap he put on when he
  spread rain over the earth, or crashed through the air as a wild
  hunter with his raging pack. His son Donar shewed himself in thunder
  and lightning, as he rode with swinging axe on his goat-spanned car.
  Mountains were sacred to both, as plants to Ziu. Freyr and Freya were
  goddesses of fertility, love, and spring; a ram was sacred to them,
  whose golden fleece illuminated night as well as day, and who drew
  their car with a horse's speed.<a href="#b2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> As
  with Freya, an image of the goddess Nerthus was drawn through the
  land in spring, to announce peace and fertility to mortals.</p>

  <p>The suggestive myth of Baldur, god of light and spring, killed by
  blind Hödur, was the expression of general grief at the passing of
  beauty.</p>

  <p>The <i>Edda</i> has a touching picture of the sorrow of Nature, of
  her trees and plants, when the one beloved of all living things fell,
  pierced by an arrow. Holda was first the mild and gracious goddess,
  then a divine being, encompassing the earth. She might be seen in
  morning hours by her favourite haunts of lake and spring, a beautiful
  white woman, who bathed and vanished. When snow fell, she was making
  her bed, and the feathers flew. Agriculture and domestic order were
  under her care.</p>

  <p>Ostara was goddess of bright dawn, of rising light, and awakening
  spring, as Hel of subterranean night, the darkness of the underworld.
  Frigg, wife of the highest god, knew the story of existence, and
  protected marriage. She was the Northern Juno or Hera.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg026" id="pg026">026</a></span>
  Ravines and hollows in the mountains were the dwelling-places of the
  dwarfs (Erdmännlein), sometimes friendly, sometimes unfriendly to
  man; now peaceful and helpful, now impish spirits of mischief in
  cloud caps and grey coats, thievish and jolly.</p>

  <p>They were visible by moonlight, dancing in the fields; and when
  their track was found in the dew,<a href="#b3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> a
  good harvest was expected. Popular belief took the floating autumn
  cobwebs for the work of elves and fairies. The spirits of mountain
  and wood were related to the water-spirits, nixies who sat combing
  their long hair in the sun, or stretched up lovely arms out of the
  water. The elves belonged to the more spiritual side of Nature, the
  giants to the grosser. Rocks and stones were the weapons of the
  giants; they removed mountains and hills, and boulders were pebbles
  shaken out of their shoes.</p>

  <p>Among animals the horse was sacred to many deities, and gods and
  goddesses readily transformed themselves into birds. Two ravens,
  Hugin and Munin, whose names signify thought and memory, were Odin's
  constant companions. The gift of prophecy was ascribed to the cuckoo,
  as its monotonous voice heralded the spring:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Kukuk vam haven, wo lange sail ik leven?</p>
  </div>

  <p>There were many legends of men and snakes who exchanged shapes,
  and whom it was unlucky to kill.<a href="#b4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The sun and moon, too, were familiar figures in legends.</p>

  <p>Their movement across the sky was a flight from two pursuing
  wolves, of which one, the Fenris wolf, was fated one day to catch and
  devour the moon. The German, like the Greek, dreaded nothing more
  than the eclipse of sun or moon, and connected it with the
  destruction of all things and the end of the world. In the moon spots
  he saw a human form carrying a hare or a stick or an axe on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg027" id="pg027">027</a></span>
  The Solstices impressed him most of all, with their almost constant
  day in summer, almost constant night in winter. Sun, moon, and stars
  were the eyes of heaven; there was a pious custom to greet the stars
  before going to bed. Still earlier, they were sparks of fire from
  Muspilli, to light the gods home. Night, day, and the sun had their
  cars--night and day with one horse, the sun with two: sunrise brought
  sounds sweeter than the song of birds or strings; the rising sun, it
  was said, rings for joy, murmuring daybreak laughs.<a href=
  "#b5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Day brought joy, night sorrow; the first was good and friendly,
  the second bad and hostile. The birds greeted daytime and summer with
  songs of delight, but grieved in silence through night and winter:
  the first swallow and stork were hailed as spring's messengers. May
  with greening woods led in beloved summer, frost and snow the
  winter.</p>

  <p>So myth, fable, and legend were interlaced in confusion; who can
  separate the threads?</p>

  <p>At any rate, the point of view which they indicate remained the
  common one even far into the Middle Ages, and shewed simple familiar
  intercourse with Nature. Even legal formulæ were full of pictures
  from Nature. In the customary oath to render a contract binding, the
  promise is to hold, so it runs, 'so long as the sun shines and rivers
  flow, so long as the wind blows and birds sing, so far off as earth
  is green and fir trees grow, so far as the vault of heaven reaches.'
  As Schnaase says,<a href="#b6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> though with some
  exaggeration, such formulæ, in their summary survey of earth and sky,
  often give a complete landscape poem in a few words. He points out
  that in northern, as opposed to classic mythology, Nature was
  considered, not in the cursory Hebrew way, that hurried over or
  missed detail, but as a whole, and in her relation to man's inner
  life.</p>

  <p>'The collective picture of heaven and earth, of cloud movement, of
  the mute life of plants--that <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg028"
  id="pg028">028</a></span>side of Nature which had almost escaped the
  eye of antiquity--occupied the Northerner most of all.</p>

  <p>'The <i>Edda</i> even represents all Nature together in one
  colossal form--the form of the giant Ymir, whom the sons of Boer
  slew, in order to make the mountains from his bones, the earth from
  his flesh, the skies from his skull.'</p>

  <p>A still grander mythical synthesis was the representation of the
  whole world under the form of the sacred ash tree Yggdrasil. This was
  the world tree which united heaven, earth, and hell. Its branches
  stretched across the world and reached up to the skies, and its roots
  spread in different directions--one toward the race of Asa in heaven,
  another toward the Hrimthursen, the third toward the underworld; and
  on both roots and branches creatures lived and played--eagle,
  squirrel, stag, and snake; while by the murmuring Urdhar stream,
  which rippled over one root, the Nones sat in judgment with the race
  of Asa.</p>

  <p>Not less significant was the conception of the end of the world,
  the twilight of the gods (Götterdämmerung), according to which all
  the wicked powers broke loose and fought against the gods; the sun
  and moon were devoured by wolves, the stars fell and earth quaked,
  the monster world-serpent Joermungande, in giant rage, reared himself
  out of the water and came to land: Loki led the Hrimthursen and the
  retinue of hell, and Surt, with his shining hair, rode away from the
  flaming earth across Bifröst, the rainbow, which broke beneath
  him.</p>

  <p>After the world conflagration a new and better earth arose, with
  rejuvenated gods.<a href="#b7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>German mediæval poetry, as a whole, epic and lyric, was interwoven
  with a hazy network of suggestive myth and legend; and moral
  elements, which in mythology were hidden by the prominence of Nature,
  stood out clear to view in the fate and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg029" id="pg029">029</a></span>character of the
  heroes. The germ of many of our fairy tales is a bit of purest poetry
  of Nature--a genuine Nature myth transferred to human affairs, which
  lay nearer to the child-like popular mind, and were therefore more
  readily understood by it.</p>

  <p>So, for instance, from the Maiden of the Shield, Sigrdrifa, who
  was pierced by Odin's sleep thorn, and who originally represented the
  earth, frozen in winter, kissed awake by the sun-god, came Brunhild,
  whose mail Siegfried's sword penetrated as the sun rays penetrate the
  frost, and lastly the King's daughter, who pricked herself with the
  fateful spindle, and sank into deep sleep. And as Sigrdrifa was
  surrounded by walls of flame, so now we have a thorny hedge of wild
  briar round the beautiful maiden (hence named Dornröschen) when the
  lucky prince comes to waken her with a kiss.<a href=
  "#b8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Not all fairy tales have preserved the myth into Christian times
  in so poetic and transparent a form as this. Its poetic germ arose
  from hidden depths of myth and legend, and, like heathen
  superstitions in the first centuries of Christianity, found its most
  fruitful soil among the people. It has often been disguised beyond
  recognition by legends, and by the worship of the Madonna and saints,
  but it has never been destroyed, and it keeps its magic to the
  present day.</p>

  <p>We see then that the inborn German feeling for Nature, conditioned
  by climate and landscape, and pronounced in his mythology, found both
  an obstacle and a support in Christianity--an obstacle in its
  transcendentalism, and a support in its inwardness. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg030" id="pg030">030</a></span></p>

  <h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <h3>THE THEOLOGICAL CHRISTIAN AND THE SYMPATHETIC HEATHEN FEELING OF
  THE FIRST TEN CENTURIES A.D.</h3>

  <p>The Middle Ages employed its best intellectual power in solving
  the problems of man's relation to God and the Redeemer, his moral
  vocation, and his claim to the Kingdom of the blessed. Mind and heart
  were almost entirely engrossed by the dogmas of the new faith, such
  as the incarnation, original sin, and free-will, and by doubts which
  the Old Testament had raised and not solved. Life was looked upon as
  a test-place, a thoroughfare to the heavenly Kingdom; earth, with its
  beauty and its appeal to the senses, as a temptress.</p>

  <p>To flee the world and to lack artistic feeling were therefore
  marks of the period. We have no trace of scientific knowledge applied
  to Nature, and she was treated with increasing contempt, as the
  influence of antiquity died out. In spite of this, the attitude of
  the Apostolic Fathers was very far from hostile. Their fundamental
  idea was the Psalmist's 'Lord, how great are Thy works; in wisdom
  hast Thou made them all!' and yet they turned to Nature--at any rate,
  the noblest Grecians among them--not only for proof of divine wisdom
  and goodness, but with a degree of personal inclination, an
  enthusiasm, to which antiquity was a stranger.</p>

  <p>Clement of Rome wrote to the Corinthians:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg031" id="pg031">031</a></span>
  'Let us note how free from anger He is towards all His creatures. The
  heavens are moved by His direction and obey Him in peace. Day and
  night accomplish the course assigned to them by Him, without
  hindrance one to another. The sun and the moon and the dancing stars,
  according to His appointment, circle in harmony within the bounds
  assigned to them, without any swerving aside. The earth, bearing
  fruit in fulfilment of His will at her proper seasons, putteth forth
  the food that supplieth abundantly both men and beasts and all living
  things which are thereupon, making no dissension, neither altering
  anything which He hath decreed. Moreover, the inscrutable depths of
  the abysses and unutterable statutes of the nether regions are
  constrained by the same ordinances. The basin of the boundless sea,
  gathered together by His workmanship into its reservoirs, passeth not
  the barriers wherewith it is surrounded; but even as He ordered it,
  so it doeth. For He said, "so far shalt thou come, and thy waves
  shall be broken within thee." The ocean which is impassable for men,
  and the worlds beyond it, are directed by the same ordinances of the
  Master. The seasons of spring and summer and autumn and winter give
  way in succession one to another in peace. The winds in their several
  quarters at their proper seasons fulfil their ministry without
  disturbance, and the overflowing fountains, created for enjoyment and
  health, without fail give their breasts which sustain the life for
  men. Yea, the smallest of living things come together in concord and
  peace.'<a href="#c1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The three great Cappadocians, the most representative of the Greek
  Fathers and leaders of the fourth century, wrote about the scenery
  round them in a tone of sentimentality not less astonishing, in view
  of the prejudice which denies all feeling for Nature to the Middle
  Ages, than their broad humanity and free handling of dogma.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg032" id="pg032">032</a></span> It
  was no ascetic renouncing the world and solitude<a href=
  "#c2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>; but rather a sensitive man, thoughtful and
  dreamy at once, who wrote as follows (Basil the Great to Gregory
  Nazianzen):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is a lofty mountain overshadowed with a deep wood, irrigated
    on the north by cold and transparent streams. At its foot is spread
    a low plain, enriched perpetually with the streams from the
    mountains. The wood, a virgin forest of trees of various kinds and
    foliage which grows around it, almost serves it as a rampart; so
    that even the Isle of Calypso, which Homer evidently admired as a
    paragon of loveliness, is nothing in comparison with this. For
    indeed it is very nearly an island, from its being enclosed on all
    sides with rocky boundaries. On two sides of it are deep and
    precipitous ravines, and on another side the river flowing from the
    steep is itself a continuous and almost impassable barrier. The
    mountain range, with its moon-shaped windings, walls off the
    accessible parts of the plain. There is but one entrance, of which
    we are the masters. My hut is built on another point, which uplifts
    a lofty pinnacle on the summit, so that this plain is outspread
    before the gaze, and from the height I can catch a glimpse of the
    river flowing round, which to my fancy affords no less delight than
    the view of the Strymore as you look from Amphipolis. For the
    Strymore broadens into lakes with its more tranquil stream, and is
    so sluggish as almost to forfeit the character of a river. The
    Iris, on the other hand, flowing with a swifter course than any
    river I know, for a short space billows along the adjacent rock,
    and then, plunging over it, rolls into a deep whirlpool, affording
    a most delightful view to me and to every spectator, and abundantly
    supplying the needs of the inhabitants, for it nurtures an
    incredible number of fishes in its eddies.</p>

    <p>Why need I tell you of the sweet exhalations from the earth or
    the breezes from the river? Other persons might admire the
    multitude of the flowers, or of the lyric birds, but I have no time
    to attend to them. But my highest eulogy of the spot is, that,
    prolific as it is of all kinds of fruits from its happy situation,
    it bears for me the sweetest of all fruits, tranquillity; not only
    because it is free from the noises of cities, but because it is not
    traversed by a single visitor except the hunters, who occasionally
    join us. For, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg033" id=
    "pg033">033</a></span>besides its other advantages, it also
    produces animals--not bears and wolves, like yours--heaven forbid!
    But it feeds herds of stags, and of wild goats and hares, and
    creatures of that kind. Do you not then observe what a narrow risk
    I ran, fool that I was, to change such a spot for Tiberine, the
    depth of the habitable world? I am now hastening to it, pardon me.
    For even Alcmæon, when he discovered the Echinades, no longer
    endured his wanderings.<a href="#c3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This highly-cultured prince of the Church clearly valued the place
  quite as much for its repose, its idyllic solitude, for what we
  moderns would call its romantic surroundings, sylvan and rugged at
  once, as for its fertility and practical uses. But it is too much to
  say, with Humboldt<a href="#c4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In this simple description of scenery and forest life, feelings
    are expressed which are more intimately in unison with those of
    modern tunes, than anything which has been transmitted to us from
    Greek or Roman antiquity. From the lonely Alpine hut to which Basil
    withdrew, the eye wanders over the humid and leafy roof of the
    forest below.... The poetic and mythical allusion at the close of
    the letter falls on the Christian ear like an echo from another and
    earlier world.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Hellenic poets of the Anthology, and the younger Pliny in
  Imperial days, held the same tone, elegiac and idyllic<a href=
  "#c5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>; as Villemain says, 'These pleasant
  pictures, these poetic allusions, do not shew the austerity of the
  cloister.'<a href="#c6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The specifically Christian
  and monastic was hidden by the purely human.</p>

  <p>Other writings of Basil's express still more strongly the mild
  dejection which longs for solitude. For instance, when Gregory had
  been dwelling upon the emptiness of all earthly things, he said in
  reply, that peace of soul must be man's chief aim, and could only be
  attained by separation from the world, by solitude; 'for the
  contemplation of Nature abates the fever of the soul, and banishes
  all insincerity and presumption.' Therefore he loved the quiet
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg034" id="pg034">034</a></span>corner
  where he was undisturbed by human intercourse.</p>

  <p>He drew melancholy comparisons from Nature: men were compared to
  wandering clouds that dissolve into nothing, to wavering shadows, and
  shipwrecked beings, etc.</p>

  <p>His homilies on the Hexameron, too, shew thought of Nature. There
  is a fine sense for the play of colour on the sea here: 'A pleasant
  sight is the glistening sea when a settled calm doth hold it; but
  pleasant too it is to behold its surface ruffled by gentle breezes,
  and its colour now purple, now white, now dark; when it dasheth not
  with violence against the neighbouring coast, but holdeth it in
  tranquil embrace.'<a href="#c7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is enthusiastic admiration for Nature mixed with his
  profound religious feeling in the whole description of the stars, the
  seasons, etc. The expression of Ptolymäos, that when he gazed at the
  stars he felt himself raised to the table of Zeus, is weak in
  comparison with Basil's words, 'If, on a clear night, you have fixed
  your gaze upon the beauty of the stars, and then suddenly turned to
  thoughts of the artist of the universe, whoever he be, who has
  adorned the sky so wonderfully with these undying flowers, and has so
  planned it that the beauty of the spectacle is not less than its
  conformity to law....if the finite and perishable world is so
  beautiful, what must the infinite and invisible be?'<a href=
  "#c8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>For him, as for modern minds, starlight brought thoughts of
  eternity: 'If the greatness of the sky is beyond human comprehension,
  what mind, what understanding could fathom eternal things?'</p>

  <p>Gregory Nazianzen's feeling for Nature was intensely melancholy.
  His poem <i>On Human Nature</i> says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>For yesterday, worn out with my grief alone, I sat apart in a
    shady grove, gnawing my heart out. For <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg035" id="pg035">035</a></span>somehow I love
    this remedy in time of grief, to talk with mine own heart in
    silence. And the breezes whispered to the note of the songster
    birds, and from the branches brought to me sweet slumber, though my
    heart was well-nigh broken. And the cicadas, friends of the sun,
    chirped with the shrill note that issues from their breasts, and
    filled the whole grove with sound. A cold spring hard by bedewed my
    feet as it flowed gently through the glen; but I was held in the
    strong grip of grief, nor did I seek aught of these things, for the
    mind, when it is burdened with sorrow, is not fain to take part in
    pleasure.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The classic writers had also contrasted Nature with mind, as, for
  example, Ibykos in his famous <i>Spring Song</i><a href=
  "#c9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>; but not with Gregory's brooding melancholy
  and self-tormenting introspection. The poem goes on to compare him to
  a cloud that wanders hither and thither in darkness, without even a
  visible outline of that for which he longed; without peace:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I am a stream of troubled water: ever onward I move, nor hath
    any part of me rest; thou wilt not a second time pass over that
    stream thou didst before pass over, nor wilt thou see a second time
    the man thou sawest before.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In his dreamy enthusiasm he likes nothing better than solitude:
  'Happy he who leads a lonely life, happy he who with the mighty force
  of a pure mind seeth the glory of the lights of heaven.'</p>

  <p>The same tone constantly recurs in his writings. Human life is but
  dust, blown by the wind; a stormy voyage, faded grass; kingdoms and
  powers are waves of the sea, which suck under and drown; a charming
  girl is a rose with thorns, etc.</p>

  <p>Gregory of Nyssa again praises the order and splendour of Nature
  and her Creator in Old Testament style: 'Seeing the harmony of the
  whole, of wonders in heaven and in earth, and how the elements of
  things, though mutually opposed, are all by Nature welded together,
  and make for one aim through a certain indefinable
  intercommunion.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg036" id="pg036">036</a></span>
  With the pathos of Job he cries:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>Who has spread out the ground at my feet?</p>

      <p>Who has made the sky firm over me as a dome?</p>

      <p>Who carries the sun as a torch before me?</p>

      <p>Who sends springs into the ravines?</p>

      <p>Who prepares the path of the waters?</p>
    </div>

    <p>And who gives my spirit the wing for that high flight in which I
    leave earth behind and hasten through the wide ocean of air, know
    the beauty of the ether, and lift myself to the stars and observe
    all their splendour, and, not staying there, but passing beyond the
    limits of mutable things, comprehend unchangeable Nature--the
    immutable Power which is based upon itself, and leads and supports
    all that exists?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This, with its markedly poetic swing, is surprisingly like the
  passage in Plato's <i>Phædo</i>, where Socrates says: 'If any man
  could arrive at the exterior limit or take the wings of a bird and
  come to the top, then, like a fish who puts his head out of the water
  and sees this world, he would see a world beyond; and if the nature
  of man could sustain the sight, he would acknowledge that this other
  world was the place of the true heaven and the true light and the
  true earth.' But even the thought, that the order and splendour of
  Nature witnessed to the eternal powers which had created her, was not
  strange to the Greek, as Aristotle proves in the remarks which Cicero
  preserved to us in his treatise <i>On the Nature of the Gods</i>.</p>

  <p>Well then did Aristotle observe: 'If there were men whose
  habitations had been always underground, in great and commodious
  houses, adorned with statues and pictures, finished with everything
  which they who are reputed happy abound with, and if, without
  stirring from thence, they should be informed of a certain divine
  power and majesty, and after some time the earth should open, and
  they should quit their dark abode to come to us, where they should
  immediately behold the earth, the seas, the heavens, should consider
  the vast <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg037" id=
  "pg037">037</a></span>extent of the clouds and force of the winds,
  should see the sun, and observe his grandeur and beauty, and also his
  generative power, inasmuch as day is occasioned by the diffusion of
  his light through the sky, and when night has obscured the earth,
  they should contemplate the heavens bespangled and adorned with
  stars, the surprising variety of the moon in her increase and wane,
  the rising and setting of all the stars and the inviolable regularity
  of all their courses; when,' says he, 'they should see these things,
  they would undoubtedly conclude that there are gods, and that these
  are their mighty works.'</p>

  <p>Thus unconsciously the Greek Fathers of the Church took over the
  thoughts of the great classic philosophers, only substituting a unity
  for a plurality of godhead. To soar upon the wings of bird, wind, or
  cloud, a <i>motif</i> which we find here in Gregory of Nyssa, and
  which reached its finest expression in Ganymede and the evening scene
  in Faust, had reached a very modern degree of development in
  antiquity.<a href="#c10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Gregory of Nyssa was still more sentimental and plaintive than
  Basil and Gregory Nazianzen:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When I see every ledge of rock, every valley and plain, covered
    with new-born verdure, the varied beauty of the trees, and the
    lilies at my feet decked by Nature with the double charms of
    perfume and of colour, when in the distance I see the ocean,
    towards which the clouds are onward borne, my spirit is overpowered
    by a sadness not wholly devoid of enjoyment. When in autumn the
    fruits have passed away, the leaves have fallen, and the branches
    of the trees, dried and shrivelled, are robbed of their leafy
    adornments, we are instinctively led, amid the everlasting and
    regular change in Nature, to feel the harmony of the wondrous
    powers pervading all things. He who contemplates them with the eye
    of the soul, feels the littleness of man amid the greatness of the
    universe.</p>

  <p>Are not these thoughts, which Humboldt rightly strings together,
  highly significant and modern? Especially <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg038" id="pg038">038</a></span>in view of the
  opinion which Du Bois Reymond, for example, expresses: 'In antiquity,
  mediæval times, and in later literature up to the last century, one
  seeks in vain for the expression of what we call a feeling for
  Nature.'<a href="#c11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Might not Werther have written them? They have all his sentimental
  melancholy, coupled with that 'delight of sorrow' which owes its name
  (Wonne der Wehmuth) to Goethe, although its meaning was known to
  Euripides.</p>

  <p>Yet it was only in rare cases, such as Seneca and Aristotle, that
  classic writers combined such appreciation of Nature's individual
  traits with that lofty view of the universe which elevates and
  humbles at once.</p>

  <p>Gregory shewed the blending of Christian with classic feeling; and
  the deepening of the inner life through the new faith is quite as
  clear in patristic writings as their close relationship to the
  classic.</p>

  <p>But the thinkers and poets of the Middle Ages did not always see
  Nature under the brilliant light of Hellenic influence; there were
  wide spaces of time in which monkish asceticism held sway, and she
  was treated with most unscientific contempt. For the development of
  feeling did not proceed in one unswerving line, but was subject to
  backward movements. The rosy afterglow of the classic world was upon
  these Greek Fathers; but at the same time they suffered from the
  sorrowfulness of the new religion, which held so many sad and
  pessimistic elements.</p>

  <p>The classic spirit seemed to shudder before the eternity of the
  individual, before the unfathomable depths which opened up for
  mankind with this religion of the soul, which can find no rest in
  itself, no peace in the world, unless it be at one with God in
  self-forgetting devotion and surrender.</p>

  <p>Solitude, to which all the deeper minds at this time paid homage,
  became the mother of new and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg039"
  id="pg039">039</a></span>great thoughts, and of a view of the world
  little behind the modern in sentimentality.</p>

  <p>What Villemain says of the quotation from Gregory Nazianzen just
  given, applies with equal force to the others:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>No doubt there is a singular charm in this mixture of abstract
    thoughts and emotions, this contrast between the beauties of Nature
    and the unrest of a heart tormented by the enigma of existence and
    seeking to find rest in faith.... It was not the poetry of Homer,
    it was another poetry.... It was in the new form of contemplative
    poetry, in this sadness of man about himself, in these impulses
    towards God and the future, in this idealism so little known by the
    poets of antiquity, that the Christian imagination could compete
    without disadvantage. It was there that that poetry arose which
    modern satiety seeks for, the poetry of reverie and reflection,
    which penetrates man's heart and deciphers his most intimate
    thoughts and vaguest wishes.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Contempt for art was a characteristic of the Fathers of the
  Church, and to that end they extolled Nature; man's handiwork,
  however dazzling, was but vanity in their eyes, whereas Nature was
  the handiwork of the Creator. Culture and Nature were purposely set
  in opposition to each other.<a href="#c12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> St
  Chrysostom wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>If the aspect of the colonnades of sumptuous buildings would
    lead thy spirit astray, look upwards to the vault of heaven, and
    around thee on the open fields, in which herds graze by the water's
    side. Who does not despise all the creations of art, when in the
    stillness of his soul he watches with admiration the rising of the
    sun, as it pours its golden light over the face of the earth; when
    resting on the thick grass beside the murmuring spring, or beneath
    the sombre shade of a thick and leafy tree, the eye rests on the
    far receding and hazy distance?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The visible to them was but a mirror of the invisible; as Paul
  says (13th of the 1st Corinthians): 'Here we see in a glass darkly,'
  and Goethe: 'Everything transitory is but a similitude.' <span class=

  <blockquote>
    <p>God (says St Chrysostom again) has placed man in the world as in
    a royal palace gleaming with gold and precious stones; but the
    wonderful thing about this palace is, that it is not made of stone,
    but of far costlier material; he has not lighted up a golden
    candelabra, but given lights their fixed course in the roof of the
    palace, where they are not only useful to us, but an object of
    great delight.<a href="#c13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Roman secular writers of the first Christian centuries had not
  this depth of thought and sadness; but from them too we have notable
  descriptions of Nature in which personal pleasure and sympathy are
  evident motives as well as religious feeling.</p>

  <p>In the little <i>Octavius</i> of Minucius Felix, a writing full of
  genuine human feeling of the time of Commodus, the mixture of the
  heathen culture and opinions of antiquity with the Christian way of
  thinking has a very modern ring. The scenery is finely sketched.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The heats of summer being over, autumn began to be temperate ...
    we (two friends, a heathen and a Christian) agreed to go to the
    delightful city of Ostia.... As, at break of day, we were
    proceeding along the banks of the Tiber towards the sea, that the
    soft breeze might invigorate our limbs, and that we might enjoy the
    pleasure of feeling the beach gently subside under our footsteps,
    Cæcilius observed an image of Serapis, and having raised his hands
    to his lips, after the wont of the superstitious vulgar, he kissed
    it.... Then Octavius said: 'It is not the part of a good man,
    brother Marcus, thus to leave an intimate companion and friend
    amidst blind popular ignorance, and to suffer him, in such open
    daylight, to stumble against stones,' etc.... Discoursing after
    this sort, we traversed the space between Ostia and the sea, and
    arrived at the open coast. There the gentle surges had smoothed the
    outermost sands like a pleasure walk, and as the sea, although the
    winds blow not, is ever unquiet, it came forward to the shore, not
    hoary and foaming, but with waves gently swelling and curled. On
    this occasion we were agreeably amused by the varieties of its
    appearance, for, as we stood on the margin and dipped the soles of
    our feet in the water, the wave alternately struck at us, and then
    receding, and sliding away, seemed to swallow <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg041" id="pg041">041</a></span>up itself. We
    saw some boys eagerly engaged in the game of throwing shells in the
    sea.... Cæcilius said: 'All things ebb into the fountain from which
    they spring, and return back to their original without contriver,
    author, or supreme arbiter ... showers fall, winds blow, thunder
    bellows, and lightnings flash ... but they have no aim.' Octavius
    answers: 'Behold the heaven itself, how wide it is stretched out,
    and with what rapidity its revolutions are performed, whether in
    the night when studded with stars, or in the daytime when the sun
    ranges over it, and then you will learn with what a wonderful and
    divine hand the balance is held by the Supreme Moderator of all
    things; see how the circuit made by the sun produces the year, and
    how the moon, in her increase, wanes and changes, drives the months
    around.... Observe the sea, it is bound by a law that the shore
    imposes; the variety of trees, how each of them is enlivened from
    the bowels of the earth! Behold the ocean, it ebbs and flows
    alternately. Look at the springs, they trickle with a perpetual
    flow; at rivers, they hold on their course in quick and continued
    motion. Why should I speak of the ridges of mountains, aptly
    disposed? of the gentle slope of hills, or of plains widely
    extended?... In this mansion of the world, when you fully consider
    the heaven and the earth, and that providence, order, and
    government visible in them, assure yourself that there is indeed a
    Lord and Parent of the whole ... do not enquire for the name of
    God--God is his name.... If I should call Him Father, you would
    imagine Him earthly; if King, carnal; and if Lord, mortal. Remove
    all epithets, and then you will be sensible of His glory....'</p>

  <p>How like Faust's confession of faith to Gretchen:</p>

    <p>Doth he not embrace, sustain,</p>

    <p>Lifts not the Heaven its dome above?</p>

    <p>Doth not the firm-set earth beneath us rise?...</p>

    <p>And beaming tenderly with looks of love</p>

    <p>Climb not the everlasting stars on high?...</p>

    <p>Fill thence thy heart, how large so e'er it be,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg042" id=
    "pg042">042</a></span>And in the feeling when thou'rt wholly
    blest,</p>

    <p>Then call it what thou wilt--Bliss! Heart! Love! God!</p>

    <p>I have no name for it--'tis feeling all</p>

    <p>Name is but sound and smoke</p>

    <p>Shrouding the glow of Heaven.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Such statements of belief were not rare in the Apologists; but
  Nature at this time was losing independent importance in men's minds,
  like life itself, which after Cyprian was counted as nothing but a
  fight with the devil.<a href="#c14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is deep reverence for Nature in the lyrics, the hymns of the
  first centuries A.D., as a work of God and an emblem of moral ideas.
  Ebert observes<a href="#c15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In comparison with the old Roman, one can easily see the
    peculiarities and perfect originality of these Christian lyrics. I
    do not mean merely in that dominance of the soul life in which man
    appeared to be quite merged, and which makes them such profound
    expressions of feeling; but in man's relationship to Nature, which,
    one might say, supplies the colour to the painter's brush.<a href=
    "#c16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Nature appears here in the service of
    ideal moral powers and robbed of her independence;<a href=
    "#c17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> the servant of her Creator, whose direct
    command she obeys. She is his instrument for man's welfare, and
    also at times, under the temporary mastery of the devil, for his
    destruction. Thus Nature easily symbolizes the moral world.</p>

  <p>'Bountiful Giver of light, through whose calm brightness, when the
  time of night is past and gone, the daylight is suffused abroad,
  Thou, the world's true morning star, clearer than the full glorious
  sun, Thou very dayspring, very light in all its fulness, that dost
  illumine the innermost recesses of the heart,' sings St Hilary in his
  Morning Hymn; and in another hymn, declaring himself unworthy to lift
  his sinful eyes to the clear stars, he urges all the creatures, and
  heaven, earth, sea and river, hill and wood, rose, lily, and star to
  weep with him and lament the sinfulness of man.</p>

  <p>In the Morning Hymn of St Ambrose dawn is <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg043" id="pg043">043</a></span>used symbolically;
  dark night pales, the light of the world is born again, and the new
  birth of the soul raises to new energy; Christ is called the true
  sun, the source of light; 'let modesty be as the dawn, faith as the
  noonday, let the mind know no twilight.'</p>

  <p>And Prudentius sings in a Morning Hymn <a href=
  "#c18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>: 'Night and mist and darkness fade, light
  dawns, the globe brightens, Christ is coming!' and again: 'The herald
  bird of dawn announces day, Christ the awaker calls us to life.' And
  in the ninth hymn: 'Let flowing rivers, waves, the seashore's
  thundering, showers, heat, snow, frost, forest and breeze, night,
  day, praise Thee throughout the ages.'<a href=
  "#c19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>He speaks of Christ as the sun that never sets, never is obscured
  by clouds, the flower of David, of the root of Jesse; of the eternal
  Fatherland where the whole ground is fragrant with beds of purple
  roses, violets, and crocuses, and slender twigs drop balsam.</p>

  <p>St Jerome united Christian genius, as Ebert says, with classic
  culture to such a degree that his writings, especially his letters,
  often shew a distinctly modern tone,<a href=
  "#c20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and go to prove that asceticism so
  deepened and intensified character that even literary style took
  individual stamp.<a href="#c21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> But the most
  perfect representative, the most modern man, of his day was
  Augustine.</p>

  <p>As Rousseau's <i>Confessions</i> revealed the revolutionary genius
  of the eighteenth century, Augustine's opened out a powerful
  character, fully conscious of its own importance, striving with the
  problems of the time, and throwing search-lights into every corner of
  its own passionate heart. He had attained, after much struggling, to
  a glowing faith, and he described the process in characteristic and
  drastic similes from Nature, which are scarcely suitable for
  translation. He said on one occasion:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>For I burned at times in my youth to satiate myself with deeds
    of hell, and dared to run wild in many <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg044" id="pg044">044</a></span>a dark love
    passage.... In the time of my youth I took my fill passionately
    among the wild beasts, and I dared to roam the woods and pursue my
    vagrant loves beneath the shade; and my beauty consumed away and I
    was loathsome in Thy sight, pleasing myself and desiring to please
    the eyes of men.... The seething waves of my youth flowed up to the
    shores of matrimony....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Comfortless at the death of his friend:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I burned, I sighed, I wept, I was distraught, for I bore within
    me a soul rent and bloodstained, that would no longer brook my
    carrying; yet I found no place where I could lay it down, neither
    in pleasant groves nor in sport was it at rest. All things, even
    the light itself, were filled with shuddering.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Augustine, like Rousseau, understood 'que c'est un fatal présent
  du ciel qu'une ame sensible.'</p>

  <p>He looked upon his own heart as a sick child, and sought healing
  for it in Nature and solitude, though in vain.</p>

  <p>The pantheistic belief of the Manicheans that all things, fire,
  air, water, etc., were alive, that figs wept when they were picked
  and the mother tree shed milky tears for the loss of them, that
  everything in heaven and earth was a part of godhead, gave him no
  comfort; it was rather the personal God of the Psalms whom he saw in
  the ordering of Nature.</p>

  <p>The cosmological element in theism has never been more beautifully
  expressed than in his words:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I asked the earth, and she said: 'I am not He,' and all things
    that are in her did confess the same. I asked the sea and the
    depths and creeping things, and they answered: 'We are not thy God,
    seek higher.' I asked the blowing breezes, and the whole expanse of
    air with its inhabitants made answer: 'Anaxagoras was at fault, I
    am not God.' I asked the sky, the sun, the moon, the stars, and
    with a loud voice did they exclaim: 'He made us.' My question was
    the enquiry of my spirit, their answer was the beauty of their
    form.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another place:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Not with uncertain but with sure consciousness, Lord, I love
    Thee. But behold, sea and sky and all <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg045" id="pg045">045</a></span>things in them
    from all sides tell me that I must love Thee, nor do they cease to
    give all men this message, so that they are without excuse. Sky and
    earth speak to the deaf Thy praises: when I love Thee, I love not
    beauty of form, nor radiancy of light; but when I love my God, I
    love the light, the voice, the sweetness, the food, the embrace of
    my innermost soul. That is what I love when I love my God.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Augustine's interest in Nature was thus religious. At the same
  time, the soothing influence of quiet woods was not unknown to
  him.</p>

  <p>The likeness and unlikeness between the Christian and heathen
  points of view are very clear in the correspondence between Ausonius,
  the poet of the Moselle, and Paulinus, Bishop of Nola; and the deep
  friendship expressed in it raises their dilettante verses to the
  level of true poetry.</p>

  <p>Ausonius, thoroughly heathen as he was, carries us far forward
  into Christian-Germanic times by his sentimentality and his artistic
  descriptions of the scenery of the Moselle.<a href=
  "#c22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is characteristic of the decline of heathendom, that the lack
  of original national material to serve as inspiration, as the Æneas
  Saga had once served, led the best men of the time to muse on Nature,
  and describe scenery and travels. Nothing in classic Roman poetry
  attests such an acute grasp of Nature's little secret charms as the
  small poem about the sunny banks of the Moselle, vine-clad and
  crowned by villas, and reflected in the crystal water below. It
  seemed as if the Roman, with the German climate, had imbibed the
  German love of Nature; as if its scenery had bewitched him like the
  German maiden whom he compared to roses and lilies in his song.</p>

  <p>Many parts of his poetical epistles are in the same tone, and we
  learn incidentally from them that a lengthy preamble about weather
  and place belonged to letter-writing even then.<a href=
  "#c23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Feeling for Nature and love of his friend are interwoven into a
  truly poetic appeal in No. 64, in which <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg046" id="pg046">046</a></span>Ausonius complains
  that Paulinus does not answer his letters:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Rocks give answer to the speech of man, and his words striking
    against the caves resound, and from the groves cometh the echo of
    his voice. The cliffs of the coast cry out, the rivers murmur, the
    hedge hums with the bees that feed upon it, the reedy banks have
    their own harmonious notes, the foliage of the pine talks in
    trembling whispers to the winds: what time the light south-east
    falls on the pointed leaves, songs of Dindymus give answer in the
    Gargaric grove. Nature has made nothing dumb; the birds of the air
    and the beasts of the earth are not silent, the snake has its hiss,
    the fishes of the sea as they breathe give forth their note....
    Have the Basque mountains and the snowy haunts of the Pyrenees
    taken away thy urbanity?... May he, who advises thee to keep
    silence, never enjoy the singing of sweet songs nor the voices of
    Nature ... sad and in need may he live in desolate regions, and
    wander silent in the rounded heights of the Alpine range.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The sounds of Nature are detailed with great delicacy in this
  appeal, and we see that the Alps are referred to as desolate
  regions.</p>

  <p>In another letter (25) he reminded his friend of their mutual
  love, their home at Burdigala, his country-house with its
  vine-slopes, fields, woods, etc., and went on:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Yet without thee no year advanceth with grateful change of
    season; the rainy spring passeth without flower, the dog-star burns
    with blazing heat, Pomona bringeth not the changing scents of
    autumn, Aquarius pours forth his waters and saddens winter.
    Pontius, dear heart, seest thou what thou hast done?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Closing in the same tender strain with a picture of his hope
  fulfilled:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Now he leaves the snowy towns of the Iberians, now he holds the
    fields of the Tarbellians, now passeth he beneath the halls of
    Ebromagus, now he is gliding down the stream, and now he knocketh
    at thy door! Can we believe it? Or do they who love, fashion
    themselves dreams?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg047" id="pg047">047</a></span>
  The greater inwardness of feeling here, as contrasted with classic
  times, is undeniable; the tone verges on the sentimentality of the
  correspondences between 'beautiful souls' in the eighteenth
  century.</p>

  <p>Paulinus was touchingly devoted to his former teacher Ausonius,
  and in every way a man of fine and tender feeling. He gave himself
  with zeal to Christianity, and became an ascetic and bishop.</p>

  <p>It was a bitter grief to him that his Ausonius remained a heathen
  when he himself had sworn allegiance to Christ and said adieu to
  Apollo. There is a fine urbanity and humanity in his writings, but he
  did not, like Ausonius, love Nature for her own sake. The one took
  the Christian ascetic point of view, the other the classic heathen,
  with sympathy and sentiment in addition.</p>

  <p>Paulinus recognized the difference, and contrasted their ideas of
  solitude. 'They are not crazed, nor is it their savage fierceness
  that makes men choose to live in lonely spots; rather, turning their
  eyes to the lofty stars, they contemplate God, and set the leisure
  that is free from empty cares, to fathom the depths of truth they
  love.'</p>

  <p>In answer to his friend's praise of home, he praised Spain, in
  which he was living, and many copious descriptions of time and place
  run through his other writings<a href="#c24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>; but
  while he yielded nothing to Ausonius in the matter of friendship,
  'sooner shall life disappear from my body than thy image from my
  heart,' he was without his quiet musing delight in Nature. For her
  the heathen had the clearer eye and warmer heart; the Christian
  bishop only acknowledged her existence in relation to his Creator,
  declaring with pride that no power had been given to us over the
  elements, nor to them over us, and that not from the stars but from
  our own hearts come the hindrances to virtue.</p>

  <p>Lives of the saints and paraphrases of the story of creation were
  the principal themes of the Christian <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg048" id="pg048">048</a></span>poets of the fourth and fifth
  centuries. In some of these the hermit was extolled with a dash of
  Robinson Crusoe romance, and the descriptions of natural phenomena in
  connection with Genesis often showed a feeling for the beauty of
  Nature in poetic language. Dracontius drew a detailed picture of
  Paradise with much self-satisfaction.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Then in flight the joyous feathered throng passed through the
    heavens, beating the air with sounding wings, various notes do they
    pour forth in soothing harmony, and, methinks, together praise for
    that they were accounted worthy to be created.<a href=
    "#c26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For the charming legend of Paradise was to many Christian minds of
  this time what the long-lost bliss of Elysium and the Golden Age had
  been to the Hellenic poets and the Roman elegist--the theme of much
  vivid imagery and highly-coloured word-painting.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Eternal spring softens the air, a healing flame floods the world
    with light, all the elements glow in healing warmth; as the shades
    of night fade, day rises.... Then the feathered flocks fly joyfully
    through the air, beating it with their wings in the rush of their
    passage, and with flattering satisfaction their voices are heard,
    and I think they praise God that they were found worthy to be
    created; some shine in snowy white, some in purple, some in
    saffron, some in yellow gold; others have white feathers round the
    eyes, while neck and breast are of the bright tint of the hyacinth
    ... and upon the branches, the birds are moved to and fro with them
    by the wind.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This shews careful observation of detail; but, for the most part,
  such idyllic feeling was checked by lofty religious thoughts.</p>

  <p>'Man,' he cries, 'should rule over Nature, over all that it
  contains, over all earth offers in fruit, flowers, and verdure that
  tree and vine, sea and spring, can give.' He summons all creation to
  praise the Creator--stars and seasons, hail-storm and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg049" id="pg049">049</a></span>lightning, earth,
  sea, river and spring, cloud and night, plants, animals, and light;
  and he describes the flood in bold flights of fancy.</p>

  <p>In the three books of Avitus<a href="#c27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> we
  have 'a complete poem of the lost Paradise, far removed from a mere
  paraphrase or versification of the Bible,'<a href=
  "#c28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> which shews artistic leanings and
  sympathetic feeling here and there. As Catullus<a href=
  "#c29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> pictures the stars looking down upon the
  quiet love of mortals by night, and Theocritus<a href=
  "#c30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> makes the cypresses their only witnesses,
  the Christian poet surrounds the marriage of our first parents with
  the sympathy of Nature:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>And angel voices joined in harmony and sang to the chaste and
    pure; Paradise was their wedding-chamber, earth their dowry, and
    the stars of heaven rejoiced with gladsome radiance.... The
    kindness of heaven maintains eternal spring there; the tumultuous
    south wind does not penetrate, the clouds forsake an air which is
    always pure.... The soil has no need of rains to refresh it, and
    the plants prosper by virtue of their own dew. The earth is always
    verdant, and its surface animated by a sweet warmth resplendent
    with beauty. Herbs never abandon the hills, the trees never lose
    their leaves, etc.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And when Adam and Eve leave it, they find all the rest of the
  beautiful world ugly and narrow in comparison. 'Day is dark to their
  eyes, and under the clear sun they complain that the light has
  disappeared.'</p>

  <p>It was the reflection of their own condition in Nature. Among
  heathen writers who were influenced, without being entirely swayed,
  by Christian teaching, and imitated the rhetorical Roman style in
  describing Nature, Apollonius Sidonius takes a prominent place. In
  spite of many empty phrases and a stilted style, difficult to
  understand as well as to translate, his poems, and still more his
  letters, give many interesting pictures of the culture of his part of
  the fifth century. In Carm. 2 he draws a <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg050" id="pg050">050</a></span>highly--coloured
  picture of the home of Pontius Leontas,<a href=
  "#c31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> a fine country property, and paints the
  charms of the villa with all the art of his rhetoric and some real
  appreciation. The meeting of the two rivers, the Garonne and the
  Dordogne, in the introduction is poetically rendered, and he goes on
  to describe the cool hall and grottos, state-rooms, pillars--above
  all, the splendid view: 'There on the top of the fortress I sit down
  and lean back and gaze at the mountains covered by olives, so dear to
  the Muse and the goats. I shall wander in their shade, and believe
  that coward Daphne grants me her love.' He delighted in unspoilt
  Nature, and describes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My fountain, which, as it flows from the mountain-side, is
    overshadowed by a many-covered grotto with its wide circle. It
    needs not Art; Nature has given it grace. That no artist's hand has
    touched it is its charm; it is no masterpiece of skill, no hammer
    with resounding blow will adorn the rocks, nor marble fill up the
    place where the tufa is worn away.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He lays stress upon the contrast between culture and Nature, town
  luxury and country solitude, in his second letter to Domidius, and
  describes the beauties of his own modest estate with sentimental
  delight:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You reproach me for loitering in the country; I might complain
    with more reason that you stay in the town when the earth shines in
    the light of spring, the ice is melting from the Alps, and the soil
    is marked by the dry fissures of tortuous furrows ... the stones in
    the stream, and the mud on the banks are dried up ... here neither
    nude statues, comic actors, nor Hippodrome are to be found ... the
    noise of the waters is so great that it drowns conversation. From
    the dining-room, if you have time to spare at meals, you can occupy
    it with the delight of looking at the scenery, and watch the
    fishing ... here you can find a hidden recess, cool even in summer
    heat, a place to sleep in. Here what joy it is to listen to the
    cicadas chirping at noonday, and to the frogs croaking when the
    twilight is coming on, and to the swans and geese giving note at
    the early hours of the night, and at midnight to the cocks crowing
    together, and to the boding crows with three-fold <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg051" id="pg051">051</a></span>note greeting
    the ruddy torch of the rising dawn; and in the half light of the
    morning to hear the nightingale warbling in the bushes, and the
    swallow twittering among the beams.... Between whiles, the
    shepherds play in their rustic fashion. Not far off is a wood where
    the branches of two huge limes interlace, though their trunks are
    apart (in their shade we play ball), and a lake that rises to such
    fury in a storm that the trees that border it are wetted by the
    spray.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another letter to Domidius he described a visit to the
  country-seat of two of his friends:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We were torn from one pleasure to another--games, feastings,
    chatting, rowing, bathing, fishing.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As a true adherent even as a bishop of classic culture and
  humanity, Sidonius is thus an interesting figure in these wild times,
  with his Pliny-like enthusiasm for country rather than city, and his
  susceptibility to woodland and pastoral life.</p>

  <p>The limit of extravagance in the bombastic rhetoric of the period
  was reached in the travels of Ennodius,<a href=
  "#c32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> who was scarcely more than a fantastic
  prattler. The purest, noblest, and most important figure of the sixth
  century was undoubtedly Boetius; but it is Cassiodorus, a statesman
  of the first rank under Theodoric, who in his <i>Variorium libris</i>
  gives the most interesting view of the attitude of his day towards
  Nature. He revelled in her and in describing her. After praising Baja
  for its beauty<a href="#c33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> and Lactarius for
  its healthiness, he said of Scyllacium:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The city of Scyllacium hangs upon the hills like a cluster of
    grapes, not that it may pride itself upon their difficult ascent,
    but that it may voluptuously gaze on verdant plains and the blue
    back of the sea. The city beholds the rising sun from its very
    cradle, when the day that is about to be born sends forward no
    heralding Aurora; but as soon as it begins to rise, the quivering
    brightness displays its torch. It beholds Phoebus in his joy; it is
    bathed in the brightness of that luminary so that it might be
    thought to be itself the native land of the sun, the claims of
    Rhodes to that honour being outdone.... It enjoys a translucent
    air, but withal so temperate, that its winters are sunny and its
    summers cool, and life passes there without sorrow, since
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg052" id=
    "pg052">052</a></span>hostile seasons are feared by none. Hence,
    too, man himself is here freer of soul than elsewhere, for this
    temperateness of the climate prevails in all things.... Assuredly
    for the body to imbibe muddy waters is a different thing from
    sucking in the transparency of a sweet fountain. Even so the vigour
    of the mind is repressed when it is clogged by a heavy atmosphere.
    Nature itself hath made us subject to these influences.... clouds
    make us feel sad, and again a bright day fills us with joy.... At
    the foot of the Moscian Mount we hollowed out the bowels of the
    rock, and tastefully introduced therein the eddying waves of
    Nereus. Here a troop of fishes sporting in free captivity refreshes
    all minds with delight, and charms all eyes with admiration. They
    run greedily to the hand of man, and, before they become his food,
    seek dainties from him.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He described the town as rich in vineyards and olive woods,
  cornfields and villas.</p>

  <p>He awarded the palm of beauty to Como and its lake, and although
  he wrote in the clumsy language of a decaying literature, this
  sixth-century sketch still strikes us as surprisingly complete and
  artistic in feeling:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Como, with its precipitous mountains and its vast expanse of
    lake, seems placed there for the defence of the Province of
    Liguria; and yet again, it is so beautiful, that one would think it
    was created for pleasure only.</p>

    <p>To the south lies a fertile plain with easy roads for the
    transport of provisions; on the north, a lake sixty miles long
    abounding in fish, soothing the mind with delicious recreation....
    Rightly is it called Como, because it is adorned with such gifts.
    The lake lies in a shell-like valley with white margins. Above
    rises a diadem of lofty mountains, their slopes studded with bright
    villas; a girdle of olives below, vineyards above, while a crest of
    thick chestnut woods adorns the very summit of the hills. Streams
    of snowy clearness dash from the hill-sides into the lake. On the
    eastern side these unite to form the river Addua, so called because
    it contains the added volume of two streams.... So delightful a
    region makes men delicate and averse to labour.... Therefore the
    inhabitants deserve special consideration, and for this reason we
    wish them to enjoy perpetually the royal bounty.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg053" id="pg053">053</a></span>
  This shews, beyond dispute, that the taste for the beauty of Nature,
  even at that wild time, was not dead, and that the writer's attitude
  was not mainly utilitarian. He noted the fertility of the land in
  wine and grain, and of the sea in fish, but he laid far greater
  stress upon its charms and their influence upon the inhabitants.</p>

  <p>On <i>a priori</i> grounds (so misleading in questions of this
  kind) one would scarcely expect the most disturbed period in the
  history of the European people to have produced a Venantius
  Fortunatus, the greatest and most celebrated poet of the sixth
  century. His whole personality, as well as his poetry, shewed the
  blending of heathenism and Christianity, of Germanism and Romanism,
  and it is only now and then among the Roman elegists and later epic
  poets that we meet a feeling for Nature which can be compared to his.
  Like all the poets of this late period, his verse lacks form, is
  rugged and pompous, moving upon the stilts of classic reminiscences,
  and coining monstrous new expressions for itself; but its feeling is
  always sincere. It was the last gleam of a setting sun of literature
  that fell upon this one beneficent figure. He was born in the
  district of Treviso near Venice, and crossed the Alps a little before
  the great Lombard invasion, while the Merovingians, following in the
  steps of Chlodwig, were outdoing each other in bloodshed and cruelty.
  In the midst of this hard time Fortunatus stood out alone among the
  poets by virtue of his talent and purity of character. His poems are
  often disfigured by bombast, prolixity, and misplaced learning; but
  his keen eye for men and things is undeniable, and his feeling for
  Nature shews not only in dealing with scenery, but in linking it with
  the inner life.</p>

  <p>The lover's wish in <i>On Virginity</i>,<a href=
  "#c34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> one of his longer poems, suggests the
  Volkslieder:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg054" id=
  "pg054">054</a></span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>O that I too might go, if my hurrying foot could poise amid the
    lights of heaven and hold on its starry course. But now, without
    thee, night comes drearily with its dark wings, and the day itself
    and the glittering sunshine is darkness to me. Lily, narcissus,
    violet, rose, nard, amomum, bring me no joy--nay, no flower
    delights my heart. That I may see thee, I pass hovering through
    each cloud, and my love teaches my wandering eyes to pierce the
    mist, and lo! in dread fear I ask the stormy winds what they have
    to tell me of my lord. Before thy feet I long to wash the pavement,
    and with my hair to sweep thy temples. Whatever it be, I will bear
    it; all hard things are sweet; if only I see thee, this penalty is
    my joy. But be thou mindful, for thy vows do I yearn; I have thee
    in my heart, have me in thy heart too.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is more tender in feeling than any poem by Catullus or
  Tibullus. We can only explain it by two facts--the deepening of the
  inner life through Christianity (we almost hear Christ's words about
  the 'great sinner'), and the intimate friendship which Fortunatus
  enjoyed with a German lady, who may justly be called the noblest and
  purest figure of her time in Franconia.</p>

  <p>This was Radegunde, the unhappy daughter of a Thuringian king, who
  first saw her father's kingdom lost, and then, fleeing from the
  cruelty of her husband, the bloodstained Chlotaire, took the veil in
  Poitiers and founded a convent, of which she made Agnes, a noble
  Franconian lady, the abbess. When Fortunatus visited the place, these
  ladies became his devoted friends, and he remained there as a priest
  until the death of Radegunde. His poems to them, which were often
  letters and notes written off-hand, are full of affection and
  gratitude (he was, by the way, a gourmet, and the ladies made
  allowance for this weakness in dainty gifts), and form an enduring
  witness of a pure and most touching friendship. They contain many
  pretty sketches of Nature and delicate offerings of flowers. In one
  he said: 'If the season brought white lilies or blossomed in red
  roses, I <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg055" id=
  "pg055">055</a></span>would send them to you, but now you must be
  content with purple violets for a greeting'; and in another, because
  gold and purple are not allowable, he sends her flowers, that she may
  have 'her gold in crocuses, her purple in violets, and they may adorn
  her hair with even greater delight than she draws from their
  fragrance.' Once, when following pious custom, she had withdrawn into
  her cell, his 'straying thoughts go in search of her':</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>How quickly dost thou hide the light from mine eyes! for without
    thee I am o'erweighted by the clouds that bear me down, and though
    thou flee and hide thyself here but for a few short days, that
    month is longer than the whole hurrying year. Prithee, let the joys
    of Easter bring thee back in safety, and so may a two-fold light
    return to us at once.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And when she comes out, he cries:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Thou hadst robbed me of my happiness; now it returns to me with
    thee, thou makest me doubly celebrate this solemn festival....
    Though the seedlings are only just beginning to shoot up from the
    furrows, yet I to-day will reap my harvest in seeing thee once
    more. To-day do I gather in the fruit and lay the peaceful sheaves
    together. Though the field is bare, nor decked with ears of corn,
    yet all, through thy return, is radiant fulness.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The comparison is tedious and spun out; but the idea is poetic. We
  find it in the classics: for instance, in Theocritus, when he praises
  Nais, whose beauty draws even Nature under her sway, and whose coming
  makes spring everywhere:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Where has my light hidden herself from my straying eyes? When I
    see not thee, I am ne'er satisfied. Though the heavens be bright,
    though the clouds have fled, yet for me is the day sunless, if it
    hide thee from me.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The most touching evidence of this friendship is the poem <i>On
  the Downfall of Thuringia</i>.</p>

  <p>'One must,' says Leo,<a href="#c35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> 'refer the
  chief excellence <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg056" id=
  "pg056">056</a></span>of the poem to the lady who tells the tale,
  must grant that the irresistible power of the description, the
  spectacle of the freshly open wounds, the sympathy in the consuming
  sorrow of a friend, gave unwonted power of the wing to this
  low-flying pen.' Radegunde is thinking of her only remaining
  relative, Amalafried:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When the wind murmurs, I listen if it bring me some news, but of
    all my kindred not even a shadow presents itself to me.... And
    thou, Amalafried, gentle son of my father's brother, does no
    anxiety for me consume thy heart? Hast thou forgotten what
    Radegunde was to thee in thy earliest years, and how much thou
    lovedst me, and how thou heldst the place of the father, mother,
    brother, and sister whom I had lost? An hour absent from thee
    seemed to me eternal; now ages pass, and I never hear a word from
    thee. A whole world now lies betwixt those who loved each other and
    who of old were never separate. If others, for pity alone, cross
    the Alps to seek their lost slaves, wherefore am I forgotten?--I
    who am bound to thee by blood? Where art thou? I ask the wind as it
    sighs, the clouds as they pass--at least some bird might bring me
    news of thee. If the holy enclosure of this monastery did not
    restrain me, thou shouldst see me suddenly appear beside thee. I
    could cross the stormy seas in winter if it were necessary. The
    tempest that alarms the sailors should cause no fear to me who love
    thee. If my vessel were dashed to pieces by the tempest, I should
    cling to a plank to reach thee, and if I could find nothing to
    cling to, I should go to thee swimming, exhausted. If I could but
    see thee once more, I should deny all the perils of the
    journey....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There is little about Nature in this beautiful avowal of love and
  longing, but the whole colouring of the mood forms a background of
  feeling for his longer descriptions. His very long and tedious poem
  about the bridal journey of Gelesiuntha, the Spanish princess, who
  married King Chilperic, shews deep and touching feeling in parts. She
  left her Toledo home with a heavy heart, crossing the Pyrenees, where
  'the mountains shining with snow <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg057" id="pg057">057</a></span>reach to the stars, and their sharp
  peaks project over the rain clouds.' In the same vein as Ausonius,
  when he urged Paulinus to write to him, she begs her sister for
  news:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>By thy name full oft I call thee, Gelesiuntha, sister mine: with
    this name fountains, woods, rivers, and fields resound. Art thou
    silent, Gelesiuntha? Answer as to thy sister stones and mountains,
    groves and waters and sky, answer in language mute.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In troubled thought and care she asked the very breezes, but of
  her sister's safety all were silent.</p>

  <p>Fortunatus, like Ausonius, not only looked at Nature with
  sympathy, but was a master in description of scenery. His lengthy
  descriptions of spring are mostly only decorative work, but here and
  there we find a really poetic idea. For example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At the first spring, when earth has doffed her frost, the field
    is clothed with variegated grass; the mountains stretch their leafy
    heads towards the sky, the shady tree renews its verdant foliage,
    the lovely vine is swelling with budding branches, giving promise
    that a weight of grapes shall hang from its prolific stems. While
    all joys return, the earth is dead and dull.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The soft violets paint the field with their own purple, the
    meadows are green with grass, the grass is bright with its fresh
    shoots. Little by little, like stars, the bright flowers spring up,
    and the sward is joyous and gay with flecks of colour, and the
    birds that through the winter cold have been numb and silent, with
    imprisoned song, are now recalled to their song.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He describes the cold winter, and a hot summer's day, when</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Even in the forests no shade was to be found, and the traveller
    almost fainted on the burning roads, longing for shade and cool
    drinks. At last the rustle of a crystal stream is heard, he hurries
    to it with delight, he lies down and lays his limbs in the soft
    kisses of the grass.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg058" id="pg058">058</a></span>
  His poems about beautiful and noteworthy places include some on the
  Garonne and Gers (Egircius):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>So dried up by heat that it is neither river nor land, and the
    grumbling croak of the frog, sole ruler of the realm from which the
    fish are banished, is heard in the lonely swamp; but when the rain
    pours down, the flood swells, and what was a lake suddenly becomes
    a sea.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He has many verses of this sort, written with little wit but great
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>More attractive are descriptions of the Rhine and Moselle,
  recalling Ausonius, and due to love partly of Nature, partly of
  verbal scene-painting. The best and most famous of these is on his
  journey by the Moselle from Metz to Andernach on the Rhine. Here he
  shews a keen eye and fine taste for wide views and high mountains, as
  well as for the minutiæ of scenery, with artistic treatment. He also
  blends his own thoughts and feelings with his impressions of Nature,
  making it clear that he values her not merely for decoration, but for
  her own sake.</p>

  <p>He has been called the last Roman poet; in reality, he belonged
  not only to the period which directly succeeded his own, when the
  Roman world already lay in ruins, but to the fully-developed Middle
  Ages--the time when Christianity and Germanism had mated with Roman
  minds.</p>

  <p>In his best pieces, such as his famous elegy, he caught the
  classic tone to perfection, feeling himself in vital union with the
  great of bygone centuries; but in thought and feeling he was really
  modern and under the influence of the Christian Germanic spirit with
  all its depth and intensity. His touching friendship with Radegunde
  is, as it were, a symbol of the blending of the two elements out of
  which the modern sprang. It was the stimulating influence of the
  noble Germanic princess, herself <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg059" id="pg059">059</a></span>Christian in soul, which fanned the
  dying sparks of classic poetry into a flame.</p>

  <p>Fortunatus stood upon a borderland. Literature was retreating
  further and further from the classic models, and culture was
  declining to its fall. In Gaul, as in Spain and Italy, the shadows of
  coming night were broadening over literary activity, thought, and
  feeling.</p>

  <p>It is a characteristic fact in Roman literature, that not only its
  great lights, but the lesser ones who followed them, were
  enthusiastically imitated. Latin poetry of the Middle Ages lived upon
  recollections of the past, or tried to raise itself again by its
  help; even so late a comer as Fortunatus became in his turn an object
  of marvel, and was copied by poets who never reached his level.</p>

  <p>It is not surprising that feeling for Nature shewed a
  corresponding shallowness and lassitude.</p>

  <p>Not only bucolic but didactic writing was modelled upon the
  classic. Isodorus and Beda, in their works with identical titles
  'concerning the existence of things,' relied on Roman models no less
  than Alcuin, who had formed himself on the pattern of Augustine's
  time in his <i>Conflict between Winter and Spring</i>, as well as in
  many single verses, directly inspired by Virgil.<a href=
  "#c36"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

  <p>His <i>Farewell to his Cell</i> caught the idyllic tone very
  neatly:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Beloved cell, retirement's sweet abode!</p>

    <p>Farewell, a last farewell, thy poet bids thee!</p>

    <p>Beloved cell, by smiling woods embraced,</p>

    <p>Whose branches, shaken by the genial breeze,</p>

    <p>To meditation oft my mind disposed.</p>

    <p>Around thee too, their health-reviving herbs</p>

    <p>In verdure gay the fertile meadows spread;</p>

    <p>And murmuring near, by flowery banks confined,</p>

    <p>Through fragrant meads the crystal streamlets glide,</p>

    <p>Wherein his nets the joyful fisher casts,</p>

    <p>And fragrant with the apple bending bough,</p>

    <p>With rose and lily joined, the gardens smile;</p>

    <p>While jubilant, along thy verdant glades <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg060" id="pg060">060</a></span>At dawn his
    melody each songster pours,</p>

    <p>And to his God attunes the notes of praise.</p>
  </div>

  <p>These heartfelt effusions express a feeling which certainly
  inspired many monks when they turned from their gloomy cells to the
  gardens and woods beyond--a feeling compounded of renunciation of the
  world with idyllic comfort in their surroundings. If their
  fundamental feeling was worship and praise of the Creator, their
  constant outdoor work, which, during the first centuries, was
  strenuous cultivation of the soil, must have roused a deep
  appreciation of Nature in the nobler minds among them. Their choice
  of sites for monasteries and hermitages fully bears out this
  view.<a href="#c37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>The Conflict between Spring and Winter</i>, with its classic
  suggestions, is penetrated by a truly German love of spring.<a href=
  "#c38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> It described the time when the cuckoo
  sings high in the branches, grass clothes earth with many tints, and
  the nightingale sings untiringly in the red-gold butcher's broom,
  captivating us with her changing melodies.</p>

  <p>Among the savants whom Charlemagne gathered round him was
  Angilbert. Virgil was his model, but the influence of the lighter
  fluency of Fortunatus was visible, as in so many of his
  contemporaries. With a vivid and artistic pen he described the wood
  and park of Aachen and the Kaiser's brilliant hunt<a href=
  "#c39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>; the great forest grove, the grassy
  meadows with brooks and all sorts of birds flitting about, the
  thicket stocked with many kinds of game.</p>

  <p>At the same time, his writing betrayed the conventional tone of
  courts in its praise of his great secular lord, and a 'thoughtful
  romantic inclination' for the eternal feminine, for the beautiful
  women with splendid ornaments, and necks shining like milk or snow or
  glowing like a rose, who, as Ebert puts it, 'lay far from the
  asceticism of the poetry of the saints.'</p>

  <p>Naso Muadorinus in his pastorals took Calpurnius <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg061" id="pg061">061</a></span>and Nemesianus for
  his models, just as they had taken Virgil, and Virgil Theocritus.
  Muadorinus imitated the latter in his pastorals.</p>

  <p>In an alternate song of his between an old man and a boy, the old
  man draws an artistic contrast between the shady coolness of the wood
  and the mid-day glow of the sun, while the boy praises Him whose
  songs the creatures follow as once they followed Orpheus with his
  lute; and at the end, Charlemagne, who was extolled at the beginning
  as a second Cæsar, is exalted to heaven as the founder of a new
  Golden Age.</p>

  <p>In the Carolingian Renaissance of the Augustine epoch of
  literature, Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans, takes first place. At any
  rate, he described in a very superior way, and, like Fortunatus, with
  some humour, the draining of the Larte at Le Mans, Feb. 820; also, in
  a light and lively strain, the Battle of the Birds, and, with the
  same strong colouring, Paradise.</p>

  <p>The idyll of the cloister garden, so often treated, became famous
  in the much-read <i>Hortulus</i> of Wahlafried.<a href=
  "#c40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Despite classical flourishes from Virgil and Columella, and
  pharmaceutical handling of plants, there is a good deal of thoughtful
  observation of Nature in these 444 hexameters.</p>

  <p>They contain descriptions of seasons, of recipes, flowers and
  vegetables, of the gardener's pleasure in digging his fields in
  spring, clearing them of nettles, and levelling the ground thrown up
  by the moles, in protecting his seedlings from rain and sun, and,
  later on, in his gay beds of deciduous plants.</p>

  <p>There is a touch here and there which is not unpoetic--for
  instance:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A bright green patch of dark blue rue paints this shady grove;
    it has short leaves and throws out short umbels, and passes the
    breath of the wind and the rays of the sun right down to the end of
    the stalk, and at a gentle touch gives forth a heavy scent.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg062" id="pg062">062</a></span>
  and:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>With what verse, with what song, can the dry thinness of my
    meagre muse rightly extol the shining lily, whose whiteness is as
    the whiteness of gleaming snow, whose sweet scent is as the scent
    of Sabian woods?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He closes pleasantly too, adjuring Grimald to read the book under
  the shade of the peach tree, while his school-fellows play round and
  pick the great delicate fruit which they can barely grasp with one
  hand. In the poem to the layman Ruodbern (100 hexameters) he
  described the dangers of Alpine travelling, both from weather and
  other foes. In those days the difficulties of the road excluded all
  interest in mountain beauty. There is a tender and expressive poem in
  Sapphic metre, in which, homesick and cold in winter, he sang his
  longing for beautiful Reichenau. But even he, like most of his
  predecessors and all his followers, wielded his pen with labour,
  expression often failing to keep pace with thought.</p>

  <p>It only remains to mention Wandalbert, a monk of the monastery at
  Prün, who, in a postscript to the <i>Conclusio des Martyrologium</i>,
  gives a charming account of a landowner's life in field, garden, and
  hunt.</p>

  <p>In the cloister, then, idyllic comfort, delighting in Nature and a
  quiet country life, was quite as much at home as scholarship and
  classical study. But we shall look there in vain for any trace of the
  sentimental, the profoundly melancholy attitude of the Fathers of the
  Church, Basil and Gregory, or for Augustine's deep faith and devout
  admiration of the works of creation: even the tone of Ausonius and
  Fortunatus, in their charming descriptions of scenery, was now a
  thing of the past. Feeling for Nature--sentimental, sympathetic,
  cosmic, and dogmatic--had dwindled down to mere pleasure in
  cultivating flowers in the garden, to the level Aachen <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg063" id="pg063">063</a></span>landscape and such
  like; and the power to describe the impression made by scenery was,
  like the impression itself, lame and weary.</p>

  <p>It was the night of the decline breaking over Latin
  literature.</p>

  <p>And how did it stand with German literature up to the eleventh
  century? A German Kingdom had existed from the treaties of Verdun and
  Mersen (842), but during this period traces of German poetry are few,
  outweighed by Latin.</p>

  <p>The two great Messianic poems, <i>Heliand</i> and <i>Krist</i>,
  stand out alone. In the <i>Heliand</i> the storm on the lake of
  Gennesaret is vividly painted:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Then began the power of the storm; in the whirlwind the waves
    rose, night descended, the sea broke with uproar, wind and water
    battled together; yet, obedient to the command and to the
    controlling word, the water stilled itself and flowed serenely.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In <i>Krist</i> there is a certain distinction in the description
  of the Ascension, as the rising figures soar past the constellations
  of stars, which disappear beneath their feet; for the rest, the
  symbolic so supplants the direct meaning, that in place of an epic we
  have a moralizing sermon. But there are traces of delight in the
  beauty of the outer world, in the sunshine, and sympathy is
  attributed to Nature:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>She grew very angry at such deeds.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The poem <i>Muspilli</i> (the world fire) shews the old northern
  feeling for Nature; still more the few existing words of the
  <i>Wessobrunner Prayer</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>This I heard as the greatest marvel among men,</p>

    <p>That once there was no earth nor heaven above,</p>

    <p>The bright stars gave no light, the sun shone not,</p>

    <p>Nor the moon, nor the glorious sea.</p>
  </div>

  <p>How plainly 'the bright stars' and the 'glorious sea' shew joy in
  the beauty of the world!</p>

  <p>In the oldest Scandinavian poems the inflexible <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg064" id="pg064">064</a></span>character of the
  Northerner and the northern landscape is reflected; the descriptions
  are short and scanty; it is not mountain, rock, and sea which count
  as beautiful, but pleasant, and, above all, fruitful scenery. The
  imagery is bold: (Kenninger) the wind is the wolf of wood or sail,
  the sea the pathway of the whale, the bath of the diving bird,
  etc.</p>

  <p>The Anglo-Saxon was especially distinguished by his forcible
  images and epithets. In Rynerwulf we have 'night falls like a helmet,
  dark brown covers the mountains.' 'The sky is the fortress of the
  storm, the sun the torch of the world, the jewel of splendour.' 'Fire
  is eager, wild, blind, and raging; the sea is the gray sea, and the
  sparkling splendid sea; waves are graves of the dead,' etc.</p>

  <p>Vivid feeling for Nature is not among the characteristic features
  of either Scandinavian or old German poetry.</p>

  <p>It is naive and objective throughout, and seldom weighty or
  forcible.</p>

  <p>The Waltharius shews the influence of Virgil's language, in
  highly-coloured and sympathetic descriptions like those of the Latin
  poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance.</p>

  <p>Animal saga probably first arose just before the twelfth century,
  and their home was probably Franconia.</p>

  <p>Like the genial notices of plant life in the Latin poems of the
  Carlovingian period, the animal poems shewed interest in the animal
  world--the interest of a child who ponders individual differences and
  peculiarities, the virtues and failings so closely allied to its own.
  It was a naive 'hand-and-glove' footing between man and the
  creatures, which attributed all his wishes and weaknesses to them,
  wiped out all differences between them with perfect impartiality, and
  gave the characteristics of each animal with exactness and
  poetry.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg065" id="pg065">065</a></span>
  The soil for the cultivation of poetry about animals was prepared by
  the symbolic and allegorical way of looking at Nature which held sway
  all through the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>The material was used as a symbolic language for the immaterial,
  the world of sense conceived of as a great picture-book of the truths
  of salvation, in whose pages God, the devil, and, between them man,
  figured: thus plant life suggested the flower of the root of Jesse,
  foretold by Isaiah, red flowers the Saviour's wounds, and so forth.
  In the earliest Christian times, a remarkable letter existed in
  Alexandria, the so-called 'Physiologus,' which has affected the
  proverbial turns of speech in the world's literature up to the
  present day to an almost unequalled degree.</p>

  <p>It gave the symbolic meanings of the different animals. The lamb
  and unicorn were symbols of Christ; sheep, fish, and deer, of his
  followers; dragons, serpents, and bears, of the devil; swine, hares,
  hyenas, of gluttony; the disorderly luxuriance of snow meant death,
  the phoenix the resurrection, and so forth, indeed, whole categories
  of animals were turned into allegories of the truths of
  salvation.<a href="#c41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> The cleverest fables of
  animals were in <i>Isengrimen</i>, published in Ghent about 1140 in
  Latin verse--the story of the sick lion and his cure by the fox, and
  the outwitting of the wolf. Such fables did not remain special to
  German national literature, but became popular subjects in the
  literature of the whole world; and it is a significant fact that they
  afterwards took root especially in Flanders, where the taste for
  still life and delight in Nature has always found a home, and which
  became the nursery, in later times, of landscape, animal, and genre
  painting. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg066" id=

  <h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <h3>THE NAIVE FEELING AT THE TIME OF THE CRUSADES</h3>

  <p>In the development and maturing of the race, as of the individual,
  nothing is more helpful than contact with foreign elements, people of
  other manners, thoughts, and feelings. Intimate intercourse between
  different nationalities rouses what is best in the soul of a nation,
  inviting, as it does, to discussion and opposition, as well as to the
  acquisition of new ideas. The conquests of Alexander the Great opened
  up a new world to the Greek, and a new culture arose--Hellenism. It
  was a new world that rose before the astonished eyes of the
  Crusader--in his case too, the East; but the resulting culture did
  not last. The most diverse motives fused to bring about this great
  migration to a land at once unknown and yet, through religion,
  familiar; and a great variety of characters and nations met under the
  banner of the Cross.</p>

  <p>Naturally this shaking up together, not only of Europeans among
  themselves, but of the eastern with the western world, brought about
  a complete revolution in manners, speech, art, science, trade,
  manufacture, thought, and feeling, and so became an important factor
  in general progress.</p>

  <p>The narrow boundaries of nationality, race, and education were
  broken through; all felt equal before the leading idea; men, places,
  plants, and animals were alike new and wonderful. Little <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg067" id="pg067">067</a></span>wonder if German
  knights returning home from the East wove fiction with their fact,
  and produced the most fantastic and adventurous heroic songs.</p>

  <p>Many of the noblest of the nations joined the Crusades in pious
  ardour for the cause, and it is easy to imagine the effect of the
  complete novelty of scene upon them. With such tremendous new
  impressions to cope with, it is not surprising that even the best
  minds, untrained as they were, were unequal to the task, and that the
  descriptions of real experiences or events in poetic form failed to
  express what they meant. Besides this, there is no doubt that in many
  ways the facts fell below their ideals; also that the Crusader's
  mantle covered at the same time a rabble, which joined from the
  lowest motives, the scum of Europe. It must also be remembered that
  it is far easier to experience or feel than to pass on that
  experience and feeling to others; that those who wrote did not always
  belong to the most educated; and that they wrote, for the most part,
  with difficulty in Greek or Latin. When all this has been weighed and
  admitted, the fact remains that in existing accounts of the Crusades
  there is great poverty of description of scenery, and lack of much
  feeling for Nature. The historian, as such, was bound to give first
  place to matters of fact and practical importance, and so to judge a
  place by its value to an army passing through or occupying it; by its
  fertility, water-supply, its swamps or stony ground, and so forth;
  but still the modern reader is astonished to see how little
  impression the scenery of the Holy Land made, judged by the accounts
  we possess, upon the Crusaders. Even when it is conceded that other
  important concerns came first, and that danger, want, and hunger must
  often have made everything disagreeable, still, references to Nature
  are very scanty, and one may look in vain for any interest in
  beautiful scenery for its own sake.</p>

  <p>There is only matter-of-fact geographical and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg068" id="pg068">068</a></span>mythological
  information in William of Tours' <i>History of the Crusades</i>; for
  instance, in his description of the Bosphorus he does not waste a
  word over its beauty. But, as 'fruitful' and 'pleasant' are
  ever-recurring adjectives with him, one cannot say that he absolutely
  ignored it.</p>

  <p>He said of Durazzo: 'They weather the bad seasons of the year in
  fruitful districts rich in woods and fields, and all acceptable
  conditions'; of Tyre, 'The town has a most excellent position on a
  plain, almost entirely surrounded by mountains. The soil is
  productive, the wood of value in many ways.' Of Antioch, 'Its
  position is very convenient and pleasant, it lies in valleys which
  have excellent and fertile soil, and are most pleasantly watered by
  springs and streams. The mountains which enclose the town on both
  sides are really very high; but send down very clear water, and their
  sides and slopes are covered by buildings up to the very summits.'
  There is nothing about beautiful views, unless one takes this, which
  really only records a meteorological curiosity: 'From the top of one
  mountain one can see the ball of the sun at the fourth watch of the
  night, and if one turns round at the time when the first rays light
  up the darkness, one has night on one side and day on the other.'</p>

  <p>Tyre is described again as 'conspicuous for the fertility of its
  soil and the charm of its position.' Its great waterworks are
  especially admired, since by their means 'not only the gardens and
  most fruitful orchards flourish, but the cane from which sugar is
  made, which is so useful to man for health and other purposes, and is
  sent by merchants to the most distant parts of the world.' Other
  reporters were charmed by the fertility and wealth of the East. 'On
  those who came from the poorer and colder western countries, the rich
  resources of the sunny land in comparison with the poverty of home
  made an impression of overflowing plenty, and at <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg069" id="pg069">069</a></span>times almost of
  inexhaustibleness. The descriptions of certain districts, extolled
  for their special richness, sound almost enthusiastic.<a href=
  "#d1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Burkhard von Monte Sion was enthusiastic about Lebanon's wealth of
  meadows and gardens, and the plain round Tripolis, and considered the
  Plain of Esdraelon the most desirable place in the world; but, on
  exact and unprejudiced examination, there is nothing in his words
  beyond homely admiration and matter-of-fact discussion of its great
  practical utility.</p>

  <p>He says of La Boneia, 'That plain has many homesteads, and
  beautiful groves of olive and fig and other trees of various kinds,
  and much timber. Moreover, it abounds in no common measure in rivers
  and pasture land'; closes a geographical account of Lebanon thus,
  'There are in Libanus and Antilibanus themselves fertile and
  well-tilled valleys, rich in pasture land, vineyards, gardens,
  plantations--in a word, in all the good things of the world'; and
  says of the Plain of Galilee, 'I never saw a lovelier country, if our
  sins and wrong-doing did not prevent Christians from living
  there.'</p>

  <p>He had some feeling too for a distant view. He wrote of Samaria:
  'The site was very beautiful; the view stretched right to the Sea of
  Joppa and to Antipatris and Cæsarea of Palestine, and over the whole
  mountain of Ephraim down to Ramathaym and Sophim and to Carmel near
  Accon by the sea. And it is rich in fountains and gardens and olive
  groves, and all the good things this world desires.' But it would be
  going too far to conclude from the following words that he
  appreciated the contrast between simple and sublime scenery: 'It must
  be noticed too, that the river, from the source of Jordan at the foot
  of Lebanon as far as the Desert of Pharan, has broad and pleasant
  plains on both sides, and beyond these the fields are surrounded by
  very high mountains as far as the Red Sea.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg070" id="pg070">070</a></span> In
  dealing with Gethsemane and the Mount of Olives, religious enthusiasm
  suppresses any reference to scenery.</p>

  <p>These descriptions shew that the wealth and fertility of the
  country were praised before its beauty, and that this was only
  referred to in short, meagre phrases, which tell less about it than
  any raptures without special knowledge.</p>

  <p>It was much the same with Phokas, who visited the Holy Land in
  1135.<a href="#d2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>He was greatly impressed by the position of Antioch, 'with its
  meadows and fruitful gardens, and the murmur of waters as the river,
  fed by the torrents of the Castalian spring, flows quietly round the
  town and besprinkles its towers with its gentle waves ... but most to
  be admired of all is the mountain between town and sea, a noble and
  remarkable sight--indeed, a delight to the beholder's eye ... the
  Orontes flows with countless windings at the foot of it, and
  discharges itself into the sea.'</p>

  <p>He thought Lebanon very beautiful and worthy its praise in Holy
  Scripture: 'The sun lies like white hair upon its head; its valleys
  are crowned with pines, cedars, and cypresses; streams, beautiful to
  look at and quite cold, flow from the ravines and valleys down to the
  sea, and the freshly melted snow gives the flowing water its crystal
  clearness.'</p>

  <p>Tyre, too, was praised for its beauty: 'Strangers were
  particularly delighted with one spring, which ran through meadows;
  and if one stands on the tower, one can see the dense growth of
  plants, the movement of the leaves in the glow of noon.'</p>

  <p>The plain of Nazareth, too, was 'a heaven on earth, the delight of
  the soul.'</p>

  <p>But recollections of the sacred story were dearer to Phokas than
  the scenery, and elsewhere he limited himself to noting the rich
  fruit gardens, shady groups of trees, and streams and rivers with
  pleasant banks.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg071" id="pg071">071</a></span>
  Epiphanius Monachus Hagiopolitæ, in his <i>Enarratio Syriæ</i>, was a
  very dry pioneer; so, too, the <i>Anonymus de locis
  Hierosolymitanis</i>; Perdiccas, in his <i>Hierosolyma</i>, describes
  Sion thus: 'It stands on an eminence so as to strike the eye, and is
  beautiful to behold, owing to a number of vines and flower gardens
  and pleasant spots.'</p>

  <p>It must be admitted then, that, beside utilitarian admiration of a
  Paradise of fruitfulness, there is some record of simple, even
  enthusiastic delight in its beauty; but only as to its general
  features, and in the most meagre terms. The country was more
  interesting to the Crusaders as the scene of the Christian story than
  as a place in which to rest and dream and admire Nature for her own
  sake.</p>

  <p>The accounts of German pilgrimages<a href="#d3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries only contain dry notices,
  such as those of Jacob von Bern (1346-47), Pfintzing (1436-40), and
  Ulrich Leman (1472-80). The last-mentioned praises Damascus in this
  clumsy fashion: 'The town is very gay, quite surrounded by orchards,
  with many brooks and springs flowing inside and out, and an
  inexpressible number of people in it,' etc. Dietrich von Schachten
  describes Venice in this way: 'Venice lies in the sea, and is built
  neither on land nor on mountain, but on wooden piles, which is
  unbelievable to one who has not seen it'; and Candia: 'Candia is a
  beautiful town in the sea, well built; also a very fruitful island,
  with all sorts of things that men need for living.' He describes a
  ride through Southern Italy: 'Saturday we rode from Trepalda, but the
  same day through chestnut and hazel woods; were told that these woods
  paid the king 16,000 gulden every year. After that we rode a German
  mile through a wood, where each tree had its vine--many trees carried
  3 ohms of wine, which is pleasant to see--and came to Nola.'</p>

  <p>He called Naples 'very pretty and big,' and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg072" id="pg072">072</a></span>on: 'Then the king
  took us to the sea and shewed us the ports, which are pretty and
  strong with bulwarks and gates; we saw many beautiful ships too,'
  etc. One does not know which is the more wonderful here, the poverty
  of the description or the utter lack of personal observation: what
  the wood produced, and how one was protected from the sea, was more
  important to the writer than wood and sea themselves, and this, even
  in speaking of the Bay of Naples, perhaps the most beautiful spot in
  Europe. But instances like these are typical of German descriptions
  at the time, and their Alpine travels fared no better.<a href=
  "#d4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Geographical knowledge of the Alps advanced very slowly; there was
  as yet no æsthetic enjoyment of their beauty. The Frankish historians
  (Gregory of Tours, Fredegar) chronicled special events in the Alps,
  but very briefly. Fredegar, for instance, knew of the sudden
  appearance of a hot spring in the Lake of Thun, and Gregory of Tours
  notes that the land-slip in 563 at the foot of the Dent du Midi,
  above the point where the Rhine enters the Lake of Geneva, was a
  dreadful event. Not only was the Castle of Tauretunum overwhelmed,
  but the blocking of the Rhine caused a deluge felt as far as Geneva.
  The pious prince of the Church explained this as a portent of another
  catastrophe, the pest, which ravaged Gaul soon after.</p>

  <p>There was much fabling at that time in the legends of saints,
  about great mines of iron, gold, and silver, and about chamois and
  buck, cattle-breeding and Alpine husbandry in the 'regio montana';
  for example, in von Aribo's <i>Vita S. Emmerani</i>. When the Alps
  became more frequented, especially when, through Charlemagne, a
  political bridge came to unite Italy and Germany, new roads were made
  and the whole region was better known--in fact, early in mediæval
  times, not only political, but ecclesiastical and mercantile life
  spread its threads over a great <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg073"
  id="pg073">073</a></span>part of the known world, and began to bind
  the lives of nations together, so that the Alps no longer remained
  <i>terra incognita</i> to dwellers far and near.</p>

  <p>We have accounts of Alpine journeys by the Abbé Majolus v. Clugny
  (970), Bernard v. Hildesheim (1101), Aribert v. Mailand, Anno v.
  Coeln<a href="#d5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, but without a trace of
  orography. They scarcely refer to the snow and glacier regions from
  the side of physical geography, or even of æsthetic feeling; and do
  not mention the mountain monarchs so familiar to-day--Mt. Blanc, the
  Jungfrau, Ortner, Glockner, etc.--which were of no value to their
  life, practical or scientific. These writers record nothing but names
  of places and their own troubles and dangers in travelling,
  especially in winter. And even at the end of the fifteenth century,
  German travels across the Alps were written in the same strain--for
  example, the account of the voyage of the Elector-Palatine Alexander
  v. Zweibrücken and Count Joh. Ludwig zu Nassau (1495-96) from Zurich
  Rapperschwyl and Wesen to Wallensee: 'This is the real Switzerland;
  has few villages, just a house here and a house there, but beautiful
  meadows, much cattle, and very high mountains, on which snow lies,
  which falls before Christmas, and is as hard as any rock.' As an
  exception to this we have a vivid and poetic description of the
  famous Verona Pass in Latin verse by Guntherus Ligurinus.</p>

  <p>Günther's description of this notorious ravine, between sky-high
  Alps, with the torrent rushing at the bottom and a passage so narrow
  that men could only move forward one by one, sounds like a personal
  experience. This twelfth-century poem comes to us, in fact, like a
  belated echo of Fortunatus.</p>

  <p>We must now enquire whether the chief representatives of German
  literature at this time shewed any of the national love of Nature,
  whether the influence of the Crusades was visible in them, how far
  scenery <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg074" id=
  "pg074">074</a></span>took a place in epic and song, and whether, as
  moderns have so often stated, mediæval Germany stood high above
  antiquity in this respect. Gervinus, a classic example on the last
  point, in the section of his history of German poetry which treats of
  the difference between the German fables about animals on the one
  hand, and Esop's and the Oriental on the other, said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The way in which animals are handled in the fables demanded a
    far slighter familiarity between them and men; so exact a knowledge
    as we see in the German fables, often involving knowledge of their
    natural history, such insight into the 'privacy of the animal
    world,' belonged to quite another kind of men. Antiquity did not
    delight in Nature, and delight in Nature is the very foundation of
    these poems. Remote antiquity neither knew nor sought to know any
    natural history; but only wondered at Nature. The art of hunting
    and the passion for it, often carried to excess in the Middle Ages,
    was unknown to it. It is a bold remark of Grimm's that he could
    smell the old smell of the woods in the German animal poems, but it
    is one whose truth every one will feel, who turns to this simple
    poetry with an open mind, who cares for Nature and life in the
    open.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is a very tangle of empty phrases and misstatements. No
  people stood in more heartfelt and naive relation to Nature,
  especially to the animal world, than the Hindoos and Persians. In
  earlier enquiries<a href="#d6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> we have reviewed
  the naive feeling displayed in Homer and the sentimental in
  Hellenism, and have seen that the taste for hunting increased
  knowledge of Nature in the open in Hellenic days far more than in the
  Middle Ages. We shall see now that the level of feeling reached in
  those and imperial Roman days was not regained in European literature
  until long after the fall of Latin poetry, and that it was the
  fertilizing influence of that classic spirit, and that alone, which
  enabled the inborn German taste for Nature, and for hunting, and
  plant and animal life, to find artistic expression. It was a too
  superficial <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg075" id=
  "pg075">075</a></span>knowledge of classic literature, and an
  inclination to synthesis, and clever <i>a priori</i> argument (a
  style impressed upon his day by Hegel's method, and fortunately fast
  disappearing), which led Gervinus to exalt the Middle Ages at the
  expense of antiquity. It sounds like a weak concession when he says
  elsewhere:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Joy in Nature, which is peculiar to modern times, in contrast to
    antiquity, which is seen in the earliest mediæval poems, and in
    which, moreover, expiring antiquity came to meet the German--this
    joy in Nature, in dwelling on plant and animal life, is the very
    soul of this (animal) poetry. As in its plastic art, so in all its
    poetry, antiquity only concerned itself with gods and heroes; its
    glance was always turned upwards.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But, as a fact, no one has ever stood with feet more firmly
  planted on this earth than the Greek, enjoying life and undeterred by
  much scruple or concern as to the powers above; and centuries of
  development passed before German literature equalled Greek in love of
  Nature and expressive representation of her beauty.</p>

  <p>To rank the two national epics of Germany, the
  <i>Nibelungenlied</i> and <i>Gudrun</i>, side by side with the
  <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> is to exaggerate their value. And
  here, as ever, overstraining the comparison is mischievous.</p>

  <p>The <i>Nibelungenlied</i> is undeniably charming with its laconic
  and yet plastic descriptions, its vigorous heroes, and the tragic
  course of their fate; so is <i>Gudrun</i>, that melodious poem of the
  North Sea. But they never, either in composition, method of
  representation, or descriptive epithets, reach the perfect art of the
  Greek epics. What moral beauty and plastic force there is in Homer's
  comparisons and in his descriptions of times and seasons! what a
  clear eye and warm heart he has for Nature in all her moods! and what
  raw and scanty beginnings of such things we have in the
  <i>Nibelungenlied</i>! It <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg076" id=
  "pg076">076</a></span>is true Homer had not attained to the degree of
  sympathy which finds in Nature a friend, a sharer of one's joys and
  sorrows; she is pictured objectively in the form of epic comparisons;
  but how faithfully, and with what range and variety!</p>

  <p>There can scarcely be another epic in the world so poor in
  descriptions of time and place as the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>; it
  cannot be used to prove German feeling for Nature!</p>

  <p>India, Persia, and Greece made natural phenomena the counterparts
  of human life, weaving into the tale, by way of comparison or
  environment, charming genre pictures of plant and animal life, each
  complete in itself; in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> Nature plays no part
  at all, not even as framework.</p>

  <p>Time is indicated as sparsely as possible:</p>

  <p>'Upon the 7th day at Worms on the Rhine shore, the gallant
  horsemen arrived.'</p>

  <p>'On a Whitsun morning we saw them all go by'; or 'When it grew
  towards even, and near the sun's last ray, seeing the air was
  cooler'; or 'He must hang, till light morning threw its glow through
  the window.' The last is the most poetic; elsewhere it is 'Day was
  over, night fell.'</p>

  <p>Terseness can be both a beauty and a force; but, in comparison
  with Greece, how very little feeling for Nature these expressions
  contain!</p>

  <p>It is no better with descriptions of place:</p>

  <p>'From the Rhine they rode through Hesse, their warriors as well,
  towards the Saxon country, where they to fighting fell.'</p>

  <p>'He found a fortress placed upon a mountain.'</p>

  <p>'Into a wide-roomed palace of fashion excellent, for there,
  beneath it rushing, one saw the Danube's flood.'</p>

  <p>Even the story of the hunt and the murder of Siegfried is quite
  matter-of-fact and sparse as to scenery: 'By a cold spring he soon
  lost his life ... then <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg077" id=
  "pg077">077</a></span>they rode from there into a deep wood ... there
  they encamped by the green wood, where they would hunt on the broad
  mead ... one heard mountain and tree echo.'</p>

  <p>'The spring of water was pure and cool and good.' ...</p>

  <p>'There fell Chriemhild's husband among the flowers ... all round
  about the flowers were wetted with his blood.'</p>

  <p>One thinks instinctively of Indian and Greek poetry, of Adonis and
  the death of Baldur in the Northern Saga. But even here, where the
  subject almost suggests it, there is no trace of Nature's sympathy
  with man.</p>

  <p>References to the animal world too--Chriemhild's dreams of the
  falcons seized by two eagles, and the two wild boars which attacked
  Siegfried, the game hunted in the forests by the heroes who run like
  panthers--all show it to be of no importance.</p>

  <p>Even such phrases as rosy-red, snow-white, etc., are rare--'Her
  lovely face became all rosy-red with pleasure'; but there is a
  certain tenderness in the comparisons of Chriemhild:</p>

  <p>'Then came the lovely maiden, even as morning red from sombre
  clouds outbreaking,' and, 'just as the moon in brightness excels the
  brightest stars, and suddenly outshining, athwart the clouds
  appears,' so she excelled all other women.</p>

  <p>It has been said that one can hear the sighing of the north wind
  and the roar of the North Sea in <i>Gudrun</i>, but this is scarcely
  more than a pretty phrase. The 'dark tempestuous' sea, 'wild
  unfathomable' waves, the shore 'wet from the blood of the slain,' are
  indeed mentioned, but that is all.</p>

  <p>Wat of Sturmland says to the young warriors: 'The air is still and
  the moon shines clear ... when the red star yonder in the south dips
  his head in the brine, I shall blow on my great horn that all
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg078" id="pg078">078</a></span>the
  hosts shall hear'; but it is hope of morning, not delight in the
  starry sky, that he is expressing.</p>

  <p>Indications of place too are of the briefest, just 'It was a broad
  neck of land, called the Wülpensand,' or, 'In a few hours they saw
  the shores where they would land, a little harbour lay in sight
  enfolded by low hills clothed with dark fir trees.'</p>

  <p>The first trace of sympathy with Nature occurs in the account of
  the effect of Horand's song.</p>

  <p>Like Orpheus, he charms the little birds and other creatures: 'He
  sang with such a splendid voice, that the little birds ceased their
  song.'</p>

  <p>'And as he began to sing again, all the birds in the copse round
  ceased their sweet songs.'</p>

  <p>'The very cattle left their green pastures to hearken, the little
  gold beetles stopped running among the grass, the fishes ceased to
  shoot about in the brooks. He sang long hours, and it seemed but a
  brief moment. The very church bells sounded sweet no longer; the folk
  left the choir songs of the priests and ran to hear him. All who
  heard his voice were heart-sick after the singer, so grand and sweet
  was the strain.'</p>

  <p>Indications of time are rarely found more short and concise than
  here:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When night ended and day began.</p>

    <p>On the 12th day they quitted the country.</p>

    <p>In Maytime. On a cool morning.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is a little richer:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was the time when leaves spring up delightfully and birds of
    all sorts sing their best in the woods.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Much more definite and distinct is:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was about that time of the year when departing winter sheds
    his last terrors upon the earth; a sharp breeze was blowing and the
    sea was covered with broken up ice; but there were gleams of
    sunshine upon the hills, and the little birds began to tune their
    throats tremulously, that they might be ready to sing their lay
    when the March weather was past.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg079" id=
  "pg079">079</a></span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Gudrun trembled with cold; her wet garment clung close to her
    white limbs; the wind dashed her golden hair about her face.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And later, when the morning of Gudrun's deliverance breaks, the
  indications of time, though short, are plastic enough:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>After the space of an hour the red star went down upon the edge
    of the sea, and Wat of Sturmland, standing upon the hill, blew a
    great blast on his horn, which was heard in the land for miles
    round.... The sound of Wat's horn ... wakened a young maid, who,
    stealing on tiptoe to the window, looked over the bay and beheld
    the glimmering of spears and helms upon the sands.... 'Awake,
    mistress,' she cried, 'the host of the Hegelings is at hand.'</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Companions are few;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>He sprang like a wild lion.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The shower of stones flung down upon Wat 'is but an April
  shower.'</p>

  <p>Images are few too:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This flower of hope, to find repose here on the shore, Hartmouth
    and his friends did not bring to blossom.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Wilhelm Grimm rightly observes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At this epoch the poetry of the Fatherland gave no separate
    descriptions of Nature--descriptions, that is, whose only object
    was to paint the impression of the landscape in glowing colours
    upon the mind. The old German masters certainly did not lack
    feeling for Nature, but they have left us no other expression of it
    than such as its connection with historical events demanded.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And further:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The question, whether contact with Southern Italy, or, through
    the Crusades, with Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine, did not enrich
    German poetry with new pictures of Nature, can only, as a general
    rule, be answered in the negative.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the courtly epics of chivalry, the place of real Nature was
  taken by a fabulous wonderworld, full <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg080" id="pg080">080</a></span>of the most fantastic and romantic
  scenery, in which wood, field, plants, and animals were all
  distorted. For instance, in the Alexander saga (of Pfaffen Lamprecht)
  Alexander the Great describes to his teacher Aristotle the wonders he
  has seen, and how one day he came with his army to a dark forest,
  where the interlacing boughs of tall trees completely shut out the
  sunlight. Clear, cool streams ran through it down to the valley, and
  birds' songs echoed in the shade. The ground was covered by an
  enormous quantity of flower buds of wondrous size, which looked like
  great balls, snow-white and rose-coloured, closely folded up.
  Presently, the fragrant goblets opened, and out of all these
  wonder-flowers stepped lovely maidens, rosy as dawn and white as day,
  and about twelve years old. All these thousands of charming beings
  raised their voices together and competed with the birds in song,
  swaying up and down in charming lines, singing and laughing in the
  cool shade. They were dressed in red and white, like the flowers from
  which they were born; but if sun rays fell on them, they would fade
  and die. They were only children of the woodland shade and the
  summer, and lived no longer than the flowers, which May brings to
  life and Autumn kills. In this wood Alexander and his host pitched
  their tents, and lived through the summer with the little maids. But
  their happiness only lasted three months and twelve days:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When the time came to an end, our joy passed away too; the
    flowers faded, and the pretty girls died; trees lost their leaves,
    springs their flow, and the birds their song; all pleasure passed
    away. Discomfort began to touch my heart with many sorrows, as day
    by day I saw the beautiful maidens die, the flowers fade: with a
    heavy heart, I departed with my men.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This fairy-like tale, with its blending of human and plant life,
  is very poetically conceived; but it is <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg081" id="pg081">081</a></span>only a play of
  fancy, one of the early steps towards the modern feeling.</p>

  <p>The battle scenes, as well as other scenes in this poem, are bold
  and exaggerated. Armies meet like roaring seas; missiles fly from
  both sides as thick as snow; after the dreadful bath of blood, sun
  and moon veil their light and turn away from the murder committed
  there.</p>

  <p>Hartmann von der Aue, too, did not draw real Nature, but only one
  of his own invention.</p>

  <p>For example, the wild forest with the magic spring in
  <i>Iwein</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I turned to the wilds next morning, and found an extensive
    clearing, hidden in the forest, solitary and without husbandmen.
    There, to my distress, I descried a sad delight of the eyes--beasts
    of every kind that I know the names of, attacking each other....
    this spring is cold and very pure; neither rain, sun, or wind reach
    it; it is screened by a most beautiful lime tree. The tree is
    excessively tall and thick, so that neither sun nor rain can
    penetrate its foliage, winter does not injure it, nor lessen its
    beauty by one hair; 'tis green and blossoming the whole year
    round.... Over the spring there is a wonderfully fine stone ... the
    tree was so covered with birds that I could scarcely see the
    branches, and even the foliage almost disappeared. The sweet songs
    were pleasant and resounded through the forest, which re-echoed
    them....</p>

    <p>As I poured water upon the ruby, the sun, which had just come
    out, disappeared, the birds' song round about ceased, a black storm
    approached, dark heavy storm-clouds came from all four quarters of
    the vault of heaven. It seemed no longer bright day ... soon a
    thousand flashes of lightning played round me in the forest ...
    there came storm, rain, and hail ... the storm became so great that
    the forest broke down.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He never shews a real love for Nature even in his lyrics, for the
  wish for flowers in <i>Winter Complaint</i> can hardly be said to
  imply that:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He who cares for flowers must lament much at this heavy, dismal
    time; a wife helps to shorten the long nights. In this way I will
    shorten long winter without the birds' song.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg082" id="pg082">082</a></span>
  Wolfram von Eschenbach, too, is very sparing of references to Nature:
  time is given by such phrases as 'when twilight began,' or 'as the
  day broke,' 'at the bright glow of morning' ... 'as day already
  turned to evening.'</p>

  <p>His interest in real things was driven into the background by
  love-making and adventures--<i>Arthur's Round Table</i> and the
  <i>Holy Grail</i>; all the romance of knighthood. When he described a
  forest or a garden, he always decked it out lavishly.</p>

  <p>For instance, the garden in Orgeluse:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A garden surrounding a mountain, planted with noble trees where
    pomegranates, figs, olives, vines, and other fruits grew richly ...
    a spring poured from the rock, and (for all this would have been
    nothing to him without a fair lady) there he found what did not
    displease him--a lady so beautiful and fair that he was charmed at
    the sight, the flower of womanly beauty.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Comparisons are few and not very poetic. In <i>Songs of the
  Heart</i>--</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The lady of the land watered herself with her heart's tears.</p>

    <p>Her eyes rained upon the child.</p>

    <p>Her joy was drowned in lamentation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Gawan and Orgeluse,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Spite their outer sweetness, as disagreeable as a shower of rain
    in sunshine.</p>

    <p>There were many fair flowers, but their colours could not
    compare with that of Orgeluse.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>His heroes are specially fond of birds. Young Parzival</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Felt little care while the little birds sang round him; it made
    his heart swell, he ran weeping into the house.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and Gawan</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Found a door open into a garden; he stept in to look round and
    enjoy the air and the singing of the birds.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg083" id="pg083">083</a></span> So
  we see that in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> scarcely a plant grew, and
  Hartmann and Wolfram's gardens belonged almost entirely to an unreal
  region; there are no traces of a very deep feeling for Nature in all
  this.</p>

  <p>But Gottfried von Strassburg, with his vivid, sensuous imagination
  and keen eye for beauty, shewed a distinct advance both in taste and
  achievement. He, too, notes time briefly: 'And as it drew towards
  evening,' 'Now day had broke.' He repeats his comparisons: fair
  ladies are 'the wonder rose of May,' 'the longing white rose.' The
  two Isolts are sun and dawn. Brangäne is the full moon. The terrified
  girl is thus described:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Her rosy mouth paled; the fair colour, which was her ornament,
    died out of her skin; her bright eyes grew dim like night after
    day.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Another comparison is:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Like the siren's song, drawing a bark to the reef as by a
    magnet, so the sweet young queen attracted many hearts.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Love is a usurious plant, whose sun never goes down; a romance
  sweetens the mood as May dew sweetens the blood.</p>

  <p>Constant friendship is one which takes the pleasure with the pain,
  the thorn with the rose. The last comparisons shew more thought, and
  still more is seen in the beginning of the poem, <i>Riwalin and
  Blancheflur</i>, which has a charming description of Spring.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Now the festival was agreed upon and arranged</p>

    <p>For the four flowering weeks</p>

    <p>When sweet May attracts, till he flies off again.</p>

    <p>At Tinkapol upon a green plain</p>

    <p>High up on a wonderful meadow with spring colour</p>

    <p>Such as no eye has seen before or since. Soft sweet May</p>

    <p>Had dressed it with his own charming extravagance.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg084" id=
    "pg084">084</a></span>There were little wood birds, a joy to the
    ear,</p>

    <p>Flowers and grass and green plants and summer meads</p>

    <p>That were a delight to eye and heart.</p>

    <p>One found there whatever one would, whatever May should
    bring--</p>

    <p>Shade from the sun, limes by the brook,</p>

    <p>A gentle breeze which brought the prattle</p>

    <p>Of Mark's court people. May's friend, the green turf,</p>

    <p>Had made herself a charming costume of flowers,</p>

    <p>In which she shone back at the guests with a festival of her
    own;</p>

    <p>The blossoming trees smiled so sweetly at every one,</p>

    <p>That heart and mind smiled back again.</p>

    <p>The pure notes of the birds, blessed and beautiful,</p>

    <p>Touched heart and senses, filling hill and dale with joy.</p>

    <p>The dear nightingale,</p>

    <p>Sweet bird, may it ever be blessed!</p>

    <p>Sang so lustily upon the bough</p>

    <p>That many a heart was filled with joy and good humour.</p>

    <p>There the company pitched itself</p>

    <p>With great delight on the green grass.</p>

    <p>The limes gave enough shade,</p>

    <p>And many covered their tent roofs with green boughs.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is a heartfelt ring in this. We see that even this early
  period of German mediæval poetry was not entirely lacking in clear
  voices to sing of Nature with real sympathy.</p>

  <p>The description of the Minne grotto is famous, with its magical
  accessories, its limes and other trees, birds, songs, and flowers, so
  that 'eye and ear alike found solace'; but the romantic love episode,
  interwoven as it is by the poet with the life of Nature, is more
  interesting for our purpose.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>They had a court, they had a council which brought them nought
    but joy. Their courtiers were the green trees, the shade and the
    sunlight, the streamlet and the spring; flowers, grass, leaf, and
    blossom, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg085" id=
    "pg085">085</a></span>refreshed their eyes. Their service was the
    song of the birds, the little brown nightingales, the throstlets
    and the merles and other wood birds. The siskin and the ringdove
    vied with each other to do them pleasure, all day long their music
    rejoiced ear and soul. Their love was their high feast.... The man
    was with the woman, and the woman with the man; they had the
    fellowship they most desired, and were where they fain would
    be....</p>

    <p>In the dewy morning they gat them forth to the meadow where
    grass and flowers alike had been refreshed. The glade was their
    pleasure-ground; they wandered hither and thither hearkening each
    other's speech, and waking the song of the birds by their
    footsteps. Then they turned them to where the cool clear spring
    rippled forth, and sat beside its stream and watched its flow till
    the sun grew high in the heaven, and they felt its shade. Then they
    betook them to the linden, its branches offered them a welcome
    shelter, the breezes were sweet and soft beneath its shade, and the
    couch at its feet was decked with the fairest grass and
    flowers.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>With these lovers, love of Nature is only second to love of each
  other. So in the following:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>That same morning had Tristan and his lady-love stolen forth
    hand in hand and come full early, through the morning dew, to the
    flowery meadow and the lovely vale. Dove and nightingale saluted
    them sweetly, greeting their friends Tristan and Iseult. The wild
    wood birds bade them welcome in their own tongue ... it was as if
    they had conspired among themselves to give the lovers a morning
    greeting. They sang from the leafy branches in changeful wise,
    answering each other in song and refrain. The spring that charmed
    their eye and ear whispered a welcome, even as did the linden with
    its rustling leaves. The blossoming trees, the fair meadow, the
    flowers, and the green grass--all that bloomed laughed at their
    coming; the dew which cooled their feet and refreshed their heart
    offered a silent greeting.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The amorous passion was the soil in which, in its early narrow
  stages, sympathy for Nature grew up. Was it the thirteenth-century
  lyrics, the love-songs of the Minnesingers, which unfolded the germ?
  For the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg086" id=
  "pg086">086</a></span>lyric is the form in which the deepest
  expression can be given to feeling for Nature, and in which she
  either appears as background, frame, or ornament, or, by borrowing a
  soul or symbolizing thought and feeling, blends with the inner
  life.</p>

  <p>As the German court epics took their material from France, so the
  German love-songs were inspired by the Provençal troubadours. The
  national differences stand out clear to view: the vivid glowing
  Provençal is fresher, more vehement, and mettlesome; the dreamy
  German more monotonous, tame, and melancholy. The one is given to
  proud daring, wooing, battle, and the triumph of victory; the other
  to musing, loving, and brooding enthusiasm. The stamp of the
  occasional, of improvisation, is upon all Provençal work; while with
  the German Minnesingers, everything--Nature as well as love--tends to
  be stereotyped, monotonous.</p>

  <p>The scanty remains of Troubadour songs<a href=
  "#d7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> often shew mind and Nature very strikingly
  brought together, either in harmony or contrast. For example, Bernard
  von Ventadour (1195):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It may annoy others to see the foliage fall from the trees, but
    it pleases me greatly; one cannot fancy I should long for leaves
    and flowers when she, my dear one, is haughty to me.</p>

    <p>Cold and snow become flowers and greenery under her charming
    glance.</p>

    <p>As I slumber at night, I am waked by the sweet song of the
    nightingale; nothing but love in my mind quite thrilled by shudders
    of delight.</p>

    <p>God! could I be a swallow and sweep through the air, I would go
    at midnight to her little chamber.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When I behold the lark up spring</p>

    <p>To meet the bright sun joyfully,</p>

    <p>How he forgets to poise his wing</p>

    <p>In his gay spirit's revelry.</p>

    <p>Alas! that mournful thoughts should spring</p>

    <p>E'en from that happy songster's glee!</p>

    <p>Strange that such gladdening sight should bring</p>

    <p>Not joy but pining care to me.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg087" id="pg087">087</a></span> A
  very modern thought which calls to mind Theodore Storm's touching
  lines after the death of his wife:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>But this I cannot endure, that the sun smiles as before, clocks
    strike and bells ring as in thy lifetime, and day and night still
    follow each other.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He connects spring with love:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When grass grows green and fresh leaves spring</p>

    <p>And flowers are budding on the plain,</p>

    <p>When nightingales so sweetly sing</p>

    <p>And through the greenwood swells the strain,</p>

    <p>Then joy I in the song and in the flower,</p>

    <p>Joy in myself but in my lady more;</p>

    <p>All objects round my spirit turns to joy,</p>

    <p>But most from her my rapture rises high.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Arnold von Mareuil (about 1200) sings in the same way:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>O! how sweet the breeze of April</p>

    <p>Breathing soft, as May draws near,</p>

    <p>While through nights serene and gentle</p>

    <p>Songs of gladness meet the ear.</p>

    <p>Every bird his well-known language</p>

    <p>Warbling in the morning's pride,</p>

    <p>Revelling on in joy and gladness</p>

    <p>By his happy partner's side....</p>

    <p>With such sounds of bliss around me,</p>

    <p>Who could wear a saddened heart?</p>
  </div>

  <p>He calls his lady-love</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The fairest creature which Nature has produced here below,
    fairer than I can express and faker than a beautiful May day, than
    sunshine in March, shade in summer, than May roses, April rain, the
    flower of beauty, mirror of love, the key of Fame.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Bertran de Born too sings:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The beautiful spring delights me well</p>

    <p>When flowers and leaves are growing,</p>

    <p>And it pleases my heart to hear the swell</p>

    <p>Of the bird's sweet chorus flowing</p>

    <p>In the echoing wood, etc.</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg088" id="pg088">088</a></span>

  <p>The Greek lyrists up to Alexandrian times contented themselves
  with implying indirectly that nothing delighted them so much as May
  and its delights; but these singers implicitly state it. The German
  Minnesingers too<a href="#d8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> are loud in praise
  of spring, as in that anonymous song:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>I think nothing so good nor worthy of praise</p>

    <p>As a fair rose and my good man's love;</p>

    <p>The song of the little birds in the woods is clear to many a
    heart.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and summer is greeted with:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The good are glad that summer comes. See what a benefit it is to
    many hearts.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Troubadour motive is here too:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Winter and snow seem as beautiful flowers and clover to me, when
    I have embraced her.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and Kürenberg makes a lady sing:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When I stand there alone in my shift and think of thee, noble
    knight, I blush like a rose on its thorn.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Delight in summer, complaint of winter--this is the fundamental
  chord struck again and again; there is scarcely any trace of blending
  the feelings of the lover with those of Nature. It is a monotonous
  repetition of a few themes, of flowers and little birds as messengers
  of love, and lady-loves who are brighter than the sun, whose presence
  brings spring in winter or cheers a grey and snowy day.</p>

  <p>Deitmar von Eist greets spring with:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Ah! now the time of the little birds' singing is coming for us,
    the great lime is greening, the long winter is past, one sees
    well-shaped flowers spread their glory over the heath. 'Tis a joy
    to many hearts, and a comfort too to mine.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another song the birds and roses remind him of a happy past and
  of the lady of his heart. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg089" id=
  "pg089">089</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>A little bird sang on the lime o'erhead,</p>

    <p>Its song resounded through the wood</p>

    <p>And turned my heart back to another place;</p>

    <p>And once again I saw the roses blow,</p>

    <p>And they brought back the many thoughts</p>

    <p>I cherish of a lady.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A lady says to a falcon:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>You happy falcon you! You fly whither you will!</p>

    <p>And choose the tree you like in the wood.</p>

    <p>I have done the same. I chose a husband</p>

    <p>For myself, whom my eyes chose.</p>

    <p>So 'tis fitting for beautiful women.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In winter he complains:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Alas for summer delight! The birds' song has disappeared with
    the leaves of the lime. Time has changed, the nightingales are
    dumb. They have given up their sweet song and the wood has faded
    from above.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Uhland's beautiful motive in <i>Spring Faith</i>, that light and
  hope will come back to the oppressed heart with the flowers and the
  green, is given, though stiffly and dimly, by Heinrich von
  Veldegge:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I have some delightful news; the flowers are sprouting on the

  <p>The loss of the beauty of summer makes him sad:</p>

  <p>Ulrich von Guotenberg makes a pretty comparison: <span class=

  <div class="poem">
    <p>She is my summer joy, she sows flowers and clover</p>

    <p>In my heart's meadow, whence I, whate'er befall,</p>

    <p>Must teem with richer bliss: the light of her eyes</p>

    <p>Makes me bloom, as the hot sun the dripping trees....</p>

    <p>Her fair salute, her mild command</p>

    <p>Softly inclining, make May rain drop down into my heart.</p>

  <p>and longs for summer:</p>

  <blockquote>

  <p>Heinrich von Morungen:</p>

    <p>Bringing delights, a sunshine without cloud.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and says, in promising fidelity: 'My steady mind is not like the
  wind.'</p>

  <p>Reinmar says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When winter is over</p>

    <p>I saw the heath with the red flowers, delightful there....</p>

    <p>The long winter is past away; when I saw the green leaves</p>

    <p>I gave up much of my sorrow.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In a time of trouble he cried:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>To me it must always be winter.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg091" id="pg091">091</a></span> So
  we see that Troubadour references to Nature were drawn from a very
  limited area. Individual grasp of scenery was entirely lacking, it
  did not occur to them to seek Nature for her own sake. Their
  comparisons were monotonous, and their scenes bare, stereotyped
  arabesques, not woven into the tissue of lyric feeling. Their ruling
  motives were joy in spring and complaint of winter. Wood, flowers,
  clover, the bright sun, the moon (once), roses, lilies, and woodland
  birds, especially the nightingale, served them as elementary or
  landscape figures.</p>

  <p>Wilhelm Grimm says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Minnesingers talk often enough of mild May, the
    nightingale's song, the dew shining on the flowers of the heath,
    but always in relation only to their own feelings reflected in
    them. To indicate sad moods they used faded leaves, silent birds,
    seed buried in snow.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and Humboldt:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The question, whether contact with Southern Italy, or the
    Crusades in Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine, have enriched the art
    of poetry in Germany with new natural pictures, can only generally
    be answered by the negative. It is not remarked that the
    acquaintance with the East gave any new direction to the songs of
    the minstrels. The Crusaders came little into actual contact with
    the Saracens; they even lived in a state of great restraint with
    other nations who fought in the same cause. One of the oldest lyric
    poets was Friedrich of Hausen. He perished in the army of
    Barbarossa. His songs contain many views of the Crusades; but they
    chiefly express religious sentiments on the pain of being separated
    from his dear friends. He found no occasion to say anything
    concerning the country or any of those who took part in the wars,
    as Reinmar the Elder, Rubin, Neidhart, and Ulrich of Lichtenstein.
    Reinmar came a pilgrim to Syria, as it appears, in the train of
    Leopold the 6th, Duke of Austria. He complains that the
    recollections of his country always haunted him, and drew away his
    thoughts from God. The date tree has here been mentioned sometimes,
    when they speak of the palm branches which pious <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg092" id="pg092">092</a></span>pilgrims bore
    upon their shoulders. I do not remember that the splendid scenery
    in Italy has excited the fancy of the minstrels who crossed the
    Alps. Walther, who had wandered about, had only seen the river Po;
    but Friedank was at Rome. He merely remarked that grass grew in the
    palaces of those who formerly bore sway there.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As a fact, even the greatest Minnesinger, Walther, the master
  lyrist of the thirteenth century, was not ahead of his contemporaries
  in this matter. His <i>Spring Longing</i> begins:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Winter has wrought us harm everywhere,</p>

    <p>Forest and field are dreary and bare</p>

    <p>Where the sweet voices of summer once were,</p>

    <p>Yet by the road where I see maiden fair</p>

    <p>Tossing the ball, the birds' song is there.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and <i>Spring and Women</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When flowers through the grass begin to spring</p>

    <p>As though to greet with smiles the sun's bright rays,</p>

    <p>On some May morning, and in joyous measure,</p>

    <p>Small songbirds make the dewy forest ring</p>

    <p>With a sweet chorus of sweet roundelays,</p>

    <p>Hath life in all its store a purer pleasure?</p>

    <p>'Tis half a Paradise on earth.</p>

    <p>Yet ask me what I hold of equal worth,</p>

    <p>And I will tell what better still</p>

    <p>Ofttimes before hath pleased mine eyes,</p>

    <p>And, while I see it, ever will.</p>

    <p>When a noble maiden, fair and pure,</p>

    <p>With raiment rich and tresses deftly braided,</p>

    <p>Mingles, for pleasure's sake, in company,</p>

    <p>High bred, with eyes that, laughingly demure,</p>

    <p>Glance round at times and make all else seem faded,</p>

    <p>As, when the sun shines, all the stars must die.</p>

    <p>Let May bud forth in all its splendour;</p>

    <p>What sight so sweet can he engender</p>

    <p>As with this picture to compare?</p>

    <p>Unheeded leave we buds and blooms,</p>

    <p>And gaze upon the lovely fair!</p>
  </div>

  <p>The grace in this rendering of a familiar motive, and the
  individuality in the following <i>Complaint of Winter</i>, were both
  unusual at the time: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg093" id=
  "pg093">093</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Erewhile the world shone red and blue</p>

    <p>And green in wood and upland too,</p>

    <p>And birdlets sang on the bough.</p>

    <p>But now it's grown grey and lost its glow,</p>

    <p>And there's only the croak of the winter crow,</p>

    <p>Whence--many a ruffled brow!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Elsewhere he says that his lady's favour turns his winter to
  spring, and adds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Cold winter 'twas no more for me,</p>

    <p>Though others felt it bitterly;</p>

    <p>To me it was mid May.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He has many pictures of Nature and pretty comparisons, but the
  stereotyped style predominates--heath, flowers, grass, and
  nightingales. The pearl of the collection is the naive song which
  touches sensuous feeling, like the <i>Song of Solomon</i>, with the
  magic light of innocence:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Under the lime on the heath where I sat with my love,</p>

    <p>There you would find</p>

    <p>The grass and the flowers all crushed--</p>

    <p>Sweetly the nightingale sang in the vale by the wood.</p>

    <p>Tandaradei!</p>

    <p>When I came up to the meadow my lover was waiting me there.</p>

    <p>Ah! what a greeting I had! Gracious Mary, 'tis bliss to me
    still!</p>

    <p>Tandaradei! Did he kiss me, you ask? Look at the red of my
    lips!</p>

    <p>Of sweet flowers of all sorts he made us a bed,</p>

    <p>I wager who passes now smiles at the sight,</p>

    <p>The roses would still show just where my head lay.</p>

    <p>Tandaradei!</p>

    <p>But how he caressed me, that any but one</p>

    <p>Should know that, God forbid! I were shamed if they did;</p>

    <p>Only he and I know it,</p>

    <p>And one little birdie who never will tell.</p>
  </div>

  <p>So we see that interest in Nature in the literature of the
  Crusaders very seldom went beyond the utilitarian bounds of pleasure
  and admiration in fertility and pleasantness; and the German
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg094" id=
  "pg094">094</a></span>national epics rarely alluded to her traits
  even by way of comparison. The court epics shewed some advance, and
  sympathy was distinctly traceable in Gottfried, and even attained to
  artistic expression in his lyrics, where his own feelings chimed with
  Nature.</p>

  <p>For the rest, the Minnesingers' descriptions were all alike. The
  charm of Nature apart from other considerations, delight in her for
  her own sake alone, was unknown to the time.</p>

  <p>Hitherto we have only spoken of literature.</p>

  <p>Feeling for Nature reveals itself in plastic art also, especially
  in painting; and since the mind of a people is one united organism,
  the relation between poetry and painting is not one of opposition and
  mutual exclusion--they rather enlarge and explain, or condition each
  other.</p>

  <p>As concerns feeling for Nature, it may be taken as a universal
  rule that landscape-painting only develops when Nature is sought for
  her own sake, and that so long as scenery merely serves the purpose
  of ornament in literature, so long it merely serves as accessory and
  background in painting; whereas, when Nature takes a wider space in
  prose and poetry, and becomes an end of representation in herself,
  the moment for the birth of landscape-painting has come. We will
  follow the stages of the development of painting very briefly, from
  Woltmann and Woermann's excellent book,<a href=
  "#d9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> which, if it throws no fresh light upon our
  subject, illustrates what has just been said in a striking
  manner.</p>

  <p>In the first centuries <i>Anno Domini</i>, painting was wholly
  proscribed by Christendom. Its technique did not differ from that of
  antiquity; but Christendom took up an attitude of antagonism. The
  picture worship of the old religions was opposed to its very origin
  and essence, and was only gradually introduced into the Christian
  cult through heathen influences. It is a fact too, easy to explain,
  especially <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg095" id=
  "pg095">095</a></span>through its Jewish origin, that Christianity at
  first felt no need of art, and that this one-sidedness only ceased
  when the specifically Jewish element in it had died out, and
  Christendom passed to cultivated Greeks and Romans. In the cemeteries
  and catacombs of the first three centuries, we find purely decorative
  work, light vines with Cupids, but also remains of landscapes; for
  instance, in the oldest part of the cemetery of Domitilla at Rome,
  where the ceiling decoration consists of shepherds, fishers, and
  biblical scenes. The ceiling picture in St Lucina (second century)
  has apparently the Good Shepherd in the middle, and round it
  alternate pictures of Him and of the praying Madonna; whilst in the
  middle it has also charming divisions with fields, branches with
  leaves and flowers, birds, masks, and floating genii.</p>

  <p>In Byzantine painting too, the influence of antiquity was still
  visible, especially in a Psaltery with a Commentary and fourteen
  large pictures. David appears here as a shepherd; a beautiful woman's
  form, exhibiting the melody, is leaning with her left arm upon his
  shoulder; a nymph's head peeps out of the foliage; and in front we
  have Bethlehem, and the mountain god resting in a bold position under
  a rock; sheep, goats, and water are close by, and a landscape with
  classic buildings, streams, and mountains forms the background; it is
  very poetically conceived. Elsewhere, too, personifications recur, in
  which classic beauty is still visible, mixed with severe Christian
  forms.</p>

  <p>At the end of the tenth century began the Romantic period, which
  closed in the thirteenth.</p>

  <p>The brilliant progress made by architecture paved the way for the
  other arts; minds trained in its laws began to look for law in
  organic Nature too, and were no longer content with the old uncertain
  and arbitrary shapes. But as no independent feeling for Nature, in
  the widest sense of the term, existed, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg096" id="pg096">096</a></span>mediæval art treated her, not
  according to her own laws, but to those of architecture. With the
  development of the Gothic style, from the thirteenth century on, art
  became a citizen's craft, a branch of industry. Heretofore it had
  possessed but one means of expression--religious festival or
  ceremony, severely ecclesiastical. This limit was now removed. The
  artist lived a wide life, open to impressions from Nature, his
  imagination fed by poetry with new ideas and feelings, and constantly
  stimulated by the love of pleasure, which was so vehement among all
  classes that it turned every civil and ecclesiastical event to
  histrionic purposes, and even made its influence felt upon the
  clergy. The strong religious feeling which pervaded the Middle Ages
  still ruled, and even rose to greater enthusiasm, in accordance with
  the spirit of the day; but it was no longer a matter of blind
  submission of the will, but of conscious acceptance.</p>

  <p>It is true that knowledge of the external world was as yet very
  limited; the painter had not explored and mastered it, but only used
  it as a means to represent a certain realm of feeling, studying it
  just so far as this demanded. We have seen the same in the case of
  poetry. The beginnings of realistic painting were visible, although,
  as, for example, in representing animals, no individuality was
  reached.</p>

  <p>From the middle of the fourteenth century a new French school
  sprang up. The external world was more keenly and accurately studied,
  especially on its graceful side. It was only at the end of that
  period that painting felt the need to develop the background, and
  indicate actual surroundings by blue sky, hills, Gothic buildings,
  and conventional trees. These were given in linear perspective; of
  aerial perspective there was none. The earlier taste still ruled in
  initialling and border decorations; but little flowers were added by
  degrees to the thorn-leaf pattern, and birds, sometimes angels,
  introduced.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg097" id="pg097">097</a></span>
  The altar-piece at Cologne, at the end of the fourteenth century, is
  more subjective in conception, and full of lyric feeling. Poetic
  feeling came into favour, especially in Madonna pictures of purely
  idyllic character, which were painted with most charming
  surroundings. Instead of a throne and worshipping figures, Mary was
  placed sitting comfortably with the Child on flowery turf, and saints
  around her; and although the background might be golden instead of
  landscape, yet all the stems and blossoms in the grass were naturally
  and accurately treated. In a little picture in the town museum at
  Frankfort, the Madonna is seated in a rose garden under fruit trees
  gay with birds, and reading a book; a table with food and drinks
  stands close by, and a battlemented wall surrounds the garden. She is
  absorbed in contemplation; three female saints are attending to
  mundane business close by, one drawing water from a brook, another
  picking cherries, the third teaching the child Christ to play the
  zither. There is real feeling in the whole picture, and the landscape
  is worked in with distinct reference to the chief idea.</p>

  <p>Hence, although there were many isolated attempts to shew that
  realistic and individual study of Nature had begun,
  landscape-painting had not advanced beyond the position of a
  background, treated in a way more or less suited to the main subject
  of the picture; and trees, rocks, meadows, flowers, were still only
  framework, ornament, as in the poetry of the Minnesingers.<a href=

  <h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <h3>INDIVIDUALISM AND SENTIMENTAL FEELING AT THE RENAISSANCE</h3>

  <p>In a certain sense all times are transitional to those who live in
  them, since what is old is always in process of being destroyed and
  giving way to the new. But there are landmarks in the general
  development of culture, which mark off definite periods and divide
  what has been from what is beginning. Hellenism was such a landmark
  in antiquity, the Renaissance in the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>Without overlooking the differences between Greek and Italian,
  classic and modern, which are relative and not absolute, it is
  instructive to note the great likeness between these two epochs. The
  limits of their culture will stand out more clearly, if, by the aid
  of Helbig's researches and Burckhardt's masterly account of the
  Renaissance, we range the chief points of that likeness side by
  side.</p>

  <p>They were epochs in which an icy crust, which had been lying over
  human thought and feeling, melted as if before a spring breeze. It is
  true that the theory of life which now began to prevail was not
  absolutely new; the stages of growth in a nation's culture are never
  isolated; it was the result of the enlargement of various factors
  already present, and their fusion with a flood of incoming ones.</p>

  <p>The Ionic-Doric Greek kingdom widened out in Alexander's time to a
  Hellenic-Asiatic one, and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg099"
  id="pg099">099</a></span>barriers of the Romano-Germanic Middle Ages
  fell with the Crusades and the great voyages of discovery. Hellenism
  and the Renaissance brought about the transition from antiquity and
  the mediæval to the specifically modern; the Roman Empire inherited
  Hellenism, the Reformation the Renaissance. Both had their roots in
  the past, both made new growth which blossomed at a later time. In
  Hellenism, Oriental elements were mixed with the Greek; in the
  Renaissance, it was a mixture of Germanic with the native Italian
  which caused the revival of classic antiquity and new culture.
  Burckhardt says<a href="#e1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Elsewhere in Europe men deliberately and with reflection
    borrowed this or the other element of classical civilization; in
    Italy, the sympathies both of the learned and of the people were
    naturally engaged on the side of antiquity as a whole, which stood
    to them as a symbol of past greatness. The Latin language too was
    easy to an Italian, and the numerous monuments and documents in
    which the country abounded facilitated a return to the past. With
    this tendency, other elements--the popular character which time had
    now greatly modified, the political institutions imported by the
    Lombards from Germany, chivalry and northern forms of civilization,
    and the influence of religion and the Church--combined to produce
    the modern Italian spirit, which was destined to serve as the model
    and ideal for the whole western world.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The distance between the works of the Greek artists and
  poets--between Homer, Sophocles, and Phidias on the one hand, and the
  Alexandrian Theocritus and Kallimachos and the Pergamos sculptures on
  the other--is greater than lies between the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> and
  the Minnesingers, and Dante and Petrarch. In both cases one finds
  oneself in a new world of thought and feeling, where each and all
  bears the stamp of change, in matters political and social as well as
  artistic. If, for example, by the aid of Von Helbig's
  researches,<a href="#e2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> we conjure up a
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg100" id=
  "pg100">100</a></span>picture of the chief points in the history of
  Greek culture, we are astonished to see how almost every point
  recurred at the Renaissance, as described by Burckhardt.</p>

  <p>The chief mark of both epochs was individualism, the discovery of
  the individual. In Hellenism it was the barriers of race and position
  which fell; in the Renaissance, the veil, woven of mysticism and
  delusion, which had obscured mediæval faith, thought, and feeling.
  Every man recognized himself to be an independent unit of church,
  state, people, corporation--of all those bodies in which in the
  Middle Ages he had been entirely merged.</p>

  <p>Monarchical institutions arose in Hellenism; but the individual
  was no longer content to serve them only as one among many; he must
  needs develop his own powers. Private affairs began to preponderate
  over public; the very physiognomy of the race shewed an individual
  stamp.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>After the time of Alexander the Great, portrait shewed most
    marked individuality. Those of the previous period had a certain
    uniform expression; one would have looked in vain among them for
    the diversities in contemporary types shewn by comparing
    Alexander's vivid face full of stormy energy, Menander's with its
    peculiar look of irony, and the elaborate savant-physiognomy of
    Aristotle. (HELBIG.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And Burckhardt says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At the close of the thirteenth century Italy began to swarm with
    individuality; the charm laid upon human personality was dissolved,
    and a thousand figures meet us each in its own special shape and
    dress.... Despotism, as we have already seen, fostered in the
    highest degree the individuality, not only of the tyrant or
    Condottiere himself, but also of the men whom he protected or used
    as his tools--the secretary, minister, poet, or companion.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Political indifference brought about a high degree of
  cosmopolitanism, especially among those who <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg101" id="pg101">101</a></span>were banished. 'My
  country is the whole world,' said Dante; and Ghiberti: 'Only he who
  has learned everything is nowhere a stranger; robbed of his fortune
  and without friends, he is yet a citizen of every country, and can
  fearlessly despise the changes of fortune.'</p>

  <p>In both Hellenism and the Renaissance, an effort was made in art
  and science to see things as they really were. In art, detail was
  industriously cultivated; but its naturalism, especially as to
  undraped figures, was due to a sensuous refinement of gallantry and
  erotic feeling. The sensuous flourished no less in Greek times than
  in those of Boccaccio; but the most characteristic peculiarity of
  Hellenism was its intentional revelling in feeling--its
  sentimentality. There was a trace of melancholy upon many faces of
  the time, and unhappy love in endless variations was the poet's main
  theme. Petrarch's lyre was tuned to the same key; a melancholy
  delight in grief was the constant burden of his song.</p>

  <p>In Greece the sight of foreign lands had furthered the natural
  sciences, especially geography, astronomy, zoology, and botany; and
  the striving for universality at the Renaissance, which was as much a
  part of its individualism as its passion for fame, was aided by the
  widening of the physical and mental horizons through the Crusades and
  voyages of discovery. Dante was not only the greatest poet of his
  time, but an astronomer; Petrarch was geographer and cartographer,
  and, at the end of the fifteenth century, with Paolo Toscanelli,
  Lucca Baccioli, and Leonardo da Vinci, Italy was beyond all
  comparison the first nation in Europe in mathematics and natural
  science.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A significant proof of the wide-spread interest in natural
    history is found in the zeal which shewed itself at an early period
    for the collection and comparative study of plants and animals.
    Italy claims <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg102" id=
    "pg102">102</a></span>to be the first creator of botanical
    gardens.... princes and wealthy men, in laying out their pleasure
    gardens, instinctively made a point of collecting the greatest
    possible number of different plants in all their species and
    varieties. (BURCKHARDT.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Leon Battista Alberti, a man of wide theoretical knowledge as well
  as technical and artistic facility of all sorts, entered into the
  whole life around him with a sympathetic intensity that might almost
  be called nervous.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At the sight of noble trees and waving corn-fields he shed tears
    ... more than once, when he was ill, the sight of a beautiful
    landscape cured him. (BURCKHARDT.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He defined a beautiful landscape as one in which one could see in
  its different parts, sea, mountain, lake or spring, dry rocks or
  plains, wood and valley. Therefore he cared for variety; and, what is
  more striking, in contrast to level country, he admired mountains and
  rocks!</p>

  <p>In Hellenism, hunting, to which only the Macedonians had been
  addicted before, became a fashion, and was enjoyed with Oriental pomp
  in the <i>paradeisoi</i>. Writers drew most of their comparisons from
  it. In the Renaissance, Petrarch did the same, and animals often
  served as emblems of state--their condition ominous of good or
  evil--and were fostered with superstitious veneration, as, for
  example, the lions at Florence.</p>

  <p>Thus the growth of the natural sciences increased interest in the
  external world, and sensitiveness brought about a sentimental
  attitude towards Nature in Hellenism and in the Renaissance.</p>

  <p>Both discovered in Nature a source of purest pleasure; the
  Renaissance feeling was, in fact, the extension and enhancement of
  the Hellenic. Burckhardt overlooked the fact that beautiful scenery
  was appreciated and described for its own sake in Hellenism, but he
  says very justly;</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg103" id=
  "pg103">103</a></span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Italians are the first among modern peoples by whom the
    outward world was seen and felt as something beautiful.... By the
    year 1200, at the height of the Middle Ages, a genuine hearty
    enjoyment of the external world was again in existence, and found
    lively expression in the minstrelsy of different nations, which
    gives evidence of the sympathy felt with all the simple phenomena
    of Nature--spring with its flowers, the green fields and the woods.
    But these pictures are all foreground without perspective.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Among the Minnesingers there were traces of feeling for Nature;
  but only for certain stereotyped phases. Of the individuality of a
  landscape, its characteristic colour, form, and light, not a word was
  said.</p>

  <p>Even the Carmina Burana were not much ahead of the Minnesingers in
  this respect, although they deserve a closer examination.</p>

  <p>These Latin poems of wandering clerks probably belong to the
  twelfth century, and though no doubt a product in which the whole of
  Europe had a share, their best pieces must be ascribed to a French
  hand. Latin poetry lives again in them, with a freshness the
  Carlovingian Renaissance never reached; they are mediæval in form,
  but full of a frank enjoyment of life and its pleasures, which hardly
  any northerner of that day possessed. Often enough this degenerated
  into frivolity; but the stir of national awakening after the long
  sleep of the Middle Ages is felt like a spring breeze through them
  all.</p>

  <p>It is a far cry from the view of Nature we saw in the Carlovingian
  monks, to these highly-coloured verses. The dim light of churches and
  bare cell walls may have doubled the monks' appreciation of blue
  skies and open-air life; but they were fettered by the constant fight
  with the senses; Nature to them must needs be less a work of God for
  man's delight, than a dangerous means of seduction. 'They wandered
  through Nature with timid misgiving, and their anxious fantasy
  depicted <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg104" id=
  "pg104">104</a></span>forms of terror or marvellous rescues.<a href=
  "#e3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The idyllic pleasure in the simple charms of
  Nature, especially in the monastery garden of the Carlovingian time,
  contrasts strikingly with the tone of these very mundane <i>vagantes
  clerici</i>, for whom Nature had not only long been absorbed and
  freed from all demoniac influence, but peopled by the charming forms
  of the old mythic poems, and made for the joy and profit of men, in
  the widest and naivest sense of the words.</p>

  <p>Spring songs, as with the Minnesingers, take up most of the space;
  but the theme is treated with greater variety. Enjoyment of life and
  Nature breathes through them all.</p>

  <p>One runs thus:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Spring cometh, and the earth is decked and studded with vernal
    flowers. The harmony of the birds' returning song rouses the heart
    to be glad. It is the time of joy.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Songs 98 to 118 rejoice that winter is gone; for instance:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Now in the mild springtime Flora opens the lap which the cold
    frost had locked in cruel time of winter; the zephyr with gentle
    murmur cometh with the spring; the grove is clad in leaves. The
    nightingale is singing, the fields are gay with divers hues. It is
    sweet to walk in the wooded glens, it is sweeter to pluck the lily
    with the rose, it is sweetest of all to sport with a lovely
    maiden.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Another makes a similar confession, for Nature and amorous passion
  are the two strings of these lyres:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Beneath the pleasant foliage of a tree 'tis sweet to rest, while
    the nightingale sings her plaintive song; sweeter still, to sport
    in the grass with a fair maiden.... O, to what changeful moods is
    the heart of the lover prone! As the vessel that wanders o'er the
    waves without an anchor, so doth Love's uncertain warfare toss
    'twixt fear and hope.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg105" id="pg105">105</a></span>
  The beauties of Nature are drawn upon to describe the fair maiden;
  her eyes are compared to stars, her colour to lilies and snow, her
  mouth to a rose, her kiss 'doth rend in sunder all the clouds of
  care.'</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In the flowery season I sat beneath a shady tree while the birds
    sang in the groves ... and listened to my Thisbe's talk, the talk I
    love and long for; and we spoke of the sweet interchange of love,
    and in the doubtful balance of the mind wanton love and chastity
    were wavering.</p>

    <p>I have seen the bright green of flowers, I have seen the flower
    of flowers, I have seen the rose of May; I have seen the star that
    is brighter than all other, that is glorious and fair above all
    other, through whom may I ever spend my life in love.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On such a theme the poet rings endless changes. The most charming
  is the poem <i>Phyllis and Flora</i>. Actual landscape is not given,
  but details are treated with freshness and care:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In the flowery season of the year, under a sky serene, while the
    earth's lap was painted with many colours, when the messenger of
    Aurora had put to flight the stars, sleep left the eyes of Phyllis
    and of Flora, two maidens whose beauty answered to the morning
    light. The breeze of spring was gently whispering, the place was
    green and gay with grass, and in the grass itself there flowed a
    living brook that played and babbled as it went. And that the sun's
    heat might not harm the maidens, near the stream there was a
    spreading pine, decked with leaves and spreading far its
    interweaving branches, nor could the heat penetrate from without.
    The maidens sat, the grass supplied the seat.... They intend to go
    to Love's Paradise: at the entrance of the grove a rivulet murmurs;
    the breeze is fragrant with myrrh and balsam; they hear the music
    of a hundred timbrels and lutes. All the notes of the birds resound
    in all their fulness; they hear the sweet and pleasant song of the
    blackbird, the garrulous lark, the turtle and the nightingale,
    etc.... He who stayed there would become immortal; every tree there
    rejoices in its own fruit; the ways are scented with myrrh and
    cinnamon and amomum; the master could be forced out of his
    house.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg106" id="pg106">106</a></span>
  The first to shew proof of a deepening effect of Nature on the human
  spirit was Dante.</p>

  <p>Dante and Petrarch elaborated the Hellenistic feeling for Nature;
  hence the further course of the Renaissance displayed all its
  elements, but with increased subjectivity and individuality.</p>

  <p>No one, since the days of Hellenism, had climbed mountains for the
  sake of the view--Dante was the first to do it. And although, in
  ranging heaven, earth, hell, and paradise in the <i>Divina
  Commedia</i>, he rarely described real Nature, and then mostly in
  comparisons; yet, as Humboldt pointed out, how incomparably in a few
  vigorous lines he wakens the sense of the morning airs and the light
  on the distant sea in the first canto of Purgatorio:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour,</p>

    <p>Which fled before it,-so that from afar</p>

    <p>I recognized the trembling of the sea.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And how vivid this is:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">The air</p>

      <p>Impregnate changed to water. Fell the rain:</p>

      <p>And to the fosses came all that the land</p>

      <p>Contain'd not, and, as mightiest streams are wont,</p>

      <p>To the great river with such headlong sweep</p>

      <p>Rush'd, that naught stayed its course.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade</p>

      <p>With lively greenness the new-springing day</p>

      <p>Attempered, eager now to roam and search</p>

      <p>Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank;</p>

      <p>Along the champaign leisurely my way</p>

      <p>Pursuing, o'er the ground that on all sides</p>

      <p>Delicious odour breathed. A pleasant air,</p>

      <p>That intermitted never, never veered,</p>

      <p>Smote on my temples gently, as a wind</p>

      <p>Of softest influence, at which the sprays,</p>

      <p>Obedient all, lean'd trembling to that part</p>

      <p>Where first the holy mountain casts his shade;</p>

      <p>Yet were not so disordered; but that still</p>

      <p>Upon their top the feather'd quiristers</p>

      <p>Applied their wonted art, and with full joy</p>

      <p>Welcomed those hours of prime, and warbled shrill</p>

      <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg107" id=
      "pg107">107</a></span>Amid the leaves, that to their jocund
      lays</p>

      <p>Kept tenour; even as from branch to branch</p>

      <p>Along the piny forests on the shore</p>

      <p>Of Chiassi rolls the gathering melody,</p>

      <p>When Eolus hath from his cavern loosed</p>

      <p>The dripping south. Already had my steps,</p>

      <p>Tho' slow, so far into that ancient wood</p>

      <p>Transported me, I could not ken the place</p>

      <p>Where I had enter'd; when behold! my path</p>

      <p>Was bounded by a rill, which to the left</p>

      <p>With little rippling waters bent the grass</p>

      <p>That issued from its brink.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and this of the heavenly Paradise:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i10">I looked,</p>

    <p>And, in the likeness of a river, saw</p>

    <p>Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves</p>

    <p>Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on</p>

    <p>'Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,</p>

    <p>Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,</p>

    <p>There, ever and anon outstarting, flew</p>

    <p>Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flowers</p>

    <p>Did set them, like to rubies chased in gold;</p>

    <p>Then, as if drunk with odours, plunged again</p>

    <p>Into the wondrous flood, from which, as one</p>

    <p>Re-entered, still another rose.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His numerous comparisons conjure up whole scenes, perfect in truth
  to Nature, and shewing a keen and widely ranging eye. For
  example:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">Bellowing, there groaned</p>

    <p>A noise, as of a sea in tempest torn</p>

    <p>By warring winds.</p>

    <p>O'er better waves to steer her rapid course</p>

    <p>The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,</p>

    <p>Well pleased to leave so cruel sea behind.</p>

    <p class="i14">(Purgatorio.)</p>

    <p>All ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,</p>

    <p>Eager to listen on the adventurous track</p>

    <p>Of my proud keel, that singing cuts her way.</p>

    <p class="i14">(Paradiso.)</p>

    <p>As sails full spread and bellying with the wind</p>

    <p class="i14">(Inferno.)</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg108" id=

    <p class="i8">As, near upon the hour of dawn,</p>

    <p>Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam</p>

    <p>Glares down in west, over the ocean floor.</p>

    <p class="i14">(Purgatorio.)</p>

    <p class="i8">As 'fore the sun</p>

    <p>And now there came o'er the perturbed waves,</p>

    <p>Loud crashing, terrible, a sound that made</p>

    <p>Either shore tremble, as if of a wind</p>

    <p>Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,</p>

    <p>That, 'gainst some forest driving all his might,</p>

    <p>Plucks off the branches, beats them down, and hurls</p>

    <p>Afar; then, onward pressing, proudly sweeps</p>

    <p>His whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.</p>

    <p class="i14">(Inferno.)</p>

    <p>As florets, by the frosty air of night</p>

    <p>Bent down and closed, when day has blanch'd their leaves</p>

    <p class="i14">(Inferno.)</p>

    <p class="i4">As fall off the light autumnal leaves,</p>

  </div>

  <p>Bees, dolphins, rays of sunlight, snow, starlings, doves, frogs, a
  bull, falcons, fishes, larks, and rooks are all used, generally with
  characteristic touches of detail.</p>

  <p>Specially tender is this:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>E'en as the bird, who 'mid the leafy bower</p>

      <p>With her sweet brood; impatient to descry</p>

      <p>Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,</p>

      <p>In the fond quest, unconscious of her toil; <span class=

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>She, of the time prevenient, on the spray</p>

      <p>That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze</p>

      <p>Expects the sun, nor, ever, till the dawn</p>

      <p>Removeth from the east her eager ken,</p>

      <p>So stood the dame erect.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The most important forward step was made by Petrarch, and it is
  strange that this escaped Humboldt in his famous sketch in the second
  volume of <i>Cosmos</i>, as well as his commentator Schaller, and
  Friedlander.</p>

  <p>For when we turn from Hellenism to Petrarch, it does not seem as
  if many centuries lay between; but rather as if notes first struck in
  the one had just blended into distinct harmony in the other.</p>

  <p>The modern spirit arose from a union of the genius of the Italian
  people of the thirteenth century with antiquity, and the feeling for
  Nature had a share in the wider culture, both as to sentimentality
  and grasp of scenery. Classic and modern joined hands in Petrarch.
  Many Hellenic motives handed on by Roman poets reappear in his
  poetry, but always with that something in addition of which antiquity
  shewed but a trace--the modern subjectivity and individuality. It was
  the change from early bud to full blossom. He was one of the first to
  deserve the name of modern--modern, that is, in his whole feeling and
  mode of thought, in his sentimentality and his melancholy, and in the
  fact that 'more than most before and after him, he tried to know
  himself and to hand on to others what he knew.' (Geiger.) It is an
  appropriate remark of Hettner's, that the phrase, 'he has discovered
  his heart,' might serve as a motto for Petrarch's songs and sonnets.
  He knew that he had that sentimental disorder which he called
  'acedia,' and wished to be rid of it. This word has a history of its
  own. To the Greeks, to Apollonius, for instance,<a href=
  "#e4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> it meant carelessness, indifference; and,
  joined with the genitive [Greek: nooio]--that is, of the mind--it
  meant, according to the scholiasts, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg110" id="pg110">110</a></span>as much as [Greek: lypê]
  (Betrübnis)--that is, distress or grief. In the Middle Ages it became
  'dislike of intellect so far as that is a divine gift'--that disease
  of the cloister which a monkish chronicler defined as 'a sadness or
  loathing and an immoderate distress of mind, caused by mental
  confusion, through which happiness of mind was destroyed, and the
  mind thrown back upon itself as from an abyss of despair.'</p>

  <p>To Dante it meant the state--</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i14">Sad</p>

    <p>In the sweet air, made gladsome by the sun,</p>
  </div>

  <p>distaste for the good and beautiful.</p>

  <p>The modern meaning which it took with Petrarch is well defined by
  Geiger as being neither ecclesiastic nor secular sin,<a href=
  "#e5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> but</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Entirely human and peculiar to the cleverest--the battle between
    reality and seeming, the attempt to people the arid wastes of the
    commonplace with philosophic thought--the unhappiness and despair
    that arise from comparing the unconcern of the majority with one's
    own painful unrest, from the knowledge that the results of striving
    do not express the effort made--that human life is but a ceaseless
    and unworthy rotation, in which the bad are always to the fore, and
    the good fall behind ... as pessimism, melancholy, world pain
    (Weltschmerz)--that tormenting feeling which mocks all attempt at
    definition, and is too vitally connected with erring and striving
    human nature to be curable--that longing at once for human
    fellowship and solitude, for active work and a life of
    contemplation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Petrarch knew too the pleasure of sadness, what Goethe called
  'Wonne der Wehmuth,' the <i>dolendi voluptas.</i></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Lo, what new pleasure human wits devise!</p>

    <p>For oftentimes one loves</p>

    <p>Whatever new thing moves</p>

    <p>The sighs, that will in closest order go;</p>

    <p>And I'm of those whom sorrowing behoves;</p>

    <p>And that with some success</p>

    <p>I labour, you may guess,</p>

    <p>When eyes with tears, and heart is brimmed with woe.</p>

      <p>Nor can I yet repent,</p>

      <p>Earth can no weal, to match my woes, impart.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>His poems are full of scenes and comparisons from Nature; for the
  sympathy for her which goes with this modern and sentimental tone is
  a deep one:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>In that sweet season of my age's prime</p>

      <p>Which saw the sprout and, as it were, green blade</p>

      <p>Of the wild passion....</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10">Changed me</p>

      <p>Array by winter's cold no leaf can lose.</p>

      <p class="i14">(Ode 1.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Love is that by which</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>My darknesses were made as bright</p>

    <p>As clearest noonday light. (Ode 4.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Elsewhere it is the light of heaven breaking in his heart, and
  springtime which brings the flowers.</p>

  <p>In Sonnet 44 he plays with impossibilities, like the Greek and
  Roman poets:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Ah me! the sea will have no waves, the snow</p>

    <p>Will warm and darken, fish on Alps will dwell,</p>

    <p>And suns droop yonder, where from common cell</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg112" id=
    "pg112">112</a></span></p>

    <p>The springs of Tigris and Euphrates flow,</p>

    <p>Or ever I shall here have truce or peace</p>

    <p>Or love....</p>
  </div>

  <p>and uses the same comparisons, Sestina 7:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>So many creatures throng not ocean's wave,</p>

    <p>So many, above the circle of the moon,</p>

    <p>Of stars were never yet beheld by night;</p>

    <p>So many birds reside not in the groves;</p>

    <p>So many herbs hath neither field nor shore,</p>

    <p>But my heart's thoughts outnumber them each eve.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Many of his poems witness to the truth that the love-passion is
  the best interpreter of Nature, especially in its woes. The woes of
  love are his constant theme, and far more eloquently expressed than
  its bliss:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>So fair I have not seen the sun arise,</p>

      <p>When heaven was clearest of all cloudy stain--</p>

      <p>The welkin-bow I have not after rain</p>

      <p>Seen varied with so many shifting dyes,</p>

      <p>But that her aspect in more splendid guise</p>

      <p>Upon the day when I took up Love's chain</p>

      <p>Diversely glowed, for nothing mortal vies</p>

      <p>Therewith.... (Sonnet 112.)</p>

    <div class="stanza">

      <p>Would from aught else choose warmth or guidance lent.</p>

      <p>Oh, 'tis miraculous, when on the grass</p>

      <p>She sits, a very flower, or when she lays</p>

      <p>Of eerie shadowy woods I never took,</p>

      <p>Though too much tow'r'd my sun they intervene.</p>

      <p class="i14">(Sonnet 143.)</p>

  </div>

  <p>and like Goethe's:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I think of thee when the bright sunlight shimmers</p>

      <p>Across the sea;</p>

      <p>When the clear fountain in the moonbeam glimmers</p>

      <p>I think of thee....</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>I hear thee, when the tossing waves' low rumbling</p>

      <p>When all is still....</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So Petrarch sings in Ode 15:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Now therefore, when in youthful guise I see</p>

    <p>The world attire itself in soft green hue,</p>

    <p>I think that in this age unripe I view</p>

    <p>That lovely girl, who's now a lady's mien.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg114" id=
    "pg114">114</a></span>Then, when the sun ariseth all aglow,</p>

    <p>I trace the wonted show</p>

    <p>Of amorous fire, in some fine heart made queen...</p>

    <p>When leaves or boughs or violets on earth</p>

    <p>I see, what time the winter's cold decays,</p>

    <p>And when the kindly stars are gathering might,</p>

    <p>Mine eye that violet and green portrays</p>

    <p>(And nothing else) which, at my warfare's birth,</p>

    <p>Armed Love so well that yet he worsts me quite.</p>

    <p>I see the delicate fine tissue light</p>

    <p>In which our little damsel's limbs are dressed....</p>

    <p>Oft on the hills a feeble snow-streak lies,</p>

    <p>Which the sun smiteth in sequestered place.</p>

    <p>Let sun rule snow! Thou, Love, my ruler art,</p>

    <p>When on that fair and more than human face</p>

    <p>I muse, which from afar makes soft my eyes....</p>

    <p>I never yet saw after mighty rain</p>

    <p>The roving stars in the calm welkin glide</p>

    <p>And glitter back between the frost and dew,</p>

    <p>But straight those lovely eyes are at my side....</p>

    <p>If ever yet, on roses white and red,</p>

    <p>My eyes have fallen, where in bowl of gold</p>

    <p>They were set down, fresh culled by virgin hands,</p>

    <p>There have I seemed her aspect to behold....</p>

    <p>But when the year has flecked</p>

    <p>Some deal with white and yellow flowers the braes,</p>

    <p>I forthwith recollect</p>

    <p>That day and place in which I first admired</p>

    <p>Laura's gold hair outspread, and straight was fired....</p>

    <p>That I could number all the stars anon</p>

    <p>And shut the waters in a tiny glass</p>

    <p>Belike I thought, when in this narrow sheet</p>

    <p>I got a fancy to record, alas,</p>

    <p>How many ways this Beauty's paragon</p>

    <p>Hath spread her light, while standing self-complete,</p>

    <p>So that from her I never could retreat....</p>

    <p>She's closed for me all paths in earth and sky.</p>

  loquacity. He was yet more eloquent and intense, more fertile in
  comparisons, when his happiest days were over.</p>

  <p>Here we have happiness and misery felt in the modern way, and
  Nature in the modern way drawn into the circle of thought and

  <p>Petrarch was the first, since the days of Hellenism, to enjoy the
  pleasures of solitude quite consciously.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>How often to my darling place of rest,</p>

    <p>Fleeing from all, could I myself but flee,</p>

      rill</p>

      <p>Or shady glen, between two slopes outspread,</p>

      <p>I find--my daunted soul doth there repose....</p>

      <p>On mountain heights, in briary woods, I find</p>

      <p>Some rest; but every dwelling place on earth</p>

      <p>Appeareth to my eyes a deadly bane....</p>

      <p>Where some tall pine or hillock spreads a shade,</p>

      <p>I sometimes halt, and on the nearest brink</p>

      <p>Her lovely face I picture from my mind....</p>

      <p>Oft hath her living likeness met my sight, (Oh who'll believe
      the word?) in waters clear,</p>

      <p>On beechen stems, on some green lawny space,</p>

      <p>Or in white cloud....</p>

      <p>I then sit down, on living rock, dead stone,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Love of solitude and feeling for Nature limit or increase each
  other; and Petrarch; like Dante, took scientific interest in her, and
  found her a stimulant to mental work.</p>

  <p>Burckhardt says: 'The enjoyment of Nature is for him the favourite
  accompaniment of intellectual <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg118"
  id="pg118">118</a></span>pursuits; it was to combine the two that he
  lived in learned retirement at Vaucluse and elsewhere, that he from
  time to time fled from the world and from his age.'</p>

  <p>He wrote a book <i>On a Life of Solitude (De Vita Solitaria)</i>
  by the little river Sorgue, and said in a letter from Vaucluse: 'O if
  you could imagine the delight with which I breathe here, free and far
  from the world, with forests and mountains, rivers and springs, and
  the books of clever men.'</p>

  <p>Purely objective descriptions, such as his picture of the Gulf of
  Spezzia and Porto Venere at the end of the sixth book of the
  <i>Africa</i>, were rare with him; but, as we have already seen, he
  admired mountain scenery. He refers to the hills on the Riviera di
  Levante as 'hills distinguished by most pleasant wildness and
  wonderful fertility.'<a href="#e6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The scenery of Reggio moved him, as he said,<a href=
  "#e7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> to compose a poem. He described the storm at
  Naples in 1343, and the earthquake at Basle. As we have seen from one
  of his odes, he delighted in the wide view from mountain heights, and
  the freedom from the oppression of the air lower down. In this
  respect he was one of Rousseau's forerunners, though his 'romantic'
  feeling was restrained within characteristic limits. In a letter of
  April 26, 1335, interesting both as to the period and the personality
  of the writer, he described to Dionisius da Borgo San Sepolchro the
  ascent of Mt. Ventoux near Avignon which he made when he was
  thirty-two, and greatly enjoyed, though those who were with him did
  not understand his enjoyment. When they had laboured through the
  difficulties of the climb, and saw the clouds below them, he was
  immensely impressed. It was in accordance with his love of solitude
  that lonely mountain tops should attract him, and the letter shows
  that he fully appreciated both climb and view.</p>

  <p>'It was a long day, the air fine. We enjoyed the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg119" id="pg119">119</a></span>advantages of
  vigour of mind, and strength and agility of body, and everything else
  essential to those engaged in such an undertaking, and so had no
  other difficulties to face than those of the region itself.' ... 'At
  first, owing to the unaccustomed quality of the air and the effect of
  the great sweep of view spread out before me, I stood like one dazed.
  I beheld the clouds under our feet, and what I had read of Athos and
  Olympus seemed less incredible as I myself witnessed the same things
  from a mountain of less fame. I turned my eyes towards Italy, whither
  my heart most inclined. The Alps, rugged and snow-capped, seemed to
  rise close by, although they were really at a great distance.... The
  Bay of Marseilles, the Rhone itself, lay in sight.'</p>

  <p>It was a very modern effect of the wide view that 'his whole past
  life with all its follies rose before his mind; he remembered that
  ten years ago, that day, he had quitted Bologna a young man, and
  turned a longing gaze towards his native country: he opened a book
  which was then his constant companion, <i>The Confessions of St
  Augustine</i>, and his eye fell on the passage in the tenth
  chapter:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>And men go about and admire lofty mountains and broad seas, and
    roaring torrents and the ocean, and the course of the stars, and
    forget their own selves while doing so.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>His brother, to whom he read these words, could not understand why
  he closed the book and said no more. His feeling had suddenly
  changed.</p>

  <p>He knew, when he began the climb, that he was doing something very
  unusual, even unheard of among his contemporaries, and justified
  himself by the example of Philip V. of Macedon, arguing that a young
  man of private station might surely be excused for what was not
  thought blamable in a grey-haired king. Then on the mountain top,
  lost in the view, the passage in St Augustine suddenly occurred to
  him, and he started blaming himself <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg120" id="pg120">120</a></span>for admiring earthly things so much.
  'I was amazed ... angry with myself for marvelling but now at earthly
  things, when I ought to have learnt long ago that nothing save the
  soul was marvellous, and that to the greatness of the soul nought
  else was great'; and he closed with an explanation flavoured with
  theology to the taste of his confessor, to whom he was writing. The
  mixture of thoroughly modern delight in Nature<a href=
  "#e8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> with ascetic dogma in this letter, gives us
  a glimpse into the divided feelings of one who stood upon the
  threshold between two eras, mediæval and modern, into the reaction of
  the mediæval mind against the budding modern feeling.</p>

  <p>This is, at any rate, the first mountain ascent for pleasure since
  Hellenic days, of which we have detailed information. From Greece
  before Alexander we have nothing; but the Persian King Darius, in his
  expedition against the Scythians in the region of Chalcedon, ascended
  the mountain on which stood the Urios temple to Zeus, and there
  'sitting in the temple, he took a view of the Euxine Sea, which is
  worthy of admiration.' (Herodotus.)</p>

  <p>Philip V. of Macedon ascended the Hæmus B.C. 181, and Apollonios
  Rhodios describes the panorama spread out before the Argonauts as
  they ascended the Dindymon, and elsewhere recalls the view from Mt.
  Olympus. These are the oldest descriptions of distant views conceived
  as landscape in the classic literature preserved to us. Petrarch's
  ascent comes next in order.</p>

  <p>This sentimental and subjective feeling for Nature, half-idyllic,
  half-romantic, which seemed to arise suddenly and spontaneously in
  Petrarch, is not to be wholly explained by a marked individuality,
  nourished by the tendencies of the period; the influence of Roman
  literature, the re-birth of the classic, must also be taken into
  account. For the Renaissance attitude towards Nature was closely
  allied to <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg121" id=
  "pg121">121</a></span>the Roman, and therefore to the Hellenic; and
  the fact that the first modern man arose on Italian soil was due to
  the revival of antiquity plus its union with the genius of the
  Italian people. Many direct analogies can be traced between Petrarch
  and the Roman poets; it was in their school that his eyes opened to
  the wonders of Nature, and he learnt to blend the inner with the
  outer life.</p>

  <p>Boccaccio does not lead us much further. There is idyllic quality
  in his description of a wood in the <i>Ameto</i>,<a href=
  "#e9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and especially in <i>Fiammetta</i>, in which
  he praises country life and describes the spring games of the
  Florentine youth.</p>

  <p>This is the description of a valley in the <i>Decameron</i>:
  'After a walk of nearly a mile, they came to the Ladies' Valley,
  which they entered by a straight path, whence there issued forth a
  fine crystal current, and they found it so extremely beautiful and
  pleasant, especially at that sultry season, that nothing could exceed
  it, and, as some of them told me afterwards, the plain in the valley
  was so exact a circle, as if it had been described by a pair of
  compasses, though it seemed rather the work of Nature than of art,
  and was about half a mile in circumference, surrounded by six hills
  of moderate height, on each of which was a palace built in the form
  of a little castle.... The part that looks toward the south was
  planted as thick as they could stand together with vines, olives,
  almonds, cherries, figs, and most other kinds of fruit trees, and on
  the northern side were fine plantations of oak, ash, etc., so tall
  and regular that nothing could be more beautiful. The vale, which had
  only that one entrance, was full of firs, cypress trees, laurels, and
  pines, all placed in such order as if it had been done by the
  direction of some exquisite artist, and through which little or no
  sun could penetrate to the ground, which was covered with a thousand
  different flowers.... But what gave no less delight than any of the
  rest was a <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg122" id=
  "pg122">122</a></span>rivulet that came through a valley which
  divided two of the mountains, and running through the vein of a rock,
  made a most agreeable murmur with its fall, appealing, as it was
  dashed and sprinkled into drops, like so much quicksilver.'</p>

  <p>Description of scenery for its own sake is scarcely more than
  attempted here, nor do Petrarch's lyrics, with their free thought of
  passion and overpowering consciousness of the joys and sorrows of
  love, reach the level of Hellenism in this respect. Yet it advanced
  with the Renaissance. Pope Pius II. (Æneas Sylvius) was the first to
  describe actual landscape (Italian), not merely in a few subjective
  lines, but with genuine modern enjoyment. He was one of those figures
  in the world's history in whom all the intellectual life and feeling
  of a time come to a focus.</p>

  <p>He had a heart for everything, and an all-round enthusiasm for
  Nature unique in his day. Antiquity and Nature were his two passions,
  and the most beautiful descriptions of Nature before Rousseau and
  Goethe are contained in his <i>Commentaries</i>.</p>

  <p>Writing of the country round his home, he says:</p>

  <p>'The sweet spring time had begun, and round about Siena the
  smiling hills were clothed with leaves and flowers, and the crops
  were rising in plenty in the fields. Even the pasture land quite
  close to the town affords an unspeakably lovely view; gently sloping
  hills, either planted with homely trees or vines, or ploughed for
  corn, look down on pleasant valleys in which grow crops, or green
  fields are to be seen, and brooks are even flowing. There are, too,
  many plantations, either natural or artificial, in which the birds
  sing with wondrous sweetness. Nor is there a mound on which the
  citizens have not built a magnificent estate; they are thus a little
  way out of the town. Through this district the Pope walked with
  joyous head.'</p>

  <p>Again and again love of Nature drew him away <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg123" id="pg123">123</a></span>even in old age
  from town life and the circle of courtiers and flatterers; he was for
  ever finding new reasons to prolong his <i>villeggiatura</i>, despite
  the grumbling of his court, which had to put up with wretched inns or
  monasteries overrun by mice, where the rain came through the roofs
  and the necessaries of life were scanty.<a href=
  "#e10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>His taste for these beautifully-situated monastic solitudes was a
  riddle to those around him. He wrote of his summer residence in
  Tibur:</p>

  <p>'On all sides round the town in summer there are most lovely
  plantations, to which the Pope with his cardinals often retired for
  relaxation, sitting sometimes on some green sward beneath the olives,
  sometimes in a green meadow on the bank of the river Aino, whence he
  could see the clear waters. There are some meadows in a retired glen,
  watered by many streams; Pius often rested in these meadows near the
  luxuriant streams and the shady trees. He lived at Tibur with the
  Minorites on an elevation whence he could see the town and the course
  of the Aino as it flowed into the plain beneath him and through the
  quiet gardens, nor did anything else give him pleasure.</p>

  <p>'When the summer was over, he had his bedroom in the house
  overlooking the Aino; from there the most beautiful view was to be
  seen, and also from a neighbouring mountain on the other side of the
  river, still covered with a green and leafy grove ... he completed a
  great part of his journey with the greatest enjoyment.'</p>

  <p>In May 1462 he went to the baths at Viterbo, and, old man as he
  was, gives this appreciative description of spring beauties by the
  way:</p>

  <p>'The road by which he made for Sorianum was at that time of the
  year delightful; there was a tremendous quantity of genista, so that
  a great part of the field seemed a mass of flowering yellow, while
  the rest, covered as it was by shrubs and various <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg124" id="pg124">124</a></span>grasses, brought
  purple and white and a thousand different colours before the eyes. It
  was the month of May, and everything was green. On one side were the
  smiling fields, on the other the smiling woods, in which the birds
  made sweet harmony. At early dawn he used to walk into the fields to
  catch the exquisite breeze before the day should grow hot, and gaze
  at the green crops and the flowering flax, which then, emulating
  heaven's own blue, gave the greatest joy to all beholders.... Now the
  crows are holding vigil, and the ringdoves; and the owl at times
  utters lament with funeral note. The place is most lovely; the view
  in the direction of Siena stretches as far as Amiata, and in the west
  reaches Mt. Argentarius.'</p>

  <p>In the plains the plague was raging; the sight of the people
  appealing to him as to a god, moved him to tears as he thought how
  few of the children would survive in the heat. He travelled to a
  castle charmingly placed on the lake of Bolsena, where 'there is a
  shady circular walk in the vineyard under the big grapes; stone steps
  shaded by the vine leaves lead down to the bank, where ilex oaks,
  alive with the songs of blackbirds, stand among the crags.' Halfway
  up the mountain, in the monastery of San Salvatore, he and his court
  took up their quarters.</p>

  <p>'The most lovely scenery met the eye. As you look to the west from
  the higher houses, the view reaches beyond Ilcinum and Siena as far
  as the Pistorian Alps. To the north a variety of hills and the
  pleasant green of woods presents itself, stretching a distance of
  five miles; if your sight is good, your eye will travel as far as the
  Apennine range and can see Cortona.'</p>

  <p>There he passed the time, shooting birds, fishing, and rowing.</p>

  <p>'In the cool air of the hills, among the old oaks and chestnuts,
  on the green meadows where there were no thorns to wound the feet,
  and no snakes <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg125" id=
  "pg125">125</a></span>or insects to hurt or annoy, the Pope passed
  days of unclouded happiness.'</p>

  <p>This is thoroughly modern: 'Silvarum amator,' as he calls himself,
  he includes both the details of the near and the general effect of
  the far-distant landscape.</p>

  <p>And with age his appreciation of it only seemed to increase; for
  instance, he says of Todi:</p>

  <p>'A most lovely view meets the eye wherever you turn; you can see
  Perusia and all the valley that lies between, full of wide--spreading
  forts and fertile fields, and honoured by the river Tiber, which,
  drawing its coils along like a snake, divides Tuscia from Umbria,
  and, close to the city itself, enters many a mountain, passing
  through which it descends to the plain, murmuring as it goes, as
  though constrained against its will.'</p>

  <p>This is his description of a lake storm, during an excursion to
  the Albanian Mountains:</p>

  <p>As far as Ostia 'he had a delightful voyage; at night the sea
  began to be most unwontedly troubled, and a severe storm arose. The
  east wind rolled up the waters from their lowest depths, huge waves
  beat the shore; you could have heard the sea, as it were, groaning
  and wailing. So great was the force of the winds, that nothing seemed
  able to resist it; they raged and alternately fled and put one
  another to rout, they overturned woods and anything that withstood
  them. The air glittered with frequent lightning, the sky thundered,
  and terrific thunder-bolts fell from the clouds.... The night was
  pitch dark, though the flashes of lightning were continuous.'</p>

  <p>And of a lake at rest he says:</p>

  <p>'The beauty of that lake is remarkable; everywhere it is
  surrounded by high rocks, the water is transparently clear. Nature,
  so far superior to art, provided a most pleasant journey. The
  Nemorian lake, with its crystal-clear waters, reflects the faces
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg126" id="pg126">126</a></span>of
  those that look into it, and fills a deep basin. The descent from the
  top to the bottom is wooded. The poetic genius would never be
  awakened if it slept here; you would say it was the dwelling-place of
  the Muses, the home of the Nymphs, and, if there is any truth in
  legends, the hiding-place of Diana.'</p>

  <p>He visited the lakes among the mountains, climbing and resting
  under the trees; the view from Monte Cavo was his favourite, from
  which he could see Terracina, the lakes of Nemi and Albano, etc. He
  noted their extent and formation, and added:</p>

  <p>'The genista, however, was especially delightful, covering, as it
  did with its flowers, the greater part of the plains. Then, moreover,
  Rome presented itself fully to the eyes, together with Soracte and
  the Sabine Land, and the Apennine range white with snow, and Tibur
  and Præneste.'</p>

  <p>It is clear that it was a thoroughly modern enthusiasm which
  attracted Æneas Sylvius to the country and gave him this ready pen
  for everything in Nature--everything, that is, except bare mountain
  summits.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to attribute this faculty for enjoying and
  describing scenery to the influence of antiquity alone, for, save the
  younger Pliny, I know of no Roman under the Empire who possessed it,
  and, besides, we do not know how far Pius II. was acquainted with
  Roman literature. We know that the re-awakening of classic literature
  exerted an influence upon the direction of the feeling for Nature in
  general, and, for the rest, very various elements coalesced. Like
  times produce like streams of tendency, and Hellenism, the Roman
  Empire, and the Renaissance were alike to some extent in the
  conditions of their existence and the results that flowed from them;
  the causal nexus between them is undeniable, and makes them the chief
  stepping-stones on the way to the modern.</p>

  <p>Theocritus, Meleager, Petrarch, and Æneas Sylvius <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg127" id="pg127">127</a></span>may serve as
  representatives of the development of the feeling for Nature from
  classic to modern; they are the ancestors of our enthusiasm, the
  links in the chain which leads up to Rousseau, Goethe, Byron, and
  Shelley.</p>

  <p>From the autobiography of Æneas Sylvius and the lyrics of Petrarch
  we gain a far truer picture of the feeling of the period up to the
  sixteenth century than from any poetry in other countries. Even the
  epic had a more modern tone in Italy; Ariosto's descriptions were far
  ahead of any German epic.</p>

  <p>Humboldt pointed out very clearly the difference between the epic
  of the people and the epic of art--between Homer and Ariosto. Both,
  he said, are true painters of the world and Nature; but Ariosto
  pleases more by his brilliance and wealth of colour, Homer by purity
  of form and beauty of composition. Ariosto achieves through general
  effect, Homer through perfection of form. Nature is more naive in
  Homer, the subject is paramount, and the singer disappears; in
  Ariosto, Nature is sentimental, and the poet always remains in view
  upon the stage. In Homer all is closely knit, while Ariosto's threads
  are loosely spun, and he breaks them himself in play. Homer almost
  never describes, Ariosto always does.</p>

  <p>Ariosto's scenes and comparisons from Nature, being calculated for
  effect, are more subjective, and far more highly-coloured than
  Homer's. But they shew a sympathetic grasp.</p>

  <p>The modern bloom, so difficult to define, lies over
  them--something at once sensuous, sentimental, and chivalrous. He is
  given to describing lonely woodland scenery, fit places for trysts
  and lovers' rendezvous.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>With flowery thorns, vermilion roses near</p>

    <p>Her, she upon a lovely bush doth meet,</p>

  <p>In the 6th Canto the Hippogriff carries Roger into a country:</p>

    <p>Nor could he, had he searched the whole world through,</p>

    <p>Soft meads, clear streams, and banks affording shade,</p>

    <p>Hillocks and plains, by culture fertile made.</p>

    <p>Fair thickets of the cedar, palm and no</p>

    <p>Less pleasant myrtle, of the laurel sweet,</p>

    <p>Of orange trees, where fruit and flow'rs did grow,</p>

    <p>And which in various forms, all lovely, meet</p>

    <p>With their thick shades against the fervid glow</p>

    <p>Of summer days, afforded a retreat;</p>

    <p>And nightingales, devoid of fear, among</p>

    <p>Those branches fluttered, pouring forth their song.</p>

    <p>Amid the lilies white and roses red,</p>

    <p>Ever more freshened by the tepid air,</p>

    <p>The stag was seen, with his proud lofty head,</p>

    <p>And feeling safe, the rabbit and the hare....</p>

    <p>Sapphires and rubies, topazes, pearls, gold,</p>

    <p>Hyacinths, chrysolites, and diamonds were</p>

    <p>Like the night flow'rs, which did their leaves unfold</p>

    <p>There on those glad plains, painted by the air</p>

    <p>So green the grass, that if we did behold</p>

    <p>It here, no emeralds could therewith compare;</p>

    <p>As fair the foliage of the trees was, which</p>

    <p>With fruit and flow'r eternally were rich.</p>

    <p>Amid the boughs, sing yellow, white, and blue,</p>

    <p>And red and green small feathered creatures gay;</p>

    <p>The crystals less limpidity of hue</p>

    <p>Than the still lakes or murmuring brooks display.</p>

    <p>A gentle breeze, that seemeth still to woo</p>

    <p>And never change from its accustomed way,</p>

    <p>Made all around so tremulous the air</p>

  <p>These comparisons not only shew faithful and personal observation,
  but are far more subjective and subtle than, for instance, Dante's.
  The same holds good of Tasso. How beautiful in detail, and how
  sentimental too, is this from <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Behold how lovely blooms the vernal rose</p>

    <p>When scarce the leaves her early bud disclose,</p>

    <p>When, half unwrapt, and half to view revealed,</p>

    <p>She gives new pleasure from her charms concealed.</p>

    <p>But when she shews her bosom wide displayed,</p>

    <p>How soon her sweets exhale, her beauties fade!</p>

    <p>No more she seems the flower so lately loved,</p>

    <p>By virgins cherished and by youths approved.</p>

    <p>So swiftly fleeting with the transient day</p>

    <p>Passes the flower of mortal life away.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg131" id="pg131">131</a></span>
  Not less subjective is:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">Like a ray of light on water</p>

    <p>A smile of soft desire played in her liquid eyes.</p>

    <p class="i14">(Sonnet 18.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The most famous lines in this poem are those which describe a
  romantic garden so vividly that Humboldt says 'it reminds one of the
  charming scenery of Sorrento.' It certainly proves that even epic
  poetry tried to describe Nature for her own sake:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The garden then unfolds a beauteous scene,</p>

    <p>With flowers adorned and ever living green;</p>

    <p>There silver lakes reflect the beaming day,</p>

    <p>Here crystal streams in gurgling fountains play.</p>

    <p>Cool vales descend and sunny hills arise,</p>

    <p>And groves and caves and grottos strike the eyes.</p>

    <p>Art showed her utmost power; but art concealed</p>

    <p>With greater charm the pleased attention held.</p>

    <p>It seemed as Nature played a sportive part</p>

    <p>And strove to mock the mimic works of art:</p>

    <p>By powerful magic breathes the vernal air,</p>

    <p>And fragrant trees eternal blossoms bear:</p>

    <p>Eternal fruits on every branch endure,</p>

    <p>Those swelling from their buds, and these mature:</p>

    <p>The joyous birds, concealed in every grove,</p>

    <p>With gentle strife prolong the notes of love.</p>

    <p>Soft zephyrs breathe on woods and waters round,</p>

    <p>The woods and waters yield a murmuring sound;</p>

    <p>When cease the tuneful choir, the wind replies,</p>

    <p>But, when they sing, in gentle whisper dies;</p>

    <p>By turns they sink, by turns their music raise</p>

    <p>And blend, with equal skill, harmonious lays.</p>
  </div>

  <p>But even here the scene is surrounded by an imaginary atmosphere;
  flowers, fruit, creatures, and atmosphere all lie under a magic
  charm. Tasso's importance for our subject lies far more in his
  much-imitated pastorals.</p>

  <p>The <i>Arcadia</i> of Jacopo Sannazaro, which appeared in 1504, a
  work of poetic beauty and still greater literary importance,<a href=
  "#e11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> paved the way for pastoral poetry, which,
  like the sonnet, was interwoven with <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg132" id="pg132">132</a></span>prose. The shepherd's occupations
  are described with care, though many of the songs and terms of
  expression rather fit the man of culture than the child of Nature,
  and he had that genuine enthusiasm for the rural which begets a
  convincing eloquence. 'Tis you,' he says at the end, addressing the
  Muse, 'who first woke the sleeping woods, and taught the shepherds
  how to strike up their lost songs.'</p>

  <p>Bembo wrote this inscription for his grave:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Strew flowers o'er the sacred ashes, here lies Sannazaro;</p>

    <p>With thee, gentle Virgil, he shares Muse and grave.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Virgil too was industriously imitated in the didactic poetry of
  his country.</p>

  <p>Giovanni Rucellai (born 1475) wrote a didactic poem, <i>The
  Bees</i>, which begins:</p>

  <p>'O chaste virgins, winged visitants of flowery banks, whilst I
  prepared to sing your praise in lofty verse, at peep of day I was
  o'ercome by sleep, and then appeared a chorus of your tiny folk, and
  from their rich mellifluous haunts, in a clear voice these words
  flowed forth.... And I will sing how liquid and serene the air
  distils sweet honey, heavenly gilt, on flowerets and on grass, and
  how the bees, chaste and industrious, gather it, and thereof with
  care and skill make perfumed wax to grace the altars of our God.'</p>

  <p>And a didactic poem by Luigi Alamanni (born 1495), called
  <i>Husbandry</i>, has: 'O blessed is he who dwells in peace, the
  actual tiller of his joyous fields, to whom, in his remoteness, the
  most righteous earth brings food, and secure in well-being, he
  rejoices in his heart. If thou art not surrounded by society rich
  with purple and gems, nor with houses adorned with costly woods,
  statues, and gold;... at least, secure in the humble dwelling of wood
  from the copse hard by, and common stones collected close at hand,
  which thine own hand has founded and built, whenever thou awakenest
  at the approach <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg133" id=
  "pg133">133</a></span>of dawn, thou dost not find outside those who
  bring news of a thousand events contrary to thy desires.... Thou
  wanderest at will, now quickly, now slowly, across the green meadow,
  through the wood, over the grassy hill, or by the stream. Now here,
  now there ... thou handlest the hatchet, axe, scythe, or hoe.... To
  enjoy in sober comfort at almost all seasons, with thy dear children,
  the fruits of thine own tree, the tree planted by thyself, this
  brings a sweetness sweet beyond all others.'</p>

  <p>These didactic writings, inspired by Virgilian Georgics, show a
  distinct preference for the idyllic.</p>

  <p>Sannazaro's <i>Arcadia</i> went through sixty editions in the
  sixteenth century alone. Tasso reckoned with the prevalent taste of
  his day in <i>Aminta</i>, which improved the then method of
  dramatizing a romantic idyll. The whole poem bears the stamp of an
  idealizing and romantic imagination, and embodies in lyric form his
  sentimental idea of the Golden Age and an ideal world of Nature. Even
  down to its details <i>Aminta</i> recalls the pastorals of Longos;
  and Daphne's words (Act I. Scene 1) suggest the most feeling
  outpourings of Kallimachos and Nonnos:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And callest thou sweet spring-time</p>

      <p>The animal, the human,</p>

      <p>Of loving! Dost thou see not</p>

      <p>How all things are enamoured</p>

      <p>Of this enamourer, rich with joy and health?</p>

      <p>Observe that turtle-dove,</p>

      <p>How, toying with his dulcet murmuring,</p>

      <p>He kisses his companion. Hear that nightingale</p>

      <p>Who goes from bough to bough</p>

      <p>Singing with his loud heart, 'I love!' 'I love!'...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10">The very trees</p>

  </div>

  <p>One seems to hear Sakuntala and her friends talking, or Akontios
  complaining. So, too, when the unhappy lover laments (Aminta):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>In my lamentings I have found</p>

    <p>A very pity in the pebbly waters,</p>

    <p>And I have found the trees</p>

    <p>But never have I found,</p>

    <p>Nor ever hope to find,</p>

    <p>Compassion in this hard and beautiful</p>

    <p>What shall I call her?</p>
  </div>

  <p>Aminta describes to Tirsis how his love grew from boyhood up:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>There grew by little and little in my heart,</p>

    <p>I knew not from what root,</p>

    <p>But just as the grass grows that sows itself,</p>

    <p>An unknown something which continually</p>

    <p>Made me feel anxious to be with her.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Sylvia kisses him:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Never did bee from flower</p>

    <p>Suck sugar so divine</p>

    <p>As was the honey that I gathered then</p>

    <p>From those twin roses fresh.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In Act II. Scene 1, the rejected Satyr, like the rejected
  Polyphemus or Amaryllis in Theocritus, complains in antitheses which
  recall Longos:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The woods hide serpents, lions, and bears under their green
    shade, and in your bosom hatred, disdain, and cruelty dwell....
    Alas, when I bring the earliest flowers, you refuse them
    obstinately, perhaps because <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg135"
    id="pg135">135</a></span>lovelier ones bloom on your own face; if I
    offer beautiful apples, you reject them angrily, perhaps because
    your beautiful bosom swells with lovelier ones.... and yet I am not
    to be despised, for I saw myself lately in the clear water, when
    winds were still and there were no waves.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is the sentimental pastoral poetry of Hellenism reborn and
  intensified.</p>

  <p>So with the elegiac motive so loved by Alexandrian and Roman
  poets, praise of a happy past time; the chorus sings in
  <i>Aminta</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>O lovely age of gold,</p>

    <p>Not that the rivers rolled</p>

    <p>With milk, or that the woods wept honeydew;</p>

    <p>Not that the ready ground</p>

    <p>Produced without a wound,</p>

    <p>Or the mild serpent had no tooth that slew....</p>

    <p>But solely that.... the law of gold,</p>

    <p>That glad and golden law, all free, all fitted,</p>

    <p>Which Nature's own hand wrote--What pleases is permitted!...</p>

    <p>Go! let us love, the daylight dies, is born;</p>

    <p>But unto us the light</p>

    <p>Dies once for all, and sleep brings on eternal night.</p>

  <p>Over thirty pastoral plays can be ascribed to Italy in the last
  third of the sixteenth century. The most successful imitator of Tasso
  was Giovanni Battista Guarini (born 1537) in <i>The True Shepherd (II
  Pastor Fido)</i>. One quotation will shew how he outvied
  <i>Aminta</i>. In Act I, Scene 1, Linko says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Look round thee, Sylvia; behold</p>

    <p>All in the world that's amiable and fair</p>

    <p>Is love's sweet work: heaven loves, the earth, the sea,</p>

    <p>Are full of love and own his mighty sway.</p>

    <p>Love through the woods</p>

    <p>The fiercest beasts; love through the waves attends</p>

    <p>Swift gliding dolphins and the sluggish whales.</p>

    <p>That little bird which sings....</p>

    <p>Oh, had he human sense,</p>

    <p>'I burn with love,' he'd cry, 'I burn with love,'</p>

    <p>And in his heart he truly burns,</p>

    <p>And in his warble speaks</p>

    <p>A language, well by his dear mate conceived,</p>

    <p>Who answering cries, 'And I too burn with love.'</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg136" id="pg136">136</a></span>

  <p>He praises woodland solitude:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Dear happy groves!</p>

    <p>And them all silent, solitary gloom,</p>

    <p>True residence of peace and of repose!</p>

    <p>How willingly, how willingly my steps</p>

    <p>To you return, and oh! if but my stars</p>

    <p>Benightly had decreed</p>

    <p>My life for solitude, and as my wish</p>

    <p>Would naturally prompt to pass my days--</p>

    <p>No, not the Elysian fields,</p>

    <p>Those happy gardens of the demi-gods,</p>

    <p>Would I exchange for yon enchanting shades.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The love lyrics of the later Renaissance are remarkably rich in
  vivid pictures of Nature combined with much personal sentiment.
  Petrarch's are the model; he inspired Vittoria Colonna, and she too
  revelled in sad feelings and memories, especially about the death of
  her husband:<a href="#e12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>'When I see the earth adorned and beautiful with a thousand lovely
  and sweet flowers, and how in the heavens every star is resplendent
  with varied colours; when I see that every solitary and lively
  creature is moved by natural instinct to come out of the forests and
  ancient caverns to seek its fellow by day and by night; and when I
  see the plains adorned again with glorious flowers and new leaves,
  and hear every babbling brook with grateful murmurs bathing its
  flowery banks, so that Nature, in love with herself, delights to gaze
  on the beauty of her works, I say to myself, reflecting: "How brief
  is this our miserable mortal life!" Yesterday this plain was covered
  with snow, to-day it is green and flowery. And again in a moment the
  beauty of the heavens is overclouded by a fierce wind, and the happy
  loving creatures remain hidden amidst the mountains and the woods;
  nor can the sweet songs of the tender plants and happy birds be
  heard, for these cruel storms have dried up the flowers on the
  ground; the birds are mute, the most rapid <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg137" id="pg137">137</a></span>streams and
  smallest rivulets are checked by frost, and what was one hour so
  beautiful and joyous, is, for a season, miserable and dead.'</p>

  <p>Here the two pictures in the inner and outer life are equally
  vivid to the poetess; it is the real 'pleasure of sorrow,' and she
  lingers over them with delight.</p>

  <p>Bojardo, too, reminds us of Petrarch; for example, in Sonnet
  89:<a href="#e13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Thou shady wood, inured my griefs to hear,</p>

      <p>So oft expressed in quick and broken sighs;</p>

      <p>Thou glorious sun, unused to set or rise</p>

      <p>But as the witness of my daily fear;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ye wandering birds, ye flocks and ranging deer,</p>

      <p>Exempt from my consuming agonies;</p>

      <p>Thou sunny stream to whom my sorrow flies</p>

      <p>'Mid savage rocks and wilds, no human traces near.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>O witnesses eternal, how I live!</p>

      <p>My sufferings hear, and win to their relief</p>

      <p>That scornful beauty--tell her how I grieve!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>But little 'tis to her to hear my grief.</p>

      <p>To her, who sees the pangs which I receive,</p>

      <p>And seeing, deigns them not the least relief.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Lorenzo de Medici's idylls were particularly rich in descriptions
  of Nature and full of feeling. 'Here too that delight in pain, in
  telling of their unhappiness and renunciation; here too those
  wonderful tones which distinguish the sonnets of the fourteenth and
  fifteenth centuries so favourably from those of a later time.'
  (Geiger.)</p>

  <p>There is a delicate compliment in this sonnet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>O violets, sweet and fresh and pure indeed,</p>

    <p>Culled by that hand beyond all others fair!</p>

    <p>What rain or what pure air has striven to bear</p>

    <p>Flowers far excelling those 'tis wont to yield?</p>

    <p>What pearly dew, what sun, or sooth what earth</p>

    <p>Did you with all these subtle charms adorn;</p>

    <p>And whence is this sweet scent by Nature drawn,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg138" id=
    "pg138">138</a></span>Or heaven who deigns to grant it to such
    worth?</p>

    <p>O, my dear violets, the hand which chose</p>

    <p>You from all others, that has made you fair,</p>

    <p>'Twas that adorned you with such charm and worth;</p>

    <p>Sweet hand! which took my heart altho' it knows</p>

    <p>Its lowliness, with that you may compare.</p>

    <p>To that give thanks, and to none else on earth.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Thus we see that the Italians of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and
  fifteenth centuries were penetrated through and through by the modern
  spirit--were, indeed, its pioneers. They recognized their own
  individuality, pondered their own inner life, delighted in the charms
  of Nature, and described them in prose and poetry, both as
  counterparts to feeling and for her own sake.</p>

  <p>Over all the literature we have been considering--whether poetic
  comparison and personification, or sentimental descriptions of
  pastoral life and a golden age, of blended inner and outer life, or
  of the finest details of scenery--there lies that bloom of the
  modern, that breath of subjective personality, so hard to define. The
  rest of contemporary Europe had no such culture of heart and mind, no
  such marked individuality, to shew.</p>

  <p>The further growth of the Renaissance feeling, itself a rebirth of
  Hellenic and Roman feeling, was long delayed.</p>

  <p>Let us turn next to Spain and Portugal--the countries chiefly
  affected by the great voyages of discovery, not only socially and
  economically, but artistically--and see the effect of the new scenery
  upon their imagination. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg139" id=
  "pg139">139</a></span></p>

  <h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <h3>ENTHUSIASM FOR NATURE AMONG THE DISCOVERERS AND CATHOLIC
  MYSTICS</h3>

  <p>The great achievement of the Italian Renaissance was the discovery
  of the world within, of the whole deep contents of the human spirit.
  Burckhart, praising this achievement, says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>If we were to collect the pearls from the courtly and knightly
    poetry of all the countries of the West during the two preceding
    centuries, we should have a mass of wonderful divinations and
    single pictures of the inward life, which at first sight would seem
    to rival the poetry of the Italians. Leaving lyrical poetry out of
    account, Godfrey of Strassburg gives us, in his <i>Tristram and
    Isolt</i>, a representation of human passion, some features of
    which are immortal. But these pearls lie scattered in the ocean of
    artificial convention, and they are altogether something very
    different from a complete objective picture of the inward man and
    his spiritual wealth.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The discovery of the beauty of scenery followed as a necessary
  corollary of this awakening of individualism, this fathoming of the
  depths of human personality. For only to fully-developed man does
  Nature fully disclose herself.</p>

  <p>This had already been stated by one of the most philosophic minds
  of the time, Pico della Mirandola, in his speech on the dignity of
  man. God, he tells us, made man at the close of creation to know the
  laws of the universe, to love its beauty, to admire its <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg140" id="pg140">140</a></span>greatness. He
  bound him to no fixed place, to no prescribed form of work, and by no
  iron necessity; but gave him freedom to will and to move.</p>

  <p>'I have set thee,' said the Creator to Adam, 'in the midst of the
  world, that thou mayest the more easily behold and see all that is
  therein. I created thee a being neither heavenly nor earthly, neither
  mortal nor immortal, only that thou mightest be free to shape and to
  overcome thyself. Thou mayest sink into a beast, and be born again to
  the Divine likeness. The brutes bring with them from their mothers'
  body what they will carry with them as long as they live; the higher
  spirits are from the beginning, or soon after, what they will be for
  ever. To thee alone is given a growth and a development depending on
  thine own free will. Thou bearest in thee the germs of a universal
  life.'</p>

  <p>The best men of the Renaissance realized this ideal of an
  all-round development, and it was the glory of Italy in the
  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, that she found a new realm in the
  inner man at the very time that her discoveries across the seas were
  enlarging the boundaries of the external world, and her science was
  studying it. Mixed as the motives of the discoverers must have been,
  like those of the crusaders before them, and probably, for the most
  part, self-interested, it is easy to imagine the surprise they must
  have felt at seeing ignorant people, who, to quote Peter Martyr (de
  rebus oceanicis):<a href="#f1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Naked, without weights or measures or death-dealing money, live
    in a Golden Age without laws, without slanderous judges, without
    the scales of the balance. Contented with Nature, they spend their
    lives utterly untroubled for the future.... Theirs is a Golden Age;
    they do not enclose their farms with trench or wall or hurdle;
    their gardens are open. Without laws, without the scales of the
    balance, without judges, they guard the right by Nature's
    light.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg141" id="pg141">141</a></span>
  And their wonder at the novelties in climate and vegetation, the
  strange forests, brilliant birds, and splendid stars of the tropics,
  must have been no less.</p>

  <p>Yet it is one thing to feel, and another to find words to convey
  the feeling to others; and the explorers often expressed regret for
  their lack of skill in this respect.</p>

  <p>Also, and this is more important in criticizing what they wrote,
  these seamen were mostly simple, unlettered folk, to whom a country's
  wealth in natural products and their practical value made the
  strongest appeal, and whose admiration of bays, harbours, trees,
  fields of grain, etc., was measured by the same standard of utility.
  Even such unskilled reporters did not entirely fail to refer to the
  beauty of Nature; but had it not been for the original and powerful
  mind of Christopher Columbus, we should have had little more in the
  way of description than 'pleasant,' 'pretty,' and such words.</p>

  <p>Marco Polo described his journey to the coast of Cormos<a href=
  "#f2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in very matter-of-fact fashion, but not
  without a touch of satisfaction at the peculiarities of the
  place:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You then approach the very beautiful plain of Formosa, watered
    by fine rivers, with plantations of the date palms, and having the
    air filled with francolins, parrots, and other birds unknown to our
    climate. You ride two days to it, and then arrive at the ocean, on
    which there is a city and a fort named Cormos. The ships of India
    bring thither all kinds of spiceries, precious stones, and pearls,
    cloths of silk and gold, elephants' teeth, and many other
    articles.... They sow wheat, barley, and other kinds of grain in
    the month of November, and reap them in March, when they become
    ripe and perfect; but none except the date will endure till May,
    being dried up by the extreme heat.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Elsewhere he wrote of scenery in the same strain: of the Persian
  deserts, and the green table-lands and wild gorges of Badachshan,
  Japan with its golden <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg142" id=
  "pg142">142</a></span>roofed palaces, paradisaical Sunda Islands with
  their 'abundance of treasure and costly spices,' Java the less with
  its eight kingdoms, etc.; but naturally his chief interest was given
  to the manners and customs of the various races, and the fertility
  and uses of their countries.</p>

  <p>In Bishop Osorio's <i>History of Emmanuel, King of Portugal</i>,
  we see some pleasure in the beauties of Nature peeping through the
  matter-of-fact tone of the day.</p>

  <p>Thus, speaking of the companions of Vasco da Gama, he says that
  they admired the far coast of Africa:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>They descried some little islands, which appeared extremely
    pleasant; the trees were lofty, the meadows of a beautiful verdure,
    and great numbers of cattle frisked about everywhere; they could
    see the inhabitants walking upon the shore in vast numbers....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of Mozambique he says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The palm trees are of a great height, covered with long prickly
    leaves; broad-spreading boughs afford an agreeable shade, and bear
    nuts of a great size, called cocoes.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of Melinda:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The city stands in a beautiful plain, surrounded with a variety
    of fine gardens; these are stocked with all sorts of trees,
    especially the orange, the flowers of which yield a most graceful
    diffusive smell. The country is rich and plentiful, abounding not
    only with tame and domestic cattle, but with game of all kinds,
    which the natives hunt down or take with nets.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of Zanzibar:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The soil of this place is rich and fertile, and it abounds with
    springs of the most excellent water; the whole island is covered
    with beautiful woods, which are extremely fragrant from the many
    wild citrons growing there, which diffuse the most grateful
    scent.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of Brazil, which is 'extremely pleasant and the soil
  fruitful':</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg143" id=
  "pg143">143</a></span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Clothed with a beautiful verdure, covered with tall trees,
    abounding with plenty of excellent water ... and so healthy that
    the inhabitants make no use of medicines, for almost all who die
    here are not cut off by any distemper, but worn out by age. Here
    are many large rivers, besides a vast number of delightful springs.
    The plains are large and spacious, and afford excellent pasture....
    In short, the whole country affords a most beautiful prospect,
    being diversified with hills and valleys, and these covered with
    thick shady woods stocked with great variety of trees, many of
    which our people were quite strangers to: of these there was one of
    a particular nature, the leaves of which, when cut, sent forth a
    kind of balsam. The trees used in dyeing scarlet grow here in great
    plenty and to a great height. The soil likewise produces the most
    useful plants.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of Ormuz, near Arabia:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The name of the island seems to be taken from the ancient city
    of Armuza in Caramania ... the place is sandy and barren, and the
    soil so very poor that it produces nothing fit for human
    sustenance, neither by nature nor by the most laborious cultivation
    ... yet here you might see greater plenty of these, as well as all
    luxurious superfluities, than in most other countries of a richer
    and more fertile soil, for the place, poor in itself, having become
    the great mart for the commodities of India, Persia, and Arabia,
    was thus abundantly stocked with the produce of all these
    countries.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Peter Martyr's<a href="#f3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> point of view was
  much the same. He was full of surprise at the splendour round him,
  and the advantages such fertility offered to husbandry:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Thus after a few days with cheerful hearts they espied the land
    long looked for....</p>

    <p>As they coasted along by the shore of certain of these islands,
    they heard nightingales sing in the thick woods in the month of
    November.</p>

    <p>They found also great rivers of fresh water and natural havens
    of capacity to harbour great navies of ships.... They found there
    wild geese, turtle-doves, and ducks, much greater than ours, and as
    white <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg144" id=
    "pg144">144</a></span>as swans, with heads of purple colour. Also
    popinjays, of the which some are green, some yellow, and having
    their feathers intermingled with green, yellow, and purple, which
    varieties delighted the sense not a little.... They entered into a
    main large sea, having in it innumerable islands, marvellously
    differing one from another; for some of them were very fruitful,
    full of herbs and trees, other some very dry, barren, and rough,
    with high rocky mountains of stone, whereof some were of bright
    blue, or azurine colour, and other glistening white.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He filled a whole page with descriptions of the wonderful wealth
  of flowers, fruit, and vegetables of all kinds, which the ground
  yields even in February. The richness of the prairie grass, the charm
  of the rivers, the wealth of fruit, the enormous size of the trees
  (with a view to native houses), the various kinds of pines, palms,
  and chestnuts, and their uses, the immense downfall of water carried
  to the sea by the rivers--all this he noted with admiration; but
  industrial interest outweighed the æsthetic, even when he called
  Spain happier than Italy. There is no trace of any real feeling for
  scenery, any grasp of landscape as a whole; he did not advance beyond
  scattered details, which attracted his eye chiefly for their material
  uses.</p>

  <p>But there is real delight in Nature in the account of a journey to
  the Cape Verde Islands, undertaken on the suggestion of Henry the
  Navigator by Aloise da Mosto,<a href="#f4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> an
  intelligent Venetian nobleman:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Cape de Verde is so called because the Portuguese, who had
    discovered it about a year before, found it covered with trees,
    which continue green all the year round. This is a high and
    beautiful Cape, which runs a good length into the sea, and has two
    hills or little mountains at the point thereof. There are several
    villages of negroes from Senega, on and about the promontory, who
    dwell in thatched houses close to the shore, and in sight of those
    who sail by.... The coast is all low and full of fine large trees,
    which are constantly green; that is, they never wither as those in
    Europe do, for the new leaves grow before the <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg145" id="pg145">145</a></span>old ones fall
    off. These trees are so near the shore that they seem to drink out
    of the sea. It is a most beautiful coast to behold, and the author,
    who had sailed both in the East and West, never saw any comparable
    with it.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As Ruge says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The delight of this solid and prudent citizen of Strasburg in
    the beauty of the tropics is lost in translation, but very evident
    in the original account.<a href="#f5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After reading it, we cannot quite say with Humboldt that Columbus
  was the very first to give fluent expression to Nature's beauty on
  the shores of the New World; none the less, and apart from his
  importance in other respects, he remains the chief representative of
  his time in the matter. Humboldt noted this in his critical
  examination of the history of geography in the fifteenth and
  sixteenth centuries, in which he pointed out his deep feeling for
  Nature, and also, what only those who know the difficulties of
  language at the time can appreciate, the beauty and simplicity of his
  expression of it.<a href="#f6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Columbus is a striking example of the fact that a man's openness
  to Nature increases with his general inner growth. No one doubts that
  uneducated sailors, like other unlettered people, are vividly
  impressed by fine scenery, especially when it is new to them, if they
  possess a spark of mental refinement. They have the feeling, but are
  unable to express it in words. But, as Humboldt says, feeling
  improves speech; with increased culture, the power of expression
  increases.</p>

  <p>We owe a debt of gratitude to Fernandez de Navarrete<a href=
  "#f7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> for the Diary in which we can trace
  Columbus' love for Nature increasing to 'a deep and poetic feeling
  for the majesty of creation.'</p>

  <p>He wrote, October 8th, 1492, in his diary:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>'Thanks be to God,' says the Admiral, 'the air is very soft like
    the April at Seville, and it is a pleasure to be there, so balmy
    are the breezes.'</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg146" id="pg146">146</a></span>
  And Humboldt says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The physiognomy and forms of the vegetation, the impenetrable
    thickets of the forests, in which one can scarcely distinguish the
    stems to which the several blossoms and leaves belong, the wild
    luxuriance of the flowering soil along the humid shores, and the
    rose-coloured flamingoes which, fishing at early morning at the
    mouth of the rivers, impart animation to the scenery,--all in turn
    arrested the attention of the old mariner as he sailed along the
    shores of Cuba, between the small Lucayan Islands and the
    Jardinillos.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Each new country seemed to him more beautiful than the last; he
  complained that he could not find new words in which to give the
  Queen an impression of the beauty of the Cuban coast.</p>

  <p>It will repay us to examine the Diary more closely, since Humboldt
  only treated it shortly and in scattered extracts, and it has been
  partly falsified, unintentionally, by attempts to modernize the
  language instead of adhering to literal translation. What Peschel
  says, for instance, is pretty but distinctly exaggerated:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Columbus was never weary of listening to the nightingales,
    comparing the genial Indian climate with the Andalusian spring, and
    admiring the luxuriant wilderness on these humid shores, with their
    dense vegetation and forests so rich in all kinds of plants, and
    alive with swarms of parrots ... with an open eye for all the
    beauties of Nature and all the wonders of creation, he looked at
    the splendour of the tropics very much as a tender father looks
    into the bright eyes of his child.<a href=
    "#f8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Diary of November 3rd says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He could see nothing, owing to the dense foliage of the trees,
    which were very fresh and odoriferous; so that he felt no doubt
    that there were aromatic herbs among them. He said that all he saw
    was so beautiful that his eyes could never tire of gazing upon such
    loveliness, nor his ears of listening to the songs of birds.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>November 14th:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He saw so many islands that he could not count them all, with
    very high land covered with trees of many kinds and an infinite
    number of palms. He was much <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg147"
    id="pg147">147</a></span>astonished to see so many lofty islands,
    and assured the Sovereigns that the mountains and islands he had
    seen since yesterday seemed to him to be second to none in the
    world, so high and clear of clouds and snow, with the sea at their
    bases so deep.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>November 25th:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He saw a large stream of beautiful water falling from the
    mountains above, with a loud noise.... Just then the sailor boys
    called out that they had found large pines. The Admiral looked up
    the hill and saw that they were so wonderfully large, that he could
    not exaggerate their height and straightness, like stout yet fine
    spindles. He perceived that here there was material for great store
    of planks and masts for the largest ships in Spain ... the
    mountains are very high, whence descend many limpid streams, and
    all the hills are covered with pines, and an infinity of diverse
    and beautiful trees.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>November 27th:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The freshness and beauty of the trees, the clearness of the
    water and the birds, made it all so delightful that he wished never
    to leave them. He said to the men who were with him that to give a
    true relation to the Sovereigns of the things they had seen, a
    thousand tongues would not suffice, nor his hand to write it, for
    that it was like a scene of enchantment.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>December 13th:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The nine men well armed, whom he sent to explore a certain
    place, said, with regard to the beauty of the land they saw, that
    the best land in Castille could not be compared with it. The
    Admiral also said that there was no comparison between them, nor
    did the Plain of Cordova come near them, the difference being as
    great as between night and day. They said that all these lands were
    cultivated, and that a very wide and large river passed through the
    centre of the valley and could irrigate all the fields. All the
    trees were green and full of fruit, and the plants tall and covered
    with flowers. The roads were broad and good. The climate was like
    April in Castille; the nightingale and other birds sang as they do
    in Spain during that month, and it was the most pleasant place in
    the world. Some birds sing sweetly at night, the crickets and frogs
    are heard a good deal.</p>
  </blockquote>

  All this shews a naive and spontaneous delight in Nature, as free
  from sentimentality as from any grasp of landscape as a distinct
  entity.</p>

  <p>In a letter about Cuba, which Humboldt gives, he says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The lands are high, and there are many very lofty mountains ...
    all most beautiful, of a thousand different shapes, accessible and
    covered with trees of a thousand kinds of such great height that
    they seemed to reach the skies. I am told that the trees never lose
    their foliage, and I can well believe it, for I observed that they
    were as green and luxuriant as in Spain in the month of May. Some
    were in bloom, others bearing fruit, and others otherwise according
    to their nature. There were palm trees of six or eight kinds,
    wonderful in their beautiful variety; but this is the case with all
    the other trees; fruits and grasses, trees, plants and fruits
    filled us with admiration. It contains extraordinary pine groves
    and very extensive plains.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Humboldt here comments that these often-repeated expressions of
  admiration prove a strong feeling for the beauty of Nature, since
  they are concerned with foliage and shade, not with precious metals.
  The next letter shews the growing power of description:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Reaching the harbour of Bastimentos, I put in.... The storm and
    a rapid current kept me in for fourteen days, when I again set
    sail, but not with favourable weather.... I had already made four
    leagues when the storm recommenced and wearied me to such a degree
    that I absolutely knew not what to do; my wound re-opened, and for
    nine days my life was despaired of. Never was the sea seen so high,
    so terrific, and so covered with foam; not only did the wind oppose
    our proceeding onward, but it also rendered it highly dangerous to
    run in for any headland, and kept me in that sea, which seemed to
    me a sea of blood, seething like a cauldron on a mighty fire. Never
    did the sky look more fearful; during one day and one night it
    burned like a furnace, and emitted flashes in such fashion that
    each time I looked to see if my masts and my sails were not
    destroyed; these flashes came with such alarming fury that we all
    thought the ship must have been consumed. All this time the waters
    from heaven never ceased, not to say that it <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg149" id="pg149">149</a></span>rained, for it
    was like a repetition of the Deluge. The men were at this time so
    crushed in spirit, that they longed for death as a deliverance from
    so many martyrdoms. Twice already had the ships suffered loss in
    boats, anchors, and rigging, and were now lying bare without
    sails.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>These extracts shew how feeling for Nature in unlettered minds
  could develop into an enthusiasm which begot to some extent its own
  power of expression. Columbus was entirely deficient in all previous
  knowledge of natural history; but he was gifted with deep feeling
  (the account of the nocturnal visions in the <i>Lettera Rarissima</i>
  is proof of this)<a href="#f9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, mental energy, and
  a capacity for exact observation which many of the other explorers
  did not possess, and these faculties made up for what he lacked in
  education.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In Cuba alone, he distinguishes seven or eight different species
    of palm more beautiful and taller than the date tree; he informs
    his learned friend Anghiera that he has seen pines and palms
    wonderfully associated together in one and the same plain, and he
    even so acutely observed the vegetation around him, that he was the
    first to notice that there were pines in the mountains of Cibao,
    whose fruits are not fir cones but berries like the olives of the
    Axarafe de Sevilla.</p>

    <p>(<i>Cosmos.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Most of Vespucci's narratives of travel, especially his letters to
  the Medici, only contain adventures and descriptions of manners and
  customs. He lacked the originality and enthusiasm which gave the
  power of the wing to Columbus.</p>

  <p>That imposing Portuguese poem, the <i>Lusiad</i> of Camoens, is
  full of jubilation over the discovery of the New World. Camoens made
  his notes of foreign places at first hand; he had served as a
  soldier, fought at the foot of Atlas in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf,
  had doubled the Cape twice, and, inspired by a deep love for Nature,
  had spent sixteen years in examining the phenomena of the ocean on
  the Indian and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg150" id=
  "pg150">150</a></span>Chinese shores. He was a great sea painter. His
  poetic and inventive power remind one at times of Dante--for
  instance, in the description of the Dream Face; and he pictures
  foreign lands with the clearness and detail of the discoverers and
  later travellers. Here and there his poetry is like the Diary of
  Columbus translated into verse--epic verse.</p>

  <p>He had the same fiery spirit, nerve, and fresh insight, with the
  poet's gift added.</p>

  <p>(None the less, the classic apparatus of deities in Thetys'
  <i>Apology</i> is no adornment.)</p>

  <p>Comparisons from Nature and animals are few but detailed:</p>

  The storm at sea reminds us of Æschylus in splendour:</p>

  <p>His magic island, the Ilha of Venus, could only have been imagined
  by a poet who had travelled widely. All the delights of the New World
  are there, with the vegetation of Southern Europe added. It is a
  poet's triumphant rendering of impressions which the discoverers so
  often felt their inability to convey:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>From far they saw the island fresh and fair,</p>

    <p>Which Venus o'er the waters guiding drove</p>

    <p>(E'en as the wind the canvas white doth bear)....</p>

    <p>Where the coast forms a bay for resting-place,</p>

    <p>Curved and all quiet, and whose shining sand</p>

    <p>Is painted with red shells by Venus' hand....</p>

    <p>Three beauteous mounts rise nobly to the view,</p>

    <p>Lifting with graceful pride their sweeling head,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg154" id=
    "pg154">154</a></span>O'er which enamelled grass adorning grew.</p>

    <p>In this delightful lovely island glad,</p>

    <p>Bright limpid streams their rushing waters threw</p>

    <p>From heights with rich luxuriant verdure clad,</p>

    <p>'Midst the white rocks above, their source derive,</p>

    <p>The streams sonorous, sweet, and fugitive....</p>

    <p>A thousand trees toward heaven their summits raise,</p>

    <p>With fruits odoriferous and fair;</p>

    <p>The orange in its produce bright displays</p>

    <p>The tint that Daphne carried in her hair;</p>

    <p>The citron on the ground its branches lays,</p>

    <p>Laden with yellow weights it cannot bear;</p>

    <p>The beauteous melons, which the whole perfume</p>

    <p>The virgin bosom in their form assume.</p>

    <p>The forest trees, which on the hills combine</p>

    <p>To ennoble them with leafy hair o'ergrown,</p>

    <p>Are poplars of Alcides; laurels shine,</p>

    <p>The which the shining God loved as his own;</p>

    <p>Myrtles of Cytherea with the pine</p>

    <p>Of Cybele, by other love o'erthrown;</p>

    <p>The spreading cypress tree points out where lies</p>

    <p>The seat of the ethereal paradise....</p>

    <p>Pomegranates rubicund break forth and shine,</p>

    <p>A tint whereby thou, ruby, losest sheen.</p>

    <p>'Twixt the elm branches hangs the jocund vine,</p>

    <p>With branches some of red and some of green....</p>

    <p>Then the refined and splendid tapestry,</p>

    <p>Covering the rustic ground beneath the feet,</p>

    <p>Makes that of Achemeina dull to be,</p>

    <p>But makes the shady valley far more sweet.</p>

    <p>Cephisian flowers with head inclined we see</p>

    <p>About the calm and lucid lake's retreat....</p>

    <p>'Twas difficult to fancy which was true,</p>

    <p>Seeing on heaven and earth all tints the same,</p>

    <p>If fair Aurora gave the flowers their time,</p>

    <p>Or from the lovely flowers to her it came;</p>

    <p>Flora and Zephyr there in painting drew</p>

    <p>The violets tinted, as of lovers' flame,</p>

    <p>The iris, and the rose all fair and fresh</p>

    <p>E'en as it doth on cheek of maiden blush....</p>

    <p>Along the water sings the snow-white swan,</p>

    <p>While from the branch respondeth Philomel....</p>

    <p>Here, in its bill, to the dear nest, with care,</p>

    <p>The rapid little bird the food doth bear.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Subjective feeling for Nature is better displayed in the lyric
  than the epic.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg155" id="pg155">155</a></span>
  The Spaniard, Fray Luis de Leon, was a typical example of a
  sixteenth-century lyrist; full of mild enthusiasm for Nature, the
  theosophico-mystical attitude of the Catholic.</p>

  <p>A most fervid feeling for Nature from the religious side breathed
  in St Francis of Assisi--the feeling which inspired his hymn to
  Brother Sun (<i>Cantico del Sole</i>), and led his brother Egidio,
  intoxicated with love to his Creator, to kiss trees and rocks and
  weep over them<a href="#f12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Praised by His creatures all,</p>

    <p>Praised be the Lord my God</p>

    <p>By Messer Sun, my brother above all,</p>

    <p>Who by his rays lights us and lights the day--</p>

    <p>Radiant is she, with his great splendour stored,</p>

    <p>Thy glory, Lord, confessing.</p>

    <p>By Sister Moon and Stars my Lord is praised,</p>

    <p>Where clear and fair they in the heavens are raised</p>

    <p>By Brother Wind, etc....</p>
  </div>

  <p>His follower, Bonaventura, too, in his verses counted--</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The smallest creatures his brothers and sisters, and called upon
    crops, vineyards, trees, flowers, and stars to praise God.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Bernard von Clairvaux made it a principle 'to learn from the
  earth, trees, corn, flowers, and grass'; and he wrote in his letter
  to Heinrich Murdach (Letter 106):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Believe me, I have proved it; you will find more in the woods
    than in books; trees and stones will teach you what no other
    teacher can.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He looked upon all natural objects as 'rays of the Godhead,'
  copies of a great original.</p>

  <p>His contemporary, Hugo von St Victor, wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The whole visible world is like a book written by the finger of
    God. It is created by divine power, and all human beings are
    figures placed in it, not to shew the free-will of man, but as a
    revelation and visible sign, by divine will, of God's invisible
    wisdom. But <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg156" id=
    "pg156">156</a></span>as one who only glances at an open book sees
    marks on it, but does not read the letters, so the wicked and
    sensual man, in whom the spirit of God is not, sees only the outer
    surface of visible beings and not their deeper parts.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>German mystics wrote in the same strain; for instance, the popular
  Franciscan preacher, Berthold von Regensburg (1272),</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Whose sermons on fields and meadows drew many thousands of
    hearers, and moved them partly by the unusual freshness and
    vitality of his pious feeling for Nature,</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>in spite of many florid symbolical accessories, such as we find
  again in Ekkehart and other fifteenth-century mystics, and especially
  in Tauler, Suso, and Ruysbroek.</p>

  <p>The northern prophetess and foundress of an Order Birgitta (1373)
  held that the breath of the Creator was in all visible things: 'We
  feel it pervading us in her visions,' says Hammerich,<a href=
  "#f13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Whether by gurgling brook or snow-covered firs. It is with us
    when the prophetess leads us along the ridges of the Swedish coast
    with their surging waves or down the shaft of a mine, or to wander
    in the quiet of evening through vineyards between roses and lilies,
    while the dew is falling and the bells ring out the Ave Maria.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Vincentius von Beauvais (1264) in his <i>Speculum Naturæ</i>
  demonstrates the value of studying Nature from a religious and moral
  point of view; and the Carthusian general, Dionysius von Rickel
  (1471), in his paper <i>On the beauty of the world and the glory of
  God (De venustate mundi et de pulchritudine Dei)</i> says in Chapter
  xxii.: 'All the beauty of the animal world is nothing but the
  reflection and out-flow of the original beauty of God,' and gives as
  special examples:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Roses, lilies, and other beautiful and fragrant flowers, shady
    woods, pine trees, pleasant meadows, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
    "pg157" id="pg157">157</a></span>high, mountains, springs, streams
    and rivers, and the broad arm of the immeasurable sea ... and above
    all shine the stars, completing their course in the clear sky in
    wonderful splendour and majestic order.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Raymundus von Sabieude, a Spaniard, who studied medicine and
  philosophy at Toulouse, and wrote his <i>Theologia Naturalis</i> in
  1436, considered Nature, like Thomas Aquinas, from a mystical and
  scholastic point of view, as made up of living beings in a graduated
  scale from the lowest to the highest; and he lauded her in terms
  which even Pope Clement VII. thought exaggerated. Piety in him went
  hand in hand with a natural philosophy like Bacon's, and his interest
  in Nature was rather a matter of intellect than feeling.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>God has given us two books--the book of all living beings, or
    Nature, and the Holy Scriptures. The first was given to man from
    the beginning when all things were created, for each living being
    is but a letter of the alphabet written by the finger of God, and
    the book is composed of them all together as a book is of letters
    ... man is the capital letter of this book. This book is not like
    the other, falsified and spoilt, but familiar and intelligible; it
    makes man joyous and humble and obedient, a hater of evil and a
    lover of virtue.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Among the savants of the Renaissance who applied the inductive
  method to Nature before Bacon,<a href="#f14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> we
  must include the thoughtful and pious Spaniard Luis Vives (1540), who
  wrote concerning the useless speculations of alchemists and
  astrologers about occult things: 'It is not arguing that is needed
  here, but silent observation of Nature.' Knowledge of Nature, he
  said, would serve both body and soul.</p>

  <p>The tender religious lyrics of the mystic, Luis de Leon, followed
  next.<a href="#f16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> His life (1521-1591) brings
  us up to the days of the Inquisition. He himself, an excellent
  teacher and man of science, was imprisoned for years for opinions too
  openly expressed in his writings; but with all his varied fortunes he
  never <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg158" id=
  "pg158">158</a></span>lost his innate manliness and tenderness. His
  biographer tells us, that as soon as the holidays began, he would
  hurry away from the gloomy lecture rooms and the noisy students at
  Salamanca, to the country, where he had taken an estate belonging to
  a monastery at the foot of a hill by a river, with a little island
  close by.</p>

  <p>It had a large uncultivated garden, made beautiful by fine old
  trees, with paths among the vines and a stream running through it to
  the river, and a long avenue of poplars whose rustle blended with the
  noise of the mill-wheel. Beyond was a view of fields. Leon would sit
  for hours here undisturbed, dipping his feet in the brook under a
  poplar--the tree which was reputed to flourish on sand alone and give
  shelter to all the birds under heaven--while the rustle of the leaves
  sang his melancholy to sleep. His biographer goes on to say that he
  had the Spaniard's special delight in Nature, and understood her
  language and her secrets; and the veiled splendour of her tones,
  colours, and forms could move him to tears. As he sat there gazing at
  the clouds, he felt lifted up in heart by the insignificance of all
  things in comparison with the spirit of man.</p>

  <p>In the pitching and tossing of his 'ships of thought' he never
  lost the consciousness of Nature's beauty, and would pray the clouds
  to carry his sighs with them in their tranquil course through heaven.
  He loved the sunrise, birds, flowers, bees, fishes; nothing was
  meaningless to him; all things were letters in a divine alphabet,
  which might bring him a message from above. Nature was symbolic; the
  glow of dawn meant the glow of divine love; a wide view, true
  freedom; rays of sunshine, rays of divine glory; the setting sun,
  eternal light; stars, flowers of light in an everlasting spring.</p>

  <p>His love for the country, especially for its peacefulness, was
  free from the folly and excess of the pastoral poetry of his day. He
  did not paint Nature <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg159" id=
  "pg159">159</a></span>entirely for her own sake; man was always her
  master<a href="#f15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> in his poems, and he
  sometimes, very finely, introduced himself and his affairs at the
  close, and represented Nature as addressing himself.</p>

  <p>His descriptions are short, and he often tries to represent sounds
  onomato-poetically.</p>

  <p>This is from his ode, <i>Quiet Life</i><a href=
  "#f17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>O happy he who flies</p>

    <p>Far from the noisy world away--</p>

    <p>Who with the worthy and the wise</p>

    <p>Hath chosen the narrow way.</p>

    <p>The silence of the secret road</p>

    <p>That leads the soul to virtue and to God!...</p>

    <p>O streams, and shades, and hills on high,</p>

    <p>Unto the stillness of your breast</p>

    <p>My wounded spirit longs to fly--</p>

    <p>To fly and be at rest.</p>

    <p>Thus from the world's tempestuous sea,</p>

    <p>O gentle Nature, do I turn to thee....</p>

    <p>A garden by the mountain side</p>

    <p>Is mine, whose flowery blossoming</p>

    <p>Shews, even in spring's luxuriant pride,</p>

    <p>What Autumn's suns shall bring:</p>

    <p>And from mountain's lofty crown</p>

    <p>A clear and sparkling rill comes tumbling down;</p>

    <p>Then, pausing in its downward force</p>

    <p>The venerable trees among,</p>

    <p>It gurgles on its winding course;</p>

    <p>And, as it glides along,</p>

    <p>Gives freshness to the day and pranks</p>

    <p>With ever changing flowers its mossy banks.</p>

    <p>The whisper of the balmy breeze</p>

    <p>Scatters a thousand sweets around,</p>

    <p>And sweeps in music through the trees</p>

    <p>With an enchanting sound</p>

    <p>That laps the soul in calm delight</p>

    <p>Where crowns and kingdoms are forgotten quite.</p>

  <p>The poem, <i>The Starry Sky</i>,<a href="#f18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
  is full of lofty enthusiasm for Nature and piety:</p>

    <p>And turn my dazzled eye</p>

    <p>To this vain mortal state</p>

    <p>All mean and visionary, mean and desolate,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg160" id="pg160">160</a></span>A
    mingled joy and grief</p>

    <p>Fills all my soul with dark solicitude....</p>

    <p>List to the concert pure</p>

    <p>Of yon harmonious countless worlds of light.</p>

    <p>See, in his orbit sure</p>

    <p>Each takes his journey bright,</p>

    <p>Led by an unseen hand through the vast maze of night.</p>

    <p>See how the pale moon rolls</p>

    <p>Her silver wheel....</p>

    <p>See Saturn, father of the golden hours,</p>

    <p>While round him, bright and blest,</p>

    <p>The whole empyrean showers</p>

    <p>Its glorious streams of light on this low world of ours.</p>

    <p>But who to these can turn</p>

    <p>And weigh them 'gainst a weeping world like this,</p>

    <p>Nor feel his spirit burn</p>

    <p>To grasp so sweet a bliss</p>

    <p>And mourn that exile hard which here his portion is?</p>

    <p>For there, and there alone,</p>

    <p>Are peace and joy and never dying love:</p>

    <p>Day that shall never cease,</p>

    <p>No night there threatening,</p>

    <p>No winter there to chill joy's ever-during spring.</p>

    <p>Ye fields of changeless green</p>

    <p>Covered with living streams and fadeless flowers;</p>

    <p>Thou paradise serene,</p>

    <p>Eternal joyful hours</p>

    <p>Thy disembodied soul shall welcome in thy towers!</p>
  </div>

  <p>It was chiefly in Spanish literature at this time that Nature was
  used allegorically. Tieck<a href="#f19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> says: 'In
  Calderon's poetry, and that of his contemporaries, we often find, in
  romances and song-like metres, most charming descriptions of the sea,
  mountains, gardens, and woody valleys, but almost always used
  allegorically, and with an artistic polish which ends by giving us,
  not so much a real impression of Nature, as one of clever description
  in musical verse, repeated again and again with slight variations.'
  This is true of Leon, but far more of Calderon, since it belongs to
  the very essence of drama. But, despite his passion for description
  and his Catholic and conventional tone, there is inexhaustible fancy,
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg161" id=
  "pg161">161</a></span>splendid colour, and a modern element of
  individuality in his poems. His heroes are conscious of their own
  ego, feel themselves to be 'a miniature world,' and search out their
  own feelings 'in the wild waves of emotion' (as Aurelian, for
  example, in <i>Zenobia</i>).</p>

  <p>Fernando says in <i>The Constant Prince</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>These flowers awoke in beauty and delight</p>

    <p>At early dawn, when stars began to set;</p>

    <p>At eve they leave us but a fond regret,</p>

    <p>Locked in the cold embraces of the night.</p>

    <p>These shades that shame the rainbow's arch of light.</p>

    <p>Where gold and snow in purple pomp are met,</p>

    <p>All give a warning man should not forget,</p>

    <p>When one brief day can darken things so bright.</p>

    <p>'Tis but to wither that the roses bloom--</p>

    <p>'Tis to grow old they bear their beauteous flowers,</p>

    <p>One crimson bud their cradle and their tomb.</p>

    <p>Such are man's fortunes in this world of ours;</p>

    <p>They live, they die; one day doth end their doom,</p>

    <p>For ages past but seem to us like hours.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The warning which Zenobia gives her captor in his hour of triumph
  to beware of sudden reverses of fortune is finely conceived:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Morn comes forth with rays to crown her,</p>

    <p>While the sun afar is spreading</p>

    <p>Golden cloths most finely woven</p>

    <p>All to dry her tear-drops purely.</p>

    <p>Up to noon he climbs, then straightway</p>

    <p>Sinks, and then dark night makes ready</p>

    <p>For the burial of the sea</p>

    <p>Canopies of black outstretching--</p>

    <p>Tall ships fly on linen pinions,</p>

    <p>On with speed the breezes send it,</p>

    <p>Small the wide seas seem and straitened,</p>

    <p>To its quick flight onward tending.</p>

    <p>Yet one moment, yet one instant,</p>

    <p>And the tempest roars, uprearing</p>

    <p>Waves that might the stars extinguish,</p>

    <p>Lifted for that ship's o'erwhelming.</p>

    <p>Day, with fear, looks ever nightwards,</p>

    <p>Calms must storm await with trembling;</p>

    <p>Close behind the back of pleasure</p>

    <p>Evermore stalks sadness dreary.</p>

  <p>In <i>Life's a Dream</i> Prince Sigismund, chained in a dark
  prison, says:</p>

    <p>Scarcely 'tis a winged flower</p>

    <p>Or a richly plumaged spray,</p>

    <p>Ere the aerial halls of day</p>

    <p>It divideth rapidly,</p>

    <p>And no more will debtor be</p>

    <p>To the nest it hates to quit;</p>

    <p>But, with more of soul than it,</p>

    <p>I am grudged its liberty.</p>

    <p>And the beast was born, whose skin</p>

    <p>Scarce those beauteous spots and bars,</p>

    <p>Like to constellated stars,</p>

    <p>Ere the instinct doth begin:</p>

    <p>Of its fierceness and its pride,</p>

    <p>And its lair on every side,</p>

    <p>It has measured far and nigh;</p>

    <p>While, with better instinct, I</p>

    <p>Am its liberty denied.</p>

    <p>Scarce a finny bark of speed</p>

    <p>I that freedom am denied.</p>

    <p>Born the streamlet was, a snake</p>

    <p>Which unwinds the flowers among,</p>

    <p>Silver serpent, that not long</p>

    <p>May to them sweet music make,</p>

    <p>Ere it quits the flowery brake,</p>

    <p>Onward hastening to the sea</p>

    <p>With majestic course and free,</p>

  <p>There is a striking remark about a garden; Menon says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>A beautiful garden surrounded by wild forest</p>

    <p>Is the more beautiful the nearer it approaches its opposite.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Splendour of colour was everything with Calderon, but it was
  splendour of so stiff and formal a kind, that, like the whole of his
  intensely severe, even inquisitorial outlook, it leaves us cold.</p>

  <p>We must turn to Shakespeare to learn how strongly <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg164" id="pg164">164</a></span>the pulse of
  sympathy for Nature could beat in contemporary drama. Goethe said:
  'In Calderon you have the wine as the last artificial result of the
  grape, but expressed into the goblet, highly spiced and sweetened,
  and so given you to drink; but in Shakespeare you have the whole
  natural process of its ripening besides, and the grapes themselves
  one by one, for your enjoyment, if you will.'</p>

  <p>In <i>Worship at the Cross</i> there is pious feeling for Nature
  and mystical feeling side by side with an obnoxious fanaticism,
  superstition, and other objectionable traits<a href=
  "#f20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>; and mystical confessions of the same sort
  may be gathered in numbers from the works of contemporary monks and
  nuns. Even of such a fanatic and self-tormentor as the Spanish
  Franciscan Petrus von Alcantara (1562), his biographer says that
  despite his strict renunciation of the world, he retained a most warm
  and deep feeling for Nature.</p>

  <p>'Whatever he saw of the outer world increased his devotion and
  gave it wings. The starry sky seen through his little monastery
  window, often kept him rapt in deep meditation for hours; often he
  was as if beside himself, so strong was his pious feeling when he saw
  the power and glory of God reflected in charming flowers and
  plants.'</p>

  <p>When Gregorio Lopez (1596), a man who had studied many sides of
  Nature, was asked if so much knowledge confused him, he answered: 'I
  find God in all things, great and small.' Similar remarks are
  attributed to many others.</p>

  <p>Next to Leon, as a poet in enthusiasm and mysticism, came St
  Teresa von Avila. She was especially notable for the ravishingly
  pretty pictures and comparisons she drew from Nature to explain the
  soul life of the Christian.<a href="#f20"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In all these outpourings of mystic feeling for Nature, there was
  no interest in her entirely for her own sake; they were all more or
  less dictated by <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg165" id=
  "pg165">165</a></span>religious feeling. It was in the later German
  and Italian mystics--for example, Bruno, Campanella, and Jacob
  Boehme--that a more subjective and individual point of view was
  attained through Pantheism and Protestantism.</p>

  <p>The Protestant free-speaking Shakespeare shewed a far more intense
  feeling for Nature than the Catholic Calderon. <span class=

  <h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <h3>SHAKESPEARE'S SYMPATHY FOR NATURE</h3>

  <p>The poetry of India may serve as a measure of the part which
  Nature can play in drama; it is full of comparisons and
  personifications, and eloquent expressions of intimate sympathy with
  plants and animals. In Greek tragedy, Nature stepped into the
  background; metaphors, comparisons, and personifications are rarer;
  it was only by degrees, especially in Sophocles and Euripides, in the
  choruses and monologues, that man's interest in her appeared, and he
  began to greet the light or the sky, land or sea, to attribute love,
  pity, or hate to her, or find comfort in her lonely places. During
  the Middle Ages, drama lay fallow, and the blossoming period of
  French tragedy, educated to the pathos of Seneca, only produced cold
  declamation, frosty rhetoric; of any real sympathy between man and
  Nature there was no question.</p>

  <p>Over this mediæval void Calderon was the bridge to
  Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>Shakespeare reached the Greek standpoint and advanced far beyond
  it. He was not only the greatest dramatist of modern times as to
  human action, suffering, and character, but also a genius in the
  interpretation of Nature.<a href="#g1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In place of the narrow limits of the old dramatists, he had the
  wider and maturer modern vision, and, despite his mastery of
  language, he was free both <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg167" id=
  "pg167">167</a></span>from the exaggeration and redundance of
  Oriental drama, and from the mere passion for describing, which so
  often carried Calderon away.</p>

  <p>In him too, the subjectivity, which the Renaissance brought into
  modern art, was still more fully developed. His metaphors and
  comparisons shew this, and, most of all, the very perfect art with
  which he assigns Nature a part in the play, and makes her not only
  form the appropriate background, dark or bright as required, but
  exert a distinct influence upon human fate.</p>

  <p>As Carrière points out:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At a period which had painting for its leading art, and was
    turning its attention to music, his mental accord produced effects
    in his works to which antiquity was a stranger.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Herder had already noted that Shakespeare gives colour and
  atmosphere where the Greek only gave outline. And although
  Shakespeare's outlines are drawn with more regard to fidelity than to
  actual beauty, yet, like a great painter, he brings all Nature into
  sympathy with man. We feel the ghostly shudder of the November night
  in <i>Hamlet</i>, breathe the bracing Highland air in <i>Macbeth</i>,
  the air of the woods in <i>As You Like It</i>; the storm on the heath
  roars through Lear's mad outburst, the nightingale sings in the
  pomegranate outside Julia's window.</p>

  <p>'How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank,' when Love solves
  all differences in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>! On the other hand,
  when Macbeth is meditating the murder of Duncan, the wolf howls, the
  owl hoots, and the cricket cries. And since Shakespeare's characters
  often act out of part, so that intelligible motive fails, while it is
  important to the poet that each scene be raised to dramatic level and
  viewed in a special light, Goethe's words apply:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Here everything which in a great world event passes secretly
    through the air, everything which at the very <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg168" id="pg168">168</a></span>moment of a
    terrible occurrence men hide away in their hearts, is expressed;
    that which they carefully shut up and lock away in their minds is
    here freely and eloquently brought to light; we recognize the truth
    to life, but know not how it is achieved.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Amorous passion in his hands is an interpreter of Nature; in one
  of his sonnets he compares it to an ocean which cannot quench
  thirst.</p>

  <p>In Sonnet 130 he says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;</p>

    <p>Coral is far more red than her lips' red;</p>

    <p>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dim;</p>

    <p>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.</p>

    <p>I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,</p>

    <p>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;</p>

    <p>And in some perfumes is there more delight</p>

    <p>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks....</p>

    <p>And yet, by Heaven, I think my love as rare</p>

    <p>As any she belied by false compare.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His lady-love is a mirror in which the whole world is
  reflected:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind....</p>

      <p>For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,</p>

      <p>The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,</p>

      <p>The mountain or the sea, the day or night,</p>

      <p>The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature.</p>

      <p class="i14">(Sonnet 113.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>When she leaves him it seems winter even in spring:</p>

      <p>'For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,</p>

      <p>And thou away, the very birds are mute.'</p>

      <p class="i14">(Sonnet 97.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here, as in the dramas,<a href="#g2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> contrasts
  in Nature are often used to point contrasts in life:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame</p>

    <p>Which like a canker in the fragrant rose</p>

    <p>Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!</p>

    <p>O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!</p>

    <p class="i14">(Sonnet 95.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>and</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>No more be grieved at that which thou hast done;</p>

    <p>And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.</p>

    <p class="i14">(Sonnet 35.)</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The ornament of beauty is suspect</p>

    <p>A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air,</p>

    <p>For canker vice the sweetest buds did love,</p>

    <p>In me thou see'st the twilight of such day</p>

    <p>As after sunset fadeth in the west,</p>

  <p>There are no better similes for the oncoming of age and death,
  than the sere leaf trembling in the wind, the twilight of the setting

  <p>It is astonishing to see how Shakespeare noted the smallest and
  most fragile things, and found the most poetic expression for them
  without any sacrifice of truth to Nature.</p>

  <p>Juliet is 'the sweetest flower of all the field.' Laertes says to
  Ophelia:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour</p>

    <p>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</p>

    <p>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</p>

    <p>Forward not permanent, sweet not lasting,</p>

    <p>The perfume and suppliance of a moment.</p>

    <p>The canker galls the infants of the spring</p>

    <p>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed;</p>

    <p>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</p>

    <p>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</p>

    <p class="i14">(<i>Hamlet.</i>)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Hamlet soliloquizes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</p>

    <p>Seems to me all the uses of this world.</p>

    <p>Fie on't, O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden</p>

    <p>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</p>

    <p>Possess it merely.</p>
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly
    frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
    excellent canopy the air, look you--this brave o'erhanging
    firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it
    appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation
    of vapours.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But the great advance which he made is seen far more in the
  sympathetic way in which he drew Nature into the action of the
  play.</p>

  <p>He established perfect harmony between human fate and the natural
  phenomena around it.</p>

  <p>There are moonlight nights for Romeo and Juliet's <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg176" id="pg176">176</a></span>brief dream, when
  all Nature, moon, stars, garden, seemed steeped in love together.</p>

  <p>He places his melancholy, brooding Hamlet</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In a land of mist and long nights, under a gloomy sky, where day
    is only night without sleep, and the tragedy holds us imprisoned
    like the North itself, that damp dungeon of Nature. (BOERNE.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What a dark shudder lies o'er Nature in <i>Macbeth</i>! And in
  <i>Lear</i>, as Jacobi says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>What a sight! All Nature, living and lifeless, reasonable and
    unreasonable, surges together, like towering storm clouds, hither
    and thither; it is black oppressive Nature with only here and there
    a lightning flash from God--a flash of Providence, rending the
    clouds.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>One must look at the art by which this is achieved in order to
  justify such enthusiastic expressions. Personification of Nature lies
  at the root of it, and to examine this in the different poets forms
  one of the most interesting chapters of comparative poetry,
  especially in Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>With him artistic personification reached a pitch never attained
  before. We can trace the steps by which Greece passed from mythical
  to purely poetic personification, increasing in individuality in the
  Hellenic period; but Shakespeare opened up an entirely new region by
  dint of that flashlight genius of imagination which combined and
  illuminated all and everything.</p>

  <p>Hense says<a href="#g5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The personification is plastic when Æschylus calls the heights
    the neighbours of the stars; individual, when Shakespeare speaks of
    hills that kiss the sky. It is plastic that fire and sea are foes
    who conspire together and keep faith to destroy the Argive army; it
    is individual to call sea and wind old wranglers who enter into a
    momentary armistice. Other personifications of Shakespeare's, as
    when he speaks of the 'wanton wind,' calls laughter a fool, and
    describes time as having a wallet on his back wherein he puts alms
    for oblivion, are of a kind which did not, and could not, exist in
    antiquity.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg177" id="pg177">177</a></span>
  The richer a man's mental endowment, the more individual his
  feelings, the more he can see in Nature.</p>

  <p>Shakespeare's fancy revelled in a wealth of images; new metaphors,
  new points of resemblance between the inner and outer worlds, were
  for ever pouring from his inexhaustible imagination.</p>

  <p>The motive of amorous passion, for instance, was a very
  divining-rod in his hands, revealing the most delicate relations
  between Nature and the soul. Ibykos had pointed the contrast between
  the gay spring time and his own unhappy heart in which Eros raged
  like 'the Thracian blast.' Theocritus had painted the pretty
  shepherdess drawing all Nature under the spell of her charms;
  Akontios (Kallimachos) had declared that if trees felt the pangs and
  longings of love, they would lose their leaves; all such ideas,
  modern in their way, had been expressed in antiquity.</p>

  <p>This is Shakespeare's treatment of them:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>How like a winter hath my absence been</p>

      <p>From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!</p>

      <p>What old December's bareness everywhere!</p>

      <p>And yet this time removed was summer time,</p>

      <p>The teeming autumn, big with rich increase ...</p>

      <p>And thou away the very birds are mute,</p>

    <p>Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</p>

  <p>He is unusually rich in descriptive phrases:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The weary sun hath made a golden set,</p>

      <p>And by the bright track of his golden car</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4">The all-cheering sun</p>

      <p>Should in the farthest East begin to draw</p>

      <p>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed.</p>

  <p>Goethe calls winds and waves lovers. In <i>Troilus and
  Cressida</i> we have:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The sea being smooth,</p>

    <p>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</p>

    <p>Upon her patient breast, making their way</p>

    <p>With those of nobler bulk!</p>

    <p>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</p>

    <p>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</p>

    <p>The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,</p>

    <p>Bounding between two moist elements</p>

    <p>Like Perseus' horse.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And further on in the same scene:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!</p>

    <p>Commotion in the winds!</p>

    <p>... the bounded waters</p>

    <p>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The personification of the river in <i>Henry IV.</i> is half
  mythical:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank</p>

    <p>In single opposition, hand to hand,</p>

    <p>He did confound the best part of an hour</p>

    <p>In changing hardiment with great Glendower;</p>

    <p>Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,</p>

    <p>Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;</p>

    <p>Who, then affrighted with their bloody looks,</p>

    <p>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</p>

    <p>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</p>

    <p>Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Striking instances of personification from <i>Antony and
  Cleopatra</i> are:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne</p>

    <p>Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold;</p>

    <p>Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that</p>

    <p>The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,</p>

    <p>Which to the time of flutes kept stroke, and made</p>

    <p>The water which they beat to follow faster</p>

    <p>As amorous of their strokes.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg181" id="pg181">181</a></span>
  And Antony, enthron'd in the market-place, sat alone</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Whistling to the air, which but for vacancy</p>

    <p>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too</p>

    <p>And made a gap in nature.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Instead of accumulating further instances of these very modern and
  individual (and sometimes far-fetched) personifications, it is of
  more interest to see how Shakespeare used Nature, not only as
  background and colouring, but to act a part of her own in the play,
  so producing the grandest of all personifications.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of Act III. in <i>King Lear</i>, Kent asks:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Who's there beside foul weather?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Gentleman</i>: One minded like the weather, most
      unquietly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Kent</i>: Where's the King?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Gent</i>: Contending with the fretful elements.</p>

      <p>Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,</p>

      <p>Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,</p>

      <p>That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,</p>

      <p>Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage</p>

      <p>Catch in their fury and make nothing of;</p>

      <p>Strives in his little world of men to outscorn</p>

      <p>The to-and-fro conflicting wind and rain.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the stormy night on the wild heath the poor old man hears the
  echo of his own feelings in the elements; his daughters' ingratitude,
  hardness, and cruelty produce a moral disturbance like the
  disturbance in Nature; he breaks out:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Blow, wind, and crack your cheeks. Rage! Blow!</p>

    <p>You cataracts and hurricanes, spout</p>

    <p>Till you have drench'd our steeples, drowned the cocks!</p>

    <p>You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,</p>

    <p>Vaunt couriers of oak-cleaving thunder-bolts,</p>

    <p>Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,</p>

    <p>Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!</p>

    <p>Crack nature's moulds, all germens spill at once</p>

    <p>That make ungrateful man....</p>

    <p>Rumble thy bellyful! Spit fire, spout rain!</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg182" id=
    "pg182">182</a></span></p>

    <p>Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters,</p>

    <p>I tax you not, you elements, with unkindness;</p>

    <p>I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,</p>

    <p>You owe me no subscription; then, let fall</p>

    <p>Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,</p>

    <p>A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man:</p>

    <p>But yet I call you servile ministers,</p>

    <p>That will with two pernicious daughters join</p>

    <p>Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head</p>

    <p>So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!</p>
  </div>

  <p>How closely here animate and inanimate Nature are woven together,
  the reasoning with the unreasoning. The poet makes the storm, rain,
  thunder, and lightning live, and at the same time endues his human
  figures with a strength of feeling and passion which gives them
  kinship to the elements. In <i>Othello</i>, too, there <i>is</i>
  uproar in Nature:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Do but stand upon the foaming shore,</p>

    <p>The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds....</p>

    <p>I never did like molestation view</p>

    <p>On the enchafed flood.</p>
  </div>

  <p>but even the unruly elements spare Desdemona:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Tempests themselves, high seas and howling winds,</p>

    <p>The gather'd rocks and congregated sands.</p>

    <p>Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel--</p>

    <p>As having sense of beauty, do omit</p>

    <p>Their mortal natures, letting go safely by</p>

    <p>The divine Desdemona.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Cassio lays stress upon 'the great contention of the sea and
  skies'; but when Othello meets Desdemona, he cries:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">O my soul's joy!</p>

    <p>If after every tempest come such calms,</p>

    <p>May the winds blow till they have wakened death!</p>

    <p>And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas</p>

    <p>Olympus-high, and duck again as low</p>

    <p>As hell's from heaven. If it were now to die,</p>

    <p>'Twere now to be most happy.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Iago calls the elements to witness his truthfulness:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,</p>

    <p>You elements that clip us round about,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg183" id=
    "pg183">183</a></span></p>

    <p>Witness, that here Iago doth give up</p>

    <p>The execution of his wit, hands, heart,</p>

    <p>To wrong'd Othello's service.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nature is disgusted at Othello's jealousy:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;</p>

    <p>The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets,</p>

    <p>Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth</p>

    <p>And will not hear it.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In terrible mental confusion he cries:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>O insupportable, O heavy hour!</p>

    <p>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse</p>

    <p>Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe</p>

    <p>Should yawn at alteration.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Unhappy Desdemona sings:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,</p>

    <p>Sing all a green willow;</p>

    <p>Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,</p>

    <p>Sing willow, willow, willow;</p>

    <p>The fresh streams ran by her and murmur'd her moans,</p>

    <p>Sing willow, willow, willow.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A song in <i>Cymbeline</i> contains a beautiful personification of
  flowers:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Hark! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,</p>

    <p>And Phoebus 'gins arise,</p>

    <p>His steeds to water at those springs</p>

    <p>On chalic'd flowers that lies;</p>

    <p>And winking Mary-buds begin</p>

    <p>To ope their golden eyes;</p>

    <p>With everything that pretty is,</p>

    <p>My lady sweet, arise;</p>

    <p>Arise! Arise!</p>
  </div>

  <p>The clearest expression of sympathy for Nature is in
  <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

  <p>Repeatedly we meet the idea that Nature shudders before the crime,
  and gives signs of coming disaster.</p>

  <p>Macbeth himself says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">Stars, hide your fires!</p>

    <p>Let not light see my black and deep desires;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg184" id=
    "pg184">184</a></span>The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be</p>

    <p>Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and Lady Macbeth:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i4">... The raven himself is hoarse</p>

    <p>That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</p>

    <p>Under my battlements.... Come, thick night,</p>

    <p>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</p>

    <p>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</p>

    <p>Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark</p>

    <p>To cry 'Hold! hold!'...</p>
  </div>

  <p>The peaceful castle to which Duncan comes all unsuspectingly, is
  in most striking contrast to the fateful tone which pervades the
  tragedy. Duncan says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air</p>

    <p>Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself</p>

    <p>Unto our gentle senses.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and Banquo:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">This guest of summer,</p>

    <p>The temple-haunting martlet, does approve</p>

    <p>By his loved masonry, that the heaven's breath</p>

    <p>Smells wooingly here; no jetty, frieze,</p>

    <p>Buttress, nor coign of vantage but this bird</p>

    <p>Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle;</p>

    <p>Where they most breed and haunt I have observ'd</p>

    <p>The air is delicate.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Perhaps the familiar swallow has never been treated with more
  discrimination; and at this point of the tale of horror it has the
  effect of a ray of sunshine in a sky dark with storm clouds.</p>

  <p>In Act II. Macbeth describes his own horror and Nature's:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">Now o'er the one half world</p>

    <p>Nature seems dead.... Thou sure and firm-set earth,</p>

    <p>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</p>

    <p>Thy very stones prate of my whereabouts.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Lady Macbeth says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman</p>

    <p>Which gives the stern'st good-night.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg185" id="pg185">185</a></span>
  Lenox describes this night:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The night has been unruly: where we lay</p>

    <p>Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,</p>

    <p>Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death</p>

    <p>And prophesying, with accents terrible,</p>

    <p>Of dire combustion and confus'd events,</p>

    <p>New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird</p>

    <p>Clamour'd the live-long night: some say, the earth</p>

    <p>Was feverish and did shake.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and later on, an old man says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Three score and ten I can remember well;</p>

    <p>Within the volume of which time I have seen</p>

    <p>Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night</p>

    <p>Hath trifled former knowings.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Rosse answers him:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">Ah, good father,</p>

    <p>Thou see'st the heavens, as troubled with man's act,</p>

    <p>Threaten his bloody stage; by the clock 'tis day,</p>

    <p>And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.</p>

    <p>Is't night's predominance or the day's shame</p>

    <p>That darkness does the-face of earth entomb</p>

    <p>When living light should kiss it?</p>
  </div>

  <p>The whole play is a thrilling expression of the sympathy for
  Nature which attributes its own feelings to her--a human shudder in
  presence of the wicked--a human horror of crime, most thrilling of
  all in Macbeth's words:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i8">Come, seeling night,</p>

    <p>Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,</p>

    <p>And with thy bloody and invisible hand</p>

    <p>Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond</p>

    <p>Which keeps me pale.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Hamlet</i>, too, Nature is shocked at man's mis-deeds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i4">... Such an act (the queen's)</p>

    <p>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty</p>

    <p class="i4">... Heaven's face doth glow,</p>

    <p>Yea, this solidity and compound mass</p>

    <p>With tristful visage, as against the doom,</p>

    <p>Is thought-sick at the act.</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg186" id="pg186">186</a></span>

  <p>But there are other personifications in this most wonderful of all
  tragedies, such as the magnificent one:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>But look, the dawn, in russet mantle clad.</p>

    <p>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The first player declaims:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>But, as we often see, against some storm</p>

    <p>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</p>

    <p>The bold winds speechless, and the orb below</p>

    <p>As hush as death....</p>
  </div>

  <p>Ophelia dies:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When down her weedy trophies and herself</p>

    <p>Fell in the weeping brook.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and Laertes commands:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Lay her i' the earth,</p>

    <p>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh</p>

    <p>May violets spring.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Thus Shakespeare's great imagination gave life and soul to every
  detail of Nature, and he obtained the right background for his
  dramas, not only through choice of scenery, but by making Nature a
  sharer of human impulse, happy with the happy, shuddering in the
  presence of wickedness.</p>

  <p>He drew every phase of Nature with the individualizing touch which
  stamps her own peculiar character, and also brings her into sympathy
  with the inner life, often with that poetic intuition which is so
  closely allied to mythology. And this holds good not only in dealing
  with the great elementary forces--storms, thunder, lightning,
  etc.--but with flowers, streams, the glow of sunlight. Always and
  everywhere the grasp of Nature was intenser, more individual, and
  subjective, than any we have met hitherto.</p>

  <p>Idyllic feeling for Nature became sympathetic in his hands.

  <h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <h3>THE DISCOVERY OF THE BEAUTY OF LANDSCAPE IN PAINTING</h3>

  <p>The indispensable condition of landscape-painting--painting, that
  is, which raises the representation of Nature to the level of its
  main subject and paints her entirely for her own sake--is the power
  to compose separate studies into a whole and imbue that with an
  artistic idea. It was therefore impossible among people like the
  Hebrews,<a href="#h1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> whose eyes were always fixed
  on distance and only noted what lay between in a cursory way, and
  among those who considered detail without relation to a whole, as we
  have seen in mediæval poetry until the Renaissance. But just as study
  of the laws of aerial and linear perspective demands a trained and
  keen eye, and therefore implies interest in Nature, so the artistic
  idea, the soul of the picture, depends directly upon the degree of
  the artist's feeling for her Literature and painting are equal
  witnesses to the feeling for Nature, and so long as scenery was only
  background in poetry, it had no greater importance in painting.
  Landscape painting could only arise in the period which produced
  complete pictures of scenery in poetry--the sentimental idyllic
  period.</p>

  <p>We have seen how in the Italian Renaissance the fetters of dogma,
  tradition, and mediæval custom were removed, and servility and
  visionariness gave place to healthy individuality and realism; how
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg188" id="pg188">188</a></span>man
  and the world were discovered anew; and further, how among the other
  Romanic nations a lively feeling for Nature grew up, partly idyllic,
  partly mystic; and finally, how this feeling found dramatic
  expression in Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>Natural philosophy also, in the course of its search for truth, as
  it threw off both one-sided Christian ideas and ancient traditions,
  came gradually to feel an interest in Nature; not only her laws, but
  her beauty, became an object of enthusiastic study. By a very long
  process of development the Hellenic feeling for Nature was reached
  again in the Renaissance; but it always remained, despite its
  sentimental and pantheistic elements, sensual, superficial, and
  naive, in comparison with Christian feeling, which a warmer heart and
  a mind trained in scholastic wisdom had rendered more profound and
  abstract. Hence Nature was sometimes an object of attention in
  detail, sometimes in mass.<a href="#h2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As we come to the first landscape painters and their birthplace in
  the Netherlands, we see how steady and orderly is the development of
  the human mind, and how factors that seem isolated are really links
  in one chain.</p>

  <p>In the Middle Ages, landscape was only background with more or
  less fitness to the subject. By the fifteenth century it was richer
  in detail, as we see in Pisanello and the Florentines Gozzoli and
  Mantegna. The poetry of earth had been discovered; the gold grounds
  gave way to field, wood, hill, and dale, and the blue behind the
  heads became a dome of sky. In the sixteenth century, Giorgione
  shewed the value of effects of light, and Correggio's backgrounds
  were in harmony with his tender, cheerful scenes. Titian loved to
  paint autumn; the sunny days of October with blue grapes, golden
  oranges, and melons; and evening with deep harmonies of colour over
  the sleeping earth. He was a great pioneer in the realm of
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg189" id=
  "pg189">189</a></span>landscape. With Michael Angelo not a blade of
  grass grew; his problem was man alone. Raphael's backgrounds, on the
  other hand, are life-like in detail: his little birds could fly out
  of the picture, the stems of his plants seem to curve and bend
  towards us, and we look deep into the flower they hold out.<a href=
  "#h3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the German Renaissance too, the great masters limited
  themselves to charming framework and ingenious arabesques for their
  Madonnas and Holy Families. But, as Lübke says,<a href=
  "#h4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> one soon sees that Dürer depended on
  architecture for borders and backgrounds far less than Holbein; he
  preferred landscape.</p>

  <p>'The charm of this background is so great, the inwardness of
  German feeling for Nature so strongly expressed in it, that it has a
  special value of its own, and the master through it has become the
  father of landscape painting.'<a href="#h5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This must be taken with a grain of salt; but, at all events, it is
  true that Dürer combined 'keen and devoted study of Nature (in the
  widest sense of the word) with a penetration which aimed at tracing
  her facts up to their source.'<a href="#h6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> It is
  interesting to see how these qualities overcame his theoretical views
  on Nature and art.<a href="#h7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Dürer's deep
  respect for Nature proved him a child of the new era. Melanchthon
  relates that he often regretted that he had been too much attracted
  in his younger days by variety and the fantastic, and had only
  understood Nature's simple truth and beauty later in life.</p>

  <p>His riper judgment preferred her to all other models. Nature, in
  his remarks on the theory of art, includes the animate and the
  inanimate, living creatures as well as scenery, and it is interesting
  to observe that his admiration of her as a divine thing was due to
  deep religious feeling. In his work on Proportion<a href=
  "#h8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> he says:</p>

  <p>'Certainly art is hidden in Nature, and he who is able to separate
  it by force from Nature, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg190" id=
  "pg190">190</a></span>possesses it. Never imagine that you can or
  will surpass Nature's achievements; human effort cannot compare with
  the ability which her Creator has given her. Therefore no man can
  ever make a picture which excels Nature's; and when, through much
  copying, he has seized her spirit, it cannot be called original work,
  it is rather something received and learnt, whose seeds grow and bear
  fruit of their own kind. Thereby the gathered treasure of the heart,
  and the new creature which takes shape and form there, comes to light
  in the artist's work.'</p>

  <p>Elsewhere Dürer says 'a good painter's mind is full of figures,'
  and he repeatedly remarks upon the superabundant beauty of all living
  things which human intelligence rarely succeeds in reproducing.</p>

  <p>The first modern landscapes in which man was only accessory were
  produced in the Netherlands. Quiet, absorbed musing on the external
  world was characteristic of the nation; they studied the smallest and
  most trifling objects with care, and set a high value on minutiæ.</p>

  <p>The still-life work of their prime was only possible to such an
  easy-going, life-loving people; the delightful animal pictures of
  Paul Potter and Adrian van de Velde could only have been painted in
  the land of Reineke Fuchs. Carrière says about these masters of genre
  painting<a href="#h9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>: 'Through the emphasis laid
  upon single objects, they not only revealed the national
  characteristics, but penetrated far into the soul of Nature and
  mirrored their own feelings there, so producing works of art of a
  kind unknown to antiquity. That divine element, which the Greek saw
  in the human form, the Germanic race divined in all the visible forms
  of Nature, and so felt at one with them and able to reveal itself
  through them.</p>

  <p>'Nature was studied more for her own sake than in her relation to
  man, and scenery became no longer mere background, but the actual
  object of the picture. Animals, and even men, whether bathing
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg191" id="pg191">191</a></span>in the
  river, lying under trees, or hunting in the forest, were nothing but
  accessories; inorganic Nature was the essential element. The greatest
  Dutch masters did not turn their attention to the extraordinary and
  stupendous, the splendour of the high Alps or their horrible
  crevasses, or sunny Italian mountains reflected in their lakes or
  tropical luxuriance, but to common objects of everyday life. But
  these they grasped with a precision and depth of feeling which gave
  charm to the most trifling--it was the life of the universe divined
  in its minutiæ. In its treatment of landscape their genre painting
  displayed the very characteristics which had brought it into
  being.'<a href="#h10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The physical characters of the country favoured landscape painting
  too. No doubt the moist atmosphere and its silvery sheen, which add
  such freshness and brilliance to the colouring, influenced the
  development of the colour sense, as much as the absence of sharp
  contrasts in contour, the suggestive skies, and abundance of streams,
  woods, meadows, and dales.</p>

  <p>But it was in devotional pictures that the Netherlanders first
  tried their wings; landscape and scenes from human life did not free
  themselves permanently from religion and take independent place for
  more than a century later. The fourteenth-century miniatures shew the
  first signs of the northern feeling for Nature in illustrations of
  the seasons in the calendar pictures of religious manuscripts.
  Beginnings of landscape can be clearly seen in that threshold picture
  of Netherland art, the altar-piece at Ghent by the brothers Van Eyck,
  which was finished in 1432. It shews the most accurate observation:
  all the plants, grasses, flowers, rose bushes, vines, and palms, are
  correctly drawn; and the luxuriant valley in which the Christian
  soldiers and the knights are riding, with its rocky walls covered by
  undergrowth jutting stiffly forward, is very like the valley of the
  Maas.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg192" id="pg192">192</a></span>
  One sees that the charm of landscape has dawned upon the
  painters.</p>

  <p>Their skies are no longer golden, but blue, and flecked with
  cloudlets and alive with birds; wood and meadow shine in sappy green;
  fantastic rocks lie about, and the plains are bounded by low hills.
  They are drinking deep draughts from a newly-opened spring, and they
  can scarcely have enough of it. They would like to paint all the
  leaves and fruit on the trees, all the flowers on the grass, even all
  the dewdrops. The effect of distance too has been discovered, for
  there are blue hill-tops beyond the nearer green ones, and a
  foreground scene opens back on a distant plain (in the Ghent
  altar-piece, the scene with the pilgrims); but they still possess
  very few tones, and their overcrowded detail is almost all, from
  foreground to furthest distance, painted in the same luminous strong
  dark-green, as if in insatiable delight at the beauty of their own
  colour. The progress made by Jan van Eyck in landscape was
  immense.</p>

  <p>To the old masters Nature had been an unintelligible chaos of
  detail, but beauty, through ecclesiastical tradition, an abstract
  attribute of the Holy Family and the Saints, and they had used their
  best powers of imagination in accordance with this view. Hence they
  placed the Madonna upon a background of one colour, generally gilded.
  But now the great discovery was made that Nature was a distinct
  entity, a revelation and reflection of the divine in herself. And Jan
  van Eyck introduced a great variety of landscapes behind his
  Madonnas. One looks, for instance, through an open window to a wide
  stretch of country with fields and fortresses, and towns with streets
  full of people, all backed by mountains. And whether the scene
  itself, or only its background, lies in the open, the landscape is of
  the widest, enlivened by countless forms and adorned by splendid
  buildings.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg193" id="pg193">193</a></span>
  Molanus, the savant of Löwen, proclaimed Dierick Bouts, born like his
  predecessor Ouwater at Haarlem, to be the inventor of landscape
  painting (claruit inventor in describendo rare); but the van Eycks
  were certainly before him, though he increased the significance of
  landscape painting and shewed knowledge of aerial perspective and
  gradations of tone. Landscape was a distinct entity to him, and could
  excite the mood that suited his subject, as, for instance, in the
  side picture of the Last Supper, where the foreground is drawn with
  such exactness that every plant and even the tiny creatures crawling
  on the grass can be identified.</p>

  <p>The scenery of Roger van der Weyden of Brabant--river valleys
  surrounded by jagged rocks and mountains, isolated trees, and meadows
  bright with sappy green--is clearly the result of direct Nature
  study; it has a uniform transparent atmosphere, and a clear green
  shimmer lies over the foreground and gradually passes into blue haze
  further back.</p>

  <p>His pupil, Memling, shews the same fine gradations of tone. The
  composition of his richest picture, 'The Marriage of St Catherine,'
  did not allow space for an unbroken landscape, but the lines of wood
  and field converge to a vista in such a way that the general effect
  is one of unity.</p>

  <p>Joachim de Patenir, who appeared in 1515, was called a landscape
  painter by his contemporaries, because he reduced his sacred figures
  to a modest size, enlarged his landscape, and handled it with extreme
  care. He was very far from grasping it as a whole, but his method was
  synthetical; his river valleys, with masses of tree and bush and
  romantic rocks, fantastic and picturesque, with fortresses on the
  river banks, all shew this.</p>

  <p>Kerry de Bles was like him, but less accurate; with all the rest
  of the sixteenth-century painters of Brabant and Flanders, he did not
  rise to the idea of landscape as a whole.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg194" id="pg194">194</a></span>
  The most minute attention was given to the accurate painting of
  single objects, especially plants; the Flemings caring more for
  perfect truth to life, the Dutch for beauty. The Flemings generally
  sought to improve their landscape by embellishing its lines, while
  the Dutch gave its spirit, but adhered simply and strictly to Nature.
  The landscapes of Peter Brueghel the elder, with their dancing
  peasants surrounded by rocks, mills, groups of trees, are painful in
  their thoroughness; and Jan Brueghel carried imitation of Nature so
  far that his minutise required a magnifying-glass--it was veritable
  miniature work. He introduced fruit and flower painting as a new
  feature of art.</p>

  <p>Rubens and Brueghel often painted on each other's canvas, Brueghel
  supplying landscape backgrounds for Rubens' pictures, and Rubens the
  figures for Brueghel's landscapes. Yet Rubens himself was the best
  landscapist of the Flemish school. He was more than that. For
  Brueghel and his followers, with all their patience and industry,
  their blue-green landscape with imaginary trees, boundless distance
  and endless detail, were very far from a true grasp of Nature. It was
  Rubens and his school who really made landscape a legitimate
  independent branch of art. They studied it in all its aspects, quiet
  and homely, wild and romantic, some taking one and some the other:
  Rubens himself, in his large way, grasping the whole without losing
  sight of its parts. They all lifted the veil from Nature and saw her
  as she was (Falke).</p>

  <p>Brueghel put off the execution of a picture for which he had a
  commission from winter to spring, that he might study the flowers for
  it from Nature when they came out, and did not grudge a journey to
  Brussels now and then to paint flowers not to be had at Antwerp.
  There is a characteristic letter which he sent to the Archbishop of
  Milan with a picture:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg195" id="pg195">195</a></span> 'I
  send your Reverence the picture with the flowers, which are all
  painted from Nature. I have painted in as many as possible. I believe
  so many rare and different flowers have never been painted before nor
  so industriously. It will give a beautiful effect in winter; some of
  the colours almost equal Nature. I have painted an ornament under the
  flowers with artistic medallions and curiosities from the sea. I
  leave it to your reverence to judge whether the flowers do not far
  exceed gold and jewels in colour.'</p>

  <p>He also painted landscapes in which people were only accessory,
  sunny valleys with leafage, golden cornfields, meadows with rows of
  dancing country folk or reapers in the wheat.</p>

  <p>Rubens, though he felt the influence of southern light and
  sunshine as much as his fellows who had been in Italy, took his
  backgrounds from his native land, from parts round Antwerp, Mechlin,
  and Brussels. Foliage, water, and undulating ground were
  indispensable to him--were, to a certain extent, the actual bearers
  of the impression he wished to convey.</p>

  <p>Brueghel always kept a childlike attitude, delighting in details,
  and proud of the clever brush which could carry imitation to the
  point of deception. Rubens was the first to treat landscape in a bold
  subjective way. He opened the book of Nature, so to speak, not to
  spell out the words syllable by syllable, but to master her secret,
  to descend into the depths of her soul, and then reflect what he
  found there--in short, he fully understood the task of the landscape
  painter. The fifty landscapes of his which we possess, contain the
  whole scale from a state of idyllic repose to one of dramatic
  excitement and tension. Take, for instance, the evening scene with
  the rainbow in the Louvre, marvellous in its delicate gradations of
  atmospheric tone, and the equally marvellous thunderstorm in the
  Belvedere <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg196" id=
  "pg196">196</a></span>at Vienna, where a rain-cloud bursts under
  sulphur lightning, and a mountain stream, swollen to a torrent and
  lashed by the hurricane, carries all before it--trees, rocks,
  animals, and men.</p>

  <p>In France, scarcely a flower had been seen in literature since the
  Troubadour days, not even in the classical poetry of Corneille and
  Racine. There were idyllic features in Fénelon's <i>Telemachus</i>,
  and Ronsard borrowed motives from antiquity; but it was pastoral
  poetry which blossomed luxuriantly here as in Italy and Spain.</p>

  <p>Honoré d'Urfé's famous <i>Astrée</i> was much translated; but both
  his shepherds and his landscape were artificial, and the perfume of
  courts and carpet knights was over the whole, with a certain trace of
  sadness.</p>

  <p>The case was different with French painting. After the
  Netherlands, it was France, by her mediæval illustrated manuscripts,
  who chiefly aided in opening the world's eyes to landscape. Both the
  Poussins penetrated below the surface of Nature. Nicolas Poussin
  (1594-1665) painted serious stately subjects, such as a group of
  trees in the foreground, a hill with a classic building in the
  middle, and a chain of mountains in the distance, and laid more
  stress on drawing than colour. There was greater life in the pictures
  of his brother-in-law, Caspar Doughet, also called Poussin; his grass
  is more succulent, his winds sigh in the trees, his storm bends the
  boughs and scatters the clouds.</p>

  <p>It was Claude Lorraine (1600-1682) who brought the ideal style to
  its perfection. He inspired the very elements with mind and feeling;
  his valleys, woods, and seas were just a veil through which divinity
  was visible. All that was ugly, painful, and confused was purified
  and transfigured in his hands. There is no sadness or dejection in
  his pictures, but a spirit of serene beauty, free from ostentation,
  far-fetched contrast, or artificial glitter. Light <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg197" id="pg197">197</a></span>breezes blow in
  his splendid trees, golden light quivers through them, drawing the
  eye to a bright misty horizon; we say with Uhland, 'The sky is
  solemn, as if it would say "this is the day of the Lord."'</p>

  <p>Artistic feeling for Nature became a worship with Claude
  Lorraine.</p>

  <p>The Netherlands recorded all Nature's phases in noble emulation
  with ever-increasing delight.</p>

  <p>The poetry of air, cloudland, light, the cool freshness of
  morning, the hazy sultriness of noon, the warm light of evening, it
  all lives and moves in Cuyp's pictures and Wynant's, while Aart van
  der Meer painted moonlight and winter snow, and Jan van Goyen the
  melancholy of mist shot by sunlight. He, too--Jan van Goyen--was very
  clever in producing effect with very small means, with a few trees
  reflected in water, or a sand-heap--the art in which Ruysdael
  excelled all others. The whole poetry of Nature--that secret magic
  which lies like a spell over quiet wood, murmuring sea, still pool,
  and lonely pasture--took form and colour under his hands; so little
  sufficed to enchant, to rouse thought and feeling, and lead them
  whither he would. Northern seriousness and sadness brood over most of
  his work; the dark trees are overhung by heavy clouds and rain, mist
  and dusky shadows move among his ruins. He had painted, says
  Carrière, the peace of woodland solitude long before Tieck found the
  word for it.</p>

  <p>Beechwoods reflected in a stream, misty cloud masses lighted by
  the rising sun; he moves us with such things as with a morning hymn,
  and his picture of a swollen torrent forcing its way between graves
  which catch the last rays of the sun, while a cloud of rain shrouds
  the ruins of a church in the background, is an elegy which has taken
  shape and colour.</p>

  <p>Ruysdael marks the culminating point of this period of
  development, which had led from mere <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg198" id="pg198">198</a></span>backgrounds and single traits of
  Nature--even a flower stem or a blade of grass, up to elaborate
  compositions imbued by a single motive, a single idea.</p>

  <p>To conjure up with slight material a complete little world of its
  own, and waken responsive feeling, is not this the secret of the
  charm in the pictures of his school--in the wooded hill or peasant's
  courtyard by Hobbema, the Norwegian mountain scene of Albert van
  Everdingen, the dusky fig-trees, rugged crags, and foaming cataract,
  or the half-sullen, half-smiling sea-pieces of Bakhuysen and Van der
  Velde?</p>

  <p>All these great Netherlander far outstripped the poetry of their
  time; it was a hundred years later before mountain and sea found
  their painter in words, and a complete landscape picture was not born
  in German poetry until the end of the eighteenth century.

  <h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <h3>HUMANISM, ROCOCO, AND PIGTAIL</h3>

  <p>Many decades passed before German feeling for Nature reached the
  heights attained by the Italian Renaissance and the Netherland
  landscapists. In the Middle Ages, Germany was engrossed with
  ecclesiastical dogma--man's relation, not only to God, but to the one
  saving Church--and had little interest for Science and Art; and the
  great achievement of the fifteenth century, the Reformation, called
  for word and deed to reckon with a thousand years of old traditions
  and the slavery of intellectual despotism. The new time was born amid
  bitter throes. The questions at issue--religious and ecclesiastical
  questions concerned with the liberty of the Christian--were of the
  most absorbing kind, and though Germany produced minds of individual
  stamp such as she had never known before, characters of original and
  marked physiognomy, it was no time for the quiet contemplation of
  Nature. Mental life was stimulated by the new current of ideas and
  new delight in life awakened: yet there is scarcely a trace of the
  intense feeling for Nature which we have seen in Petrarch and Æneas
  Sylvius.</p>

  <p>Largely as it was influenced by the Italian Renaissance, it is
  certainly a mistake to reckon the Humanist movement in Germany, as
  Geiger does,<a href="#i1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> as a 'merely imported
  culture, entirely lacking independence.' The germ of this great
  movement <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg200" id=
  "pg200">200</a></span>towards mental freedom was contained in the
  general trend of the time, which was striving to free itself from the
  fetters of the Middle Ages in customs and education as well as dogma.
  It was chiefly a polemical movement, a fight between contentious
  savants. The writings of the Humanists at this naively sensuous
  period were full of the joy of life and love of pleasure; but
  scarcely any simple feeling for Nature can be found in them, and
  there was neither poet nor poem fit to be compared with Petrarch and
  his sonnets.</p>

  <p>Natural philosophy, too, was proscribed by scholastic wisdom; the
  real Aristotle was only gradually shelled out from under mediæval
  accretions. The natural philosopher, Conrad Summenhart<a href=
  "#i2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> (1450-1501) was quite unable to disbelieve
  the foolish legend, that the appearance of a comet foretold four
  certain events--heat, wind, war, and the death of princes. At the
  same time, not being superstitious, he held aloof from the crazy
  science of astrology and all the fraud connected with it. Indeed, as
  an observer of Nature, and still more as a follower and furtherer of
  the scholastic Aristotelian natural philosophy, he shewed a leaning
  towards the theory of development, for, according to him, the more
  highly organized structures proceed from those of lower organization,
  and these again form the inorganic under the influence of meteors and
  stars. The poet laureate Conrad Celtes (<i>b</i>. 1459), a singer of
  love and composer of four books about it, was a true poet. His
  incessant wandering, for he was always moving from place to place,
  was due in part to love of Nature and of novelty, but still more to a
  desire to spread his own fame. He lacked the naivete and openness to
  impressions of the true child of Nature; his songs in praise of
  spring, etc., scatter a colourless general praise, which is evidently
  the result of arduous thought rather than of direct impressions from
  without; and his many references <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg201" id="pg201">201</a></span>to ancient deities shew that he
  borrowed more than his phrases.</p>

  <p>Though geography was then closely bound up with the writing of
  history, as represented by Beatus Rhenanus (1485-1547) and Johann
  Aventinus, and patriotism and the accounts of new lands led men to
  wish to describe the beauties and advantages of their own, the
  imposing discoveries across the seas did not make so forcible an
  impression upon the German humanist as upon savants elsewhere,
  especially in Italy and Spain. A mystico-theosophical feeling for
  Nature, or rather a magical knowledge of her, flourished in Germany
  at this time among the learned, both among Protestants and those who
  were partially true to Catholicism. One of the strangest exponents of
  such ideas was Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim of Cologne<a href=
  "#i3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (1535). His system of the world abounded in
  such fantastic caprices as these: everything depends on harmony and
  sympathy; when one of Nature's strings is struck, the others sound
  with it: the analogical correspondences are at the same time magical:
  symbolic relations between natural objects are sympathetic also: a
  true love-bond exists between the elm and vine: the sun bestows life
  on man; the moon, growth; Mercury, imagination; Venus, love, etc. God
  is reflected in the macrocosm, gives light in all directions through
  all creatures, is adumbrated in man microcosmically, and so
  forth.</p>

  <p>Among others, Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus Paracelsus
  von Hohenheim (1541), ranked Nature and the Bible, like Agrippa, as
  the best books about God and the only ones without falsehood.</p>

  <p>'One must study the elements, follow Nature from land to land,
  since each single country is only one leaf in the book of creation.
  The eyes that find pleasure in this true experience are the true
  professors, and more reliable than all learned writings.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg202" id="pg202">202</a></span> He
  held man to be less God's very image than a microcosmic copy of
  Nature--the quintessence of the whole world. Other enthusiasts made
  similar statements. Sebastian Frank of Donauwörth (1543) looked upon
  the whole world as an open book and living Bible, in which to study
  the power and art of God and learn His will: everything was His
  image, all creatures are 'a reflection, imprint, and expression of
  God, through knowledge of which man may come to know the true Mover
  and Cause of all things.'</p>

  <p>He shewed warm feeling for Nature in many similes and
  descriptions<a href="#i4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>--in fact, much of his
  pithy drastic writing sounds pantheistic. But he was very far from
  the standpoint of the great Italian philosophers, Giordano Bruno and
  Campanella. Bruno, a poet as well as thinker, distinguished Nature in
  her self-development--matter, soul, and mind--as being stages and
  phases of the One.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The material of all things issues from the original womb,</p>

    <p>For Nature works with a master hand in her own inner depths;</p>

    <p>She is art, alive and gifted with a splendid mind.</p>

    <p>Which fashions its own material, not that of others,</p>

    <p>And does not falter or doubt, but all by itself</p>

    <p>Lightly and surely, as fire burns and sparkles.</p>

    <p>Easily and widely, as light spreads everywhere,</p>

    <p>Never scattering its forces, but stable, quiet, and at one,</p>

    <p>Orders and disposes of everything together.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Campanella, even in a revolting prison, sang in praise of the
  wisdom and love of God, and His image in Nature. He personified
  everything in her; nothing was without feeling; the very movements of
  the stars depended on sympathy and antipathy; harmony was the central
  soul of all things.</p>

  <p>The most extraordinary of all German thinkers was the King of
  Mystics, Jacob Böhme. Theist and pantheist at once, his mind was a
  ferment of different <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg203" id=
  "pg203">203</a></span>systems of thought. It is very difficult to
  unriddle his <i>Aurora</i>, but love of Nature, as well as love of
  God, is clear in its mystical utterances:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>God is the heart or source of Nature.</p>

    <p>Nature is the body of God.</p>
  </div>

  <p>'As man's mind rules his whole body in every vein and fills his
  whole being, so the Holy Ghost fills all Nature, and is its heart and
  rules in the good qualities of all things.'</p>

  <p>'But now heaven is a delightful chamber of pleasure, in which are
  all the powers, as in all Nature the sky is the heart of the
  waters.'</p>

  <p>In another place he calls God the vital power in the tree of life,
  the creatures His branches, and Nature the perfection and
  self-begotten of God.</p>

  <p>Nature's powers are explained as passion, will, and love, often in
  lofty and beautiful comparisons:</p>

  <p>'As earth always bears beautiful flowers, plants, and trees, as
  well as metals and animate beings, and these finer, stronger, and
  more beautiful at one time than another; and as one springs into
  being as another dies, causing constant use and work, so it is in
  still greater degree with the begetting of the holy mysteries<a href=
  "#i5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> ... creation is nothing else than a
  revelation of the all-pervading superficial godhead ... and is like
  the music of many flutes combined into one great harmony.'</p>

  <p>But the most representative man, both of the fifteenth century
  and, in a sense, of the German race, was Luther. That maxim of
  Goethe's for teaching and ethics,' Cheerfulness is the mother of all
  virtues, might well serve as a motto for Luther;</p>

  <p>The two men had much in common.</p>

  <p>The one, standing half in the Middle Ages, had to free himself
  from mental slavery by strength of will and courage of belief.</p>

  <p>The other, as the prophet of the nineteenth century, the
  incarnation of the modern man, had to shake off <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg204" id="pg204">204</a></span>the artificiality
  and weak sentimentality of the eighteenth.</p>

  <p>To both alike a healthy joy in existence was the root of being.
  Luther was always open to the influence of Nature, and,
  characteristically, the Psalter was his favourite book. 'Lord, how
  manifold are Thy works, in wisdom hast Thou made them all!'</p>

  <p>True to his German character, he could be profoundly sad; but his
  disposition was delightfully cheerful and healthy, and we see from
  his letters and table-talk, that after wife and child, it was in
  'God's dear world' that he took the greatest pleasure. He could not
  have enough of the wonders of creation, great or small. 'By God's
  mercy we begin to see the splendour of His works and wonders in the
  little flowers, as we consider how kind and almighty He is; therefore
  we praise and thank Him. In His creatures we see the power of His
  word--how great it is. In a peach stone, too, for hard as the shell
  is, the very soft kernel within causes it to open at the right
  time.'<a href="#i6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Again, 'So God is present in
  all creatures, even the smallest leaves and poppy seeds.'</p>

  <p>All that he saw of Nature inspired him with confidence in the
  fatherly goodness of God. He wrote, August 5th, 1530, to Chancellor
  Brneck:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I have lately seen two wonderful things: the first, looking from
    the window at the stars and God's whole beautiful sky dome, I saw
    never a pillar to support it, and yet it did not fall, and is still
    firm in its place. Now, there are some who search for such pillars
    and are very anxious to seize them and feel them, and because they
    cannot, fidget and tremble as if the skies would certainly fall ...
    the other, I also saw great thick clouds sweep over our heads, so
    heavy that they might be compared to a great sea, and yet I saw no
    ground on which they rested, and no vats in which they were
    contained, yet they did not fall on us, but greeted us with a frown
    and flew away. When they had gone, the rainbow lighted both the
    ground and the roof which had held them.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Luther often used very forcible images from <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg205" id="pg205">205</a></span>Nature. 'It is
  only for the sake of winter that we lie and rot in the earth; when
  our summer comes, our grain will spring up--rain, sun, and wind
  prepare us for it--that is, the Word, the Sacraments, and the Holy
  Ghost.'</p>

  <p>His Bible was an orchard of all sorts of fruit trees; in the
  introduction to the Psalter, he says of the thanksgiving psalms:
  'There one looks into the hearts of the saints as into bright and
  beautiful gardens--nay, as into heaven itself, where pure and happy
  thoughts of God and His goodness are the lovely flowers.'</p>

  <p>His description of heaven for his little son John is full of
  simple reverent delight in Nature, quite free from platonic and
  mystical speculation as to God's relation to His universe; and
  Protestant divines kept this tone up to the following century, until
  the days of rationalism and pietism.</p>

  <p>Of such spontaneous hearty joy in Nature as this, the national
  songs of a nation are always the medium. They were so now; for, while
  a like feeling was nowhere else to be found, the Volkslieder
  expressed the simple familiar relationship of the child of Nature to
  wood, tree, and flower in touching words and a half-mythical,
  half-allegorical tone which often revealed their old Germanic
  origin.</p>

  <p>There is a fourteenth-century song, probably from the Lower
  Rhine,<a href="#i7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> which suggests the poems of
  the eighth and ninth centuries, about a great quarrel between Spring,
  crowned with flowers, and hoary-headed Winter, in which one praises
  and the other blames the cuckoo for announcing Spring.</p>

  <p>In this song, Summer complains to mankind and other friends that a
  mighty master is going to drive him away; this mighty master, Winter,
  then takes up the word, and menaces Spring with the approach of
  frost, who will slight and imprison him, and then kill him; ice and
  hail agree with Winter, and storm, rain, snow, and bitter winds are
  called his vassals, etc.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg206" id="pg206">206</a></span>
  There are naive verses in praise of Spring and Summer:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When that the breezes blow in May,</p>

    <p>And snow melts from the wood away,</p>

    <p>Blue violets lift their heads on high,</p>

    <p>And when the little wood-birds sing,</p>

    <p>And flow'rets from the ground up-spring,</p>

    <p>Then everybody's glad.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Others complaining of Winter, who must have leave of absence, and
  the wrongs it has wrought are poured out to Summer. The little birds
  are very human; the owlet complains:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">Poor little owlet me!</p>

    <p>I have to fly all alone through the wood to-night;</p>

    <p>The branch I want to perch on is broken,</p>

    <p>The leaves are all faded,</p>

    <p>My heart is full of grief.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The cuckoo is either praised for bringing good news, or made fun
  of as the 'Gutzgauch.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>A cuckoo will fly to his heart's treasure, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The fable songs<a href="#i8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> of animal weddings
  are full of humour. The fox makes arrangements for his wedding: 'Up
  with you now, little birds! I am going to take a bride. The starling
  shall saddle the horses, for he has a grey mantle; the beaver with
  the cap of marten fur must be driver, the hare with his light foot
  shall be outrider; the nightingale with his clear voice shall sing
  the songs, the magpie with his steady hop must lead the dances,'
  etc.</p>

  <p>The nightingale, with her rich tones, is beloved and honoured
  before all the winged things; she is called 'the very dear
  nightingale,' and addressed as a lady.</p>

  <p>'Thou art a little woodbird, and flyest in and out the green wood;
  fair Nightingale, thou little woodbird, thou shalt be my
  messenger.'</p>

  <p>It is she who warns the girl against false love, or is the silent
  witness of caresses.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg207" id="pg207">207</a></span>
  There were a great many wishing songs: 'Were I a little bird and had
  two wings, I would fly to thee,' or 'Were I a wild falcon, I would
  take flight and fly down before a rich citizen's house--a little maid
  is there,' etc. 'And were my love a brooklet cold, and sprang out of
  a stone, little should I grieve if I were but a green wood; green is
  the wood, the brooklet is cold, my love is shapely.' The betrayed
  maiden cries: 'Would God I were a white swan! I would fly away over
  mountain and deep valley o'er the wide sea, so that my father and
  mother should not know where I was.'</p>

  <p>Flowers were used symbolically in many ways; roses are always the
  flowers of love. 'Pretty girls should be kissed, roses should be
  gathered,' was a common saying; and 'Gather roses by night, for then
  all the leaves are covered with cooling dew.' 'The roses are ready to
  be gathered, so gather them to-day. He who does not gather in summer,
  will not gather in winter.' There is tenderness in this: 'I only know
  a little blue flower, the colour of the sky; it grows in the green
  meadow, 'tis called forget-me-not.'</p>

  <p>These are sadder:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>There is a lime tree in this valley,</p>

    <p>O God! what does it there?</p>

    <p>It will help me to grieve</p>

    <p>That I have no lover.</p>
  </div>

  <p>'Alas! you mountains and deep valleys, is this the last time I
  shall see my beloved? Sun, moon, and the whole sky must grieve with
  me till my death.'</p>

  <p>Where lovers embrace, flowers spring out of the grass, roses and
  other flowers and grasses laugh, the trees creak and birds
  sing;<a href="#i9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> where lovers part, grass and
  leaves fade.<a href="#i10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Most touching of all is the idea, common to the national songs of
  all nations, that out of the grave of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg208" id="pg208">208</a></span>two lovers, lilies and roses spring
  up, or climbing plants, love thus outliving death.</p>

  <p>We look in vain among the master singers of the fifteenth and
  sixteenth centuries for such fresh heartfelt tones as these, although
  honest Hans Sachs shews joy in Nature here and there; most charmingly
  in the famous comparison of 'the Wittenberg Nightingale, which every
  one hears everywhere now,' in praise of Luther:</p>

  <p>'Wake up, the dawn is nigh! I hear a joyous nightingale singing in
  the green hedge, it fills the hills and valleys with its voice. The
  night is stooping to the west, the day is rising from the east, the
  morning red is leaping from the clouds, the sun looks through. The
  moon quenches her light; now she is pale and wan, but erewhile with
  false glamours she dazzled all the sheep and turned them from their
  pasture lands and pastor....'</p>

  <p>Fischart too, in his quaint description of a voyage on the Rhine
  in <i>Glückhaft Schiff</i>, shews little feeling for Nature; but in
  <i>Simplicissimus</i>, on the other hand, that monument of literature
  which reflected contemporary culture to a unique degree, it is very
  marked; the more so since it appeared when Germany lay crushed by the
  Thirty Years' War.</p>

  <p>When the hero as a boy was driven from his village home and fled
  into the forest, he came upon a hermit who took care of him, and
  waking at midnight, he heard the old man sing:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Come, nightingale, comfort of the night,</p>

    <p>Let your voice rise in a song of joy, come praise the
    Creator,</p>

    <p>While other birds are sound asleep and cannot sing!...</p>

    <p>The stars are shining in the sky in honour of God....</p>

    <p>My dearest little bird, we will not be the laziest of all</p>

    <p>And lie asleep; we will beguile the time with praise</p>

    <p>Till dawn refreshes the desolate woods.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Simplicissimus</i> goes on: 'During this song, methinks, it was
  as if nightingale, owl, and echo had combined <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg209" id="pg209">209</a></span>in song, and if
  ever I had been able to hear the morning star, or to try to imitate
  the melody on my bagpipe, I should have slipt away out of the hut to
  join in the melody, so beautiful it seemed; but I was asleep.'</p>

  <p>What was the general feeling for Nature in other countries during
  the latter half of the seventeenth century? In Italy and Spain it had
  assumed a form partly bucolic and idyllic, partly theosophically
  mystical; Shakespeare's plays had brought sympathy to maturity in
  England; the Netherlands had given birth to landscape painting, and
  France had the splendid poetic landscapes of Claude Lorraine. But the
  idealism thus reached soon degenerated into mannerism and
  artificiality, the hatching of empty effect.</p>

  <p>The aberrations of taste which found expression in the periwig
  style of Louis XIV., and in the pigtails of the eighteenth century,
  affected the feeling for Nature too. The histories of taste in
  general, and of feeling for Nature, have this in common, that their
  line of progress is not uniformly straightforward, but liable to
  zigzags. This is best seen in reviewing the different civilized races
  together. Moreover, new ideas, however forcible and original, even
  epoch-making, do not win acceptance at once, but rather trickle
  slowly through resisting layers; it is long before any new gain in
  culture becomes the common property of the educated, and hence
  opposite extremes are often found side by side--taste for what is
  natural with taste for what is artificial. Garden style is always a
  delicate test of feeling for Nature, shewing, as it does, whether we
  respect her ways or wish to impose our own. The impulse towards the
  modern French gardening came from Italy. Ancient and modern times
  both had to do with it. At the Renaissance there was a return to
  Pliny's style,<a href="#i11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> which the Cinque
  cento gardens copied. In this style laurel and box-hedges were clipt,
  and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg210" id=
  "pg210">210</a></span>marble statues placed against them, 'to break
  the uniformity of the dark green with pleasant silhouettes. One looks
  almost in vain for flowers and turf; even trees were exiled to a
  special wilderness at the edge of the garden; but the great ornament
  of the whole was never missing, the wide view over sunny plains and
  dome-capt towns, or over the distant shimmering sea, which had
  gladdened the eyes of Roman rulers in classic days.'<a href=
  "#i12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The old French garden as Maître Lenotre laid it out in Louis
  XIV.'s time at Versailles, St Germain, and St Cloud, was
  architectural in design, and directly connected, like Pliny's, with
  various parts of the house, by open halls, pavilions, and colonnades.
  Every part of it--from neat turf parterres bordered by box in front
  of the terrace, designs worked out in flowers or coloured stones, and
  double rows of orange spaliers, to groups of statues and
  fountains--belonged to one symmetrical plan, the focus of which was
  the house, standing free from trees, and visible from every point.
  Farther off, radiating avenues led the eye in the same direction, and
  every little intersecting alley, true to the same principle, ran to a
  definite object--obelisk, temple, or what not. There was no lack of
  bowers, giant shrubberies, and water-courses running canal-wise
  through the park, but they all fell into straight lines; every path
  was ruled by a ruler, the eye could follow it to its very end.
  Artifice was the governing spirit. As Falke says: 'Nature dared not
  speak but only supply material; she had to sacrifice her own
  inventive power to this taste and this art. Hills and woods were only
  hindrances; the straight lines of trees and hedges, with their medley
  of statues and "cabinets de verdure," demanded level ground, and the
  landscape eye of the period only tolerated woods as a finish to its
  cut and clipt artificialities.'<a href="#i13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Trees and branches were not allowed to grow at their own sweet
  will; they were cut into cubes, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg211"
  id="pg211">211</a></span>balls, pyramids, even into shapes of
  animals, as the gardener's fancy or his principles decreed; cypresses
  were made into pillars or hearts with the apex above or below; and
  the art of topiary even achieved complete hunting scenes, with
  hunters, stags, dogs, and hares in full chase on a hedge. Of such a
  garden one could say with honest Claudius, ''Tis but a tailor's joke,
  and shews the traces of the scissors; it has nothing of the great
  heart of Nature.'</p>

  <p>It was Nature in bondage: 'green architecture,' with all its
  parts, walls, windows, roofs, galleries cut out of leafage, and
  theatres with stage and wings in which silk and velvet marquises with
  full-bottomed wigs and lace jabots, and ladies in hooped petticoats
  and hair in towers, played at private theatricals.</p>

  <p>Where water was available, water devices were added. And in the
  midst of all this unnaturalness Greek mythology was introduced: the
  story of Daphne and Apollo appeared in one alley, Meleager and
  Atalanta in another, all Olympus was set in motion to fill up the
  walls and niches. And the people were like their gardens both in
  dress and manners; imposing style was everything.</p>

  <p>Then came the Rococo period of Louis XV. The great periwig
  shrivelled to a pigtail, and petty flourish took the place of
  Lenotre's grandezza.</p>

  <p>'The unnatural remained, the imposing disappeared and caprice took
  its place,' says Falke. Coquetry too. All the artistic output of the
  time bears this stamp, painting included. Watteau's scenery and
  people were unnatural and affected--mere inventions to suit the
  gallant <i>fêtes</i>. But he knew and loved Nature, though he saw her
  with the intoxicated eye of a lover who forgets the individual but
  keeps a glorified impression of her beauty, whereas Boucher's
  rosy-blue landscapes look as if he had never seen their originals.
  His world had nothing in common with Nature, and with reality
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg212" id="pg212">212</a></span>only
  this, that its sensuousness, gaiety, falsity, and coquetry were true
  to the period. But in both Watteau and Boucher there was a faint
  glimmer of the idyllic--witness the dash of melancholy in Watteau's
  brightest pictures. Feeling for Nature was seeking its lost path--the
  path it was to follow with such increased fervour.</p>

  <p>German literature too, in the seventeenth century, stood under the
  sign manual of the Pigtail and Periwig; it was baroque, stilted,
  bombastic, affected, feeling and form alike were forced, not
  spontaneous. Verses were turned out by machinery and glued together.
  Martin Opitz,<a href="#i14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> the recognized leader
  and king of poets, had travelled far, but there is no distinct
  feeling for Nature in his poetry. His words to a mountain:</p>

  <p>'Nature has so arranged pleasure here, that he who takes the
  trouble to climb thee is repaid by delight,' scarcely admit the
  inference that he understood the charm of distance in the modern
  sense. He took warmer interest in the bucolic side of country life;
  rhyming about the delightful places, dwellings of peace, with their
  myrtles, mountains, valleys, stones, and flowers, where he longed to
  be; and his <i>Spring Song</i>, an obvious imitation of the classics
  (Horace's <i>Beatus ille</i> was his model for <i>Zlatna</i>), has
  this conventional contrast between his heart and Nature.</p>

  <p>'The frosty ice must melt; snow cannot last any longer, Favonius;
  the gentle breeze is on the, fields again. Seed is growing
  vigorously, grass greening in all its splendour, trees are budding,
  flowers growing ...thou, too my heart, put off thy grief.'</p>

  <p>There is more nostalgia than feeling for Nature in this:</p>

  <p>'Ye birches and tall limes, waste places, woods and fields,
  farewell to you!</p>

  <p>'My comfort and my better dwelling-place is elsewhere!'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg213" id="pg213">213</a></span>
  But (and this Winter, strange to say, ignores) his pastorals have all
  the sentimental elegiac style of the Pigtail period.</p>

  <p>There had been German adaptations of foreign pastorals, such as
  Montreux, <i>Schãferei von der schönen Juliana</i>, since 1595;
  Urfé's <i>Astrée</i> and Montemayor's <i>Diana</i> appeared in 1619,
  and Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> ten years later.</p>

  <p>Opitz tried to widen the propaganda for this kind of poetry, and
  hence wrote, not to mention little pastorals such as <i>Daphne,
  Galatea, Corydon,</i> and <i>Asteria</i>, his <i>Schãferei von der
  'Nymphen Hercinie.'</i></p>

  <p>His references to Nature in this are as exaggerated as everything
  else in the poem. He tells how he did not wake 'until night, the
  mother of the stars, had gone mad, and the beautiful light of dawn
  began to shew herself and everything with her....</p>

  <p>'I sprang up and greeted the sweet rays of the sun, which looked
  down from the tops of the mountains and seemed at the same time to
  comfort me.'</p>

  <p>He came to a spring 'which fell from a crag with charming murmur
  and rustle,' cut a long poem in the fir bark, and conversed with
  three shepherds on virtue, love, and travelling, till the nymph
  Hercynia appeared and shewed him the source of the Silesian stream.
  One of the shepherds, Buchner, was particularly enthusiastic about
  water: 'Kind Nature, handmaid of the Highest, has shewn her best
  handiwork in sea, river, and spring.'</p>

  <p>Fleming too, who already stood much higher as a lyrist and had
  travelled widely, lacked the power of describing scenery, and must
  needs call Oreads, Dryads, Castor and Pollux to his aid. He rarely
  reached the simple purity of his fine sonnet <i>An Sich,</i> or the
  feeling in this: 'Dense wild wood, where even the Titan's brightest
  rays give no light, pity my sufferings. In my sick soul 'tis as dark
  as in thy black hollow.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg214" id="pg214">214</a></span> In
  this time of decline the hymns of the Evangelical Church (to which
  Fleming contributed) were full of feeling, and brought the national
  songs to mind as nothing else did.</p>

  <p>A few lines of Paul Gerhardt's seem to me to out-weigh whole
  volumes of contemporary rhymes--lines of such beauty as the
  <i>Evening Song</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Now all the woods are sleeping,</p>

    <p>And night and stillness creeping</p>

    <p>O'er field and city, man and beast;</p>

    <p>The last faint beam is going,</p>

    <p>The golden stars are glowing</p>

    <p>In yonder dark-blue deep.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And after him, and more like him than any one else, came Andreas
  Gryphius.</p>

  <p>There was much rhyming about Nature in the poet schools of
  Hamburg, Königsberg, and Nuremberg; but, for the most part, it was an
  idle tinkle of words without feeling, empty artificial stuff with
  high-flown titles, as in Philipp von Zesen's <i>Pleasure of
  Spring</i>, and <i>Poetic Valley of Roses and Lilies</i>.</p>

  <p>'Up, my thoughts, be glad of heart, in this joyous pleasant March;
  ah! see spring is reviving, earth opens her treasury,' etc.</p>

  <p>His romances were more noteworthy if not more interesting. He
  certainly aimed high, striving for simplicity and clearness of
  expressions in opposition to the Silesian poets, and hating foreign
  words.</p>

  <p>His feeling for Nature was clear; he loved to take his reader into
  the garden, and was enthusiastic about cool shady walks, beds of
  tulips, birds' songs, and echoes. Idyllic pastoral life was the
  fashion--people of distinction gave themselves up to country life and
  wore shepherd costume--and he introduced a pastoral episode into his
  romance, <i>Die adriatische Rosemund.</i><a href=
  "#i15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Rosemund, whose father places arbitrary conditions in the way of
  her marriage with Markhold, becomes a shepherdess.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg215" id=
  "pg215">215</a></span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Not far off was a delightful spot where limes and alders made
    shade on hot summer days for the shepherds and shepherdesses who
    dwelt around. The shady trees, the meadows, and the streams which
    ran round it, and through it, made it look beautiful ... the
    celestial Rosemund had taken up her abode in a little shepherd hut
    on the slope of a little hill by a water-course, and shaded by some
    lime trees, in which the birds paid her homage morning and
    evening.... Such a place and such solitude refreshed the more than
    human Rosemund, and in such peace she was able to unravel her
    confused thoughts.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>She thought continually of Markhold, and spent her time cutting
  his name in the trees. The following description of a walk with her
  sister Stillmuth and her lover Markhold, gives some idea of the
  formal affected style of the time.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The day was fine, the sky blue, the weather everywhere warm. The
    sun shone down on the globe with her pleasant lukewarm beams so
    pleasantly, that one scarcely cared to stay indoors. They went into
    the garden, where the roses had opened in the warmth of the sun,
    and first sat down by the stream, then went to the grottos, where
    Markhold particularly admired the shell decorations. When this
    charming party had had enough of both, they finally betook
    themselves to a leafy walk, where Rosemund introduced pleasant
    conversation on many topics. She talked first about the many
    colours of tulips, and remarked that even a painter could not
    produce a greater variety of tints nor finer pictures than these,
    etc.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In describing physical beauty, he used comparisons from Nature;
  for instance, in <i>Simson</i><a href="#i16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The sun at its brightest never shone so brightly as her two eyes
    ... no flower at its best can shew such red as blooms in the meadow
    of her cheeks, no civet rose is so milk-white, no lily so delicate
    and spotless, no snow fresh-fallen and untrodden is so white, as
    the heaven of her brows, the stronghold of her mind.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>H. Anselm von Ziegler und Klipphausen also waxes eloquent in his
  famous <i>Asiatischen Banise</i>: 'The suns of her eyes played with
  lightnings; her <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg216" id=
  "pg216">216</a></span>curly hair, like waves round her head, was
  somewhat darker than white; her cheeks were a pleasant Paradise where
  rose and lily bloomed together in beauty--yea, love itself seemed to
  pasture there.' Elsewhere too this writer, so highly esteemed by the
  second Silesian school of poets, indulged in showy description and
  inflated rhetoric. Anton Ulrich von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel tried
  more elaborate descriptions of scenery; so that Chovelius says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Duke's German character shews pleasantly in his delight in
    Nature. The story often takes one into woods and fields; already
    griefs and cares were carried to the running brook and mossy stone,
    and happy lovers listened to the nightingale.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>His language is barely intelligible, but there is a pleasant
  breadth about his drawing--for example, of the king's meadow and the
  grotto in <i>Aramena</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Very cold crystal streams flowed through the fields and ran
    softly over the stony ground, making a pleasant murmur. Whilst the
    ear was thus contented, a distant landscape delighted the eye. No
    more delightful place, possessing all this at once, could have been
    found, etc.</p>

    <p>Looking through the numerous air-holes, the eye lost itself in a
    deep valley, surrounded by nothing but mountains, where the
    shepherds tended their flocks, and one heard their flutes
    multiplied by the echo in the most delightful way.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Mawkish shepherd play is mixed here with such verses as
  (Rahel):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Thou, Chabras, thou art the dear stream, where Jacob's mouth
    gave me the first kiss. Thou, clear brook, often bearest away the
    passionate words of my son of Isaac ... on many a bit of wounded
    bark, the writing of my wounds is to be found.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The most insipid pastoral nonsense of the time was produced by the
  Nuremberg poets, the Pegnitz shepherds Klaj and Harsdörfer. Their
  strength lay in imitating the sounds of Nature, and they were
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg217" id="pg217">217</a></span>much
  admired. What is still more astonishing, Lohenstein's writings were
  the model for thirty years, and it was the fashion for any one who
  wrote more simply to apologize for being unable to reach the level of
  so great a master! To us the bombast, artificiality, and hidden
  sensuality of his poetry and Hoffmannswaldan's, are equally
  repulsive.</p>

  <p>What dreary, manufactured stuff this is from Lohenstein's
  <i>Praise of Roses sung by the Sun</i><a href=
  "#i17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>This is the queen of flowers and plants,</p>

      <p>The bride of heaven, world's treasure, child of stars!</p>

      <p>For whom love sighs, and I myself, the sun, do pant,</p>

      <p>Because her crown is golden, and her leaves are velvet,</p>

      <p>Her foot and stylus emerald, her brilliance shames the
      ruby.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Other beings possess only single beauties,</p>

      <p>Nature has made the rose beautiful with all at once.</p>

      <p>She is ashamed, and blushes</p>

      <p>Because she sees all the other flowers stand ashamed before
      her.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Rose Love</i> he finds the reflection of love in
  everything:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>In whom does not Love's spirit plant his flame?</p>

    <p>One sees the oil of love burn in the starry lamps,</p>

    <p>That pleasant light can nothing be but love,</p>

    <p>For which the dew from Phoebus' veil doth fall.</p>

    <p>Heaven loves the beauteous globe of earth,</p>

    <p>And gazes down on her by night with thousand eyes;</p>

    <p>While earth to please the heaven</p>

    <p>Doth clover, lilies, tulips in her green hair twine,</p>

    <p>The elm and vine stock intertwine,</p>

    <p>The ivy circles round the almond trees,</p>

    <p>And weeps salt tears when they are forced apart.</p>

    <p>And where the flowers burn with glow of Love,</p>

    <p>It is the rose that shews the brightest flame,</p>

    <p>For is the rose not of all flowers the queen,</p>

    <p>The wondrous beauty child of sun and earth?</p>
  </div>

  <p>Artificiality and bombast reached its highest pitch in these
  poets, and feeling for Nature was entirely absent. <span class=

  <h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <h3>SYMPTOMS OF A RETURN TO NATURE</h3>

  <p>It is refreshing to find, side by side with these mummified
  productions, the traces of a pure national poetry flowing clear as
  ever, 'breaking forth from the very heart of the people, ever
  renewing its youth, and not misled by the fashion of the
  day.'<a href="#j1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The traces prove that simple primitive love for Nature was not
  quite dead. For instance, this of the Virgin Mary: 'Mary, she went
  across the heath, grass and flowers wept for grief, she did not find
  her son.' And the lines in which the youth forced into the cloister
  asks Nature to lament with him: 'I greet you all, hill and dale, do
  not drive me away--grass and foliage and all the green things in the
  wild forest. O tree! lose your green ornaments, complain, die with
  me--'tis your duty.'</p>

  <p>Then the Spring greetings:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Now we go into the wide, wide world,</p>

    <p>With joy and delight we go;</p>

    <p>The woods are dressing, the meadows greening,</p>

    <p>The flowers beginning to blow.</p>

    <p>Listen here! and look there! We can scarce trust our eyes,</p>

    <p>For the singing and soaring, the joy and life everywhere.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>What is sweeter than to wander in the early days of Spring</p>

    <p>From one place to another in sheer delight and glee;</p>

    <p>While the sun is shining brightly, and the birds exult
    around</p>

    <p>Fair Nightingale, the foremost of them all?</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg219" id="pg219">219</a></span>

  <p>This has the pulse of true and naive feeling (the hunter is
  starting for the hunt in the early morning):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When I come into the forest, still and silent everywhere,</p>

    <p>There's a look of slumber in it, but the air is fresh and
    cool.</p>

    <p>Now Aurora paints the fir tops at their very tips with gold,</p>

    <p>And the little finch sits up there launching forth his song of
    praise,</p>

    <p>Thanking for the night that's over, for the day that's just
    awake</p>

    <p>Gently blows the breeze of morning, rocking in the topmost
    twigs,</p>

    <p>And it bends them down like children, like good children when
    they pray;</p>

    <p>And the dew is an oblation as it drops from their green
    hair.</p>

    <p>O what beauties in the forest he that we may see and know!</p>

    <p>One could melt away one's heart before its wonders manifold!</p>
  </div>

  <p>The sixth line in the original has a melody that reminds one of
  Goethe's early work.</p>

  <p>But even amidst the artificial poetry then in vogue, there were a
  few side streams which turned away from the main current of the great
  poet schools, from the unnaturalness and bombast affected especially
  by the Silesians. As Winter says, even the satirists Moscherosch and
  Logau were indirectly of use in paving the way for a healthier
  condition, through their severe criticisms of the corruption of the
  language; and Logau's one epigram on May, 'This month is a kiss which
  heaven gives to earth, that she may be a bride now, a mother
  by-and-by,' outweighs all Harsdörfer's and Zesen's poetry about
  Nature.</p>

  <p>But even by the side of Opitz and Fleming there was at least one
  poet of real feeling, Friedrich von Spee.<a href=
  "#j2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> With all his mystic and pietist
  Christianity, he kept an open eye for Nature. His poems are full of
  disdain of the world and joy in Nature,<a href=
  "#j3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> longings <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg220" id="pg220">220</a></span>for death and lamentations over sin;
  he delighted in personifications of abstract ideas, childish playing
  with words and feelings, and sentimental enthusiasm. But mawkish and
  canting as he was apt to be, he often shewed a fine appreciation of
  detail. He was even--a rare thing then--fascinated by the sea.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Now rages and roars the wild, wild sea,</p>

      <p>Now in soft curves lies quietly;</p>

      <p>Sweetly the light of the sun's bright glow</p>

      <p>Mirrors itself in the water below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Sad winter's past--the stork is here,</p>

      <p>Birds are singing and nests appear;</p>

      <p>Bowery homes steal into the day,</p>

      <p>Flow'rets present their full array;</p>

      <p>Like little snakes and woods about,</p>

      <p>The streams go wandering in and out.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>His motives, like his diminutives, are constantly recurring. He
  uses many bold and poetic personifications; the sun 'combs her golden
  hair,' the moon is a good shepherd who leads his sheep the stars
  across the blue heath, blowing upon a soft pipe; the sun adorns
  herself in spring with a crown and a girdle of roses, fills her
  quiver with arrows, and sends her horses to gallop for miles across
  the smooth sky; the wind flies about, stopping for breath from time
  to time; shakes its wings and withdraws into its house when it is
  tired; the brook of Cedron sits, leaning on a bucket in a hollow,
  combing his bulrush hair, his shoulders covered by grass and water;
  he sings a cradle song to his little brooks, or drives them before
  him, etc.</p>

  <p>But the most gifted poet of the set, and the most doughty opponent
  of Lohenstein's bombast, was the unhappy Christian Guenther.<a href=
  "#j4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>He vents his feelings in verse because he must. There is a
  foretaste of Goethe in his lyrics, poured put to free the soul from a
  burden, and melodious as if by accident. As we turn over the leaves
  of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg221" id=
  "pg221">221</a></span>book of songs, we find deep feeling for Nature
  mingled with his love and sorrows.<a href=
  "#j5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Bethink you, flowers and trees and shades,</p>

    <p>Of the sweet evenings here with Flavia!</p>

    <p>'Twas here her head upon my shoulder pressed;</p>

    <p>Conceal, ye limes, what else I dare not say.</p>

    <p>'Twas here she clover threw and thyme at me,</p>

    <p>And here I filled her lap with freshest flowers.</p>

    <p>Ah! that was a good time!</p>

    <p>I care more for moon and starlight than the pleasantest of
    days,</p>

    <p>And with eyes and heart uplifted from my chamber often gaze</p>

    <p>With an awe that grows apace till it scarcely findeth space.</p>
  </div>

  <p>To his lady-love he writes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Here where I am writing now</p>

    <p>'Tis lonely, shady, cool, and green;</p>

    <p>And by the slender fig I hear</p>

    <p>The gentle wind blow towards Schweidnitz.</p>

    <p>And all the time most ardently</p>

    <p>I give it thousand kisses for thee.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And at Schweidnitz:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>A thousand greetings, bushes, fields, and trees,</p>

    <p>You know him well whose many rhymes</p>

    <p>And songs you've heard, whose kisses seen;</p>

    <p>Remember the joy of those fine summer nights.</p>
  </div>

  <p>To Eleanora:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Spring is not far away. Walk in green solitude</p>

    <p>Between your alder rows, and think ...</p>

    <p>As in the oft-repeated lesson</p>

    <p>The young birds' cry shall bear my longing;</p>

    <p>And when the west wind plays with cheek and dress be sure</p>

    <p>He tells me of thy longing, and kisses thee a thousand times for
    me.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In a time of despair, he wrote:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Storm, rage and tear! winds of misfortune, shew all your
    tyranny!</p>

    <p>Twist and split bark and twig,</p>

    <p>And break the tree of hope in two <span class="pagenum"><a name=
    "pg222" id="pg222">222</a></span></p>

    <p>Stem and leaves are struck by this hail and thunder,</p>

    <p>The root remains till storm and rain have laid their wrath.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Again:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The woods I'll wander through,</p>

    <p>From men I'll flee away,</p>

    <p>With lonely doves I'll coo,</p>

    <p>And with the wild things stay.</p>

    <p>When life's the prey of misery,</p>

    <p>And all my powers depart,</p>

    <p>A leafy grave will be</p>

    <p>Far kinder than thy heart.</p>
  </div>

  <p>True lyrist, he gave Nature her full right in his feelings, and
  found comfort in return; but, as Goethe said of him, gifted but
  unsteady as he was, 'He did not know how to restrain himself, and so
  his life and poetry melted away.'</p>

  <p>Among those who made use of better material than the Silesian
  poets, H. Barthold Brockes stood first. Nature was his one and only
  subject; but in this he was not original, he was influenced by
  England. While France was dictating a taste like the baroque, and
  Germany enthusiastically adopting it (every petty prince in the land
  copied the gardens at Versailles, Schwetzingen more closely than the
  rest), a revolution which affected all Europe was brought about by
  England. The order of the following dates is significant: William
  Kent, the famous garden artist, died in 1748, James Thomson in the
  same year, Brockes a year earlier; and about the same time the
  imitations of Robinson Crusoe sprang up like mushrooms.</p>

  <p>We have considered Shakespeare's plays; English lyrists too of the
  fifteenth and sixteenth centuries shewed deep feeling for Nature, and
  invested scenery with their own feelings in a very delicate way.</p>

  <p>Robert Southwell (1595), in <i>Love's Servile Lott</i>, compares
  love to April:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>May never was the month for love,</p>

    <p>For May is full of floures,</p>

    <p>But rather Aprill, wett by kinde,</p>

    <p>Like winter rose and summer yce,</p>

  <p>Edmund Spenser (1598) describes a garden in <i>The Faerie

    <p>In which all pleasures plenteously abownd,</p>

    <p>Fixed become, as in their sphere.</p>

    <p>Ask me no more if east or west</p>

  <p>William Drummond (1746) avowed a taste which he knew to be very
  unfashionable:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Thrice happy he, who by some shady grove,</p>

    <p>Far from the clamorous world, doth live his own</p>

    <p>Though solitary, who is not alone,</p>

    <p>But doth converse with that eternal love.</p>

    <p>O how more sweet is birds' harmonious moan</p>

    <p>Or the soft sobbings of the widow'd dove,</p>

    <p>Than those smooth whisp'rings near a prince's throne....</p>

    <p>O how more sweet is zephyr's wholesome breath</p>

    <p>And sighs perfum'd, which new-born flowers unfold.</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg225" id="pg225">225</a></span>

  <p>Another sonnet, to a nightingale, says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Sweet bird, that sing'st away the early hours</p>

    <p>Of winters past or coming void of care,</p>

    <p>Well pleased with delights which present are,</p>

    <p>Fair seasons, budding sprays, sweet-smelling flowers;</p>

    <p>To rocks, to springs, to rills, from leafy bowers</p>

    <p>Thou thy Creator's goodness dost declare,</p>

    <p>And what dear gifts on thee He did not spare,</p>

    <p>A stain to human sense in sin that lowers,</p>

    <p>What soul can be so sick which by thy songs</p>

    <p>Attir'd in sweetness, sweetly is not driven</p>

    <p>Quite to forget earth's turmoils, spites, and wrongs?</p>
  </div>

  <p>He greets Spring:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Sweet Spring, thou turn'st with all thy goodly train</p>

    <p>Thy head with flames, thy mantle bright with flowers;</p>

    <p>The zephyrs curl the green locks of the plain,</p>

    <p>The clouds for joy in pearls weep down their showers.</p>

  <p>Robert Blair (1746) sings in <i>The Grave</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i4">Oh, when my friend and I</p>

    <p>In some thick wood have wander'd heedless on,</p>

    <p>Hid from the vulgar eye, and sat us down</p>

    <p>Upon the sloping cowslip-cover'd bank,</p>

    <p>Where the pure limpid stream has slid along</p>

    <p>In grateful errors through the underwood,</p>

    <p>Sweet murmuring; methought the shrill-tongu'd thrush</p>

    <p>Mended his song of love, the sooty blackbird</p>

    <p>Mellowed his pipe and soften'd every note,</p>

    <p>The eglantine smell'd sweeter and the rose</p>

    <p>Assum'd a dye more deep, whilst ev'ry flower</p>

    <p>Vied with its fellow plant in luxury</p>

    <p>Of dress. Oh! then the longest summer's day</p>

    <p>Seem'd too, too much in haste, still the full heart</p>

    <p>Had not imparted half; half was happiness</p>

    <p>Too exquisite to last--Of joys departed</p>

    <p>Not to return, how painful the remembrance!</p>
  </div>

  <p>The great painter of Nature among the poets was James Thomson. He
  was not original, but followed Pope, who had lighted up the seasons
  in a dry, dogmatic way in <i>Windsor Forest</i>, and pastoral poems,
  and after the publication of his <i>Winter</i> the taste of the day
  carried him on. His deep and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg226"
  id="pg226">226</a></span>sentimental affection for Nature was mixed
  up with piety and moralizing. He said in a letter to his friend
  Paterson:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Retirement and Nature are more and more my passion every day;
    and now, even now, the charming time comes on; Heaven is just on
    the point, or rather in the very act, of giving earth a green gown.
    The voice of the nightingale is heard in our lane. You must know
    that I have enlarged my rural domain ... walled, no, no! paled in
    about as much as my garden consisted of before, so that the walk
    runs round the hedge, where you may figure me walking any time of
    day, and sometimes of the night.... May your health continue till
    you have scraped together enough to return home and live in some
    snug corner, as happy as the Corycius senex in Virgil's fourth
    Georgic, whom I recommend both to you and myself as a perfect model
    of the truest happy life.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is a fact that Solitude and Nature became a passion with him.
  He would wander about the country for weeks at a time, noting every
  sight and sound, down to the smallest, and finding beauty and divine
  goodness in all. His <i>Seasons</i> were the result.</p>

  <p>There is faithful portraiture in these landscapes in verse; some
  have charm and delicacy, but, for the most part, they are only
  catalogues of the external world, wholly lacking in links with the
  inner life.</p>

  <p>Scene after scene is described without pause, or only interrupted
  by sermonizing; it is as monotonous as a gallery of landscape
  paintings.</p>

  <p>The human beings introduced are mere accessories, they do not
  live, and the undercurrent of all is praise of the Highest. His
  predilection is for still life in wood and field, but he does not
  neglect grander scenery; his muse</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>"Sees Caledonia, in romantic view:</p>

    <p>Her airy mountains, from the waving main</p>

    <p>Invested with a keen diffusive sky,</p>

    <p>Breathing the soul acute; her forests huge,</p>

    <p>Incult, robust, and tall, by Nature's hand</p>

    <p>Planted of old; her azure lakes between,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg227" id=
    "pg227">227</a></span>Poured out extensive and of watery wealth</p>

    <p>Full; winding, deep and green, her fertile vales,</p>

    <p>With many a cool translucent brimming flood</p>

    <p>Washed lovely...."</p>
  </div>

  <p>And in <i>A Hymn</i> we read:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Ye headlong torrents rapid and profound,</p>

    <p>Ye softer floods that lead the humid maze</p>

    <p>Along the vale; and thou, majestic main,</p>

    <p>A secret world of wonders in thyself.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is the lack of human life, the didactic tone, and the wearisome
  detail which destroys interest in the <i>Seasons</i>--the lack of
  happy moments of invention. Yet it had great influence on his
  contemporaries in rousing love for Nature, and it contains many
  beautiful passages. For example:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Come, gentle Spring, ethereal mildness, come,</p>

    <p>And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud,</p>

    <p>While music wakes around, veiled in a shower</p>

    <p>Of shadowing roses, on our plains descend.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His most artistic poem is Winter:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When from the pallid sky the sun descends</p>

    <p>With many a spot, that o'er his glaring orb</p>

    <p>Uncertain wanders, stained; red fiery streaks</p>

    <p>Begin to flush around. The reeling clouds</p>

    <p>Stagger with dizzy poise, as doubting yet</p>

    <p>Which master to obey; while rising slow,</p>

    <p>Blank in the leaden-coloured east, the moon</p>

    <p>Wears a wan circle round her blunted horns.</p>

    <p>Seen through the turbid fluctuating air,</p>

    <p>The stars obtuse emit a shivering ray;</p>

    <p>Or frequent seem to shoot, athwart the gloom,</p>

    <p>And long behind them trail the whitening blaze.</p>

    <p>Snatched in short eddies plays the withered leaf,</p>

    <p>And on the flood the dancing feather floats.</p>

    <p>With broadened nostrils to the sky upturned,</p>

    <p>The conscious heifer snuffs the stormy gale....</p>

    <p>Retiring from the downs, where all day long</p>

    <p>They picked their scanty fare, a blackening train</p>

    <p>Of clamorous rooks thick urge their weary flight</p>

    <p>And seek the closing shelter of the grove,</p>

    <p>Assiduous, in his bower, the wailing owl</p>

    <p>Plies his sad song. The cormorant on high</p>

    <p>Wheels from the deep, and screams along the land.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg228" id=
    "pg228">228</a></span>Loud shrieks the soaring heron, and with wild
    wing</p>

    <p>The circling sea-fowl cleave the flaky skies.</p>

    <p>Ocean, unequal pressed, with broken tide</p>

    <p>And blind commotion heaves, while from the shore,</p>

    <p>Eat into caverns by the restless wave</p>

    <p>And forest-rustling mountains, comes a voice</p>

    <p>That solemn-sounding bids the world prepare.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The elaboration of detail in such painting is certain evidence,
  not only of a keen, but an enthusiastic eye for Nature. As he says in
  Winter:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Nature, great parent! whose unceasing hand</p>

    <p>Rolls round the seasons of the changeful year!</p>

    <p>How mighty, how majestic, are thy works!</p>

    <p>With what a pleasing dread they swell the soul</p>

    <p>That sees astonish'd, and astonish'd sings!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Brockes was directly influenced by Pope and Thomson, and
  translated the <i>Seasons</i>, when he had finished his <i>Irdisches
  Vergnügen in Gott</i>. This unwieldy work, insipid and prosaic as it
  is, was still a literary achievement, thanks to the dignity of the
  subject and the high seriousness of its aim, at a time when frivolity
  was the fashion in poetry. Its long pious descriptions of natural
  phenomena have none of the imposing flow of Thomson's strophes. It
  treats of fire in 138 verses of eight lines each, of air in 79, water
  in 78, earth in 74, while flowers and fruit are dissected and
  analyzed at great length; and all this rhymed botany and physics is
  loosely strung together, but it shews a warm feeling for Nature of a
  moralizing and devotional sort. He says himself<a href=
  "#j7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> that he took up the study of poetry first as
  an amusement, but later more seriously, and chose Nature as his
  theme, not only because her beauty moved him, but as a means 'whereby
  man might enjoy a permissible pleasure and be edified at the same
  time.'</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>So I resolved to sing the praises of the Creator to the best of
    my powers, and felt the more bound to do it, because I held that
    such great and almost inexcusable <span class="pagenum"><a name=
    "pg229" id="pg229">229</a></span>neglect and ingratitude was a
    wrong to the Creator, and unbecoming in Christendom. I therefore
    composed different pieces, chiefly in Spring, and tried my best to
    describe the beauties of Nature, in order, through my own pleasure,
    to rekindle the praise of the wise Creator in myself and others,
    and this led at last to the first part of my <i>Irdisches
    Vergnügen</i>. (1721.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>His evidence from animal and plant life for the teleological
  argument is very laughable; take, for example, the often-quoted
  chamois:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The fat is good for phthisis, the gall for the face, chamois
    flesh is good to eat, and its blood cures vertigo--the skin is no
    less useful. Doth not the love as well as the wisdom and
    almightiness of the Creator shine forth from this animal?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For the rest, the following lines from <i>Irdisches Vergnügen in
  Gott</i> will serve to give an idea of his style; they certainly do
  honour to his laborious attempt to miss none of the charms of the
  wood:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Lately as I sat on the green grass</p>

    <p>Shaded by a lime tree, and read,</p>

    <p>I raised my eyes by chance and saw</p>

    <p>Different trees here and there, some far, some near,</p>

    <p>Some half, some all in light, and some in shade,</p>

    <p>Their boughs bowed down by leaves.</p>

    <p>I saw how beautifully both air and flowery mead</p>

    <p>Were crowned and adorned.</p>

    <p>To describe the green grace</p>

    <p>And the landscape it makes so sweet,</p>

    <p>And at the same time prolong my pleasure,</p>

    <p>I took pencil and paper</p>

    <p>And tried to describe the beautiful trees in rhyme,</p>

    <p>To the glory of God their Creator.</p>

    <p>Of all the beauty the world lays before our eyes,</p>

    <p>There certainly is none which does not pale</p>

    <p>Beside green boughs,</p>

    <p>Nothing to compare for pure beauty with a wood.</p>

    <p>The green roofing overhead</p>

    <p>Makes me feel young again;</p>

    <p>It hangs there, a living tapestry,</p>

    <p>To the glory of God and our delight....</p>

    <p>Beyond many trees that lay in shade</p>

    <p>I often saw one in full light;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg230" id="pg230">230</a></span>A
    human eye would scarce believe</p>

    <p>How sweetly twilight, light and darkness</p>

    <p>Meet side by side in leafy trees.</p>

    <p>Peering through the leaves with joy</p>

    <p>We notice, as we see the leaves</p>

    <p>Lighted from one side only,</p>

    <p>That we can almost see the sun</p>

    <p>Mixing gold with the tender green, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and so on for another twenty lines.</p>

  <p>Yet this rich Burgomaster of Hamburg, for all that he dealt
  chiefly in rhymed prose, had his moments of rare elevation of thought
  and mystical rapture about Nature; for instance, in the introduction
  to <i>Ueber das Firmament</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>As lately in the sapphire depths,</p>

    <p>Not bound by earth nor water, aim nor end,</p>

    <p>In the unplumbed aerial sea I gazed,</p>

    <p>And my absorbed glance, now here, now there,</p>

    <p>But ever deeper sank--horror came over me,</p>

    <p>My eye grew dizzy and my soul aghast.</p>

    <p>That infinite vast vault,</p>

    <p>True picture of Eternity,</p>

    <p>Since without birth or end</p>

    <p>From God alone it comes....</p>

    <p>It overwhelmed my soul.</p>

    <p>The mighty dome of deep dark light,</p>

    <p>Bright darkness without birth or bound,</p>

    <p>Swallowed the very world--burying thought.</p>

    <p>My being dwindled to an atom, to a nought;</p>

    <p>I lost myself,</p>

    <p>So suddenly it beat me down,</p>

    <p>And threatened with despair.</p>

    <p>But in that salutary nothingness, that blessed loss,</p>

    <p>All present God! in Thee--I found myself again.</p>
  </div>

  <p>While English poetry and its German imitations were shewing these
  signs of reaction from the artificiality of the time, and science and
  philosophy often lauded Nature to the skies, as, for instance,
  Shaftesbury<a href="#j8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> (1671-1713), a return to
  Nature became the principle of English garden-craft in the first half
  of the eighteenth century.<a href="#j9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The line
  of progress here, as in taste generally, did not run <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg231" id="pg231">231</a></span>straightforward,
  but fluctuated. From the geometric gardens of Lenotre, England passed
  to the opposite extreme; in the full tide of periwig and hoop
  petticoat, minuets, beauty-patches and rouge, Addison and Pope were
  banishing everything that was not strictly natural from the garden.
  Addison would even have everything grow wild in its own way, and Pope
  wrote:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>To build, to plant, whatever you intend,</p>

    <p>To rear the column, or the arch to bend,</p>

    <p>To swell the terrace or to sink the grot,</p>

    <p>In all let Nature never be forgot.</p>
  </div>

  <p>William Kent made allowance for this idea; but, as a painter, and
  looking at his native scenery with a painter's eye, he noted its
  characteristic features--the gentle undulations, the freshness of the
  green, the wealth of trees--and based his garden-craft on these.</p>

  <p>The straight line was banished; in its place came wide spaces of
  lawn and scattered groups of trees of different sorts--dark fir and
  alder here, silver birch and grey poplar there; and flowery fields
  with streams running through them stood out in relief against dark
  woodland.</p>

  <p>Stiff walls, balustrades, terraces, statues, and so forth,
  disappeared; the garden was not to contrast with the surrounding
  landscape, but to merge into it--to be not Art, but a bit of Nature.
  It was, in fact, to be a number of such bits, each distinct from the
  rest--waterfall, sheltered sunny nook, dark wood, light glade. Kent
  himself soon began to vary this mosaic of separate scenes by adding
  ruins and pavilions; but it was Chambers the architect who developed
  the idea of variety by his writings on the dwellings and manners of
  the Chinese.<a href="#j10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The fundamental idea that the garden ought to be a sample of the
  landscape was common both <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg232" id=
  "pg232">232</a></span>to Kent and the Chinese; but, as China is far
  richer than England in varieties of scenery, her gardens included
  mountains, rocks, swamps, and deserts, as well as sunny fields and
  plains, while English gardens were comparatively monotonous. When the
  fashion for the Chinese style came in, as unluckily it did just when
  we were trying to oust the Rococo, so that one pigtail superseded the
  other, variety was achieved by groups of buildings in all sorts of
  styles. Stables, ice-houses, gardeners' cottages took the form of
  pavilions, pagodas, kiosks, and temples.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as a reaction against the Rococo, enthusiasm for Nature
  increased, and feeling was set free from restraint by the growing
  sentimentality. Richardson's novels fed the taste for the pleasures
  of weeping sensibility, and garden-craft fell under its sway. In all
  periods the insignificant and non-essential is unable to resist the
  general stamp, if that only shews a little originality.</p>

  <p>These gardens, with temples to friendship and love, melancholy,
  virtue, re-union, and death, and so forth, were suitable backgrounds
  for the sentimental scenes described in the English novels, and for
  the idyllic poets and moonshine singers of Germany. Here it was the
  fashion to wander, tenderly intertwined, shedding floods of tears and
  exchanging kisses, and pausing at various places to read the
  inscriptions which directed them what to feel. At one spot they were
  to laugh, at another to weep, at a third to be fired with
  devotion.</p>

  <p>Hermitages sprang up everywhere, with hermits, real or dummy. Any
  good house near a wood, or in a shady position, was called a
  hermitage, and dedicated to arcadian life, free from care and
  ceremony. Classic and romantic styles competed for favour in
  architecture; at one moment everything must needs be purely classic,
  each temple Corinthian, Ionic, or Doric; at another Gothic, with the
  ruins <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg233" id=
  "pg233">233</a></span>and fortresses of mediæval romance. And not
  only English gardens, but those of Europe generally, though to a less
  degree, passed through these stages of development, for no disease is
  so infectious as fashion.</p>

  <p>It was not till the end of the eighteenth century that a healthy
  reaction set in in England, when Repton turned back to Kent's
  fundamental principle and freed it from its unnatural excrescences,
  with the formula: the garden should be an artistic representation of
  the landscape, a work of art whose materials are provided by Nature
  herself, whether grass, flowers, bushes, trees, water, or whatever it
  may be that she has to offer. Thus began our modern landscape
  gardening.</p>

  <p>In another region too, a change was brought about from the Rococo
  to a more natural style. It is true that Nature plays no direct
  <i>rôle</i> in <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and wins as little notice
  there as in its numberless imitations; yet the book roused a longing
  for healthier, more natural conditions in thousands of minds. It led
  the idyllic tendency of the day back to its source, and by shewing
  all the stages, from the raw state of Nature up to the culture of the
  community, in the life of one man, it brought out the contrast
  between the far-off age of innocence and the perverted present.</p>

  <p>The German <i>Simplicissimus</i> closed with a Robinsonade, in
  which the hero, after long wandering, found rest and peace on an
  island in the ocean of the world, alone with himself and Nature. The
  readers of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> were in much the same position.
  Defoe was not only a true artist, but a man of noble, patient
  character, and his romance proved a healing medicine to many sick
  minds, pointing the way back to Nature and a natural fife, and
  creating a longing for the lost innocence of man.</p>

  <p>Rousseau, who was also a zealous advocate of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg234" id="pg234">234</a></span>the English
  gardens, and disgusted by the French Pigtail style, was more
  impressed by <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> than by any other book. It was
  the first book his Emilia gave him, as a gospel of Nature and
  unspoilt taste. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg235" id=
  "pg235">235</a></span></p>

  <h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <h3>THE SENSITIVENESS AND EXAGGERATION OF THE ELEGIAC IDYLLIC
  FEELING</h3>

  <p>This longing to return to the lost paradise of Nature gradually
  produced a state of melancholy hyper-sensitiveness, an epidemic of
  world pain, quite as unnatural as the Rococo.</p>

  <p>The heart came into its rights again and laid claim to absolute
  dominion in its kingdom, and regret that it had lain so long deprived
  of its own, gave rise to a tearful pensiveness, which added zest to
  restitution. It was convalescence, but followed at once by another
  complaint. Feeling swung from one extreme to the other.</p>

  <p>German feeling in the first half of the eighteenth century was
  chiefly influenced, on the one hand, by Richardson's novels, which
  left no room for Nature, and by the poetry of Young and Thomson; on
  the other, by the pastoral idylls interspersed with anacreontic
  love-passages, affected by the French. At first description and
  moralizing preponderated.</p>

  <p>In 1729 Haller's <i>Alps</i> appeared. It had the merit of drawing
  the eyes of Europe to Alpine beauty and the moral worth of the Swiss,
  but shewed little eye for romantic scenery. It is full of descriptive
  painting, but not of a kind that appeals: scene follows scene with
  considerable pathos, especially in dealing with the people; but
  landscape is looked <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg236" id=
  "pg236">236</a></span>at almost entirely from the moralizing or
  utilitarian standpoint.</p>

  <p>'Here, where the majestic Mount Gothard elevates its summit above
  the clouds, and where the earth itself seems to approach the sun,
  Nature has assembled in one spot all the choicest treasure of the
  globe. The deserts of Libya, indeed, afford us greater novelties, and
  its sandy plains are more fertile in monsters: but thou, favoured
  region, art adorned with useful productions only, productions which
  can satisfy all the wants of man. Even those heaps of ice, those
  frowning rocks in appearance so sterile, contribute largely to the
  general good, for they supply inexhaustible fountains to fertilize
  the land. What a magnificent picture does Nature spread before the
  eye, when the sun, gilding the top of the Alps, scatters the sea of
  vapours which undulates below! Through the receding vale the theatre
  of a whole world rises to the view! Rocks, valleys, lakes, mountains,
  and forests fill the immeasurable space, and are lost in the wide
  horizon. We take in at a single glance the confines of divers states,
  nations of various characters, languages, and manners, till the eyes,
  overcome by such extent of vision, drop their weary lids, and we ask
  of the enchanted fancy a continuance of the scene.</p>

  <p>'When the first emotion of astonishment has subsided, how
  delightful is it to observe each several part which makes up this
  sublime whole! That mass of hills, which presents its graceful
  declivity covered with flocks of sheep whose bleatings resound
  through the meadows; that large clear lake, which reflects from its
  level surface sunbeams gently curved; those valleys, rich in verdure,
  which compose by their various outlines points of perspective which
  contract in the distance of the landscape! Here rises a bare steep
  mountain laden with the accumulated snow of ages; its icy head rests
  among the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg237" id=
  "pg237">237</a></span>clouds, repelling the genial rays of the moon
  and the fervid heat of the dog-star: there a chain of cultivated
  hills spreads before the delighted eye; their green pastures are
  enlivened by flocks, and their golden corn waves in the wind: yet
  climates so different as those are only separated by a cool, narrow
  valley. Behold that foaming torrent rushing from a perpendicular
  height! Its rapid waves dash among the rocks, and shoot even beyond
  their limits. Divided by the rapidity of its course and the depth of
  the abyss where it falls, it changes into a grey moving veil; and, at
  length scattered into humid atoms, it shines with the tints of the
  rainbow, and, suspended over the valley, refreshes it with plenteous
  dew. The traveller beholds with astonishment rivers flowing towards
  the sky, and issuing from one cloud, hide themselves in the grey veil
  of another.</p>

  <p>'Those desert places uncheered by the rays of the sun, those
  frozen abysses deprived of all verdure, hide beneath their sterile
  sands invaluable treasures, which defy the rigour of the seasons and
  all the injuries of time! 'Tis in dark and marshy recesses, upon the
  damp grottos, that crystal rocks are formed. Thus splendour is
  diffused through their melancholy vaults, and their shadowy depths
  gutter with the colours of the rainbow. O Nature, how various are thy
  operations, how infinite thy fertility!'</p>

  <p>We cannot agree with Frey<a href="#k1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> that
  'these few strophes may serve as sufficient proof that Haller's
  poetry is still, even among the mass of Alpine poetry, unsurpassed
  for intense power of direct vision, and easily makes one forget its
  partial lack of flexibility of diction.'</p>

  <p>The truth is, flexibility is entirely lacking; but the lines do
  express the taste for open-air life among the great sublimities and
  with simple people. The poem is not romantic but idyllic, with a
  touch of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg238" id=
  "pg238">238</a></span>elegiac. It is the same with the poem <i>On the
  Origin of Evil</i> (Book I.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>On those still heights whence constant springs flow down,</p>

    <p>I paused within a copse, lured by the evening breeze;</p>

    <p>Wide country lay spread out beneath my feet,</p>

    <p>Bounded by its own size alone....</p>

    <p>Green woods covered the hills, through which the pale tints of
    the fields</p>

    <p>Shone pleasantly.</p>

    <p>Abundance and repose held sway far as the eye could
    reach....</p>

    <p>And yonder wood, what left it to desire</p>

    <p>With the red tints upon the half-bare beeches</p>

    <p>And the rich pine's green shade o'er whitened moss?</p>

    <p>While many a sun-ray through the interstices</p>

    <p>A quivering light upon the darkness shed,</p>

    <p>Blending in varying hues green night with golden day</p>

    <p>How pleasant is the quiet of the copse! ...</p>

    <p>Yea, all I see is given by Providence,</p>

    <p>The world itself is for its burgher's joy;</p>

    <p>Nature's inspired with the general weal,</p>

    <p>The highest goodness shews its trace in all.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Friedrich von Hagedorn, too, praises country pleasures in <i>The
  Feeling of Spring</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Enamelled meadows! freshly decked in green,</p>

    <p>I sing your praises constantly;</p>

    <p>Nature and Spring have decked you out....</p>

    <p>Delightful quiet, stimulant of joy,</p>

    <p>How enviable thou art!</p>
  </div>

  <p>This idyllic taste for country life was common at the time,
  especially among the so-called 'anacreontists.' Gleim, for instance,
  in his <i>Praise of Country Life</i>: 'Thank God that I have fled
  from the bustle of the world and am myself again under the open
  sky.'</p>

  <p>And in <i>The Countryman</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>How happy is he who, free from cares, ploughs his father's
    fields; every morning the sun shines on the grass in which he
    lies.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg239" id="pg239">239</a></span>
  And Joh. Friedrich von Cronegk:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Fly from sordid cares and the proud tumult of cities ... here in
    the peaceful valley shy wisdom sports at ease, where the smiling
    Muse crowns herself with dewy roses.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>With this idyllic tone it is not surprising to find the religious
  feeling of many hymn writers; for instance, Gleim in <i>The Goodness
  of God</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>For whom did Thy goodness create the world so beautiful, O God?
    For whom are the flowers on hill and dale? ... Thou gavest us power
    to perceive the beauty.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And above all, honest Gellert:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The skies, the globe, the seas, praise the eternal glory. O my
    Creator, when I consider Thy might and the wisdom of Thy ways....
    Sunshine and storm preach Thee, and the sands of the sea.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Ewald von Kleist excelled Haller as much as Haller had excelled
  Brockes.</p>

  <p>Julian Schmidt says<a href="#k3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>: 'Later on,
  descriptive poetry, like didactic, fell into disgrace; but at that
  time this dwelling upon the minutiæ of Nature served to enrich the
  imagination; Kleist's descriptions are thoughtful and interesting.'
  It is easy to see that his longer poems cost him much labour; they
  were not the pure songs of feeling that gush out spontaneously like a
  spring from the rock. But in eloquence and keenness of observation he
  excelled his contemporaries, although he, too, followed the fashion
  of eighteenth-century literature, and coquetted with Greek nymphs and
  deities, and the names of winds and maidens.</p>

  <p>The tendency to depression, increased by his failure to adapt
  himself to military life, made him incline more and more to
  solitude.</p>

  <p><i>To Doris</i> begins:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Now spring doth warm the flakeless air,</p>

    <p>And in the brook the sky reflects her blue,</p>

    <p>Shepherds in fragrant flowers find delight ...</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg240" id=
    "pg240">240</a></span>The corn lifts high its golden head,</p>

    <p>And Zephyr moves in waves across the grain,</p>

    <p>Her robe the field embroiders; the young rush</p>

    <p>Adorns the border of each silver stream,</p>

    <p>Love seeks the green night of the forest shade,</p>

    <p>And air and sea and earth and heaven smile.</p>

  <p>He, too, wrote with hymn-like swing in praise of the Creator:
  'Great is the Lord! the unnumbered heavens are the chambers of his
  fortress, storm and thunder-clouds his chariot.'</p>

  <p>The most famous of his poems, and the one most admired in his own
  day, was <i>Spring</i>. This is full of love for Nature. It describes
  a country walk after the muggy air of town, and conveys a vivid
  impression of fresh germinating spring, though it is overlaid by
  monotonous detail:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Receive me, hallowed shades! Ye dwellings of sweet buss!</p>

    <p>Umbrageous arches full of sleeping dark delights ...</p>

    <p>Receive me! Fill my soul with longing and with rest ...</p>

    <p>And you, ye laughing fields,</p>

    <p>Valleys of roses, labyrinths of streams,</p>

    <p>I will inhale an ecstasy with your balsamic breath,</p>

    <p>And, lying in the shade, on strings of gold</p>

    <p>Sing your indwelling joys....</p>

    <p>On rosy clouds, with rose and tulip crowned,</p>

    <p>Spring has come down from heaven....</p>

    <p>The air grew softer, fields took varied hues,</p>

    <p>The shades were leafy, and soft notes awoke</p>

    <p>And flew and warbled round the wood in twilight greenery.</p>

    <p>Brooks took a silver tint, sweet odours filled the air,</p>

    <p>The early shepherd's pipe was heard by Echo in the dale....</p>

    <p>Most dear abode! Ah, were I but allowed</p>

    <p>Down in the shade by yon loquacious brook</p>

    <p>Henceforth to live! O sky! thou sea of love,</p>

    <p>Eternal spring of health, will not thy waters succour me?</p>

    <p>Must, my life's blossom wither, stifled by the weeds?</p>
  </div>

  <p>Johann Peter Uz, who was undervalued because of his sickly style,
  wrote many little songs full of feeling for Nature, though within
  narrow limits. Their titles shew the pastoral taste<a href=
  "#k4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>:--<i>Spring</i>, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg242" id="pg242">242</a></span><i>Morning,
  Shepherd's Morning Song, The Muse with the Shepherds, The Meadow in
  the Country, Vintage, Evening, May, The Rose, Summer and Wine, Winter
  Night, Longing for Spring</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>Many are fresh and full of warm feeling, especially the Spring
  Songs:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>See the blossoming of Spring!</p>

    <p>Will't not taste the joys it showers?</p>

    <p>Dost not feel its impulse thrill?</p>

      <p>Has brought me here away.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>O what a fresh breeze flows</p>

      <p>Down from the wooded hill,</p>

      <p>How pleasantly the west wind flies</p>

      <p>With rustling dewy wing</p>

      <p>Across the vale,</p>

      <p>Where all is green and blossoming.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The personification is more marked in this:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Thou hast sent us the Spring in his gleaming robe</p>

    <p>With roses round his head. Smiling he comes, O God!</p>

    <p>The hours conduct him to his flowery throne</p>

    <p>Into the groves he enters and they bloom; fresh green is on the
    plain,</p>

    <p>The forest shade returns, the west wind lovingly unfurls</p>

    <p>Its dewy plumes, and happy birds begin to sing.</p>

    <p>The face of Nature Thou hast deckt with beauty that
    enchants,</p>

    <p>O Thou rich source of all the beautiful ...</p>

    <p>My heart is lifted up to Thee in purest love.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His feeling for Nature was warm enough, although most of his
  writing was so artificial and tedious from much repetition of a few
  ideas, that Kleist could <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg243" id=
  "pg243">243</a></span>write to Gleim<a href="#k5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>:
  'The odes please me more the more I read them. With a few exceptions,
  they have only one fault, too many laurel woods; cut them down a
  little. Take away the marjoram too, it is better in a good sausage
  than in a beautiful poem.'</p>

  <p>Joh. Georg Jacobi also belonged to the circle of poets gathered
  round Gleim; but in many respects he was above it. He imitated the
  French style<a href="#k6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> far less than the
  others--than Hagedorn, for example; and though the Anacreontic
  element was strong in him, he overcame it, and aimed at pure lyrical
  feeling. From his Life, written by a devoted friend, we see that he
  had all the sentimentality of the day,<a href=
  "#k7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> but with much that was healthy and amiable
  in addition, and he touched Nature with peculiar freshness and
  genuineness.</p>

  <p>In a poem to his brother, about the Saale valley near Halle, he
  wrote:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Lie down in early spring on yon green moss,</p>

    <p>By yon still brook where heart with heart we spoke,</p>

    <p>My brother....</p>

    <p>Will't see the little garden and the pleasant heights above,</p>

    <p>So quiet and unspoilt? O friend, 'tis Nature speaks</p>

    <p>In distant wood, near plain and careless glade,</p>

    <p>Here on my little hill and in the clover....</p>

    <p>Dost hear the rustle of the streamlet through the wood?</p>
  </div>

  <p>Jacobi was one whose heart, as he said of Gleim, took a warm
  interest in all that breathed, even a violet, and sought sympathy and
  companionship in the whole range of creation.</p>

  <p>This is from his <i>Morning Song</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>See how the wood awakes, how from the lighted heights</p>

    <p>With the soft waving breeze</p>

    <p>The morning glory smiles in the fresh green....</p>

    <p>Here by the rippling brook and quivering flower,</p>

    <p>We catch Love's rustle as she gently sweeps</p>

    <p>Like Spring's own breath athwart the plains.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another song is;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Tell me, where's the violet fled.</p>

      <p>Late so gayly blowing.</p>

      <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg244" id=
      "pg244">244</a></span>Springing 'neath fair Flora's tread,</p>

      <p>Choicest sweets bestowing?</p>

      <p>Swain, the vernal scene is o'er,</p>

      <p>And the violet blooms no more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Say, where hides the blushing rose,</p>

      <p>Pride of fragrant morning,</p>

      <p>Garland meet for beauty's brows,</p>

      <p>Hill and dale adorning?</p>

      <p>Gentle maid, the summer's fled,</p>

      <p>And the hapless rose is dead.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Bear me then to yonder rill,</p>

      <p>Late so freely flowing,</p>

      <p>Watering many a daffodil</p>

      <p>On its margin glowing.</p>

      <p>Sun and wind exhaust its store,</p>

      <p>Yonder rivulet glides no more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Lead me to the bowery shade,</p>

      <p>Late with roses flaunting,</p>

      <p>Loved resort of youth and maid,</p>

      <p>Amorous ditties chanting.</p>

      <p>Hail and wind with fury shower,</p>

      <p>Leafless mourns the rifled bower!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Say, where bides the village maid,</p>

      <p>Late yon cot adorning?</p>

      <p>Oft I've met her in the glade</p>

      <p>Fair and fresh as morning.</p>

      <p>Swain, how short is beauty's bloom,</p>

      <p>Seek her in her grassy tomb.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Whither roves the tuneful swain</p>

      <p>Who, of rural pleasures,</p>

      <p>Rose and violet, rill and plain,</p>

      <p>Sang in deftest measures?</p>

      <p>Maiden, swift life's vision flies,</p>

      <p>Death has closed the poet's eyes.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>To Nature</i> runs thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Leaves are falling, mists are twining, and to winter sleep
    inclining</p>

    <p>Are the trees upon the plain,</p>

    <p>In the hush of stillness ere the snowflakes hide them,</p>

    <p>Friendly Nature, speak to me again!</p>

    <p>Thou art echo and reflection of our striving,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg245" id=
    "pg245">245</a></span>Thou art painter of our hopes and of our
    fears,</p>

    <p>Thou art singer of our joys and of our sorrows,</p>

    <p>Of our consolations and our groans....</p>
  </div>

  <p>While feeling for Nature was all of this character, idyllic,
  sensitive, sympathetic, but within very narrow bounds, and the poets
  generally were wandering among Greek and Latin bucolics and playing
  with Damon, Myrtil, Chloe, and Daphnis, Salomon Gessner made a
  speciality of elegiac pastoral poetry. He was a better landscapist
  than poet, and his drawings to illustrate his idylls were better than
  the poems themselves. The forest, for instance, and the felling of
  the tree, are well drawn; whereas the sickly sweet Rococo verse in
  imitation of the French, and reminding one more of Longos than
  Theocritus, is lifeless. His rhapsody about Nature is uncongenial to
  modern readers, but his love was real.</p>

  <p>The introduction 'to the Reader'<a href="#k8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
  is characteristic:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>These Idylls are the fruits of some of my happiest hours; of
    those hours when imagination and tranquillity shed their sweetest
    influence over me, and, excluding all which belongs to the period
    in which we live, recalled all the charms and delights of the
    Golden Age. A noble and well-regulated mind dwells with pleasure on
    these images of calm tranquillity and uninterrupted happiness, and
    the scenes in which the poet delineates the simple beauties of
    uncorrupted nature are endeared to us by the resemblance we fancy
    we perceive in them to the most blissful moments that we nave
    ourselves enjoyed. Often do I fly from the city and seek the
    deepest solitudes; there, the beauties of the landscape soothe and
    console my heart, and gradually disperse those impressions of
    solicitude and disgust which accompanied me from the town;
    enraptured, I give up my whole soul to the contemplation of Nature,
    and feel, at such moments, richer than an Utopian monarch, and
    happier than a shepherd of the Golden Age.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is a true picture of the time! Man knew that he was sick, and
  fled from town and his fellows <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg246"
  id="pg246">246</a></span>into solitude, there to dream himself back
  to a happier past, and revel in the purity and innocence, the healing
  breath, of forest and field.</p>

  <p>The magic of moonlight began to be felt. Mirtilla</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>perceived his old father slumbering in the moonbeams....
    Mirtilla stood long contemplating him, and his eyes rested fondly
    on the old man except when he raised them toward heaven through the
    glistening leaves of the vine, and tears of filial love and joy
    bedewed his cheeks.... How beautiful! how beautiful is the
    landscape! How bright, how clear appears the deep blue of heaven
    through the broken clouds! They fly, they pass away, these towering
    clouds; but strew a shadow as they pass over the sunny
    landscape.... Oh, what joy overwhelms my soul! how beautiful, how
    excellent is all around, what an inexhaustible source of rapture!
    From the enlivening sun down to the little plant that his mild
    influence nourishes, all is wonderful! What rapture overpowers me
    when I stand on the high hill and look down on the wide-spread
    landscape beneath me, when I lay stretched along the grass and
    examine the various flowers and herbs and their little inhabitants;
    when at the midnight hour I contemplate the starry heavens!...
    Wrapt in each other's arms, let us contemplate the approach of
    morning, the bright glow of sunset, or the soft beams of moonlight;
    and as I press thee to my trembling heart, let us breathe out in
    broken accents our praises and thanksgivings. Ah! what
    inexpressible joy, when with such raptures are blended the
    transports of the tenderest love.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Many prosaic writings of a different kind shew how universally
  feeling, in the middle of the eighteenth century, turned towards
  Nature.</p>

  <p>The æsthetic writer Sulzer (1750) wrote <i>On the Beauty of
  Nature</i>. Crugot's widely-read work of edification, <i>Christ in
  Solitude</i> (1761), shewed the same point of view among the mystical
  and pietist clergy; and Spalding's <i>Human Vocation</i><a href=
  "#k9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> (written with a warmth that reminds one of
  Gessner) among the rationalists, whom he headed. He says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Nature contains numberless pleasures, which, through my great
    sensitiveness, nourish my mind... I open <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg247" id="pg247">247</a></span>eye and ear, and
    through these openings pleasures flow into my soul from a thousand
    sides: flowers painted by the hand of Nature, the rich music of the
    forest, the bright daylight which pours life and light all round
    me.... How indifferent, tasteless, and dead is all the fantastic
    glamour of artificial splendour and luxuriance in comparison with
    the living radiance of the real beautiful world of Nature, with the
    joyousness, repose, and admiration I feel before a meadow in
    blossom, a rustling stream, the pleasant awesomeness of night, or
    of the majesty of innumerable worlds. Even the commonest and most
    familiar things in Nature give me endless delight, when I feel them
    with a heart attuned to joy and admiration.... I lose myself,
    absorbed in delight, in the consideration of all this general
    beauty, of which I hold myself to be a not disfigured part.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Klopstock, the torch-bearer of Germany's greatest poets, owed much
  of his power of the wing to religion. He introduced that new epoch in
  the literature of his country which culminated in Goethe. As so often
  happens in mental development, the reaction against prevailing
  conditions and the advance to higher ones, in the middle of the
  eighteenth century, led first of all to the opposite extreme--balance
  was only reached by degrees. What chiefly made Klopstock a literary
  reformer was the glowing enthusiasm and powerful imagination which
  compelled the stiff poetic forms, clumsy as they were, to new rhythm
  and melodious cadence. And although his style degenerated into
  mannerism in the <i>Messias</i>, for the youthful impetus which had
  carried his Pegasus over the clouds to the stars could not keep it
  there without artificial aid, the immense value of his influence
  remained. He is one of the most interesting representatives, not only
  of his own, but of all similar periods of exaggerated feelings and
  ideals. Despite his loftiness of thought and speech, and his seraphic
  raptures, he was not without a full share of sensuous development,
  and women's eyes, or a girl's rosy lips, would draw him away from the
  finest view in the world.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg248" id="pg248">248</a></span> A
  mind so intent upon the noble and beautiful was sure to be
  enthusiastic about Nature; his correspondence is the best witness to
  this, and at the same time throws side-lights upon the period.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to-day to understand the influence which the
  <i>Messias</i> had upon its readers; even Friedenkende spent happy
  hours reading it with pious tears of delight, and young and old were
  of the same opinion.</p>

  <p>There is a pretty letter from Gustchen Stolberg<a href=
  "#k10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> to Klopstock, which runs thus:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>UETERSEN, 25 <i>April</i> 1776.</p>

    <p>In the garden. Yes, in the garden, dearest Klopstock! I have
    just been walking about, it was so beautiful: the little birds were
    singing, violets and other flowers wafted their fragrance to me,
    and I began thinking very warmly of all whom I dearly, dearly love,
    and so very soon came to my dear Klopstock, who certainly has no
    truer friend than I am, though perhaps others express it better ...
    Thanks, thanks, for your very delightful little letter--how dear to
    me I don't tell you--can't tell you.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>C. F. Cramer was his enthusiastic panegyrist. It is not only what
  he says of the private life and special taste of his adored friend
  which is noteworthy, but the way in which he does it--the tone in
  which, as a cultivated man of the day, he judged him. 'He will paint
  and paint Nature. For this he must be acquainted with her. This is
  why he loves her so well. This is why he strays by the brook and
  weeps. This is why in spring he goes out into the fields of blossoms,
  and his eyes run over with tears. All creation fills him with
  yearning and delight. He goes from mountain to valley like a man in a
  dream. When he sees a stream, he follows its course; when a hill, he
  must climb it; when a river--oh! if only he could rush with it to the
  sea! A rock--oh! to look down from its crags to the land below! A
  hawk hovers over <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg249" id=
  "pg249">249</a></span>him--oh! to have its wings and fly so much
  nearer to the stars! He stands for hours looking at a flower or moss,
  throws himself down on the grass and decks his hat with ivy and
  cornflowers. He goes by moonlight to visit the graves and think of
  death, immortality, and eternal life. Nothing hinders his
  meditations. He sees everything in relation to something else. Every
  visible object has an invisible companion, so ardently, so entirely,
  so closely does he feel it all.'</p>

  <p>This, coming straight from life, tells us more than a volume of
  odes; it contains the real feeling of the time, sensitive, dreamy,
  elegiac.</p>

  <p>His friend goes on: 'He walks often and likes it, but generally
  looks for sunny places; he goes very slowly, which is fatal for me,
  for I run when I walk ... Often he stands still and silent, as if
  there were knots which he could not untie (in his thoughts). And
  truly there are unknown depths of feeling as well as thought.'</p>

  <p>In another place: 'He went out and gloated over the great scene of
  immeasurable Nature. Orion and the Pleiades moved over his head, the
  dear moon was opposite. Looking intently into her friendly face, he
  greeted her repeatedly: "Moon, Moon, friend of my thoughts; hurry not
  away, dear Moon, but stay. What is thy name? Laura, Cynthia, Cyllene?
  Or shall I call thee beautiful Betty of the Sky?" ... He loved
  country walks; we made for lonely places, dark fearsome thickets,
  lonely unfrequented paths, scrambled up all the hills, spied out
  every bit of Nature, came to rest at last under a shady rock ...
  Klopstock's life is one constant enjoyment. He gives himself up to
  feeling, and revels in Nature's feast ... Winter is his favourite
  time of year....<a href="#k11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> He preaches
  skating with the unction of a missionary to the heathen, and not
  without working miracles, ... the ice by moonlight is a feast of the
  Gods to him ... only <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg250" id=
  "pg250">250</a></span>one rule, we do not leave the river till the
  moon has gone.' Klopstock described this in his <i>Skating</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>O youth, whose skill the ice-cothurn</p>

    <p>Drives glowing now, and now restrains,</p>

    <p>On city hearths let faggots burn,</p>

    <p>But come with me to crystal plains.</p>

    <p>The scene is filled with vapouring light,</p>

    <p>As when the winter morning's prime</p>

    <p>Looks on the lake. Above it night</p>

    <p>Scatters, like stars, the glittering rime.</p>

    <p>How still and white is all around!</p>

    <p>How rings the track with new sparr'd frost!</p>

    <p>Far off the metal's cymbal sound</p>

    <p>Betrays thee, for a moment lost ...</p>
  </div>

  <p>Cramer tells how Klopstock paid a long-remembered visit to Count
  Bernstoff at Schloss Stintenburg:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It has a most romantic situation in a bewitching part of
    Mecklenburg; 'tis surrounded by forest full of delightful gloom,
    and a large lake, with a charming little island in the centre,
    which wakes echoes. Klopstock is very fond of echoes, and is always
    trying to find them in his walks.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This illustrates the lines in <i>Stintenburg</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">Isle of pious solitude,</p>

    <p>Loved playmate of the echo and the lake, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <p>but in this ode, as in so many of his, simple personal feeling
  gives way to the stilted mannerism of the bard poetry.</p>

  <p>He wrote of Soroe,<a href="#k12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> one of the
  loveliest places in the Island of Zealand, as 'an uncommonly pleasant
  place'; where 'By a sacred tree, on a raised grass plot two hundred
  paces from the great alley, and from a view over the Friedensburg
  Lake towards a little wooded island ... Fanny appeared to him in the
  silver evening clouds over the tree-tops.'</p>

  <p>The day on which he composed <i>The Lake of Zurich</i> was one of
  the pleasantest in his life. Cramer says: 'He has often told me and
  still tells, with youthful fervour, about those delightful days
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg251" id="pg251">251</a></span>and
  this excursion: the boat full of people, mostly young, all in good
  spirits; charming girls, his wife Herzel, a lovely May morning.'</p>

  <p>But, unlike St Preux, he 'seemed less impressed by our scenery
  than by the beauty of our girls,<a href="#k13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
  and his letters bear out the remark.<a href=
  "#k14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Yet delight in Nature was always with him:
  Klopstock's lofty morality pours forth all through it. Nature, love,
  fame, wine, everything is looked at from an ennobling point of
  view.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Fair is the majesty of all thy works</p>

      <p>On the green earth, O Mother Nature fair!</p>

      <p>The glimmering night, the rosy dawn.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This is true lyric feeling, spontaneous, not forced. Many of his
  odes, and parts of the <i>Messias</i>, shew great love for Nature.
  There is a fine flight of imagination in <i>The Festival of
  Spring</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Not into the ocean of all the worlds would I plunge--not hover
    where the first created, the glad choirs of the sons of light,
    adore, deeply adore and sunk in ecstasy. Only around the drop on
    the bucket, only around the earth, would I hover and adore.
    Hallelujah! hallelujah! the drop on the bucket flowed also out of
    the hand of the Almighty.</p>

    <p>When out of the hand of the Almighty the greater earth flowed,
    when the streams of light rushed, and the seven stars began to
    be--then flowedst thou, drop, out of the hand of the Almighty.</p>

    <p>When a stream of light rushed, and our sun began to be, a
    cataract of waves of light poured, as adown the rock a storm-cloud,
    and girded Orion, then flowedst thou, drop, out of the hand of the
    Almighty. Who are the thousandfold thousands, who all the myriads
    that inhabit the drop?...</p>

    <p>But thou, worm of Spring, which, greenly golden, art fluttering
    beside me, thou livest and art, perhaps, ah! not immortal....</p>

    <p>The storm winds that carry the thunder, how they roar, how with
    loud waves they stream athwart the forest! Now they hush, slow
    wanders the black cloud....</p>

    <p>Ah! already rushes heaven and earth with the gracious rain; now
    is the earth refreshed....</p>

    <p>Behold Jehovah comes no longer in storm; in gentle pleasant
    murmurs comes Jehovah, and under him bends the bow of peace.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In another ode, <i>The Worlds</i>, he calls the stars 'drops of
  the ocean.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg254" id="pg254">254</a></span>
  Again, in <i>Death</i> he shews the sense of his own nothingness, in
  presence of the overpowering greatness of the Creator:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Ye starry hosts that glitter in the sky,</p>

    <p>How ye exalt me! Trancing is the sight</p>

    <p>Of all Thy glorious works, Most High.</p>

    <p>How lofty art Thou in Thy wondrous might;</p>

    <p>What joy to gaze upon these hosts, to one</p>

    <p>Who feels himself so little, God so great,</p>

    <p>Himself but dust, and the great God his own!</p>

    <p>Oh, when I die, such rapture on me wait!</p>
  </div>

  <p>As regards our subject, Klopstock performed this function--he
  tuned the strings of feeling for Nature to a higher pitch, thereby
  excelling all his contemporaries. His poetry always tended to
  extravagance; but in thought, feeling, and language alike, he was
  ahead of his time.</p>

  <p>The idyllic was now cultivated with increased fervour, especially
  by the Göttingen Brotherhood of Poets. The artificial and
  conventional began to wane, and Nature's own voice was heard again.
  The songs of Claudius were like a breath of spring.<a href=
  "#k15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> His peasant songs have the genuine ring;
  they are hail-fellow-well-met with Nature. Hebel is the only modern
  poet like him.</p>

  <h4>EVENING SONG</h4>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The lovely day-star's run its course....</p>

    <p>Come, mop my face, dear wife,</p>

    <p>And then dish up....</p>

    <p>The silvery moon will look down from his place</p>

    <p>And preside at our meal over dishes and grace.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He hated artificiality:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Simple joy in Nature, free from artifice, gives as great a
    pleasure as an honest lover's kiss.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>His <i>Cradle Song to be sung by Moonlight</i> is delightful in
  its naive humour (the moon was his special favourite): <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg255" id="pg255">255</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Sleep then, little one. Why dost thou weep?</p>

    <p>Moonlight so tender and quiet so deep,</p>

    <p>Quickly and easily cometh thy sleep.</p>

    <p>Fond of all little ones is the good moon;</p>

    <p>Girls most of all, but he even loves boys.</p>

    <p>Down from up there he sends beautiful toys....</p>

    <p>He's old as a raven, he goes everywhere;</p>

    <p>Even when father was young, he was there.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The pearl of his poems is the exquisite <i>Evening Song</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The moon hath risen on high,</p>

      <p>And in the clear dark sky</p>

      <p>The golden stars all brightly glow;</p>

      <p>And black and hushed the woods,</p>

      <p>While o'er the fields and floods</p>

      <p>The white mists hover to and fro.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>How still the earth, how calm!</p>

      <p>What dear and home-like charm</p>

      <p>From gentle twilight doth she borrow!</p>

      <p>Like to some quiet room,</p>

      <p>Where, wrapt in still soft gloom,</p>

      <p>We sleep away the daylight's sorrow.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Boie's <i>Evening Song</i> is in the same key. None of the
  moonshine poets of his day expressed night-fall like this:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">How still it is! How soft</p>

    <p class="i6">The breezes blow!</p>

    <p>The lime leaves lisp in whisper and echo answers low;</p>

    <p>Scarce audibly the rivulet running amid the flower</p>

    <p>With murmuring ripple laps the edge of yonder mystic bower.</p>

    <p>And ever darker grows the veil thou weavest o'er the land,</p>

    <p>And ever quieter the hush--a hush as of the grave....</p>

    <p>Listen! 'tis Night! she comes, unlighted by a star,</p>

    <p>And with the slow sweep of her heavy wing</p>

    <p>Awes and revives the timid earth.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Bürger sings in praise of idyllic comfort in <i>The Village</i>,
  and Hoelty's mild enthusiasm, touched with melancholy, turned in the
  same direction.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg256" id=

  <blockquote>
    <p>My predilection is for rural poetry and melancholy enthusiasm;
    all I ask is a hut, a forest, a meadow with a spring in it, and a
    wife in my hut.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The beginning of his <i>Country Life</i> shews that moralizing was
  still in the air:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Happy the man who has the town escaped!</p>

    <p>To him the whistling trees, the murmuring brooks,</p>

    <p>The shining pebbles preach</p>

    <p>Virtue's and wisdom's lore....</p>

    <p>The nightingale on him sings slumber down;</p>

    <p>The nightingale rewakes him, fluting sweet,</p>

    <p>When shines the lovely red</p>

    <p>Of morning through the trees.</p>

    <p>Then he admires Thee in the plain, O God!</p>

    <p>In the ascending pomp of dawning day,</p>

    <p>Thee in Thy glorious sun.</p>

    <p>The worm--the budding branch--</p>

    <p>Where coolness gushes in the waving branch</p>

    <p>Or o'er the flowers streams the fountain, rests,</p>

    <p>Inhales the breadth of prime</p>

    <p>The gentle airs of eve.</p>

    <p>His straw-decked thatch, where doves bask in the sun,</p>

    <p>And play, and hop, invites to sweeter rest</p>

    <p>Than golden halls of state</p>

    <p>Or beds of down afford.</p>

    <p>To him the plumy people</p>

    <p>Chatter and whistle on his</p>

    <p>And from his quiet hand</p>

    <p>Peck crumbs or peas or grains</p>

  <p>Hoeltz was the most sentimental of this group; Joh. Heinrich Voss
  was more robust and cheerful. He put his strength into his longer
  poems; the lyrics contain a great deal of nonsense. An extract from
  <i>Luise</i> will shew his idyllic taste:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Wandering thus through blue fields of flax and acres of barley,
    both paused on the hill-top, which commands such a view of the
    whole lake, crisped with the soft breath of the zephyr and
    sparkling in sunshine; fair were the forests of white barked birch
    beyond, and the fir-trees, lovely the village at the foot half hid
    by the wood. Lovely Luise had welcomed her parents and shewn them a
    green mound under an old beech tree, where the prospect was very
    inviting. 'There we propose,' said she, to unpack and to spread the
    breakfast. Then we'll adjourn to the boat and be rowed for a time
    on the water,' etc.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We find the same taste, often expressed in a very original way, in
  both the brothers Stolberg. In Christian Stolberg's <i>Elegy to
  Hangwitz</i>, for instance, another poem has these lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Thither, where 'mong the trees of life,</p>

    <p>Where in celestial bowers</p>

    <p>Under your fig-tree, bowed with fruit</p>

    <p>And warranting repose,</p>

    <p>Under your pine, inviting shady joy,</p>

    <p>Unchanging blooms</p>

    <p>Eternal Spring!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Friedrich Stolberg was a very prophet of Nature; in his ode
  <i>Nature</i> he says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>He who does not love Nature cannot be my friend.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His prayer may serve as the motto of his day:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Holy Nature, heavenly fair,</p>

    <p>Lead me with thy parent care;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg258" id=
    "pg258">258</a></span>In thy footsteps let me tread</p>

    <p>As a willing child is led.</p>

    <p>When with care and grief opprest,</p>

    <p>Soft I sink me on thy breast;</p>

    <p>On thy peaceful bosom laid,</p>

    <p>Grief shall cease, nor care invade.</p>

    <p>O congenial power divine,</p>

    <p>All my votive soul is thine.</p>

    <p>Lead me with thy parent care,</p>

    <p>Holy Nature, heavenly fair!</p>
  </div>

  <p>He, too, sang the moon; but Klopstock's influence seems to have
  carried him to higher flights than his contemporaries. He wrote in
  fine language of wild scenery, even sea and mountains, which had
  played no part in German poetry before.</p>

  <h4>TO THE SEA</h4>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Thou boundless, shining, glorious sea,</p>

    <p>With ecstasy I gaze on thee;</p>

    <p>Joy, joy to him whose early beam</p>

    <p>Kisses thy lip, bright ocean stream.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the thousand hours, old sea,</p>

    <p>Of sweet communion held with thee;</p>

    <p>Oft as I gazed, thy billowy roll</p>

    <p>Woke the deep feelings of my soul.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There are beautiful notes, reminding one of Goethe, in his
  <i>Unsterbliche Jüngling, Ode to a Mountain Torrent</i>.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Immortal youth!</p>

    <p>Thou streamest forth from rocky caves;</p>

    <p>No mortal saw</p>

    <p>The cradle of thy might,</p>

    <p>No ear has heard</p>

    <p>Thy infant stammering in the gushing Spring.</p>

    <p>How lovely art thou in thy silver locks!</p>

    <p>How dreadful thundering from the echoing crags!</p>

    <p>At thy approach</p>

    <p>The firwood quakes;</p>

    <p>Thou easiest down, with root and branch, the fir</p>

    <p>Thou seizest on the rock,</p>

    <p>And roll'st it scornful like a pebble on.</p>

    <p>Thee the sun clothes in dazzling beams of glory,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg259" id=
    "pg259">259</a></span>Why hasten so to the cerulean sea?</p>

    <p>Is not the neighbourhood of heaven good?</p>

    <p>Not grand thy temple of encircling rocks?</p>

    <p>Not fair the forest hanging o'er thy bed?</p>

    <p>Hasten not so to the cerulean sea;</p>

    <p>Youth, thou art here,</p>

    <p>Strong as a god,</p>

    <p>Free as a god,</p>

    <p>Though yonder beckon treacherous calms below,</p>

    <p>The wavering lustre of the silent sea,</p>

    <p>Now softly silvered by the swimming moon,</p>

    <p>Now rosy golden in the western beam;</p>

    <p>Youth, what is silken rest,</p>

    <p>And what the smiling of the friendly moon,</p>

    <p>Or gold or purple of the evening sun,</p>

    <p>To him who feels himself in thraldom's bonds?</p>

    <p>Here thou canst wildly stream</p>

    <p>As bids thy heart;</p>

    <p>Below are masters, ever-changeful minds,</p>

    <p>Or the dead stillness of the servile main.</p>

    <p>Hasten not so to the cerulean sea;</p>

    <p>Youth, thou art here,</p>

    <p>Strong as a god,</p>

    <p>Free as a god.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Here we have, with all Klopstock's pathos, a love for the wild and
  grandiose in Nature, almost unique in Germany, in this time of
  idyllic sentimentality. But the discovery of the beauty of romantic
  mountain scenery had been made by Rousseau some time before, for
  Rousseau, too, was a typical forerunner, and his romances fell like a
  bomb-shell among all the idyllic pastoral fiction of the day.
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg260" id="pg260">260</a></span></p>

  <h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <h3>THE AWAKENING OF FEELING FOR THE ROMANTIC</h3>

  <p>Rousseau was one of those rare men who bring about a complete
  change in the culture of their time by their revolutionary
  originality. In such beings the world's history, so to speak, begins
  again. Out of touch with their own day, and opposed to its ruling
  taste and mode of thought, they are a law unto themselves, and
  naturally tend to measure all things by themselves, while their too
  great subjectivity is apt to be increased by a morbid sophistry of
  passion and the conviction of the prophet.</p>

  <p>Of this type, unchecked by a broad sense of humanity, full of
  subversive wilfulness, and not only untrained in moderation, but
  degenerating into crass exaggeration, Rousseau was the first
  example.</p>

  <p>Hellenism, the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, had only produced
  forerunners. What in Petrarch was a tendency, became an established
  condition in Rousseau: the acedia reached its climax. All that went
  on in his mind was so much grit for his own mill, subject-matter for
  his observation, and therefore of the greatest value to him. He lived
  in introspection, a spectator of his own struggles, his own waverings
  between an ideal of simple duty and the imperious demands of a
  selfish and sensuous ego. His passion for Nature partially atoned for
  his unamiable and doubtful character; he was false in many ways; but
  that feeling rang true--it was <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg261"
  id="pg261">261</a></span>the best part of him, and of that 'idealism
  of the heart' whose right of rule he asserted in an age of
  artificiality and petty formalism. Those were no empty words in his
  third letter to Malesherbes:</p>

  <p>'Which time of my life do you suppose I recall most often and most
  willingly in my dreams? Not the pleasures of youth; they were too
  few, too much mixed with bitterness, and they are too far away now.
  It is the time of my retreat, of my solitary walks--those fast-flying
  delicious days that I passed all alone by myself, with my good and
  simple Thérèse, my beloved dog, my old cat, with the wild birds and
  the roes of the forest, with all Nature and her inconceivable
  Maker.</p>

  <p>'When I got up early to go and watch the sunrise from my garden,
  when I saw a fine day begin, my first wish was that neither letters
  nor visitors might come to break its charm....</p>

  <p>'Then I would seek out some wild place in the forest, some desert
  spot where there was nothing to shew the hand of man, and so tell of
  servitude and rule--some refuge which I could fancy I was the first
  to discover, and where no importunate third party came between Nature
  and me....</p>

  <p>'The gold broom and the purple heather touched my heart; the
  majestic trees that shaded me, the delicate shrubs around, the
  astonishing variety of plants and flowers that I trod under foot,
  kept me alternately admiring and observing.'</p>

  <p>His writings shew that with him return to Nature was no mere
  theory, but real earnest; they condemned the popular garden-craft and
  carpet fashions, and set up in their place the rights of the heart,
  and free enjoyment of Nature in her wild state, undisturbed by the
  hand of man.</p>

  <p>It was Rousseau who first discovered that the Alps were beautiful.
  But to see this fact in its true light, we must glance back at the
  opinions of preceding periods.<a href="#l1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg262" id="pg262">262</a></span>
  Though the Alpine countries were the arena of all sorts of
  enterprise, warlike and peaceful, in the fifteenth century, most of
  the interest excited by foreign parts was absorbed by the great
  voyages of discovery; the Alps themselves were almost entirely
  omitted from the maps.</p>

  <p>To be just to the time, it must be conceded that security and
  comfort in travelling are necessary preliminaries to our modern
  mountain rapture, and in the Middle Ages these were non-existent.
  Roads and inns were few; there was danger from robbers as well as
  weather, so that the prevailing feelings on such journeys were misery
  and anxiety, not pleasure. Knowledge of science, too, was only just
  beginning; botany, geology, and geognosy were very slightly diffused;
  glacier theories were undreamt of. The sight of a familiar scene near
  the great snow-peaks roused men's admiration, because they were
  surprised to find it there; this told especially in favour of the
  idyllic mountain valleys.</p>

  <p>Felix Fabri, the preacher monk of Ulm, visited the East in 1480
  and 1483, and gave a lifelike description of his journeys through the
  Alps in his second account. He said<a href=
  "#l2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>:</p>

  <p>'Although the Alps themselves seem dreadful and rigid from the
  cold of the snow or the heat of the sun, and reach up to the clouds,
  the valleys below them are pleasant, and as rich and fruitful in all
  earthly delights as Paradise itself. Many people and animals inhabit
  them, and almost every metal is dug out of the Alps, especially
  silver. 'Mid such charms as these men live among the mountains, and
  Nature blooms as if Venus, Bacchus, and Ceres reigned there. No one
  who saw the Alps from afar would believe what a delicious Paradise is
  to be found amid the eternal snow and mountains of perpetual winter
  and never-melting ice.'</p>

  <p>Very limited praise only extended to the valleys!</p>

  <p>In the sixteenth century we have the records of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg263" id="pg263">263</a></span>those who crossed
  the Alps with an army, such as Adam Reissner, the biographer of the
  Frundsberg, and mention their 'awe' at sight of the valleys, and of
  those who had travelled to Italy and the East, and congratulated
  themselves that their troublesome wanderings through the Alps were
  over. Savants were either very sparing of words about their travels,
  or else made rugged verses which shewed no trace of mountain
  inspiration. There were no outbursts of admiration at sight of the
  great snow-peaks; 'horrible' and 'dreadful' were the current
  epithets. The æsthetic sense was not sufficiently developed, and
  discount as we will for the dangers and discomforts of the road, and,
  as with the earlier travellers to the East, for some lack of power of
  expression, the fact remains that mountains were not appreciated. The
  prevalent notion of beautiful scenery was very narrow, and even among
  cultured people only meant broad, level country.</p>

  <p>B. Kiechel<a href="#l3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (1585) was enthusiastic
  about 'the beautiful level scenery' of Lichfeld, and found it
  difficult to breathe among the Alps. Schickhart wrote: 'We were
  delighted to get away from the horrible tedious mountains,' and has
  nothing to say of the Brenner Pass except this poor joke: 'It did not
  burn us much, for what with the ice and very deep snow and horribly
  cold wind, we found no heat.' The most enthusiastic description is of
  the Lake of Como, by Paulus Jovius (1552), praising
  Bellagio,'<a href="#l4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> In the seventeenth century
  there was some admiration for the colossal proportions of the Alps,
  but only as a foil to the much admired valleys.</p>

  <p>J.J. Grasser wrote of Rhoetia<a href="#l5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>:
  'There are marble masses projecting, looking like walls and towers in
  imitation of all sorts of wonderful architecture. The villages lie
  scattered in the valleys, here and there the ground is most fruitful.
  There <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg264" id=
  "pg264">264</a></span>is luxuriance close to barrenness, gracefulness
  close to dreadfulness, life close to loneliness. The delight of the
  painter's eye is here, yet Nature excels all the skill of art. The
  very ravines, tortuous foot-paths, torrents, alternately raging and
  meagre, the arched bridges, waves on the lakes, varied dress of the
  fields, the mighty trees, in short, whatever heaven and earth grant
  to the sight, is an astonishment and a pastime to the enraptured eye
  of the wanderer.'</p>

  <p>But this pastime depended upon the contrast between the charming
  valleys and the dreadful mountains.</p>

  <p>Joseph Furttenbach (1591) writing about the same district of
  Thusis, described 'the little bridges, under which one hears the
  Rhine flowing with a great roar, and sees what a horrible cruel
  wilderness the place is.' In Conrad Gessner's <i>De admiratione
  Montium</i> (1541)<a href="#l6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> a passage occurs
  which shews that even in Switzerland itself in the sixteenth century
  one voice was found to praise Alpine scenery in a very different way,
  anticipating Rousseau. 'I have resolved that so long as God grants me
  life I will climb some mountains every year, or at least one
  mountain, partly to learn the mountain flora, partly to strengthen my
  body and refresh my soul. What a pleasure it is to see the monstrous
  mountain masses, and lift one's head among the clouds. How it
  stimulates worship, to be surrounded by the snowy domes, which the
  Great Architect of the world built up in one long day of creation!
  How empty is the life, how mean the striving of those who only crawl
  about on the earth for gain and home-baked pleasures! The earthly
  paradise is closed to them.'</p>

  <p>Yet, just as after Rousseau, and even in the nineteenth century,
  travellers were to be found who thought the Alps 'dreadful' (I refer
  to Chateaubriand's 'hideux'), so such praise as this found no echo in
  its own day.</p>

  <p>But with the eighteenth century came a change. <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg265" id="pg265">265</a></span>Travelling no
  longer subserved the one practical end of making acquaintance with
  the occupations, the morals, the affairs generally, of other peoples;
  a new scientific interest arose, geologists and physicists ventured
  to explore the glaciers and regions of perpetual snow, and first
  admiration, and then love, supplanted the old feeling of horror.</p>

  <p>Modern methods began with Scheuchzer's (1672-1733) <i>Itinera
  Alpina</i>. Every corner of the Alps was explored--the Splugen,
  Julier, Furka, Gotthard, etc.--and glaciers, avalanches, ores,
  fossils, plants examined. Haller, as his verses shew, was botanist as
  well as theologian, historian, and poet; but he did not appreciate
  mountain beauty.</p>

  <p>Brockes to some extent did. He described the Harz Mountains in the
  Fourth Book of his <i>Earthly Pleasure in God (Irdisches Vergüngen in
  Gott)</i>; and in his <i>Observations on the Blankenburg Marble</i>
  he said: 'In many parts the rough mountain heights were monstrously
  beautiful, their size delights and appals us'; and wound up a
  discussion of wild scenery in contrast to cultivated with: 'Ponder
  this with joy and reverence, my soul. The mountain heights wild and
  beautiful shew us a picture of earthly disorder.'<a href=
  "#l7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> It was very long before expressions of
  horror and fear entirely disappeared from descriptions of the Alps.
  In Richardson's <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i> we read: 'We bid adieu
  to France and found ourselves in Savoy, equally noted for its poverty
  and rocky mountains. We had left behind us a blooming Spring, which
  enlivened with its verdure the trees and hedges on the road we
  passed, and the meadows already smiled with flowers.... Every object
  which here presents itself is excessively miserable.' Savoy is 'one
  of the worst countries under Heaven.'</p>

  <p>Addison,<a href="#l8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> on the other hand,
  wrote of the Alps from Ripaille: 'It was the pleasantest voyage in
  the world to follow the windings of this river Inn <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg266" id="pg266">266</a></span>through such a
  variety of pleasing scenes as the course of it naturally led us. We
  had sometimes on each side of us a vast extent of naked rocks and
  mountains, broken into a thousand irregular steps and precipices
  ... but, as the materials of a fine landscape are not always the
  most profitable to the owner of them, we met with but little corn
  or pasturage,' etc. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu<a
  href="#l9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> wrote from Lyons, Sept. 25, 1718:
  'The prodigious aspect of mountains covered with eternal snow,
  clouds hanging far below our feet, and the vast cascades tumbling
  down the rocks with a confused roaring, would have been solemnly
  entertaining to me, if I had suffered less from the extreme cold
  that reigns here.'</p>

  <p>On the whole, Switzerland was little known at the beginning of the
  eighteenth century. Many travellers still measured the value of
  scenery entirely by fertility, like Keyssler,<a href=
  "#l10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> who praised garden-like level country such
  as that round Mantua, in contrast to the useless wild Tyrolese
  mountains and the woods of Westphalia; and Lüneburg or Moser,<a href=
  "#l11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> who observed ironically to Abbt (1763),
  after reading <i>Emilia</i> and <i>La Nouvelle Héloise</i>: 'The
  far-famed Alps, about which so much fuss has been made.'</p>

  <p>Rousseau was the real exponent of rapture for the high Alps and
  romantic scenery in general. Isolated voices had expressed some
  feeling before him, but it was he who deliberately proclaimed it, and
  gave romantic scenery the first place among the beauties of Nature.
  He did not, as so many would have it--Du Bois Reymond, for
  example--discover our modern feeling for Nature; the great men of the
  Renaissance, even the Hellenic poets, fore-ran him; but he directed
  it, with feeling itself in general, into new channels.<a href=
  "#l12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In French literature he stood alone; the descriptions of landscape
  before him were either borrowed blossoms of antiquity or sentimental
  and erotic <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg267" id=
  "pg267">267</a></span>pastorals. He opened up again for his country
  the taste for wood and field, sunshine and moonlight, for the
  idyllic, and, above all, for the sublime, which had been lost under
  artificiality and false taste.</p>

  <p>The primitive freshness, the genuine ring of his enthusiasm for
  country life, was worth all the laboured pastorals and fables of
  previous periods of literature.</p>

  <p>His <i>Confessions</i> opened not only the eyes of France, but the
  heart.</p>

  <p>A Swiss by birth, and living in one of the most beautiful parts of
  Europe, Rousseau was devotedly fond of his home on the Lake of
  Geneva. As a boy he loved to leave the city and rove in the
  country.</p>

  <p>He describes how once on a Sunday in 1728 he wandered about,
  forgetting the time. 'Before me were fields, trees, flowers; the
  beautiful lake, the hill country, and high mountains unfolded
  themselves majestically before my eyes. I gloated over the beautiful
  spectacle while the sun was setting. At last, too late, I saw that
  the city gates were shut.'</p>

  <p>From that time on he felt more drawn to Nature than to men. In the
  Fourth Book of the <i>Confessions</i> he says, speaking of 1732:</p>

  <p>'A view of the Lake of Geneva and its beautiful banks has had even
  in my idea a particular attraction that I cannot describe, not
  arising merely from the beauty of the prospect, but something, I know
  not what, more interesting which affects and softens me. 'Every time
  I have approached the Vaudois country, I have experienced an
  impression composed of the remembrance of Mademoiselle de Warens, who
  was born there; of my father, who lived there; of Mademoiselle de
  Wulson, who had been my first love; and of several pleasant journeys
  I had made there in my childhood, mingled with some nameless charm,
  more powerfully attractive than all the rest. When that ardent desire
  for a life of happiness and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg268" id=
  "pg268">268</a></span>tranquillity (which ever follows me, and for
  which I was born) inflames my mind, 'tis ever to the country of Vaud,
  near the lake, on those charming plains, that imagination leads me.
  An orchard on the banks of that lake, and no other, is absolutely
  necessary; a firm friend, an amiable woman, a cow, and a little boat;
  nor could I enjoy perfect happiness on earth without these
  concomitants.... On my way to Vevey I gave myself up to the soft
  melancholy ... I sighed and wept like a child.'</p>

  <p>He clung to Nature, and most of all when surrounded by human
  beings; a morbid impulse to flee from them was always present as a
  negative element in the background of his love for her. His Fifth
  Reverie, the most beautiful one, shews this.</p>

  <p>He had gone to the Peter Island on the Lake of Bienne. So far as
  he knew, no other traveller had paid any attention to the place; but
  that did not disturb his confidence in his own taste.</p>

  <p>'The shores of the Lake of Bienne are wilder and more romantic
  than those of the Lake of Geneva, because the rocks and woods come
  nearer to the water; but they are not less radiant. With less
  cultivation and fewer vineyards, towns, and houses, there are more
  green fields and shady sheltered spots, more contrasts and
  irregularities. As there are no good carriage roads on these happy
  shores, the district is little frequented by travellers; but it is
  interesting for the solitary contemplation of those who like to
  intoxicate themselves at their leisure with Nature's charms, and to
  retire into a silence unbroken by any sound but the eagle's cry, the
  intermittent warbling of birds, and the roar of torrents falling from
  the mountains,'</p>

  <p>Here he had a delightful Robinson Crusoe existence. The only other
  human beings were the Bernese manager with his family and labourers.
  He counted his two months among the happiest of his life, and would
  have liked to stay for ever. True <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg269" id="pg269">269</a></span>to his character, he proceeded to
  analyze the charm of the episode, and decided that it was made up of
  the <i>dolce far niente</i>, solitude, absence of books and writing
  materials, dealing with simple folk, healthy movement in the open
  air, field labour, and, above all, intercourse with Nature, both in
  admiring and studying her. He was seized with a passion for
  botanizing, and planned a comprehensive Flora Petrinsularis, dividing
  the whole island into quarters, so that no part might escape
  notice.</p>

  <p>'There is nothing more strange than the ravishment, the ecstasy, I
  felt at each observation I made upon vegetable structure and
  organization.</p>

  <p>'I would go by myself, throw myself into a boat when the water was
  calm, and row to the middle of the lake, and then, lying full-length
  in the boat with my eyes to the sky, I would let myself drift,
  sometimes for hours, lost in a thousand confused but delicious
  reveries.... Often when the sunset reminded me that it was time to
  return, I found myself so far from the island that I was forced to
  pull with all my strength to get back before night-fall. At other
  times, instead of wandering about the lake, I amused myself by
  skirting the green shores of the island where the limpid water and
  cool shade often invited to a bathe.... When the lake was too rough
  for rowing, I would spend the afternoon scouring the island,
  botanizing right and left. I often sat down to dream at leisure in
  sunny, lonely nooks, or on the terraces and hillocks, to gaze at the
  superb ravishing panorama of the lake and its shores--one side
  crowned by near mountains, the other spread out in rich and fertile
  plains, across which the eye looked to the more distant boundary of
  blue mountains.... When evening fell, I came down from the higher
  parts of the mountains and sat by the shore in some hidden spot, and
  there the sound of the waves and the movements of the water, making
  me oblivious of all other distraction, would <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg270" id="pg270">270</a></span>plunge me into
  delicious reverie. The ebb and flow of the water, and the sound of
  it, restrained and yet swelling at intervals, by striking eye and ear
  without ceasing, came to the aid of those inner movements of the mind
  which reverie destroys, and sufficed to make me pleasantly conscious
  of existence without the trouble of thinking.... There is nothing
  actual in all this to which the heart can attach itself; even in our
  most intense enjoyment there is scarcely a moment of which the heart
  can truly say "I should like it to stay for ever."'</p>

  <p>One thinks of Faust: 'O moment! tarry awhile, thou art so
  fair!'</p>

  <p>However, at the close of the Reverie he admits that he has often
  had such moments--moments free from all earthly passion--on the lake
  and on the island. His feeling was increased by botanical knowledge,
  and later on in life the world of trees and plants became his one
  safe refuge when pursued by delusions of persecution.</p>

  <p>The Seventh Reverie has a touching account of his pleasure in
  botany, of the effect of 'earth in her wedding-dress, the only scene
  in the world of which eyes and heart never weary,' the intoxicating
  sense that he was part of a great system in which individual detail
  disappears, and he only sees and hears the whole.</p>

  <p>'Shunning men, seeking solitude, no longer dreaming, still less
  thinking, I began to concern myself with all my surroundings, giving
  the preference to my favourites...brilliant flowers, emerald meadows,
  fresh shade, streams, thickets, green turf, these purified my
  imagination.... Attracted by the pleasant objects around, I note
  them, study them, and finally learn to classify them, and so become
  at one stroke as much of a botanist as one need be when one only
  studies Nature to find ever new reasons for loving her.</p>

  <p>'The plants seem sown in profusion over the <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg271" id="pg271">271</a></span>earth like the
  stars in the sky, to invite man, through pleasure and curiosity, to
  study them; but the stars are far off; they require preliminary
  knowledge ... while plants grow under our very feet--lie, so to
  speak, in our very hands.'</p>

  <p>He had a peaceful sense of being free from his enemies when he was
  pursuing his botany in the woods. He described one
  never-to-be-forgotten ramble when he lost himself in a dense thicket
  close to a dizzy precipice, where, save for some rare birds, he was
  quite alone. He was just feeling the pride of a Columbus in the
  discovery of new ground, when his eye fell upon a manufactory not far
  off. His first feeling was a flash of delight at finding himself
  again among men; but this gave way to the more lasting and painful
  one, that even among the Alps there was no escape from his
  tormentors.</p>

  <p>Years later, when he knew that he would never revisit the spot,
  the leaves in his herbarium would carry him back to it in memory.</p>

  <p>So strong a personal attachment to Nature, solitude, and
  retirement had not been known before; but it was thrown into this
  high relief by the morbid dread of man and hatred of culture, which
  formed a constant dark background to his mind. It was a state of mind
  which naturally led to intense dislike of formal French gardens and
  open admiration of the English park. He rejected all the garnish of
  garden-craft, even grafted roses and fruit trees, and only admitted
  indigenous plants which grew outdoors.<a href=
  "#l13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> It is greatly due to his feeling for
  English Park style that a healthier garden-craft gained ground in
  Germany as well as France. The foremost maxim of his philosophy and
  teaching, that everything is good as it comes from the bosom of
  mother Nature, or rather from the hand of God, and that man and his
  culture are responsible for all the evil, worked out in his attitude
  towards Nature.</p>

  <p>He placed her upon a pedestal, worshipping her, <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg272" id="pg272">272</a></span>and the Creator
  through her, and this made him the first to recognize the fact that
  study of Nature, especially of botany, should be an important factor
  in the education of children.</p>

  <p>His <i>Confessions</i>, the truest photographs of a human
  character in existence, shew at once the keenest introspection and
  intense love for Nature. No one before Rousseau had been so aware of
  his own individuality--that is, of himself, as a being--who in this
  particular state only exists once, and has therefore not only
  relative but absolute value. He gave this peculiarity its full value,
  studying it as a thing outside himself, of which every detail was
  important, watching with great interest his own change of moods, the
  fluctuations of that double self which now lifted him to the ideal,
  now cast him down to the lowest and commonest. His relation to Nature
  was the best thing about him, and when he was happy, as he was for
  the first time in the society of Mademoiselle de Warens, Nature
  seemed lovelier than ever.</p>

  <p>The scattered passages about Nature in the <i>Confessions</i> have
  a youthful freshness:</p>

  <p>'The appearance of Aurora seemed so delightful one morning, that,
  putting on my clothes, I hastened into the country to see the rising
  of the sun. I enjoyed that pleasure to its utmost extent. It was one
  week after midsummer: the earth was covered with verdure and flowers;
  the nightingales, whose soft warblings were almost over, seemed to
  vie with each other, and, in concert with birds of various kinds, to
  bid adieu to spring and hail the approach of a beautiful summer's
  day.'</p>

  <p>He loved rambling over hill and dale, even by night; thus, when he
  was at Lyons:</p>

  <p>'It had been a very hot day, the evening was delightful, the dew
  moistened the parched grass, no wind was stirring; the air was fresh
  without chilliness, the setting sun had tinged the clouds with
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg273" id="pg273">273</a></span>a
  beautiful crimson, which was again reflected by the water, and the
  trees bordering the terrace were filled with nightingales that were
  constantly answering each other's songs. I walked along in a kind of
  ecstasy, surrendering my heart and senses to the enjoyment of so many
  delights, and sighing only from regret at enjoying them alone.
  Absorbed in this pleasing reverie, I lengthened my walk till it grew
  very late, without perceiving I was tired. At length I threw myself
  on the steps of a kind of niche in a terrace wall. How charming was
  that couch! The trees formed a stately canopy, a nightingale sat
  directly over me, and with his soft notes lulled me to rest. How
  delicious my repose! my awakening more so. It was broad day; on
  opening my eyes, I saw the water, the verdure, and an adorable
  landscape before me.'</p>

  <p>At the end of the Fourth Book he states his idea of beautiful
  scenery:</p>

  <p>'I love to walk at my ease and stop at leisure ... travelling on
  foot in a fine country with fine weather ... and having an agreeable
  object to terminate my journey. It is already understood what I mean
  by a fine country; never can a flat one, though ever so beautiful,
  appear such to my eyes. I must have torrents, fir trees, black woods,
  mountains to climb or descend, and rugged roads with precipices on
  either side to alarm me. I experienced this pleasure to its utmost
  extent as I approached Chambéry, not far from a mountain road called
  the Pas d'Échelle. Above the main road, hewn through the solid rock,
  a small river runs and rushes into fearful chasms, which it appears
  to have been millions of ages in forming. The road has been hedged by
  a parapet to prevent accidents, and I was thus enabled to contemplate
  the whole descent and gain vertigoes at pleasure, for a great part of
  my amusement in these steep rocks lies in their causing a giddiness
  and swimming in my head, which I am <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg274" id="pg274">274</a></span>particularly fond of, provided I am
  in safety. Leaning therefore on the parapet, I remained whole hours,
  catching from time to time a glance of the froth and blue water whose
  rushing caught my ear, mingled with the cries of ravens and other
  birds of prey that flew from rock to rock and bush to bush at 600
  feet below me.'</p>

  <p>His preference was for the wild and sublime, and he was glad that
  this was not a popular taste; but he could write glowing descriptions
  of more idyllic scenery and of village life.</p>

  <p>He said of a day at the Charmettes, a property near Chambéry, with
  his beloved friend Madame de Warens, at the end of 1736:</p>

  <p>'I arose with the sun and was happy; I walked and was happy; I saw
  Madame de Warens and was happy; I quitted her and still was happy.
  Whether I rambled through the woods, over the hills, or strolled
  along the valley; read, was idle, worked in the garden, or gathered
  fruits, happiness continually accompanied me.'</p>

  <p>He offered his morning prayer from a hill-top, and in the evening,
  before he left, stooped to kiss the ground and the trees, gazing till
  they were out of sight at the places where he had been so happy.</p>

  <p>At the Hermitage with Thérèse there was a similar idyll.</p>

  <p>The most epoch--making event in European feeling for Nature was
  the appearance of <i>La Nouvelle Héloise</i> (1761). The book
  overflows with Rousseau's raptures about the Lake of Geneva. St Preux
  says:</p>

  <p>'The nearer I drew to Switzerland, the greater were my emotions.
  That instant in which I discovered the Lake of Geneva from the
  heights of Jura, was a moment of ecstasy and rapture. The sight of my
  country, my beloved country, where a deluge of pleasure had
  overflowed my heart; the pure and wholesome air of the Alps, the
  gentle breeze <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg275" id=
  "pg275">275</a></span>of the country, more sweet than the perfumes of
  the East; that rich and fertile spot, that unrivalled landscape, the
  most beautiful that ever struck the eye of man, that delightful
  abode, to which I found nothing comparable in the vast tour of the
  globe; the mildness of the season, the serenity of the climate, a
  thousand pleasing recollections which recalled to my mind the
  pleasures I had enjoyed;--all these circumstances together threw me
  into a kind of transport which I cannot describe, and seemed to
  collect the enjoyment of my whole life into one happy moment.'</p>

  <p><i>La Nouvelle Héloise</i> shewed the world three things in quite
  a new light: the inner consciousness which was determined to give
  feeling its rights again, though well aware that 'a feeling heart is
  an unhappy gift from heaven'; the taste for solitude, 'all noble
  passions are formed in solitude'; and closely bound up with these,
  the love of romantic scenery, which it described for the first time
  in glowing language.</p>

  <p>Such expressions as these of St Preux were unheard of at that
  time: 'I shall do my best to be free quickly, and able to wander at
  my ease in the wild places that to my mind make the charm of this
  country.' 'I am of opinion that this unfrequented country deserves
  the attention of speculative curiosity, and that it wants nothing to
  excite admiration but a skilful spectator'; and 'Nature seems
  desirous of hiding her real charms from the sight of men, because
  they are too little sensible of them, and disfigure them when within
  their reach; she flies from public places; it is on the tops of
  mountains, in the midst of forests, on desert islands, that she
  displays her most affecting charms.'</p>

  <p>Rousseau certainly announced his views with all the fervour of a
  prophet proclaiming a newly-discovered truth. The sketch St Preux
  gives of the country that 'deserved a year's study,' in the
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg276" id=
  "pg276">276</a></span>twenty-third letter to Julia, is very poetic.
  He is ascending a rocky path when a new view breaks upon him:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>One moment I beheld stupendous rocks hanging ruinous over my
    head; the next, I was enveloped in a drizzling cloud, which arose
    from a vast cascade that, dashing, thundered against the rocks
    below my feet. On one side a perpetual torrent opened to my view a
    yawning abyss, which my eyes could hardly fathom with safety;
    sometimes I was lost in the obscurity of a hanging wood, and then
    was greatly astonished with the sudden opening of a flowery
    plain.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He was always charmed by 'a surprising mixture of wild and
  cultivated Nature':</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Here Nature seems to have a singular pleasure in acting
    contradictory to herself, so different does she appear in the same
    place in different aspects. Towards the east, the flowers of
    spring; to the south, the flowers of autumn; and northwards, the
    ice of winter. Add to that the illusions of vision, the tops of the
    mountains variously illumined, the harmonious mixture of light and
    shade....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After climbing, he reflects:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Upon the top of mountains, the air being subtle and pure, we
    respire with greater freedom, our bodies are more active, our minds
    more serene, our pleasures less ardent, and our passions much more
    moderate. Our meditations acquire a degree of sublimity from the
    grandeur of the objects around us. It seems as if, being lifted
    above all human society, we had left every low terrestrial
    sentiment behind.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He can find no words to express 'the amazing variety, magnitude,
  and beauty of a thousand stupendous objects, the pleasure of gazing
  at an entire new scene ... and beholding, as it were, another Nature
  and a new world.'</p>

  <p>Earlier in the year he wrote his letters to Julia upon a block of
  stone in his favourite wild spot, and the wintry landscape harmonized
  with his feelings:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I run to and fro, climb the rocks and explore my whole district,
    and find everything as horrible without <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg277" id="pg277">277</a></span>as I experienced
    it within. There is no longer any verdure to be seen, the grass is
    yellow and withered, the trees are stripped of their foliage, and
    the north-east blast heaps snow and ice around me. In short, the
    whole face of Nature appears as decayed to my outward senses as I
    myself from within am dead to hope and joy.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Julia, too, is enthusiastic about places, where 'no vestiges are
  seen of human toil, no appearance of studied and laborious art; every
  object presents only a view of the tender care of Nature, our common
  mother.'</p>

  <p>When St Preux knows that she returns his love, his sympathy for
  Nature overflows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I find the country more delightful, the verdure fresher and
    livelier, the air more temperate, and the sky more serene than ever
    I did before; even the feathered songsters seem to tune their
    tender throats with more harmony and pleasure; the murmuring rills
    invite to love-inspiring dalliance, while the blossoms of the vine
    regale me from afar with the choicest perfumes ... let us animate
    all Nature, which is absolutely dead without the genial warmth of
    love.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>St Preux escorts his old love to the Meillerie, and it was with
  his description of this that Rousseau unrolled the full charm of
  mountain scenery, and opened the eyes of his readers to see it.</p>

  <p>They were climbing a mountain top on the Savoy side of the
  lake:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This solitary spot formed a wild and desert nook, but full of
    those sorts of beauties which are only agreeable to susceptible
    minds, and appear horrible to others. A torrent, occasioned by the
    melting of the snow, rolled in a muddy stream within twenty paces
    of us, and carried dust, sand, and stones along with it, not
    without considerable noise. Behind us, a chain of inaccessible
    rocks divided the place where we stood from that part of the Alps
    which they call the Ice house.... Forests of gloomy fir trees
    afforded us a melancholy shade on the right, while on the left was
    a large wood of oak, beyond which the torrent issued; and beneath,
    that vast body of water which the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
    "pg278" id="pg278">278</a></span>lake forms in the bay of the Alps,
    parted us from the rich coast of the Pays de Vaud, crowning the
    whole landscape with the top of the majestic Jura.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Rousseau's influence upon feeling in general, and feeling for
  Nature in particular, was an extraordinary one, widening and
  deepening at once.</p>

  <p>By his strong personal impulse he impelled it into more natural
  paths, and at the same time he discovered the power of the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>He brought to flower the germ which had lain dormant in Hellenism
  and the Renaissance; and although his readers imbibed a sickly strain
  of morbid sentimentality with this passion for the new region of
  feeling, the total effect of his individuality and his idealism was
  to intensify their love for Nature. His feelings woke the liveliest
  echo, and it was not France alone who profited by the lessons he
  taught.</p>

  <p>He was no mountaineer himself, but he pointed out the way, and
  others soon followed it. Saussure began his climbing in 1760,
  exploring the Alps with the indomitable spirit of the discoverer and
  the scientist's craving for truth. He ascended Mont Blanc in 1787,
  and only too soon the valleys of Chamounix filled with tourists and
  speculators. One of the first results of Rousseau's imposing
  descriptions of scenery was to rouse the most ardent of French
  romance writers, Bernardin de St Pierre; and his writings, especially
  his beautiful pictures of the Ile de France, followed hard in the
  wake of <i>La Nouvelle Héloise</i>.</p>

  <p>In <i>Paul and Virginia</i> vivid descriptions of Nature were
  interwoven with an idyllic Robinson Crusoe romance:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Within this enclosure reigns the most profound silence. The
    waters, the air, all the elements are at peace. Scarcely does the
    echo repeat the whispers of the palm trees spreading their broad
    leaves, the long points of which are gently agitated by the winds.
    A soft light illumines the bottom of this deep valley, <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg279" id="pg279">279</a></span>on which the sun
    shines only at noon. But even at break of day the rays of light are
    thrown on the surrounding rocks, and their sharp peaks, rising
    above the shadows of the mountain, appear like tints of gold and
    purple gleaming upon the azure sky.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Like Rousseau, St Pierre held that 'to take refuge in the wildest
  and most desert places is an instinct common to all feeling and
  suffering beings, as if rocks were ramparts against misfortune, and
  Nature's calm could appease the sorrows of the soul'<a href=
  "#l14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>; but he differed in caring for Nature far
  more for her own sake, and not in opposition to culture and a
  detested world. He wrote too, not as a philosopher proclaiming a new
  gospel, but as a poet<a href="#l15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>; the poetry
  of Nature had been revealed to French literature.</p>

  <p>St Pierre drew the beauty of the tropics in a poem, and George
  Forster's <i>Voyage round the World</i><a href=
  "#l16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> shewed how quickly Rousseau's influence
  told upon travels. It was a far cry from the Crusaders and
  discoverers to the highly-cultured Forster, alive to everything that
  was good and beautiful, and able to express it. He was the first to
  describe countries and peoples from both the scientific and artistic
  standpoint--a style of writing which Humboldt perfected, and some
  later writers, Haeckel, for example, in <i>Indischen Briefen</i>,
  have carried on with success.</p>

  <p>To quote Forster:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The town of Santa Cruz in Madeira was abreast of us at six in
    the afternoon. The mountains are here intersected by numerous deep
    glens and valleys. On the sloping ground we observed several
    country houses pleasantly situated amidst surrounding vineyards and
    lofty cypresses, which gave the country altogether a romantic
    appearance. Early on the 29th we were agreeably surprised with the
    picturesque appearance of the city of Funchal....</p>

  <p>In October 1772, off South Africa:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The night was scarcely begun when the water all round us
    afforded the most grand and astonishing sight <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg280" id="pg280">280</a></span>that can be
    imagined. As far as we could see, the whole ocean seemed to be in a
    blaze. Every breaking wave had its summit illuminated by a light
    similar to that of phosphorus, and the sides of the vessel, coming
    in contact with the sea, were strongly marked by a luminous
    line.... There was a singularity and a grandeur in the display of
    this phenomenon which could not fail of giving occupation to the
    mind, and striking it with a reverential awe, due to
    omnipotence.</p>

    <p>The ocean was covered to a great extent with myriads of
    animalcules; these little beings, organized, alive, endowed with
    locomotive power, a quality of shining whenever they please, of
    illuminating every body with which they come in contact ... all
    these ideas crowded upon us, and bade us admire the Creator, even
    in His minutest works.... I hope I shall not have formed too
    favourable an opinion of my readers, if I expect that the
    generality will sympathize with me in these feelings.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Dusky Bay:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We glided along by insensible degrees, wafted by light airs past
    numerous rocky islands, each of which was covered with wood and
    shrubberies, where numerous evergreens were sweetly contrasted and
    mingled with the various shades of autumnal yellow. Flocks of
    aquatic birds enlivened the rocky shores, and the whole country
    resounded with the wild notes of the feathered tribe.... The view
    of rude sceneries in the style of Rosa, of antediluvian forests
    which clothed the rock, and of numerous rills of water which
    everywhere rolled down the steep declivity, altogether conspired to
    complete our joy.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Cascade Cove in New Zealand:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This waterfall at a distance of a mile and a half seems to be
    but inconsiderable on account of its great elevation; but, after
    climbing about 200 yards upwards, we ... found a view of great
    beauty and grandeur before us. The first object which strikes the
    beholder is a clear column of water eight or ten yards in
    circumference, which is projected with great impetuosity from the
    perpendicular rock at the height of 100 yards. Nearly at the fourth
    part of the whole height this column meeting a part of the same
    rock, which now acquires a little inclination, spreads on its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg281" id=
    "pg281">281</a></span>broad back into a limpid sheet of about
    twenty-five yards in width. Here its surface is curled, and dashes
    upon every little eminence in its rapid descent, till it is all
    collected in a fine basin about sixty yards in circuit, included on
    three sides by the natural walls of the rocky chasm, and in front
    by huge masses of stone irregularly piled above each other. Between
    them the stream finds its way, and runs foaming with the greatest
    rapidity along the slope of the hill to the sea. The whole
    neighbourhood of the cascade ... is filled with a steam or watery
    vapour.... We ... were struck with the sight of a most beautiful
    rainbow of a perfectly circular form, produced by the meridian rays
    of the sun refracted in the vapour of the cascade.</p>

    <p>The scenery on the left consists of steep brown rocks fringed on
    the summits with overhanging shrubs and trees; the enchanting
    melody of various birds resounded on all sides, and completed the
    beauty of this wild and romantic spot.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He described: 'A waterspout, a phenomenon which carried so much
  terrific majesty in it, and connected, as it were, the sea with the
  clouds, made our oldest mariners uneasy and at a loss how to
  behave.'</p>

  <p>He begins his diary of August 1773 with O'Taheite:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was one of those beautiful mornings which the poets of all
    nations have attempted to describe, when we saw the isle of
    O'Taheite within two miles before us. The east wind, which had
    carried us so far, was entirely vanished, and a faint breeze only
    wafted a delicious perfume from the land, and curled the surface of
    the sea. The mountains, clothed with forests, rose majestic in
    various spiry forms, on which we already perceived the light of the
    rising sun ... everything seemed as yet asleep; the morning scarce
    dawned, and a peaceful shade still rested on the landscape....</p>

    <p>This spot was one of the most beautiful I had ever seen, and
    could not fail of bringing to remembrance the most fanciful
    descriptions of poets, which it eclipsed in beauty; we had a
    prospect of the plain below us, and of the sea beyond it. In the
    shade of trees, whose branches hung over the water, we enjoyed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg282" id="pg282">282</a></span>a
    pleasant gale, which softened the heat of the day; and, amidst the
    solemn uniform noise of the waterfall, which was but seldom
    interrupted by the whistling of birds, we sat down....</p>

    <p>We could have been well pleased to have passed the whole day in
    this retirement ... however, feasting our eyes once more with the
    romantic scenery, we returned to the plain.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It was such descriptions as these which stimulated Humboldt. There
  is a breath of poetry in his writings; his <i>Views of Nature</i> and
  <i>Cosmos</i> give ample proof that love of Nature and knowledge of
  Nature can condition and deepen each other.</p>

  <p>It is not surprising that in the flood of scientific 'Travels'
  which followed, especially in imitation of Forster, there were some
  that laid claim to a wonderful grade of feeling. For example, the
  description of a day at the Equator by von Spix and v. Martius in
  their Travels in Brazil in 1817 to 1820:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In these seas the sun rises from the ocean with great splendour,
    and gilds the clouds accumulated in the horizon, which in grand and
    various groups seem to present to the eye of the spectator
    continents with high mountains and valleys, with volcanoes and
    seas, mythological and other strange creations of fancy.</p>

    <p>The lamp of day gradually rises in the transparent blue sky; the
    damp grey fogs subside; the sea is calm or gently rises and falls,
    with a surface smooth as a mirror, in a regular motion. At noon a
    pale, faintly shining cloud rises, the herald of a sudden tempest,
    which at once disturbs the tranquillity of the sea. Thunder and
    lightning seem as if they would split our planet; but a heavy rain
    of a salt taste, pouring down in the midst of roaring whirlwinds,
    puts an end to the raging of the elements, and several
    semi-circular rainbows, extended over the ocean like gay triumphal
    arches, announce the peaceful termination of the great natural
    phenomenon. As soon as the air and sea have recovered their
    equilibrium, the sky again shews its transparent azure.... As the
    sun gradually sinks in the clouded horizon, the sea and sky assume
    a new dress, which is beyond description sublime and magnificent.
    The most brilliant red, yellow, violet, in <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg283" id="pg283">283</a></span>infinite shades
    and contrasts, are poured out in profusion over the azure of the
    firmament, and are reflected in still gayer variety from the
    surface of the water. The day departs amid continued lightning on
    the dusky horizon, while the moon in silent majesty rises from the
    unbounded ocean into the cloudless upper regions. Variable winds
    cool the atmosphere; numerous falling stars, coming particularly
    from the south, shed a magic light; the dark-blue firmament,
    reflected with the constellations on the untroubled bosom of the
    water, represents the image of the wholly starry hemisphere; and
    the ocean, agitated even by the faintest breeze of the night, is
    changed into a sea of waving fire.... The variety of the light and
    foliage of the trees, which is seen in the forests, on the slopes
    of the mountains: the blending of the most diverse colours, and the
    dark azure and transparency of the sky, impart to the landscapes of
    the tropical countries a charm to which even the pencil of a
    Salvator Rosa and a Claude cannot do justice....</p>

    <p>Except at noon, when all living creatures in the torrid zone
    seek shade and repose, and when a solemn silence is diffused over
    the scene, illumined by the dazzling beams of the sun, every hour
    of the day calls into action another race of animals.... When the
    sun goes down, most of the animals retire to rest ... myriads of
    luminous beetles now begin to fly about like <i>ignes fatui</i>,
    and the blood-sucking bats hover like phantoms in the profound
    darkness of the night.... The traveller does not here meet with the
    impressions of those sublime and rugged high Alps of Europe, nor,
    on the other hand, those of a meaner nature; but the character of
    these landscapes combines grandeur with simplicity and
    softness....</p>

    <p>He who has not personally experienced the enchantment of
    tranquil moonlight nights in these happy latitudes can never be
    inspired, even by the most faithful description, with those
    feelings which scenes of such wondrous beauty excite in the mind of
    the beholder.</p>

    <p>A delicate transparent mist hangs over the country, the moon
    shines brightly amid heavy and singularly grouped clouds, the
    outlines of the objects illuminated by it are clear and well
    defined, while a magic twilight seems to remove from the eye those
    which are in shade. Scarce a breath of air is stirring, and the
    neighbouring mimosas, that have folded up their leaves to sleep,
    stand motionless beside the dark crowns of <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg284" id="pg284">284</a></span>the manga, the
    jaca, and the ethereal jambos; or sometimes a sudden wind arises
    and the juiceless leaves of the acaju rustle, the richly flowered
    grumijama and pitanga let drop a fragrant shower of snow-white
    blossoms; the crowns of the majestic palms wave slowly over the
    silent roof which they overshade, like a symbol of peace and
    tranquillity.</p>

    <p>Shrill cries of the cicada, the grasshopper, and tree frog make
    an incessant hum, and produce by their monotony a pleasing
    melancholy.... Every half-hour different balsamic odours fill the
    air, and other flowers alternately unfold their leaves to the
    night.... While the silent vegetable world, illuminated by scores
    of fireflies as by a thousand moving stars, charms the night by its
    delicate effluvia, brilliant lightnings play incessantly on the
    horizon, and elevate the mind in joyful admiration to the stars,
    which, glowing in solemn silence in the firmament above the
    continent and ocean, fill the soul with a presentiment of still
    sublimer wonders.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Travels by sea were described at much greater length and with much
  more effusion than travels by land; one might infer from the silence
  of the people who moved about in Europe in the eighteenth century,
  that no love of Nature existed. The extreme discomfort of the road up
  to a hundred years ago may account for this silence within
  Germany.</p>

  <p>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu wrote in 1716 of Saxon Switzerland:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We passed by moonshine the frightful precipices that divide
    Bohemia from Saxony, at the bottom of which runs the river Elbe ...
    in many places the road is so narrow that I could not discern an
    inch of space between the wheels and the precipice....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and her husband declared that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>he had passed the Alps five times in different places, without
    having gone a road so dangerous.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Scherr relates that in the late autumn of 1721 a citizen of
  Schwabisch-Gmünd travelled to Ellwangen, a distance of eight hours'
  posting.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg285" id="pg285">285</a></span>
  Before starting, he had a mass performed in St John's Church 'for the
  safe conclusion of the coming journey.' He set off one Monday with
  his wife and a maid in a two-horse vehicle called a small tilt waggon
  (<i>Planwägelchen</i>), but in less than an hour the wheels stuck in
  mud, and the whole party had to get out and push the carriage, up to
  their knees in filth. In the middle of the village of Boebingen the
  driver inadvertently drove the front left wheel into a manure hole,
  the carriage was overturned, and the lady of the party had her nose
  and cheek badly grazed by the iron hoops.</p>

  <p>From Moeggelingen to Aalen they were obliged to use three horses,
  and yet it took fully six hours, so that they were obliged to spend
  the night there. Next morning they set off early, and reached the
  village of Hofen by mid-day without accidents. Here for a time the
  travelling ceased, for a hundred paces beyond the village the
  carriage fell into a puddle, and they were all terribly soiled; the
  maid's right shoulder was dislocated, and the manservant's hand
  injured. The axle of one of the wheels was broken, and a horse
  completely lamed in the left forefoot. They had to put up a second
  time for the night, leave horses, carriage, man, and maid in Hofen,
  and hire a rack waggon, in which at last, pitifully shaken, they
  reached the gates of Ellwangen on Wednesday at vesper bells.</p>

  <p>When Eva König, Lessing's <i>fiancée</i>, was on her way from
  Brunswick to Nuremberg in 1772, she wrote to him from Rattelsdorf
  (two miles north of Bamberg), on February 28th, as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You will certainly never in your life have heard of a village
    called Rattelsdorf? We have been in it already twenty-four hours,
    and who knows if we shall not have to stay four times as long! It
    depends on the Maine, whether it falls or not; as it is now, one
    could not cross it, even if one dared to. I have never in my life
    met with so many hindrances, so many dangers and hardships, as on
    this journey. I can <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg286" id=
    "pg286">286</a></span>hardly think of any misfortunes which we have
    not already had.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>She goes on to describe that in thirty-eight hours two axles and
  two poles had been broken, the horses had bolted with them, one horse
  had fallen and died, and so on; on March 2nd they were still
  prisoners in the wretched village.</p>

  <p>In 1750 a day's journey was still reckoned at five miles, two
  hours to the mile; and when in July 1750 Klopstock travelled with
  Gleim from Halberstadt to Magdeburg in a light carriage drawn by four
  horses, at the rate of six miles in six hours, he thought this speed
  remarkable enough to merit comparison with the racing in the Olympian
  games. People of any pretensions shunned the discomforts of
  travelling on foot--the bad roads, the insecurity, the dirty inns,
  and the rough treatment in them; to walk abroad in good clothes and
  admire the scenery was an unknown thing. (G. Freytag.)</p>

  <p>It was only after the widening of thoroughfares, the invention of
  steamboats (the first was on the Weser 1827) and railways (1835),
  that travelling became commoner and more popular, and feeling for
  Nature was thereby increased.</p>

  <p>After the Swiss Alps had been discovered for them, people began to
  feel interest in their native mountains; Zimmermann led the way with
  his observations on a journey in the Harz 1775, and Gatterer in 1785
  published <i>A Guide to Travelling in the Harz</i> in five
  volumes.</p>

  <p>In 1806 appeared Nicolas's <i>Guide to Switzerland</i>, in 1777
  J.T. Volkmar's <i>Journey to the Riesengebirge</i>, and before long
  each little country and province, be it Weimar, Mecklenburg, or the
  Mark, had discovered a Switzerland within its own boundaries, with
  mountains as much like the Swiss Alps as a charming little girl is
  like a giant.</p>

  <p>It was the opening of men's eyes to the charms of romantic scenery
  at home.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg287" id="pg287">287</a></span>
  The Isle of Rügen too, Swedish at that time, with its striking
  contrasts of deep blue bays and inlets, chalk rocks and beech woods,
  came into fashion with lovers of Nature, especially after the road
  from Sagard to Stubbenkamer had been improved<a href=
  "#l17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>--so much so, in fact, that in 1805 Grümbke
  was complaining that many people only went there to feast, not to
  enjoy the scene:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You know I am no foe to pleasure, and appreciate my food and
    drink after physical exertion as much as any one; but it is
    desecration to make that the main object here. In this dreadfully
    beautiful wilderness, under these green corridors of beeches, on
    the battlements of this great dazzling temple, before this huge
    azure mirror of the sea, only high and serious thoughts should find
    a place--the whole scene, stamped as it is with majesty and
    mystery, seems designed to attract the mind to the hidden life of
    the unending world around it. For this, solitude and rest are
    necessary conditions, hence one must visit Stubbenkamer either
    alone or with intimate and congenial friends.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <h3>THE UNIVERSAL PANTHEISTIC FEELING OF MODERN TIMES</h3>

  <p>The eighteenth century, so proudly distinguished as the century of
  Frederic the Great and Maria Theresa, Kant and Lessing, Rousseau and
  Voltaire, the age of enlightenment, and, above all, of the
  Revolution, was the most sentimental period in history. Its feeling
  for Nature bore the same stamp. Many of the Anacreontists and
  Göttingen poets, as well as Klopstock, shewed genuine enthusiasm; but
  their horizon was narrow, and though F. Stolberg sang of the sea and
  his native mountains, most of them only rang the changes on moonlight
  and starlight, pastoral idylls, the joys of spring, and winter
  excursions on the ice. Even Rousseau, the prophet of high mountains,
  was the child of the same sentimental, self-adoring time; a morbid
  strain, call it misanthropy, melancholy, what you will, underlay all
  his passion for Nature. It was Goethe who dissolved the spell which
  lay over the world, and, although born into the days of beautiful
  souls, moonshine poets, seraphic heaven stormers, pastoral poems, and
  <i>La Nouvelle Héloise</i>, ennobled and purified the tone of the day
  and freed it from convention!</p>

  <p>It was by dint of his genius for expression, the gift of finding
  the one right word, that he became the world's greatest lyrist: what
  he felt became a poem, what he saw a picture.</p>

  <p>To see and to fashion into poetry were one with <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg289" id="pg289">289</a></span>him, whereas his
  predecessors had called out the whole artillery of Olympus--nymphs,
  Oreads, Chloe, Phyllis, Damon, Aurora, Echo, and Zephyr--even the
  still heavier ordnance of the old Teutonic gods and half-gods, only
  to repeat stereotyped ideas, and produce descriptions of scenery,
  without lyric thought and feeling.</p>

  <p>But Goethe's genius passed through very evident stages of
  development, and found forerunners in Lessing and Herder.</p>

  <p>Lessing's mind was didactic and critical, not lyric, so that his
  importance here is a negative one. In laying down the limits of
  poetry and painting in <i>Laocoon</i>, he attacked the error of his
  day which used poetry for pictures, debasing it to mere descriptions
  of seasons, places, plants, etc.</p>

  <p>He was dealing with fundamental principles when he said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Simonides called painting dumb poetry, and poetry speaking
    painting; but ... many modern critics have drawn the crudest
    conclusions possible from this agreement between painting and
    poetry. At one time they confine poetry within the narrow limits of
    painting, and at another allow painting to fill the whole wide
    sphere of poetry.... This fault-finding criticism has partially
    misled the virtuosos themselves. In poetry a fondness for
    description, and in painting a fancy for allegory, has arisen from
    the desire to make the one a speaking picture without really
    knowing what it can and ought to paint, and the other a dumb poem
    without having considered in how far painting can express universal
    ideas without abandoning its proper sphere and degenerating into an
    arbitrary method of writing.... Since the artist can use but a
    single moment of ever-changing Nature, and the painter must further
    confine his study of this one moment to a single point of view,
    while their works are made not simply to be looked at, but to be
    contemplated long and often, evidently the most fruitful moment and
    the most fruitful aspect must be chosen. Now that only is fruitful
    which allows free play to the imagination. The more we see, the
    more we must be able to imagine; and the more we imagine, the more
    we must think we see.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg290" id="pg290">290</a></span>
  And against descriptive poetry he said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When a poetaster, says Horace, can do nothing else, he falls to
    describing a grove, an altar, a brook winding through pleasant
    meadows, a rushing river, or a rainbow. Pope expressly enjoined
    upon every one who would not prove himself unworthy the name of
    poet, to abandon as early as possible this fondness for
    description. A merely descriptive poem he declared to be a feast
    made up of sauces.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Acute as his distinction was between poetry as the representative
  art of actions in time, and painting as the representative art of
  bodies in space, he did not give due value to lyric feeling or
  landscape painting.<a href="#m1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> They belong to a
  region in which his sharp, critical acumen was not at home.</p>

  <p>But his discussions established the position that external objects
  of any sort, including Nature in all her various shapes, are not
  proper subjects for poetry when taken as Thomson, Brockes, and Haller
  took them, by themselves alone, but must first be imbued with human
  feeling. And the same holds good of landscape painting. Goethe's
  lyrics are the most perfect examples of this blending of the outer
  and inner world.</p>

  <p>Lessing's criticisms had a salutary, emancipating effect upon
  prevalent taste; but a more positive influence came into play through
  Herder's warm predilection for the popular songs, which had been so
  long neglected, and for all that rises, as in the Psalms, Homer,
  Shakespeare, Ossian, from primitive sources of feeling, and finds
  spontaneous expression in poetry. The effect of his pioneering was
  marked, especially upon Goethe. Herder understood the revulsion of
  feeling from the unnatural restraint of the Pigtail period, and while
  holding up the mirror to his own day, he at the same time led its
  taste and the expression of it towards what was simple and natural,
  by disclosing the treasures which lay hidden in the poetry of the
  people. The lyric was freed from the artificiality and convention
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg291" id="pg291">291</a></span>which
  had so long ruled it, and although he did not carry out his plan of a
  history of poetry, his collections and his profound remarks upon them
  were of great service, sowing a seed that bore fruit in succeeding
  days.</p>

  <p>The popular songs to him were children of the same mother as the
  plants and flowers. 'All the songs of such unlettered folk,'<a href=
  "#m2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> he said, 'weave a living world around
  existing objects, actions, and events. How rich and manifold they all
  become! And the eye can actually see them, the mind realize them;
  they are set in motion. The different parts of the song are no more
  connected together than the trees and bushes in a wood, the rocks in
  a desert, or the scenes depicted.' In another place<a href=
  "#m3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> he put the history of feeling for Nature
  very tersely: 'There is no doubt that the spirit of man is made
  gentler by studying Nature. What did the classics aim at in their
  Georgics, but under various shapes to make man more humane and raise
  him gradually to order, industry, and prosperity, and to the power to
  observe Nature?...' Hence, when poetry revived in the Middle Ages,
  she soon recollected the true land of her birth among the plants and
  flowers. The Provencal and the romantic poets loved the same
  descriptions. Spenser, for instance, has charming stanzas about
  beautiful wilds with their streams and flowers; Cowley's six books on
  plants, vegetables, and trees are written with extraordinary
  affection and a superfluity of imagination; and of our old Brockes,
  Gessner says: 'He observed Nature's many beauties down to their
  finest minutiæ, the smallest things move his tender feelings; a
  dewdrop on a blade of grass in the sunshine inspires him. His scenes
  are often too laboured, too wide in scope, but still his poems are a
  storehouse of pictures direct from Nature. Haller's <i>Alps</i>,
  Kleist's poems and Gessner's, Thomson's <i>Seasons</i>, speak for
  themselves.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg292" id="pg292">292</a></span> He
  delighted in Shaftesbury's praises of Nature as the good and
  beautiful in the <i>Moralists</i>, and translated it<a href=
  "#m4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; in fact, in Herder we have already an
  æsthetic cult of the beauties of Nature.</p>

  <p>After the moral disquisitions of Pope, Addison, Shaftesbury, etc.,
  Nature's influence on man, moral and æsthetic, became, as we have
  already seen, a favourite theme in Germany too, both in pious and
  rationalistic circles<a href="#m5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>; but there are
  few traces of any æsthetic analysis.</p>

  <p>The most important one was Kant's, in his <i>Observations on the
  Beautiful and Sublime</i> in 1764. He distinguished, in the finer
  feeling for Nature, a feeling for the sublime and a feeling for the
  beautiful.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Both touch us pleasantly, but in different ways. The sight of a
    mountain with a snowy peak reaching above the clouds, the account
    of a storm ... these excite pleasure, but mixed with awe; while
    flowery meadows, valleys with winding streams and covered by
    browsing herds, a description of Elysium ... also cause pleasant
    feelings, but of a gay and radiant kind. To appreciate the first
    sensations adequately, we must have a feeling for the sublime; to
    appreciate the second, a feeling for the beautiful.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He mentioned tall oaks, lonely shades in consecrated groves, and
  night-time, as sublime; day, beds of flowers, low hedges, and trees
  cut into shapes, as beautiful.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Minds which possess the feeling for the sublime are inclined to
    lofty thoughts of friendship, scorn of the world, eternity, by the
    quiet stillness of a summer evening, when the twinkling starlight
    breaks the darkness. The light of day impels to activity and
    cheerfulness. The sublime soothes, the beautiful stimulates.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He goes on to subdivide the sublime:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This feeling is sometimes accompanied by horror or by dejection,
    sometimes merely by quiet admiration, at other times by a sense of
    wide-spread beauty. I will call the first the terrible, the second
    the noble, the third the splendid sublime.</p>

    Profound solitude is sublime, but in a terrible way. This is why
    great deserts, like the Desert of Gamo in Tartary, have always been
    the supposed abode of fearful shades, hobgoblins, and ghostly
    spectres. The sublime is always great and simple; the beautiful may
    be small, elaborate, and ornamental.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He tried, too, to define the romantic in Nature, though very
  vaguely:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The dreadful variety of the sublime, when quite unnatural, is
    adventurous. When sublimity or beauty is excessive, it is called
    romantic.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In his <i>Kalligone</i>, which appeared in 1800, Herder quoted
  Kant in making one of the characters say, 'One calls day beautiful,
  night sublime,' and tried to carry the idea a step further; 'The
  sublime and beautiful are not opposed to each other, but stem and
  boughs of a tree whose top is the most sublimely beautiful of all,'
  that is the romantic. In the same book he attempted to analyze his
  impressions of Nature, calling a rugged place odious, an
  insignificant one without character tedious. 'In the presence of
  great mountains,' he says, 'the spirit is filled with bold
  aspirations, whereas in gentle valleys it lies quiet.' Harmony in
  variety was his ideal, like the sea in storm and calm. 'An ocean of
  beautiful forms in rest and movement.'</p>

  <p>And in reference to the contrast between a place made 'dreadful
  and horrible' by a torrent dashing over rocks and a quiet and
  charming valley, he said: 'These changes follow unalterable laws,
  which are recognized by our minds, and in harmony with our feelings.'
  He saw the same order in variety among plants, from the highest to
  the lowest, from palm tree to moss. In the second part of the book he
  gave an enthusiastic description of the sublime in sky and sea.</p>

  <p>His beautiful words on the inspiration of Nature shew his insight
  into her relation to the poet soul of the people:<span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg294" id="pg294">294</a></span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Everything in Nature must be inspired by life, or it does not
    move me, I do not feel it. The cooling zephyr and the morning
    sunbeam, the wind blowing through the trees, and the fragrant
    carpet of flowers, must cool, warm, pervade us--then we feel
    Nature. The poet does not say he feels her, unless he feels her
    intensely, living, palpitating and pervading him, like the wild
    Nature of Ossian, or the soft luxuriant Nature of Theocritus and
    the Orientals. In Nature, the more varieties the better; for
    instance, in a beautiful country I rustle with the wind and become
    alive (and give life--inspire), I inhale fragrance and exhale it
    with the flowers; I dissolve in water; I float in the blue sky; I
    feel all these feelings.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Herder touched the lyre himself with a skilful hand. Thought
  predominated with him, but he could make Nature live in his
  song.<a href="#m7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> 'I greet thee, thou wing of
  heaven,' he sang to the lark; and to the rainbow, 'Beautiful child of
  the sun, picture and hope over dark clouds ... hopes are colours, are
  broken sun-rays and the children of tears, truth is the sun.'</p>

  <p>In <i>By the Sea at Naples</i> he wrote:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>A-weary of the summer's fiery brand,</p>

    <p>I sat me down beside the cooling sea,</p>

    <p>Where the waves heaving, rolled and kissed the strand</p>

    <p>Of the grey shore, ...</p>

    <p>And over me, high over in the air,</p>

    <p>Of the blue skyey vault, rustled the tree ...</p>

    <p>Queen of all trees, slender and beautiful,</p>

    <p>The pine tree, lifting me to golden dreams.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Recollections of Naples</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Yes! they are gone, those happy, happy hours</p>

    <p>Joyous but short, by Posilippo's bay!</p>

    <p>Sweet dream of sea and lake, of rock and hill,</p>

    <p>Grotto and island, and the mirrored sun</p>

    <p>In the blue water--thou hast passed away!</p>
  </div>

  <p>and</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>When the glow of evening softly fades</p>

    <p>From the still sea, and with her gleaming host</p>

    <p>The moon ascends the sky.</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg295" id="pg295">295</a></span>

  <p><i>Night</i> is very poetic:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i6">And comest thou again,</p>

    <p>Thou Mother of the stars and heavenly thoughts?</p>

    <p>Divine and quiet Mother, comest thou?</p>

    <p>The earth awaits thee, from thy chalice cup</p>

    <p>But one drop of thy heavenly dew to quaff,</p>

    <p>Her flowers bend low their heads;</p>

    <p>And with them, satiate with vision, droops</p>

    <p>My overcharged soul....</p>

    <p>O starry goddess with the crown of gold,</p>

    <p>Upon whose wide-spread sable mantle gleam</p>

    <p>A thousand worlds ...</p>

    <p>Silence divine, that filleth all the world,</p>

    <p>Flowing so softly to the eternal shores</p>

    <p>Of an eternal universe....</p>
  </div>

  <p>And in <i>St John's Night</i>, he exclaims:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Infinite, ah! inexhaustible art thou, Mother Nature!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Like the rest, Herder suffered from the over-sensitiveness of his
  day. His correspondence with his <i>fiancée</i> shews this<a href=
  "#m8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>; one sees Rousseau's influence:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>My pleasantest hours are when, quite alone, I walk in a charming
    wood close to Bückeburg, or lie upon a wall in the shade of my
    garden, or lastly, for we have had capital moonlight for three
    nights, and the last was the best of all, when I enjoy these hours
    of sweetly sleeping night with all the songs of the
    nightingale.</p>

    <p>I reckon no hours more delightful than those of green solitude.
    I live so romantically alone, and among woods and churches, as only
    poets, lovers, and philosophers can live.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And his <i>fiancée</i> wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>'Tis all joy within and around me since I have known thee, my
    best beloved: every plant and flower, everything in Nature, seems
    beautiful to me.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I went early to my little room; the moon was quite covered by
    clouds, and the night so melancholy from the croaking of the frogs,
    that I could not leave the window for a long time: my whole soul
    was dark and cloudy; I thought of thee, my dear one, and that
    thought, that sigh, reduced me to tears.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg296" id="pg296">296</a></span>
  and</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Do you like the ears of wheat so much? I never pass a cornfield
    without stroking them.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Goethe focussed all the rays of feeling for Nature which had found
  lyrical expression before him, and purged taste, beginning with his
  own, of its unnatural and sickly elements. So he became the
  liberating genius of modern culture. Not only did German lyric poetry
  reach its climax in him; but he was the most accurate, individual,
  and universal interpreter of German feeling for Nature.</p>

  <p>His wide original mind kept open house for the most diverse
  elements of feeling, and exercised an ennobling control upon each and
  all at will; Homer's naivete, Shakespeare's sympathy, Rousseau's
  enthusiasm, even Ossian's melancholy, found room there.</p>

  <p>While most love lyrics of his day were false in feeling, mere
  raving extravagances, and therefore poor in those metaphors and
  comparisons which prove sympathy between Nature and the inner life,
  it could be said of him that 'Nature wished to know what she looked
  like, and so she created Goethe.' He was the microcosm in which the
  macrocosm of modern times was reflected.</p>

  <p>He was more modern and universal than any of his predecessors, and
  his insight into Nature and love for her have been rarely equalled in
  later days. He did not live, like so many of the elegiac and idyllic
  poets of the eighteenth century, a mere dream-life of the
  imagination: Goethe stood firmly rooted among the actualities; from
  boyhood up, as he said in <i>Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>, he had 'a
  warm feeling for all objective things.'</p>

  <p>No poet, Klopstock not excepted, was richer in verbal invention,
  and many of the phrases and epithets which he coined form in
  themselves very striking evidence (which is lost in translation) of
  his close and original observation of Nature.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg297" id="pg297">297</a></span> He
  has many beautiful comparisons to Nature:</p>

  <p>His lady-love is 'brightly beautiful as morning clouds on yonder
  height.'</p>

  <p>'I was wont to look at thee as one looks at the stars and moon,
  delighting in thee without the most distant wish in my quiet breast
  to possess thee.'</p>

  <p>'I give kisses as the spring gives flowers.'</p>

  <p>'My feeling for thee was like seed, which germinates slowly in
  winter, but ripens quickly in summer.'</p>

  <p>The stars move 'with flower feet.'</p>

  <p>The graces are 'pure as the heart of the waters, as the marrow of
  earth.'</p>

  <p>A delicate poem is a rainbow only existing against a dark
  ground.</p>

  <p>In <i>Stella</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Thou dost not feel what heavenly dew to the thirsty it is, to
    return to thy breast from the sandy desert world.</p>

    <p>I felt free in soul, free as a spring morning.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In <i>Faust</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The cataract bursting through the rocks is the image of human
    effort; its coloured reflection the image of life.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When Werther feels himself trembling between existence and
  non-existence, everything around him sinking away, and the world
  perishing with him:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The past flashes like lightning over the dark abyss of the
    future.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>These are among his still more numerous metaphors:</p>

  <p>A sea of folly, an ocean of fragrance, the waves of battle, the
  stream of genius, the tiger claw of despair, the sun-ray of the past.
  Iphigenia says to Orestes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>O let the pure breath of love blow lightly on thy heart's flame
    and cool it.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg298" id="pg298">298</a></span>
  and Eleonora complains about Tasso:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Let him go! But what twilight falls round me now! Formerly the
    stream carried us along upon the light waves without a rudder.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Goethe we see very clearly how the inner life, under the
  pressure of its own intensity, will, so to speak, overflow into the
  outer world, making that live in its turn; and how this is especially
  the case when the amorous passion is present to add its impetus to
  feeling, and attribute its own fervour to all around.</p>

  <p><i>May Song</i>, <i>On the Lake</i>, <i>Ganymede</i>, are
  instances of this.</p>

  <p><i>Ganymede</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">Oh, what a glow</p>

    <p class="i2">Around me in morning's</p>

    <p class="i2">Blaze thou diffusest,</p>

    <p class="i2">Beautiful spring!</p>

    <p>With the rapture of love but intenser,</p>

    <p>Intenser and deeper and sweeter,</p>

    <p>Nestles and creeps to my heart</p>

    <p class="i2">The sensation divine</p>

    <p class="i2">Of thy fervour eternal,</p>

    <p class="i2">Oh, thou unspeakably fair!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Beautiful personifications abound:</p>

  <p>The sun is proudly throned in heaven.</p>

  <p>The glowing sun gazes at the rugged peak or charms it with fiery
  love,</p>

  <p>Or bathes like the moon in the ocean.</p>

  <p>The parting glance of Mother Sun broods on the grapes.</p>

  <p>'Morning came frightening away light sleep with its
  footsteps.'</p>

  <p>'The young day arose with delight.'</p>

  <p>The moon: 'Thou spreadest thy glance soothingly over my
  abode.'</p>

  <p>On a cloudy night: 'Evening already rocked earth, and night hung
  on the mountains; from a hill of clouds the moon looked mournfully
  out of the mist.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg299" id="pg299">299</a></span>
  'The lofty stars turn their clear eyes down to me.'</p>

  <p>Even the rock lives: 'The hard rock opens its bosom, not envying
  earth its deep springs.'</p>

  <p>The stream: 'Thou hurriest on with joyful light mood; see the rock
  spring bright with the glance of the stars, yet no shady valley, no
  flowers make him tarry ... his course winds downwards to the plain,
  then he scatters in delightful spray, in cloud waves ... foams
  gloomily to the abyss.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>With gradual step from out the far-off grey,</p>

    <p>Self-heralded draws on the storm.</p>

    <p>Birds on the wing fly low across the water, weighted down,</p>

    <p>And seamen hasten to reef in the sail</p>

    <p>Before its stubborn wrath.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His flowers are alive:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The beauteous snowdrops</p>

    <p>Droop o'er the plain,</p>

    <p>The crocus opens</p>

    <p>Its glowing bud ...</p>

    <p>With saucy gesture</p>

    <p>Primroses flare,</p>

    <p>And roguish violets</p>

    <p>Hidden with care.</p>
  </div>

  <p>But these are only examples. To obtain a clear idea of Goethe's
  attitude, we must take a more general survey of his work, for his
  poetic relationship to Nature, like his mental development in
  general, passed through various stages of growth. That it was a warm
  one even in youth is shewn by the letter in 1766 from Leipzig<a href=
  "#m9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You live contented in M. I even so here. Lonely, lonely,
    altogether lonely. Dearest Riese, this loneliness has impressed my
    soul with a certain sadness.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>This solitary joy is mine,</p>

    <p>When far apart from all mankind,</p>

    <p>By shady brook-side to recline.</p>

    <p>And keep my loved ones in my mind....</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg300" id="pg300">300</a></span>

  <p>He goes on with these lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Then is my heart with sorrow filled,</p>

    <p>Sad is mine eye.</p>

    <p>The flooded brook now rages by,</p>

    <p>That heretofore so gently rilled.</p>

    <p>No bird sings in the bushes now,</p>

    <p>The tree so green is dry,</p>

    <p>The zephyr which on me did blow</p>

    <p>So cheering, now storms northerly,</p>

    <p>And scattered blossoms bears on high.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He was already in full sympathy with Nature. A few of his earlier
  poems<a href="#m10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> shew prevalent taste, the
  allusions to Zephyr and Lima, for instance, in <i>Night</i>; but they
  are followed by lines which are all his own.</p>

  <p>He had an incomparable way of striking the chords of love and
  Nature together.</p>

  <p>Where his lady-love dwells, 'there is love, and goodness is
  Nature.' He thinks of her</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>When the bright sunlight shimmers</p>

      <p class="i4">Across the sea,</p>

      <p>When the clear fountain in the moonbeam glimmers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Thou art seductive and charming; flowers,</p>

      <p>Sun, moon, and stars only worship thee.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is passionate feeling for Nature in the <i>May Song</i> of
  his Sesenheimer period:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>How gloriously gleameth</p>

    <p>All Nature to me!</p>

    <p>How bright the sun beameth,</p>

    <p>How fresh is the lea!</p>

    <p>White blossoms are bursting</p>

    <p>The thickets among,</p>

    <p>And all the gay greenwood</p>

    <p>Is ringing with song!</p>

    <p>There's radiance and rapture</p>

    <p>That nought can destroy,</p>

    <p>Oh earth, in thy sunshine,</p>

    <p>Oh heart, in thy joy.</p>

    <p>Oh love! thou enchanter</p>

    <p>So golden and bright,</p>

    <p>Like the red clouds of morning</p>

    <p>That rest on yon height,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg301" id=
    "pg301">301</a></span>It is them that art clothing</p>

    <p>The fields and the bowers,</p>

    <p>And everywhere breathing</p>

    <p>The incense of flowers.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Looking back in old age to those happy days of youth, he saw in
  memory not only Frederica but the scenery around her. He said
  (<i>Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>): 'Her figure never looked more
  charming than when she was moving along a raised footpath; the charm
  of her bearing seemed to vie with the flowering ground, and the
  indestructible cheerfulness of her face with the blue sky.' In Alsace
  he wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>One has only to abandon oneself to the present in order to enjoy
    the charms of the sky, the glow of the rich earth, the mild
    evenings, the warm nights, at the side of one's love, or near
    her.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and one of the poems to Frederica says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The world lies round me buried deep in mist, but</p>

    <p>In one glance of thine lies sunshine and happiness.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is a strong pulse of life--life that overflows into
  Nature--in <i>The Departure</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>To horse! Away, o'er hill and steep,</p>

    <p>Into the saddle blithe I spring;</p>

    <p>The eve was cradling earth to sleep,</p>

    <p>And night upon the mountains hung.</p>

    <p>With robes of mist around him set,</p>

    <p>The oak like some huge giant stood,</p>

    <p>While, with its hundred eyes of jet,</p>

    <p>Peer'd darkness from the tangled wood.</p>

    <p>Amid a bank of clouds the moon</p>

    <p>A sad and troubled glimmer shed;</p>

    <p>The wind its chilly wings unclosed,</p>

    <p>And whistled wildly round my head.</p>

    <p>Night framed a thousand phantoms dire,</p>

    <p>Yet did I never droop nor start;</p>

    <p>Within my veins what living fire!</p>

    <p>What quenchless glow within my heart!</p>
  </div>

  <p>And very like it, though in a minor key, is the Elegy which
  begins, 'A tender, youthful trouble.'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg302" id="pg302">302</a></span> He
  tells in <i>Wahrheit und Dichtung</i> how he found comfort for his
  love troubles in Frankfort:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>They were accustomed to call me, on account of wandering about
    the district, the 'wanderer.' In producing that calm for the mind,
    which I felt under the open sky, in the valleys, on the heights, in
    the fields, and in the woods, the situation of Frankfort was
    serviceable.... On the setting in of winter a new world was
    revealed to us, since I at once determined to skate.... For this
    new joyous activity we were also indebted to Klopstock, to his
    enthusiasm for this happy species of motion.... To pass a splendid
    Sunday thus on the ice did not satisfy us, we continued in movement
    late into the night.... The full moon rising from the clouds, over
    the wide nocturnal meadows which were frozen into fields of ice,
    the night breeze which rustled towards us on our course, the solemn
    thunder of the ice which sunk as the water decreased, the strange
    echo of our own movements, rendered the scenes of Ossian just
    present to our minds.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>His attachment, to Lotte, stirred far deeper feelings than the
  earlier ones to Frederica and Lilli:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>(If I, my own dear Lilli, loved thee not, How should I joy to
    view this scene so fair! And yet if I, sweet Lilli, loved thee not,
    Should I be happy here or anywhere?)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and drew him correspondingly nearer to Nature.</p>

  <p>There is no book in any language which so lives and moves and has
  its being in Nature as <i>Werther</i>.<a href=
  "#m11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> In <i>Wahrheit und Dichtung</i> Goethe
  said of the 'strange element' in which <i>Werther</i> was designed
  and written:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I sought to free myself internally from all that was foreign to
    me, to regard the external with love, and to allow all beings, from
    man downwards, as low as they were comprehensible, to act upon me,
    each after its own kind. Thus arose a wonderful affinity with the
    single objects of Nature, and a hearty concord, a harmony with the
    whole, so that every change, whether of place or region, or of the
    times of the day and year, or whatever else could happen, affected
    me in the deepest manner. The glance of the painter associated
    itself with that of <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg303" id=
    "pg303">303</a></span>the poet; the beautiful rural landscape,
    animated by the pleasant river, increased my love of solitude and
    favoured my silent observations as they extended on all sides.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The strong influence of <i>La Nouvelle Héloise</i> upon
  <i>Werther</i> was very evident, but there was a marked difference
  between Goethe's feeling for Nature and Rousseau's. Rousseau had the
  painter's eye, but not the keen poetic vision.</p>

  <p>Goethe's romances are pervaded by the penetrating quality peculiar
  to his nation, and by virtue of which in <i>Werther</i>, the outer
  world, the scenery, was not used as framework, but was always
  interwoven with the hero's mood. The contrast between culture and
  Nature is always marked in Rousseau, and his religion was deism;
  Goethe resolves Nature into feeling, and his religion was a growing
  pantheism. As a work of art, <i>Werther</i> is excellent, <i>La
  Nouvelle Héloise</i> is not. Goethe used his hero's bearing towards
  Nature with marvellous effect to indicate the turns and changes of
  his moods, just as he indicated the threatening calamity and the
  growing apprehension of it by skilful stress laid upon some of her
  little traits--a faculty which only Theodore Storm among later poets
  has caught from him.</p>

  <p>The growth of amorous passion is portrayed as an elementary force,
  and the revolutionary element in the book really consists in the
  strength of this passion and the assertion of its natural rights.
  Everything artificial, forced, conventional, in thought, act, and
  feeling--and what at that time was not?--was repugnant to Werther;
  what he liked most of all was the simplicity of children and
  uneducated people.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Nothing distresses me more than to see men torment each other;
    particularly when in the flower of their age, in the very season of
    pleasure, they waste their few short days of sunshine in quarrels
    and disputes, and only perceive their error when it is too late to
    repair it.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg304" id="pg304">304</a></span> To
  such intense sympathy as this, all that had been sung ere now by
  German poets had to give place. Nature, which hitherto had played no
  <i>rôle</i> at all in fiction, not even among the English, was
  Werther's truest and most intimate friend.</p>

  <p>Werther is sensitive and sentimental, though in a single-hearted
  way, with a sentimentality that reminds us more and more, as the
  story proceeds, of the gloomy tone of Ossian and Young. He is a
  thoroughly original character, who feels that he is right so to be;
  and although he falls a prey to his melancholy, yet there is much
  more force and thought in his outpourings than in all the moonshine
  tirades that preceded him. It is the work of a true poet, in the best
  days of a brilliant youth.</p>

  <p>Werther, like Rousseau, was happiest in solitude. Solitude, in the
  'place like paradise,' was precious balm to his feeling heart, which
  he considers 'like a sick child'; and the 'warm heavenly imagination
  of the heart' illuminates Nature round him--his 'favourite valley,'
  the 'sweet spring morning,' Nature's 'unspeakable beauty.' He was
  absorbed in artistic feeling, though he could not draw; 'I could not
  draw them, not a stroke, and have never been a greater artist than at
  that moment.' His power lay in imbuing his whole subject with
  feeling; he felt the heart of Nature beating, and its echo in his own
  breast.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
    meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
    of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
    sanctuary, then I throw myself down in the tall grass by the
    trickling stream; and as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
    unknown plants discover themselves to me. When I hear the buzz of
    the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the
    countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel
    the presence of the Almighty who formed us in His own image, and
    the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as
    it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg305" id=
    "pg305">305</a></span>friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes,
    and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power,
    like the idea of a beloved mistress, then I often long and think: O
    that you could describe these conceptions, that you could impress
    upon paper all that lives so full and warm within you, that it
    might be the mirror of your soul, as your soul is the mirror of the
    infinite God!</p>

    <p>O! my friend! but it is too much for my strength. I sink under
    the weight of the grandeur of these visions.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Werther could not express all his love for Nature, but the secret
  of it lay in the power to bring his own world of thought and feeling
  into communion with her, and so give her speech. He divined something
  immortal in her akin to himself. 'The true feeling of Nature,' he
  said, 'is love.' He poured 'the stream of his genius' over her, and
  she became 'dear and familiar' to him.... The simple homely scenery
  delighted him--the valley, the brook, the fine walnut trees.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>When I go out at sunrise in the morning to Walheim, and with my
    own hands gather the peas in the garden, which are to serve for my
    dinner; when I sit down to shell them and read my Homer during the
    intervals, and then, selecting a saucepan from the kitchen, fetch
    my own butter, put my mess on the fire, cover it up.... Nothing
    fills me with a more pure and genuine sense of happiness than those
    traits of patriarchal life, which, thank heaven, I can imitate
    without affectation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>With the growth of his love-passion his feeling for Nature
  increased; on July 24th he wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I never felt happier, I never understood Nature better, even
    down to the veriest stem or smallest blade of grass.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then Albert came on the scene, and love became a torment, and
  Nature a tormentor:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>August</i> 18.--Must it ever be thus, that the source of our
    happiness must also be the fountain of our misery? The full and
    ardent sentiment which animated my heart with the love of Nature,
    overwhelming me with <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg306" id=
    "pg306">306</a></span>a torrent of delight, and which brought all
    paradise before me, has now become an insupportable torment, a
    demon which perpetually pursues and harasses me. When in bye-gone
    days I gazed from these rocks upon yonder mountains across the
    river and upon the green flowery valley before me, and saw all
    nature budding and bursting around--the hills clothed from foot to
    peak with tall thick forest trees, the valleys in all their varied
    windings shaded with the loveliest woods, and the soft river
    gliding along amongst the lisping reeds, mirroring the beautiful
    clouds which the soft evening breeze wafted across the sky--when I
    heard the groves about me melodious with the music of birds, and
    saw the million swarms of insects dancing in the last golden beams
    of the sun, whose setting rays awoke the humming beetles from their
    grassy beds, whilst the subdued tumult around directed my attention
    to the ground, and I there observed the arid rock compelled to
    yield nutriment to the dry moss, whilst the heath flourished upon
    the barren sands below me--all this displayed to me the inner
    warmth which animates all Nature, and filled and glowed within my
    heart. I felt myself exalted by this overflowing fulness to the
    perception of the Godhead, and the glorious forms of an infinite
    universe became visible to my soul.... From the inaccessible
    mountains across the desert, which no mortal foot has trod, far as
    the confines of the unknown ocean, breathes the spirit of the
    eternal Creator, and every atom to which He has given existence
    finds favour in His sight. Ah! how often at that time has the
    flight of a bird soaring above my head inspired me with the desire
    of being transported to the shores of the immeasurable waters,
    there to quaff the pleasure of life from the foaming goblet of the
    infinite, and to partake, if but for a moment, even with the
    confined powers of my soul, the beatitude of the Creator, who
    accomplishes all things in himself and through himself.... It is as
    if a curtain had been drawn from before my eyes.... My heart is
    wasted by the thought of that destructive power which lies
    concealed in every part of universal nature--Nature has formed
    nothing that does not consume itself and every object near it; so
    that, surrounded by earth, and air, and all the active powers, I
    wander on my way with aching heart, and the universe is to me a
    fearful monster, for ever devouring its own offspring.... If in
    such moments I find no sympathy ... I either wander through the
    country, climb some precipitous cliff, or force a path through the
    trackless <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg307" id=
    "pg307">307</a></span>thicket, where I am lacerated and torn by
    thorns and briars, and thence I find relief.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then, as he was going away, he felt how sympathetic the place had
  been to him:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I was walking up and down the very avenue which was so dear to
    me--a secret sympathy had frequently drawn me thither....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>the moon rose from behind a hill, increasing his melancholy, and
  Charlotte put his feeling into words, saying (like Klopstock):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>September</i> 10.--Whenever I walk by moonlight, it brings to
    my remembrance all my beloved and departed friends, and I am filled
    with thoughts of death and futurity.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Even in his misery he realises the [Greek: charisgoôn] of
  Euripides, Petrarch's <i>dolendi voluptas</i>--the <i>Wonne der
  Wehmuth</i>.</p>

  <p>On September 4th he wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is even so! As Nature puts on her autumn tints, it becomes
    autumn with me and around me. My leaves are sere and yellow, and
    the neighbouring trees are divested of their foliage.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It was due to this autumn feeling that he could say:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Ossian has superseded Homer in my heart. To what a world does
    the illustrious bard carry me! To wander over pathless wilds,
    surrounded by impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble light of
    the moon, we see the spirits of our ancestors; to hear from the
    mountain tops, 'mid the roar of torrents, their plaintive sounds
    issuing from deep caverns.... And this heart is now dead; no
    sentiment can revive it. My eyes are dry, and my senses, no more
    refreshed by the influence of soft tears, wither and consume my
    brain. I suffer much, for I have lost the only charm of life, that
    active sacred power which created worlds around me, and it is no
    more. When I look from my window at the distant hills and behold
    the morning sun breaking through the mists and illuminating the
    country round it which is still wrapt in silence, whilst the soft
    stream <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg308" id=
    "pg308">308</a></span>winds gently through the willows which have
    shed their leaves; when glorious Nature displays all her beauties
    before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectual to attract
    one tear of joy from my withered heart....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On November 30th he wrote: 'About dinner-time I went to walk by
  the river side, for I had no appetite,' and goes on in the tone of
  Ossian:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Everything around me seemed gloomy: a cold and damp easterly
    wind blew from the mountains, and black heavy clouds spread over
    the plain.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and in the dreadful night of the flood:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Upon the stroke of twelve I hastened forth. I beheld a fearful
    sight. The foaming torrents rolled from the mountains in the
    moonlight; fields and meadows, trees and hedges, were confounded
    together, and the entire valley was converted into a deep lake
    which was agitated by the roaring wind. And when the moon shone
    forth and tinged the black clouds with silver, and the impetuous
    torrent at my feet foamed and resounded with awful and grand
    impetuosity, I was overcome by a mingled sensation of awe and
    delight. With extended arms I looked down into the yawning abyss,
    and cried 'Plunge!' For a moment my senses forsook me, in the
    intense delight of ending my sorrows and my sufferings by a plunge
    into that gulf.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To his farewell letter he adds:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Yes, Nature! put on mourning. Your child, your friend, your
    lover, draws near his end.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The genuine poetic pantheism, which, for all his melancholy and
  sentimentality, was the spring of Werther's feeling, is seen in
  loftier and more comprehensive form in the first part of
  <i>Faust</i>, when Faust opens the book and sees the sign of
  macrocosmos:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>How all things live and work, and ever blending,</p>

    <p>Weave one vast whole from Being's ample range!</p>

    <p>How powers celestial, rising and descending,</p>

    <p>Their golden buckets ceaseless interchange.</p>

    <p>Their flight on rapture-breathing pinions winging,</p>

    <p>From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing,</p>

    <p>Through the wide whole their chimes melodious ringing.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg309" id="pg309">309</a></span>
  And the Earth spirit says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>In the currents of life, in action's storm,</p>

    <p>I float and I wave</p>

    <p>With billowy motion,--</p>

    <p>Birth and the grave</p>

    <p>A limitless ocean.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Not only of knowledge of, but of feeling for, Nature, it is
  said:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Inscrutable in broadest light,</p>

    <p>To be unveiled by force she doth refuse.</p>
  </div>

  <p>But Faust is in deep sympathy with her; witness:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Thou full-orbed moon! Would thou wert gazing now</p>

    <p>For the last time upon my troubled brow!</p>
  </div>

  <p>and</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Loos'd from their icy fetters, streams and rills</p>

    <p>In spring's effusive, quick'ning mildness flow,</p>

    <p>Hope's budding promise every valley fills.</p>

    <p>And winter, spent with age, and powerless now,</p>

    <p>Draws off his forces to the savage hills.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and the idyllic evening mood, which gives way to a burst of
  longing:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>In the rich sunset see how brightly glow</p>

    <p>Yon cottage homes girt round with verdant green.</p>

    <p>Slow sinks the orb, the day is now no more;</p>

    <p>Yonder he hastens to diffuse new light.</p>

    <p>Oh! for a pinion from the earth to soar,</p>

    <p>And after, ever after him to strive!</p>

    <p>Then should I see the world outspread below,</p>

    <p>Illumined by the deathless evening beams,</p>

    <p>The vales reposing, every height aglow,</p>

    <p>The silver brooklets meeting golden streams....</p>

    <p>Alas! that when on Spirit wing we rise,</p>

    <p>No wing material lifts our mortal clay.</p>

    <p>But 'tis our inborn impulse, deep and strong,</p>

    <p>To rush aloft, to struggle still towards heaven,</p>

    <p>When far above us pours its thrilling song</p>

    <p>The skylark lost amid the purple even,</p>

    <p>When on extended pinion sweeps amain</p>

    <p>The lordly eagle o'er the pine-crowned height.</p>

    <p>And when, still striving towards its home, the crane</p>

    <p>O'er moor and ocean wings its onward flight.</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg310" id="pg310">310</a></span>

  <p>But the most complete expression of Goethe's attitude, not only in
  the period of <i>Werther</i> and the first part of <i>Faust</i>, but
  generally, is contained in the <i>Monologue</i>, which was probably
  written not earlier than the spring of 1788:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Spirit sublime! Thou gav'st me, gav'st me all</p>

    <p>For which I prayed. Not vainly hast thou turn'd</p>

    <p>To me thy countenance in flaming fire;</p>

    <p>Thou gav'st me glorious Nature for my realm,</p>

    <p>And also power to feel her and enjoy;</p>

    <p>Not merely with a cold and wond'ring glance,</p>

    <p>Thou didst permit me in her depths profound,</p>

    <p>As in the bosom of a friend, to gaze;</p>

    <p>Before me thou dost lead her living tribes,</p>

    <p>And dost in silent grove, in air and stream,</p>

    <p>Teach me to know my kindred....</p>
  </div>

  <p>His feeling was not admiration alone, nor reverence alone, but the
  sympathy of <i>Childe Harold</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Are not the mountains, waves, and skies a part</p>

    <p>Of me and of my soul, as I of them?</p>

    <p>Is not the love of these deep in my heart</p>

    <p>With a pure passion? Should I not contemn</p>

    <p>All objects, if compared with these?</p>
  </div>

  <p>and the very confession of faith of such poetic pantheism is in
  Faust's words:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Him who dare name,</p>

    <p>And yet proclaim,</p>

    <p>Yes, I believe?...</p>

    <p>The All-embracer,</p>

    <p>All-sustainer,</p>

    <p>Doth he not embrace, sustain</p>

    <p>Thee, me, himself?</p>

    <p>Lifts not the heaven its dome above?</p>

    <p>Doth not the firm-set earth beneath us rise?</p>

    <p>And beaming tenderly with looks of love,</p>

    <p>Climb not the everlasting stars on high?</p>
  </div>

  <p>The poems which date directly after the Wetzlar period are full of
  this sympathetic pantheistic love for Nature--<i>Mahomet's Song</i>,
  for example, with its splendid comparison of pioneering genius to a
  mountain torrent: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg311" id=
  "pg311">311</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Ho! the spring that bursts</p>

    <p>From the mountain height</p>

    <p>Joyous and bright,</p>

    <p>As the gleam of a star....</p>

    <p>Down in the vale below</p>

    <p>Flowers bud beneath his tread ...</p>

    <p>And woo him with fond eyes.</p>

    <p>And the streamlets of the mountains</p>

    <p>Shout to him, and cry out 'Brother'!</p>

    <p>Brother! take thy brothers with thee,</p>

    <p>With thee to thine ancient father,</p>

    <p>To the eternal Ocean,</p>

    <p>Who with outstretch'd arms awaits us....</p>

    <p>And so beareth he his brothers</p>

    <p>To their primal sire expectant,</p>

    <p>All his bosom throbbing, heaving,</p>

    <p>With a wild, tumultuous joy.</p>
  </div>

  <p>We see the same pathos--the pathos of Pindar and the Psalms--in
  the comparison:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Like water is the soul of man,</p>

    <p>From heaven it comes, to heaven it goes,</p>

    <p>And back again to earth in ceaseless change.</p>
  </div>

  <p>in the incomparable <i>Wanderer</i>, in <i>Wanderer's Storm
  Song,</i> and, above all, in <i>Ganymede</i>, already given, of which
  Loeper remarks:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The poem is, as it were, a rendering of that letter (Werther's
    of May 10th) in rhythm. The underlying pantheism had already shewn
    itself in the <i>Wanderer's Storm Song</i>. It was not the delight
    in God of a Brockes, not the adoration of a Klopstock, not
    sesthetic enjoyment of Nature, not, as in later years, scientific
    interest; it was rather a being absorbed in, identified with,
    Nature, a sympathy carried so far that the very ego was surrendered
    to the elements.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the Lake of Zurich he wrote, June 15th, 1775:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>And here I drink new blood, fresh food,</p>

    <p>From world so free, so blest;</p>

    <p>How sweet is Nature and how good,</p>

    <p>Who holds me to her breast.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and Elmire sings in <i>Ermin and Elmire</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>From thee, O Nature, with deep breath</p>

    <p>I drink in painful pleasure.</p>
  </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg312" id="pg312">312</a></span>

  <p>One of the gems among his Nature poems is <i>Autumn Feelings</i>
  (it was the autumn of his love for Lilli):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Flourish greener as ye clamber,</p>

    <p>O ye leaves, to seek my chamber;</p>

    <p>Up the trellised vine on high</p>

    <p>May ye swell, twin-berries tender,</p>

    <p>Juicier far, and with more splendour</p>

    <p>Ripen, and more speedily.</p>

    <p>O'er ye broods the sun at even,</p>

    <p>As he sinks to rest, and heaven</p>

    <p>Softly breathes into your ear</p>

    <p>All its fertilizing fulness,</p>

    <p>While the moon's refreshing coolness,</p>

    <p>Magic-laden, hovers near.</p>

    <p>And alas! ye're watered ever</p>

    <p>By a stream of tears that rill</p>

    <p>From mine eyes--tears ceasing never,</p>

    <p>Tears of love that nought can still.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The lyrical effect here depends upon the blending of a single
  impression of Nature with the passing mood--an occasional poem rare
  even for Goethe.</p>

  <p>In a letter to Frau von Stein he admitted that he was greatly
  influenced by Nature:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I have slept well and am quite awake, only a quiet sadness lies
    upon my soul.... The weather agrees exactly with my state of mind,
    and I begin to believe that it is the weather around me which has
    the most immediate effect upon me, and the great world thrills my
    little one with her own mood.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Again, <i>To the Moon</i>, in the spring 1778, expresses perfect
  communion between Nature and feeling:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Flooded are the brakes and dells</p>

    <p>With thy phantom light,</p>

    <p>And my soul receives the spell</p>

    <p>Of thy mystic night.</p>

    <p>To the meadow dost thou send</p>

    <p>Something of thy grace,</p>

    <p>Like the kind eye of a friend</p>

    <p>Beaming on my face.</p>

    <p>Echoes of departed times</p>

    <p>Vibrate in mine ear,</p>

    <p>Joyous, sad, like spirit chimes,</p>

    <p>As I wander here.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg313" id=
    "pg313">313</a></span>Flow, flow on, thou little brook,</p>

    <p>Ever onward go!</p>

    <p>Trusted heart and tender look</p>

    <p>Left me even so!</p>

    <p>Richer treasure earth has none</p>

    <p>Than I once possessed--</p>

    <p>Ah! so rich, that when 'twas gone</p>

    <p>Worthless was the rest.</p>

    <p>Little brook! adown the vale</p>

    <p>Rush and take my song:</p>

    <p>Give it passion, give it wail,</p>

    <p>As thou leap'st along!</p>

    <p>Sound it in the winter night</p>

    <p>When thy streams are full,</p>

    <p>Murmur it when skies are bright</p>

    <p>Mirror'd in the pool.</p>

    <p>Happiest he of all created</p>

    <p>Who the world can shun,</p>

    <p>Not in hate, and yet unhated,</p>

    <p>Sharing thought with none,</p>

    <p>Save one faithful friend, revealing</p>

    <p>To his kindly ear</p>

    <p>Thoughts like these, which o'er me stealing,</p>

    <p>Make the night so drear.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In January 1778, he wrote to Frau von Stein about the fate of the
  unhappy Chr. von Lassberg, who had drowned himself in the Ilm:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This inviting grief has something dangerously attractive about
    it, like the water itself; and the reflections of the stars, which
    gleam from above and below at once, are alluring.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To the same year belongs <i>The Fisher</i>, which gave such
  melodious voice to the magic effect of a shimmering expanse of water,
  'the moist yet radiant blue,' upon the mood; just as, later on,
  <i>The Erlking</i>, with the grey of an autumn evening woven
  ghostlike round tree and shrub, made the mind thrill with
  foreboding.</p>

  <p>Goethe was always an industrious traveller. In his seventieth year
  he went to Frankfort, Strassburg, the Rhine, Thuringia, and the Harz
  Mountains (Harzreise, 1777): 'We went up to the peaks, and down to
  the depths of the earth, and hammered at <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg314" id="pg314">314</a></span>all the rocks.'
  His love for Nature increased with his science; but, at the same
  time, poetic expression of it took a more objective form; the
  passionate vehemence, the really revolutionary attitude of the
  <i>Werther</i> period, gave way to one equally spiritual and
  intellectual, but more temperate.</p>

  <p>This transition is clearly seen in the Swiss letters. In his first
  Swiss travels, 1775, he was only just free from <i>Werther</i>, and
  his mind was too agitated for quiet observation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Hasten thee, Kronos!...</p>

    <p>Over stock and stone let thy trot</p>

    <p>Into life straightway lead....</p>

    <p>Wide, high, glorious the view</p>

    <p>Gazing round upon life,</p>

    <p>While from mount unto mount</p>

    <p>Hovers the spirit eterne,</p>

    <p>Life eternal foreboding....</p>
  </div>

  <p>Far more significant and ripe--in fact, mature--are the letters in
  1779, shewing, as they do, the attitude of a man of profound mind, in
  the prime of his life and time. He was the first German poet to fall
  under the spell of the mountains--the strongest spell, as he held,
  which Nature wields in our latitudes. 'These sublime, incomparable
  scenes will remain for ever in my mind'; and of one view in
  particular, over the mountains of Savoy and Valais, the Lake of
  Geneva, and Mont Blanc, he said: 'The view was so great, man's eye
  could not grasp it.'</p>

  <p>He wrote of his feelings with perfect openness to Frau von Stein,
  and these letters extended farther back than those from Switzerland,
  and were partly mixed with them.</p>

  <p>From Selz:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>An uncommonly fine day, a happy country--still all green, only
    here and there a yellow beech or oak leaf. Meadows still in their
    silver beauty--a soft welcome breeze everywhere. Grapes improving
    with every step and every day. Every peasant's house has a vine up
    to the roof, and every courtyard a great <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg315" id="pg315">315</a></span>overhanging
    arbour. The air of heaven soft, warm, and moist. The Rhine and the
    clear mountains near at hand, the changing woods, meadows, fields
    like gardens, do men good, and give me a kind of comfort which I
    have long lacked.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The pen remains as ever the pen of a poet, but he looks at
  Switzerland now with a mature, settled taste, analyzing his
  impressions, and studying mountains, glaciers, boulders,
  scientifically.</p>

  <p>Of the Staubbach Fall, near Lauterbrunnen (Oct. 9th, 1779):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The clouds broke in the upper air, and the blue sky came
    through. Clouds clung to the steep sides of the rocks; even the top
    where the Staubbach falls over, was lightly covered. It was a very
    noble sight ... then the clouds came down into the valley and
    covered all the foreground. The great wall over which the water
    falls, still stood out on the right. Night came on.... In the
    Munsterthal, through which we came, everything was lofty, but more
    within the mind's power of comprehension than these. In comparison
    with the immensities, one is, and must remain, too small.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And after visiting the Berne glacier from Thun (Oct. 14):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is difficult to write after all this ... the first glance
    from the mountain is striking, the district is surprisingly
    extensive and pleasant ... the road indescribably beautiful ... the
    view from the Lake of Brienz towards the snow mountains at sunset
    is great.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>More eloquent is the letter of October 3rd, from the
  Munsterthal:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The passage through this defile roused in me a grand but calm
    emotion. The sublime produces a beautiful calmness in the soul,
    which, entirely possessed by it, feels as great as it ever can
    feel. How glorious is such a pure feeling, when it rises to the
    very highest without overflowing. My eye and my soul were both able
    to take in the objects before me, and as I was preoccupied by
    nothing, and had no false tastes to counteract their impression,
    they had on me their full and natural <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg316" id="pg316">316</a></span>effect. When we
    compare such a feeling with that we are sensible of, when we
    laboriously harass ourselves with some trifle, and strain every
    nerve to gain as much as possible for it, and, as it were, to patch
    it out, striving to furnish joy and aliment to the mind from its
    own creation; we then feel sensibly what a poor expedient, after
    all, the latter is....</p>

    <p>When we see such objects as these for the first time, the
    unaccustomed soul has to expand itself, and this gives rise to a
    sort of painful joy, an overflowing of emotion which agitates the
    mind and draws from us the most delicious tears.... If only destiny
    had bidden me to dwell in the midst of some grand scenery, then
    would I every morning have imbibed greatness from its grandeur, as
    from a lonely valley I would extract patience and repose.</p>

    <p>One guesses in the dark about the origin and existence of these
    singular forms.... These masses must have been formed grandly and
    simply by aggregation. Whatever revolutions may subsequently have
    up-heaved, rent, and divided them ... the idea of such nightly
    commotions gives one a deep feeling of the eternal stability of the
    masses.... One feels deeply convinced that here there is nothing
    accidental, that here there is working an eternal law which,
    however slowly, yet surely governs the universe.</p>

  <p>By the Lake of Geneva, where he thought of Rousseau, he went up
  the Dole:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The whole of the Pays de Vaux and de Gex lay like a plan before
    us ... we kept watching the mist, which gradually retired ... one
    by one we distinctly saw Lausanne ... Vevey.... There are no words
    to express the beauty and grandeur of this view ... the line of
    glittering glaciers was continually drawing the eye back again to
    the mountains.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>From Cluse he wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The air was as warm as it usually is at the beginning of
    September, and the country we travelled through beautiful. Many of
    the trees still green; most of them had assumed a brownish-yellow
    tint, but only a few were quite bare. The crops were rich and
    verdant, the mountains caught from the red sunset a rosy hue
    blended with violet, and all these rich tints were combined with
    grand, beautiful, and agreeable forms of the landscape.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg317" id="pg317">317</a></span> At
  Chamouni, about effects of light:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Here too again it seemed to us as if the sun had first of all
    attracted the light mists which evaporated from the tops of the
    glaciers, and then a gentle breeze had, as it were, combed the fine
    vapours like a fleece of foam over the atmosphere. I never remember
    at home, even in the height of summer, to have seen any so
    transparent, for here it was a perfect web of light.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At the Col de Baume:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Whilst I am writing, a remarkable phenomenon is passing along
    the sky. The mists, which are shifting about and breaking in some
    places, allow you through their openings, as through skylights, to
    catch a glimpse of the blue sky, while at the same time the
    mountain peaks, rising above our roofs of vapour, are illuminated
    by the sun's rays....</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At Leukertad, at the foot of the Gemmi, he wrote (Nov. 9th):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The clouds which gather here in this valley, at one time
    completely hiding the immense rocks and absorbing them in a waste
    impenetrable gloom, or at another letting a part of them be seen
    like huge spectres, give to the people a cast of melancholy. In the
    midst of such natural phenomena, the people are full of
    presentiments and forebodings ... and the eternal and intrinsic
    energy of his (man's) nature feels itself at every nerve moved to
    forebode and to indulge in presentiments.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On the way across the Rhine glacier to the Furka, he felt the
  half-suggestive, half-distressing sense of mountain loneliness:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It was a strange sight ... in the most desolate region of the
    world, in a boundless monotonous wilderness of mountains enveloped
    in snow, where for three leagues before and behind you would not
    expect to meet a living soul, while on both sides you had the deep
    hollows of a web of mountains, you might see a line of men wending
    their way, treading each in the deep footsteps of the one before
    him, and where, in the whole of the wide expanse thus smoothed
    over, the eye could discern nothing but the track they left behind
    them. The hollows, as we left them, lay behind us grey and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg318" id=
    "pg318">318</a></span>boundless in the mist. The changing clouds
    continually passed over the pale disc of the sun, and spread over
    the whole scene a perpetually moving veil.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He sums up the impressions made on him with:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The perception of such a long chain of Nature's wonders, excites
    within me a secret and inexpressible feeling of enjoyment.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The most profound change in his mental life was brought about by
  his visit to Italy, 1786-87. The poetic expression of this refining
  process, this striving towards the classic ideal, towards Sophrosyne,
  was <i>Iphigenia</i>.</p>

  <p>Its effect upon his feeling for Nature appeared in a more
  matter-of-fact tone; the man of feeling gave way to the scientific
  observer.</p>

  <p>He had, as he said (Oct. 30th, 1887), lately 'acquired the habit
  of looking only at things, and not, as formerly, seeing with and in
  the things what actually was not there.'</p>

  <p>He no longer imputed his feelings to Nature, and studied her
  influence on himself, but looked at her with impersonal interest.
  Weather, cloud, mountain formation, the species of stone, landscape,
  and social themes, were all treated almost systematically as so much
  diary memoranda for future use. There was no artistic treatment in
  such jottings; meteorology, botany, and geology weighed too
  heavily.</p>

  <p>The question, 'Is a place beautiful?' paled beside 'Is its soil
  clay?' 'Are its rocks quartz, chalk, or mica schist?' The problem of
  the archetypal plant was more absorbing than the finest groups of
  trees. The years of practical life at Weimar, and, above all, the
  ever-growing interest in science, were the chief factors in this
  change, which led him, as he said in his <i>Treatise on
  Granite</i>,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>from observation and description of the human heart, that part
    of creation which is the most youthful, varied, unstable, and
    destructible, to observation of that Son of Nature, which is the
    oldest, deepest, most stable, most indestructible.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg319" id="pg319">319</a></span>
  The enthusiastic subjective realism of stormy youth was replaced by
  the measured objective realism of ripe manhood. Hence the difference
  between his letters from Switzerland and those from Italy, where this
  inner metamorphosis was completed; as he said, 'Between Weimar and
  Palermo I have had many changes.'</p>

  <p>For all that, he revelled in the beauty of Italy. As he once
  said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is natural to me to revere the great and beautiful willingly
    and with pleasure; and to develop this predisposition day by day
    and hour by hour by means of such glorious objects, is the most
    delightful feeling.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The sea made a great impression upon him:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I set out for the Lido...landed, and walked straight across the
    isthmus. I heard a loud hollow murmur--it was the sea! I soon saw
    it; it crested high against the shore as it retired, it was about
    noon and time of ebb. I have then at last seen the sea with my own
    eyes, and followed it on its beautiful bed, just as it quitted
    it.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But further on he only remarks: 'The sea is a great sight.'
  Elsewhere, too, it is only noticed very shortly.</p>

  <p>Rome stimulated his mind to increased productiveness, and, partly
  for this reason, he could not assimilate all the new impressions
  which poured in upon him from without, from ruins, paintings,
  churches, palaces, the life of the people. He drew a great deal too;
  from Frascati he wrote (Nov. 15th, 1786):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The country around is very pleasant; the village lies on the
    side of a hill, or rather of a mountain, and at every step the
    draughtsman comes upon the most glorious objects. The prospect is
    unbounded. Rome lies before you, and beyond it on the right is the
    sea, the mountains of Tivoli, and so on.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In Rome itself (Feb. 2nd, 1787):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Of the beauty of a walk through Rome by moonlight it is
    impossible to form a conception without having witnessed it.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg320" id="pg320">320</a></span>
  During Carnival (Feb. 21st):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The sky, so infinitely fine and clear, looked down nobly and
    innocently upon the mummeries.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the voyage to Sicily:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At noon we went on board; the weather being extremely fine, we
    enjoyed the most glorious of views. The corvette lay at anchor near
    to the Mole. With an unclouded sun the atmosphere was hazy, giving
    to the rocky walls of Sorrento, which were in the shade, a tint of
    most beautiful blue. Naples with its living multitudes lay in full
    sunshine, and glittered brilliantly with countless tints.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>and on April 1st:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>With a cloudy sky, a bright but broken moonlight, the reflection
    on the sea was infinitely beautiful.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At first, Italy, and especially Rome, felt strange to him, in
  scenery, sky, contour, and colour. It was only by degrees that he
  felt at home there.</p>

  <p>He refers to this during his second visit to Rome in a notable
  remark, which aptly expresses the faculty of apperception--the link
  between us and the unfamiliar, which enables mental growth.</p>

  <p>June 16th, 1787:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>One remark more! Now for the first time do the trees, the rocks,
    nay, Rome itself, grow dear to me; hitherto I have always felt them
    as foreign, though, on the other hand, I took pleasure in minor
    subjects having some resemblance to those I saw in youth.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On August 18th, 1787, he wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Yesterday before sunrise I drove to Acqua Acetosa. Verily, one
    might well lose his senses in contemplating the clearness, the
    manifoldness, the dewy transparency, the heavenly hue of the
    landscape, especially in the distance.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In October, when he heard of the engagement of a beautiful
  Milanese lady with whom he had fallen in love:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg321" id=
  "pg321">321</a></span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I again turned me instantly to Nature, as a subject for
    landscapes, a field I had been meanwhile neglecting, and
    endeavoured to copy her in this respect with the utmost fidelity. I
    was, however, more successful in mastering her with my eyes.... All
    the sensual fulness which that region offers us in rocks and trees,
    in acclivities and declivities, in peaceful lakes and lively
    streams, all this was grasped by my eye more appreciatively, if
    possible, than ever before, and I could hardly resent the wound
    which had to such degree sharpened my inward and outward sense.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>On leaving Rome, he wrote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Three nights before, the full moon shone in the clearest heaven,
    and the enchantment shed over the vast town, though often felt
    before, was never felt so keenly as now. The great masses of light,
    clear as in mild daylight, the contrast of deep shades,
    occasionally relieved by reflexions dimly portraying details, all
    this transported us as if into another, a simpler and a greater,
    world.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The later diaries on his travels are sketchy throughout, and more
  laconic and objective: for example, at Schaffhausen (Sept. 18th):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Went out early, 7.30, to see the Falls of the Rhine; colour of
    water, green--causes of this, the heights covered by mist--the
    depths clear, and we saw the castle of Laufen half in mist; thought
    of Ossian. Love mist when moved by deep feeling.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At Brunnen:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Green of the lake, steep banks, small size of boatman in
    comparison to the enormous masses of rock. One saw precipices grown
    over by trees, summits covered by clouds. Sunshine over the scene,
    one felt the formless greatness of Nature.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He was conscious of the great change in himself since his last
  visit there, and wrote to Schiller (Oct. 14th, 1797):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I remember the effect these things had upon me twenty years ago.
    The total impression remained with me, but the details faded, and I
    had a wonderful longing to repeat the whole experience and correct
    my impressions. I had become another man, and therefore it must
    needs appear different to me.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg322" id="pg322">322</a></span> In
  later years he travelled a great deal in the Harz Mountains, to
  Carlsbad, Toplitz, the Maine, Marienbad, etc. After the death of his
  great friends, Schiller and Carl August, he was more and more lonely,
  and his whole outlook, with increasing years, grew more impersonal,
  his attitude to Nature more abstract and scientific; the archetypal
  plant was superseded by the theory of colours. But he kept fresh eyes
  for natural beauty into ripe age; witness this letter from
  Heidelberg, May 4th, 1808, to Frau von Stein:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Yesterday evening, after finishing my work, I went alone to the
    castle, and first scrambled about among the ruins, and then betook
    myself to the great balcony from which one can overlook the whole
    country. It was one of the loveliest of May evenings and of
    sunsets. No! I have really never seen such a fine view! Just
    imagine! One looked into the beautiful though narrow Neckar valley,
    covered on both sides with woods and vineyards and fruit trees just
    coming into flower. Further off the valley widened, and one saw the
    setting sun reflected in the Rhine as it flowed majestically
    through most beautiful country. On its further side the horizon was
    bounded by the Vosges mountains, lit up by the sun as if by a fire.
    The whole country was covered with fresh green, and close to me
    were the enormous ruins of the old castle, half in light and half
    in shade. You can easily fancy how it fascinated me. I stood lost
    in the view quite half an hour, till the rising moon woke me from
    my dreams.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Goethe's true lyrical period was in the seventies, before his
  Italian journeys; during and after that time he wrote more dramatic
  and epic poetry, with ballads and the more narrative kind of epic. In
  sending <i>Der Jüngling und der Mühlbach</i> to Schiller from
  Switzerland in 1797, he wrote: 'I have discovered splendid material
  for idylls and elegies, and whatever that sort of poetry is
  called.'</p>

  <p>Nature lyrics were few during his Italian travels, as in the
  journey to Sicily, 1787; among them were <i>Calm at Sea</i>:
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg323" id="pg323">323</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Silence deep rules o'er the waters,</p>

    <p>Calmly slumbering lies the main.</p>
  </div>

  <p>and <i>Prosperous Voyage</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The mist is fast clearing,</p>

    <p>And radiant is heaven,</p>

    <p>Whilst Æolus loosens</p>

    <p>Our anguish-fraught bond.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The most perfect of all such short poems was the <i>Evening
  Song</i>, written one September night of 1783 on the Gickelhahn, near
  Ilmenau. He was writing at the same time to Frau von Stein: 'The sky
  is perfectly clear, and I am going out to enjoy the sunset. The view
  is great and simple--the sun down.'</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>Every tree top is at peace.</p>

      <p>E'en the rustling woods do cease</p>

      <p>Every sound;</p>

      <p>The small birds sleep on every bough.</p>

      <p>Wait but a moment--soon wilt thou</p>

      <p>Sleep in peace.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The hush of evening, the stilling of desire in the silence of
    the wood, the beautiful resolution of all discords in Nature's
    perfect concord, the naive and splendid pantheism of a soul which
    feels itself at one with the world--all this is not expressed in so
    many words in the <i>Night Song</i>; but it is all there, like the
    united voicesin a great symphony. (SCHURÉ.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The lines are full of that pantheism which not only brings subject
  and object, Mind and Nature, into symbolic relationship, but works
  them into one tissue. Taken alone with <i>The Fisher</i> and <i>To
  the Moon</i>, it would suffice to give him the first place as a poet
  of Nature.</p>

  <p>He was not only the greatest poet, but the greatest and most
  universal thinker of modern times. With him feeling and knowledge
  worked together, the one reaching its climax in the lyrics of his
  younger days, the other gradually moderating the fervour of passion,
  and, with the more objective outlook of age, laying greater stress
  upon science. His feeling <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg324" id=
  "pg324">324</a></span>for Nature, which followed an unbroken course,
  like his mental development generally, stands alone as a type of
  perfectly modern feeling, and yet no one, despite the many
  intervening centuries, stood so near both to Homer and to
  Shakespeare, and in philosophy to Spinoza.</p>

  <p>But because with Goethe poetry and philosophy were one, his
  pantheism is full of life and poetic vision, whilst that of the wise
  man of Amsterdam is severely mathematical and abstract. And the
  postulate of this pantheism was sympathy, harmony between Nature and
  the inner life. He felt himself a part of the power which upholds and
  encompasses the world. Nature became his God, love of her his
  religion. In his youth, in the period of <i>Werther, Ganymede</i>,
  and the first part of <i>Faust</i>, this pantheism was a nameless,
  unquenchable aspiration towards the divine--for wings to reach, like
  the rays of light, to unmeasured heights; as he said in the Swiss
  mountains, 'Into the limitless spaces of the air, to soar over
  abysses, and let him down upon inaccessible rocks.'</p>

  <p>After the Italian journeys science took the lead, the student of
  Nature supplanted the lover, even his symbolism took a more abstract
  and realistic form. But he never, even in old age, lost his love for
  the beauties of Nature, and, holding to Spinoza's fundamental ideas
  of the unchangeableness and eternity of Nature's laws, and the
  oneness of the Cosmos, he sought to think it out and base it upon
  scientific grounds, through the unbroken succession of animal and
  vegetable forms of life, the uniform 'formation and transformation of
  all organic Nature.' He wrote to Frau von Stein: 'I cannot express to
  you how legible the book of Nature is growing to me; my long spelling
  out has helped me. It takes effect now all of a sudden; my quiet
  delight is inexpressible; I find much that is new, but nothing that
  is unexpected--everything fits in and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg325" id="pg325">325</a></span>conforms, because I have no system,
  and care for nothing but truth for its own sake. Soon everything
  about living things will be clear to me.'<a href=
  "#m13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Poetic and scientific intuition were simultaneous with him, and
  their common bond was pantheism. This pantheism marked an epoch in
  the history of feeling. For Goethe not only transformed the unreal
  feeling of his day into real, described scenery, and inspired it with
  human feeling, and deciphered the beauty of the Alps, as no one else
  had done, Rousseau not excepted; but he also brought knowledge of
  Nature into harmony with feeling for her, and with his wonderfully
  receptive and constructive mind so studied the earlier centuries,
  that he gathered out all that was valuable in their feeling.</p>

  <p>As Goethe in Germany, so Byron in England led the feeling for
  Nature into new paths by his demoniac genius and glowing pantheism.
  Milton's great imagination was too puritan, too biblical, to allow
  her independent importance; he only assigned her a <i>rôle</i> in
  relation to the Deity. In fiction, too, she had no place; but, on the
  other hand, we find her in such melancholy, sentimental outpourings
  as Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Night, sable Goddess! from her ebon throne</p>

    <p>In rayless majesty now stretches forth</p>

    <p>Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumb'ring world...</p>

    <p>Creation sleeps. 'Tis as the gen'ral pulse</p>

    <p>Of life stood still, and Nature made a pause;</p>

    <p>An awful pause, prophetic of her end...etc.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There is a wealth of imagery and comparison amid Ossian's
  melancholy and mourning; clouds and mist are the very shadows of his
  struggling heroes. For instance:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>His spear is a blasted pine, his shield the rising moon. He sat
    on the shore like a cloud of mist on the rising hill.</p>

    <p>Thou art snow on the heath; thy hair is the mist of Cromla, when
    it curls on the hill, when it shines to <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg326" id="pg326">326</a></span>the beam of the
    west. Thy breasts are two smooth rocks seen from Branno of
    streams.</p>

    <p>As the troubled noise of the ocean when roll the waves on high;
    as the last peal of the thunder of heaven, such is the noise of
    battle.</p>

    <p>As autumn's dark storms pour from two echoing hills, towards
    each other approached the heroes.</p>

    <p>The clouds of night came rolling down, Darkness rests on the
    steeps of Cromla. The stars of the north arise over the rolling of
    Erin's waves; they shew their heads of fire through the flying mist
    of heaven. A distant wind roars in the wood. Silent and dark is the
    plain of death.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Wordsworth's influence turned in another direction. His real taste
  was pastoral, and he preached freer intercourse with Nature, glossing
  his ideas rather artificially with a theism, through which one reads
  true love of her, and an undeniable, though hidden, pantheism.</p>

  <p>In <i>The Influence of Natural Objects</i> he described how a life
  spent with Nature had early purified him from passion:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me</p>

    <p>With stinted kindness. In November days,</p>

    <p>When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made</p>

    <p>A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods</p>

    <p>At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,</p>

    <p>When by the margin of the trembling lake</p>

    <p>Beneath the gloomy hills, I homeward went</p>

    <p>In solitude, such intercourse was mine.</p>

    <p>'Twas mine among the fields both day and night,</p>

    <p>And by the waters all the summer long,</p>

    <p>And in the frosty season, when the sun</p>

    <p>Was set, and visible for many a mile,</p>

    <p>The cottage windows through the twilight blazed,</p>

    <p>I heeded not the summons....</p>
  </div>

  <p>Like Klopstock, he delighted in sledging</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i4">while the stars</p>

    <p>Eastward were sparkling bright, and in the west</p>

    <p>The orange sky of evening died away.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Far more characteristic of the man is the confession in <i>Tintern
  Abbey</i>: <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg327" id=
  "pg327">327</a></span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Nature then</p>

    <p>(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days</p>

    <p>And their glad animal movements all gone by)</p>

    <p>To me was all in all. I cannot paint</p>

    <p>What then I was. The sounding cataract</p>

    <p>Haunted me like a passion; the tall rock,</p>

    <p>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</p>

    <p>The colours and their forms, were then to me</p>

    <p>An appetite, a feeling and a love</p>

    <p>That had no need of a remoter charm</p>

    <p>By thought supplied, or any interest</p>

    <p>Unborrow'd from the eye.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Beautiful notes, to be struck again more forcibly by the frank
  pantheism of Byron.</p>

  <p>What Scott had been doing for Scotland,<a href=
  "#m14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> and Moore for Ireland, Wordsworth, with
  still greater fidelity to truth, tried to do for England and her
  people; in contrast to Byron and Shelley, who forsook home to range
  more widely, or Southey, whose <i>Thalaba</i> begins with an imposing
  description of night in the desert:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">How beautiful is night!</p>

    <p>A dewy freshness fills the silent air,</p>

    <p>No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain</p>

    <p>Breaks the serene of heaven;</p>

    <p>In full-orb'd glory yonder Moon divine</p>

    <p>Rolls through the dark blue depths.</p>

    <p>Beneath her steady ray</p>

    <p>The desert-circle spreads</p>

    <p>Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.</p>

    <p>How beautiful is night!</p>
  </div>

  <p>But all that previous English poets had done seemed harmless and
  innocent in comparison with Byron's revolutionary poetry. Prophecy in
  Rousseau became poetry in Byron.</p>

  <p>There was much common ground between these two passionate aspiring
  spirits, who never attained to Goethe's serenity. Both were
  melancholy, and fled from their fellows; both strove for perfect
  liberty and unlimited self-assertion; both felt with the wild and
  uproarious side of Nature, and found idyllic scenes marred by
  thoughts of mankind.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg328" id="pg328">328</a></span>
  Byron's turbulence never subsided; and his love for Nature,
  passionate and comprehensive as it was, was always 'sickled o'er'
  with misanthropy and pessimism, with the 'world-pain.'</p>

  <p>He turned to her first through disdain of his kind and love of
  introspection, and later on, when he was spurned by the London world
  which had been at his feet, and disdain grew into hatred and disgust,
  from a wish to be alone. But, as Boettger says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Though this heart, in which the whole universe is reflected, is
    a sick one, it has immeasurable depths, and an intensified spirit
    life which draws everything under its sway and inspires it, feeling
    and observing everything only as part of itself.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The basis of Byron's feeling for Nature was a revolutionary
  one--elementary passion. The genius which threw off stanza after
  stanza steeped in melody, was coupled with an unprecedented
  subjectivity and individualism. When the first part of <i>Childe
  Harold</i> came out, dull London society was bewitched by the music
  and novelty of this enthusiastic lyric of Nature, with its
  incomparable interweaving of scenery and feeling:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The sails were fill'd, and fair the light winds blew,</p>

    <p>As glad to waft him from his native home....</p>

    <p>But when the sun was sinking in the sea,</p>

    <p>He seized his harp...</p>

    <p>Adieu, adieu! my native shore</p>

    <p>Fades o'er the waters blue;</p>

    <p>The night winds sigh, the breakers roar,</p>

    <p>And shrieks the wild sea-mew;</p>

    <p>Yon sun that sets upon the sea</p>

    <p>We follow in his flight;</p>

    <p>Farewell awhile to him and thee,</p>

    <p>My native land, good-night!</p>
  </div>

  <p>He says of the beauty of Lusitania:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Oh Christ! it is a goodly sight to see</p>

    <p>What Heaven hath done for this delicious land.</p>

    <p>What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!</p>

    <p>What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!...</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg329" id=

    crown'd,</p>

    <p>The cork trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,</p>

    <p>The mountain moss, by scorching skies imbrown'd,</p>

    <p>The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep.</p>

    <p>The tender azure of the unruffled deep,</p>

    <p>The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,</p>

    <p>The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,</p>

    <p>The vine on high, the willow branch below,</p>

    <p>Mix'd in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Yet his spirit drives him away, 'more restless than the swallow in
  the skies.'</p>

  <p>The charm of the idyllic is in the lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>But these between, a silver streamlet glides....</p>

    <p>Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,</p>

    <p>And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,</p>

    <p>That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The beauty of the sea and night in this:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The moon is up; by Heaven a lovely eve!</p>

      <p>Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand....</p>

      <p>How softly on the Spanish shore she plays,</p>

      <p>Disclosing rock, and slope, and forest brown</p>

      <p>Distinct....</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Bending o'er the vessel's laving side</p>

      <p>To gaze on Dian's wave-reflected sphere.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He reflects that:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,</p>

    <p>To slowly trace the forest's shady scene....</p>

    <p>To climb the trackless mountain all unseen</p>

    <p>With the wild flock that never needs a fold,</p>

    <p>Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean,--</p>

    <p>This is not solitude; 'tis but to hold</p>

    <p>Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unroll'd.</p>

    <p>But 'midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men,</p>

    <p>To hear, to see, to feel, and to possess,</p>

    <p>And roam along, the world's tired denizen,</p>

    <p>With none who bless us, none whom we can bless ...</p>

    <p>This is to be alone--this, this is solitude.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His preference for wild scenery shews here:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Dear Nature is the kindest mother still,</p>

    <p>Though always changing, in her aspect mild;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg330" id=
    "pg330">330</a></span>From her bare bosom let me take my fill,</p>

    <p>Her never-wean'd, though not her favour'd child.</p>

    <p>O she is fairest in her features wild,</p>

    <p>Where nothing polish'd dares pollute her path;</p>

    <p>To me by day or night she ever smiled,</p>

    <p>Though I have mark'd her when none other hath,</p>

    <p>And sought her more and more, and loved her best in wrath.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He observes everything--now 'the billows' melancholy flow' under
  the bows of the ship, now the whole scene at Zitza:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Where'er we gaze, around, above, below,</p>

    <p>What rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!</p>

    <p>Rock, river, forest, mountain, all abound,</p>

    <p>And bluest skies that harmonize the whole;</p>

    <p>Beneath, the distant torrent's rushing sound</p>

    <p>Tells where the volumed cataract doth roll</p>

    <p>Between those hanging rocks, that shock yet please the soul.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is full of poetic vision:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Where lone Utraikey forms its circling cove,</p>

    <p>And weary waves retire to gleam at rest,</p>

    <p>How brown the foliage of the green hill's grove,</p>

    <p>Nodding at midnight o'er the calm bay's breast,</p>

    <p>As winds come lightly whispering from the west,</p>

    <p>Kissing, not ruffling, the blue deep's serene;--</p>

    <p>Here Harold was received a welcome guest;</p>

    <p>Nor did he pass unmoved the gentle scene,</p>

    <p>For many a job could he from Night's soft presence glean.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Feeling himself 'the most unfit of men to herd with man,' he is
  happy only with Nature:</p>

  Byron's feeling was thus, like Goethe's in <i>Werther</i> and
  <i>Faust</i>, a pantheistic sympathy. But there was this great
  difference between them--Goethe's mind passed through its period of
  storm and stress, and attained a serene and ripe vision; Byron's
  never did. Melancholy and misanthropy always mingled with his
  feelings; he was, in fact, the father of our modern 'world-pain.'</p>

  <p>Still more like a brilliant meteor that flashes and is gone was
  Shelley, the most highly strung of all modern lyrists. With him, too,
  love of Nature amounted to a passion; but it was with her remote
  aerial forms that he was most at home. His imagination, a cosmic one,
  revelling among the spheres, was like Byron's in its preference for
  the great, wide, and distant; but unlike his in giving first place to
  the serene and passionless. As Brandes says: 'In this familiarity
  with the great forms and movements of Nature, Shelley is like Byron;
  but like him as a fair genius is like a dark one, as Ariel is like
  the flame-bringing angel of the morning star.'</p>

  <p>We see his love for the sea, especially at rest, in the 'Stanzas
  written in dejection near Naples,' which contain the beautiful line
  which proved so prophetic of his death:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The sun is warm, the sky is clear,</p>

    <p>The waves are dancing fast and bright;</p>

    <p>Blue isles and snowy mountains wear</p>

    <p>The purple noon's transparent might....</p>

    <p>I see the deep's untrampled floor</p>

    <p>With green and purple sea-weeds strewn;</p>

    <p>I see the waves upon the shore</p>

    <p>Like light dissolved, in star showers thrown....</p>

    <p>Yet now despair itself is mild,</p>

    <p>Even as the winds and waters are;</p>

    <p>I could lie down like a tired child</p>

    <p>And weep away the life of care</p>

    <p>Which I have borne, and yet must bear,--</p>

    <p>Till death like sleep might steal on me,</p>

    <p>And I might feel in the warm air</p>

    <p>My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea</p>

    <p>Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg336" id="pg336">336</a></span> In
  his <i>Essay on Love</i>, speaking of the irresistible longing for
  sympathy, he says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In solitude, or in that deserted state when we are surrounded by
    human beings, and yet they sympathize not with us, we love the
    flowers, the grass, and the water and the sky. In the motion of the
    very leaves of spring, in the blue air, there is then found a
    secret correspondence with our heart. There is eloquence in the
    tongueless wind, and a melody in the flowing brooks and the
    rustling of the reeds beside them, which, by their inconceivable
    relation to something within the soul, awaken the spirits to a
    dance of breathless rapture, and bring tears of mysterious
    tenderness to the eyes, like the voice of one beloved singing to
    you alone.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As Brandes says: 'His pulses beat in secret sympathy with
  Nature's. He called plants and animals his dear sisters and brothers,
  and the words which his wife inscribed upon his tombstone in Rome,
  "cor cordium," are true of his relation to Nature also.'</p>

  <p><i>The Cloud</i>, with its marvellously vivid personification, is
  a perfect example of his genius.</p>

  <p>It gives the measure of his unlikeness to the more homekeeping
  imaginations of his contemporaries Wordsworth, Coleridge, Burns, and
  Moore; and at the same time to Byron, for here there are no morbid
  reflections; the poem is pervaded by a naive, childlike tone, such as
  one hears in the old mythologies.</p>

    <p>The triumphal arch through which I march,</p>

    <p>With hurricane, fire, and snow,</p>

    <p>When the Powers of the air are chained to my chair,</p>

    <p>Is the million-coloured bow;</p>

    <p>The Sphere-fire above its soft colours wove</p>

    <p>While the moist earth was laughing below.</p>

    <p>I am the daughter of Earth and Water,</p>

    <p>And the nursling of the Sky.</p>
  </div>

  <p>As Brandes puts it; When the cloud sings thus of the moon:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i14">When</p>

    <p>That orbed maiden with white fire laden,</p>

    <p>Whom Mortals call the Moon,</p>

    <p>Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor</p>

    <p>By the midnight breezes strewn;</p>

    <p>And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,</p>

    <p>Which only the angels hear,</p>

    <p>May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,</p>

    <p>The Stars peep behind her and peer.</p>
  </div>

  <p>or of--</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor eyes,</p>
  </div>

  <p>the reader is carried back, by dint of the virgin freshness of the
  poet's imagination, to the time when the phenomena of Nature were
  first moulded into mythology.</p>

  <p>This kinship to the myth is very clear in the finest of all his
  poems, the <i>Ode to the West Wind</i>, when the poet says to the
  wind:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,...</p>

    <p>Thou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion,</p>

    <p>Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed.</p>

    <p>Shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean.</p>

    <p>Angels of rain and lightning, there are spread</p>

    <p>On the blue surface of thine airy surge,</p>

    <p>Like the bright hair uplifted from the head</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg338" id=
    "pg338">338</a></span>Of some fierce Mænad, even from the dim
    verge</p>

    <p>Of the horizon to the zenith's height,</p>

    <p>The locks of the approaching storm.</p>
  </div>

  <p>He calls the wind the 'breath of Autumn's being,' the one</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed</p>

    <p>The winged seeds.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And cries to it:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;</p>

    <p>If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;</p>

    <p>A wave to pant beneath thy power and share</p>

    <p>The impulse of thy strength, only less free</p>

    <p>Than thou, O uncontrollable!...</p>

    <p>0 lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!</p>

    <p>I fall upon the thorns of life, I bleed!</p>

    <p>A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed</p>

    <p>One too like thee, tameless, and swift, and proud.</p>

    <p>Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is;</p>

    <p>What if my leaves are falling like its own?</p>

    <p>The tumult of thy mighty harmonies</p>

    <p>Will take from both a deep autumnal tone,</p>

    <p>Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,</p>

    <p>My spirit. Be thou me, impetuous one!</p>

    <p>Drive my dead thoughts over the universe,</p>

    <p>Like withered leaves, to quicken a new birth;</p>

    <p>And by the incantation of this verse,</p>

    <p>Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth</p>

    <p>Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!</p>

    <p>Be through my lips to unawakened earth</p>

    <p>The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,</p>

    <p>If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?</p>
  </div>

  <p>His poems are full of this power of inspiring all the elements
  with life, breathing his own feeling into them, and divining love and
  sympathy in them; for instance:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>The fountains mingle with the river,</p>

    <p>And the river with the ocean;</p>

    <p>The winds of heaven mix for ever</p>

    <p>With a sweet emotion....</p>

    <p>See the mountains kiss high heaven,</p>

    <p>And the waves clasp one another...</p>

    <p>And the sunlight clasps the earth,</p>

    <p>And the moonbeams kiss the sea.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg339" id=
  "pg339">339</a></span>and:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>I love all thou lovest,</p>

    <p>Spirit of Delight;</p>

    <p>The fresh earth in new leaves dressed,</p>

    <p>And the starry night,</p>

    <p>Autumn evening and the morn</p>

    <p>When the golden mists are born.</p>

    <p>I love snow and all the forms</p>

    <p>Of the radiant frost;</p>

    <p>I love waves and winds and storms--</p>

    <p>Everything almost</p>

    <p>Which is Nature's, and may be</p>

    <p>Untainted by man's misery.</p>
  </div>

  <p>To Goethe, Byron, and Shelley, this pantheism, universal love,
  sympathy with Nature in all her forms, was the base of feeling; but
  both of England's greatest lyrists, dying young, failed to attain
  perfect harmony of thought and feeling. There always remained a
  bitter ingredient in their poetry.</p>

  <p>Let us now turn to France.</p>

  <h4>LAMARTINE AND VICTOR HUGO</h4>

  <p>Rousseau discovered the beauty of scenery for France; St Pierre
  portrayed it poetically, not only in <i>Paul and Virginia</i>, but in
  <i>Chaumiére Indienne</i> and <i>Etudes de la Nature</i>. The science
  which these two writers lacked, Buffon possessed in a high degree;
  but he had not the power to delineate Nature and feeling in
  combination: he lacked insight into the hidden analogies between the
  movements of the mind and the phenomena of the outer world.
  Chateaubriand, on the contrary, had this faculty to its full modern
  extent. It is true that his ego was constantly to the fore, even in
  dealing with Nature, but his landscapes were full of sympathetic
  feeling. He had Rousseau's melancholy and unrest, and cared nothing
  for those 'oppressive masses,' mountains, except as backgrounds; but
  he was enthusiastic about the scenery which he saw in America, the
  virgin forests, and the Mississippi--above all, about the sea. His
  Réné, that life-like <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg340" id=
  "pg340">340</a></span>figure, half-passionate, half-<i>blasé</i>,
  measuring everything by himself, and flung hither and thither by the
  waves of passion, shewed a lover's devotion to the sea and to Nature
  generally.<a href="#m15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> 'It was not God whom I
  contemplated on the waves in the magnificence of His works: I saw an
  unknown woman, and the miracle of his smile, the beauties of the sky,
  seemed to me disclosed by her breath. I would have bartered eternity
  for one of her caresses. I pictured her to myself as throbbing behind
  this veil of the universe which hid her from my eyes. Oh! why was it
  not in my power to rend the veil and press the idealized woman to my
  heart, to spend myself on her bosom with the love which is the source
  of my inspiration, my despair, and my life?'</p>

  <p>In subjectivity and dreaminess both Chateaubriand and Lamartine
  were like the German romanticists, but their fundamental note was
  theism, not pantheism. The storm of the French Revolution, which made
  radical changes in religion, as in all other things, was followed by
  a reaction. Christianity acquired new power and inwardness, and
  Nature was unceasingly praised as the mirror of the divine idea of
  creation.</p>

  <p>In his <i>Génie du Christianisme</i>, Chateaubriand said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The true God, in entering into His Works, has given his
    immensity to Nature... there is an instinct in man, which puts him
    in communication with the scenes of Nature.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Lamartine was a sentimental dreamer of dreams, a thinker of lofty
  thoughts which lost themselves in the inexpressible. His
  <i>Meditations</i> shew his ardent though sad worship of Nature; his
  love of evening, moonlight, and starlight. For instance,
  <i>L'Isolement</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Ici gronde le fleuve aux vagues écumantes,</p>

    <p>Il serpente et s'enfonce en un lointain obscur:</p>

    <p>Là le lac immobile étend ses eaux dormantes</p>

    <p>Oò l'étoile du soir se lève dans l'azur.</p>

    <p>An sommet de ces monts couronnés de bois sombres,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg341" id=
    "pg341">341</a></span>Le crépuscule encore jette un dernier
    rayon;</p>

    <p>Et le char vaporeux de la reine des ombres</p>

    <p>Monte et blanchit déjà les bords de l'horizon.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Le Soir</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Le soir ramène le silence....</p>

    <p>Venus se lève à l'horizon;</p>

    <p>A mes pieds l'étoile amoureuse</p>

    <p>De sa lueur mystérieuse</p>

    <p>Blanchit les tapis de gazon.</p>

    <p>De ce hêtre au feuillage sombre</p>

    <p>J'entends frissonner les rameaux;</p>

    <p>On dirait autour des tombeaux</p>

    <p>Qu'on entend voltiger une ombre,</p>

    <p>Tout-à-coup, détaché des cieux,</p>

    <p>Un rayon de l'astre nocturne,</p>

    <p>Glissant sur mon front taciturne,</p>

    <p>Vient mollement toucher mes yeux.</p>

    <p>Doux reflet d'un globe de flamme</p>

    <p>Charmant rayon, que me veux-tu?</p>

    <p>Viens-tu dans mon sein abattu</p>

    <p>Porter la lumière à mon âme?</p>

    <p>Descends-tu pour me révéler</p>

    <p>Des mondes le divin mystére,</p>

    <p>Ces secrets cachés dans la sphère</p>

    <p>Où le jour va te rappeler?</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the thought of happy past hours, he questions the lake:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Un soir, t'en souvient-il, nous voguions en silence;</p>

    <p>On n'entendait au loin, sur l'onde et sous les cieux,</p>

    <p>Que le bruit des rameurs qui frappaient en cadence</p>

    <p>Tes flots harmonieux.</p>

    <p>O lac! rochers muets! grottes! forêt obscure!</p>

    <p>Vous que le temps épargne ou qu'il peut rajeunir</p>

    <p>Gardez de cette nuit, gardez, belle nature,</p>

    <p>Au moins le souvenir!...</p>

    <p>Que le vent qui gémit, le roseau qui soupire</p>

    <p>Que les parfums légers de ton air embaumé,</p>

    <p>Que tout ce qu'on entend, l'on voit, ou l'on respire,</p>

    <p>Tout dise: 'ils out aimés!</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>La Prière</i> has:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Le roi brillant du jour, se couchant dans sa gloire,</p>

      <p>Descend avec lenteur de son char de victoire;</p>

      <p>Conserve en sillons d'or sa trace dans les cieux,</p>

      <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg342" id=

      <p>Et le voile des nuits sur les monts se déplie.</p>

      <p>C'est l'heure, où la nature, un moment recueillie,</p>

      <p>Entre la nuit qui touche et le jour qui s'enfuit</p>

      <p>S'élève au créateur du jour et de la nuit,</p>

  <p>The decay of autumn corresponds to his own dolorous feelings:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Oui, dans ces jours d'automne où la nature expire,</p>

    <p>A ses regards voilés je trouve plus d'attraits;</p>

    <p>C'est l'adieu d'un ami, c'est le dernier sourire</p>

    <p>Des lèvres que la mort va fermer pour jamais.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is from <i>Ischia</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Le Soleil va porter le jour à d'autres mondes;</p>

    <p>Dans l'horizon désert Phébé monte sans bruit,</p>

    <p>Et jette, en pénétrant les ténébres profondes,</p>

    <p>Un voile transparent sur le front de la nuit.</p>

    <p>Voyez du haut des monts ses clartés ondoyantes</p>

    <p>Comme un fleuve de flamme inonder les coteaux,</p>

    <p>Dormir dans les vallons on glisser sur les pentes,</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg343" id=
    "pg343">343</a></span>Ou rejaillir au loin du sein brillant des
    eaux....</p>

    <p>Doux comme le soupir d'un enfant qui sommeille,</p>

    <p>Un son vague et plaintif se répand dans les airs....</p>

    <p>Mortel! ouvre ton âme à ces torrents de vie,</p>

    <p>Reçois par tous les sens les charmes de la nuit....</p>
  </div>

  <p>He sees the transitoriness of all earthly things reflected in
  Nature:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>L'onde qui baise ce rivage,</p>

    <p>De quoi se plaint-elle à ses bords?</p>

    <p>Pourquoi le roseau sur la plage, pourquoi le ruisseau sous
    l'ombrage,</p>

    <p>Rendent-ils de tristes accords?</p>

    <p>De quoi gémit la tourterelle? Tout naist, tout paise.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Such a depth of sympathy and dreamy dolorous reverie was new to
  France, but Rousseau had broken the ice, and henceforward feeling
  flowed freely. To Lamartine the theist, as to the pantheists Goethe,
  Shelley, and Byron, Nature was a friend and lover.</p>

  <p>Victor Hugo was of the same mind, but his poetry is clearer and
  more plastic than Lamartine's. We quote from his finest poems, the
  <i>Feuilles d'Automne</i>. He was a true lyrist, familiar both with
  the external life of Nature and the inner life of man. His beautiful
  'Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne' has the spirit of <i>Faust</i>. He
  imagines himself upon a mountain top, with earth on one side, the sea
  on the other; and there he hears two voices unlike any ever heard
  before:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>L'une venait des mers, chant de gloire! hymne heureux!</p>

    <p>C'était la voix des flots qui se parlaient entre eux....</p>

    <p>Or, comme je l'ai dit, l'Océan magnifique</p>

    <p>Epandait une voix joyeuse et pacifique</p>

    <p>Chantant comme la harpe aux temples de Sion,</p>

    <p>Et louait la beauté de la création.</p>
  </div>

  <p>while from the other voice:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Pleurs et cris! L'injure, l'anatheme....</p>

    <p>C'était la terre et l'homme qui pleuraient!...</p>

    <p>L'une disait, Nature! et l'autre, Humanité!</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg344" id="pg344">344</a></span>
  The personifications in this poem are beautiful. He, too, like
  Lamartine, loves sea and stars most of all. These verses from <i>Les
  Orientales</i> remind one of St Augustine:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>J'étais seul près des flots par une nuit d'étoiles,</p>

      <p>Pas un nuage aux cieux; sur les mers pas de voiles,</p>

      <p>Et les bois et les monts et toute la nature</p>

      <p>Semblaient interroger dans confus murmure</p>

      <p>Les flots des mers, les feux du ciel.</p>

      <p>Et les étoiles d'or, légions infinies,</p>

      <p>A voix haute, à voix basse, avec mille harmonies</p>

      <p>Disaient en inclinant leurs couronnes de feu,</p>

      <p>Et les flots bleus, que rien gouverne et n'arrête,</p>

      <p>Disaient en recourbant l'écume de leur crête:</p>

      <p>C'est le Seigneur Dieu, le Seigneur Dieu!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Parfois lorsque tout dort, je m'assieds plein de joie</p>

      <p>Sous le dôme étoilé qui sur nos fronts flamboie;</p>

      <p>J'écoute si d'en haut il tombe quelque bruit;</p>

      <p>Et l'heure vainement me frappe de son aile</p>

      <p>Quand je contemple ému cette fête eternelle</p>

      <p>Que le ciel rayonnant donne au monde la nuit!</p>

      <p>Souvent alors j'ai cru que ces soleils de flamme</p>

      <p>Dans ce monde endormi n'échauffaient que mon âme;</p>

      <p>Qu'à les comprendre seul j'étais prédestiné;</p>

      <p>Que j'étais, moi, vaine ombre obscure et taciturne,</p>

      <p>Le roi mystérieuse de la pompe nocturne;</p>

      <p>Que le ciel pour moi seul s'était illuminé!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The necessary condition of delight in Nature is very strikingly
  given:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Si vous avez en vous, vivantes et pressées,</p>

    <p>Un monde intérieur d'images, de pensées,</p>

    <p>De sentimens, d'amour, d'ardente passion</p>

    <p>Pour féconder ce monde, échangez-le sans cesse</p>

    <p>Avec l'autre univers visible qui vous presse!</p>

    <p>Mêlez toute votre âme à la création....</p>

    <p>Que sous nos doigts puissans exhale la nature,</p>

    <p>Cette immense clavier!</p>
  </div>

  <p>His lyrics are rich in fine scenes from Nature, unrolled in cold
  but stately periods, and the poetic intuition which always divines
  the spirit life brought him near to that pantheism which we find in
  all the greatest English and German poets of his time,<a href=
  "#m16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and which lay, too, at the root of German
  romanticism. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg345" id=
  "pg345">345</a></span></p>

  <h4>THE GERMAN ROMANTICISTS</h4>

  <p>Schiller did not possess the intrinsically lyrical genius of
  Goethe; his strength lay, not in song, but drama, and in a didactic
  form of epic--the song not of feeling, but of thought.</p>

  <p>Descriptions of Nature occur here and there in his epics and
  dramas; but his feeling for her was chiefly theoretic. Like his
  contemporaries, he passed through a sentimental period;
  <i>Evening</i> shews this, and <i>Melancholy, to Laura</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Laura, a sunrise seems to break</p>

    <p>Where'er thy happy looks may glow....</p>

    <p>Thy soul--a crystal river passing,</p>

    <p>Silver clear and sunbeam glassing,</p>

    <p>Mays into blossom sad autumn by thee:</p>

    <p>Night and desert, if they spy thee,</p>

    <p>To gardens laugh--with daylight shine,</p>

    <p>Lit by those happy smiles of thine!</p>
  </div>

  <p>With such ecstatic extravagances contrast the excellent
  descriptions of Nature full of objective life in his longer
  poems--for instance, the tumult of Charybdis and the unceasing rain
  in <i>The Diver</i>, evening in <i>The Hostage</i>, and landscape in
  <i>William Tell</i> and <i>The Walk</i>. In the last, as Julian
  Schmidt says, the ever varying scenery is made a 'frame for a kind of
  phenomenology of mankind.'</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Flowers of all hue are struggling into glow</p>

    <p>Along the blooming fields; yet their sweet strife</p>

    <p>Melts into one harmonious concord. Lo!</p>

    <p>The path allures me through the pastoral green</p>

    <p>And the wide world of fields! The labouring bee</p>

    <p>Hums round me, and on hesitating wing</p>

    <p>O'er beds of purple clover, quiveringly</p>

    <p>Hovers the butterfly. Save these, all life</p>

    <p>Sleeps in the glowing sunlight's steady sheen--</p>

    <p>E'en from the west no breeze the lull'd airs bring.</p>

    <p>Hark! in the calm aloft I hear the skylark sing.</p>

    <p>The thicket rustles near, the alders bow</p>

    <p>Down their green coronals, and as I pass,</p>

    <p>Waves in the rising wind the silvering grass;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg346" id=
    "pg346">346</a></span>Come! day's ambrosial night! receive me
    now</p>

    <p>Beneath the roof by shadowy beeches made</p>

    <p>Cool-breathing, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Schiller's interest in Nature was more a matter of reflection than
  direct observation; its real tendency was philosophical and ethical.
  He called Nature naive (he included naturalness in Nature); those who
  seek her, sentimental; but he overlooked (as we saw in an earlier
  chapter) the fact that antiquity did not always remain naive, and
  that not all moderns are sentimental.</p>

  <p>As Rousseau's pupil he drew a sharp distinction between Nature and
  Art, and felt happy in solitude where 'man with his torment does not
  come,' lying, as he says in <i>The Bride of Messina</i>, like a child
  on the bosom of Nature.</p>

  <p>In Schiller's sense of the word, perhaps no poet has been more
  sentimental about Nature than Jean Paul.</p>

  <p>He was the humorous and satirical idyllist <i>par excellence</i>,
  and laid the scenes of his romances in idyllic surroundings, using
  the trifling events of daily life to wonderful purpose. There is an
  almost oriental splendour in his pages, with their audacious
  metaphors and mixture of ideas. With the exception of Lake Maggiore
  in <i>Titan</i>, he gives no set descriptions of landscape; but all
  his references to it, all his sunrises and sunsets, are saturated
  with the temperament of his characters, and they revel in feeling.
  They all love Nature, and wander indefatigably about their own
  countryside, finding the reflection of their feelings in her. There
  is a constant interweaving of the human soul and the universe;
  therein lies his pantheistic trait. 'To each man,' he said,<a href=
  "#m17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> 'Nature appears different, and the only
  question is, which is the most beautiful? Nature is for ever becoming
  flesh for mankind; outer Nature takes a different form in each mind.'
  Certainly the nature of Jean Paul was different <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg347" id="pg347">347</a></span>from the Nature of
  other mortals. Was she more beautiful? He wrote of her in his usual
  baroque style, with a wealth of thought and feeling, and everywhere
  the sparkle of genius; but it is all presented in the strangest
  motley, as exaggerated and unenjoyable as can be. For example, from
  <i>Siebenkâs</i>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I appeared again then on the last evening of the year 1794, on
    the red waves of which so many bodies, bled to death, were borne
    away to the ocean of eternity.</p>

    <p>To the butterfly--proboscis of Siebenkäs, enough honey--cells
    were still open in every blue thistle-blossom of destiny.</p>

    <p>When they had passed the gate--that is to say, the
    un-Palmyra-like ruins of it--the crystal reflecting grotto of the
    August night stood open and shining above the dark green earth, and
    the ocean-calm of Nature stayed the wild storm of the human heart.
    Night was drawing and closing her curtain (a sky full of silent
    suns, not a breath of breeze moving in it) up above the world, and
    down beneath it the reaped corn stood in the sheaves without a
    rustle. The cricket with his one constant song, and a poor old man
    gathering snails for the snail pits, seemed to be the only things
    that dwelt in the far-reaching darkness.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When it was autumn in his heart:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Above the meadows, where all the flowers were withered and dead;
    above the fields, where the corn ears waved no more, floated dim
    phantom forms, all pale and wan, faint pictures of the past. Over
    the grand eternal woods and hills a biting mist was draped in
    clinging folds, as if all Nature, trembling into dust, must vanish
    in its wreaths.... But one bright thought pierced these dark fogs
    of Nature and the soul, turning them to a white gleaming mist, a
    dew all glittering with rainbow colours, and gently lighting upon
    flowers.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When his married life grew more unhappy, in December:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The heart of our sorrowful Firmian grew sadder yet, as he stood
    upon this cold, burnt-out hearth-place of Nature.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg348" id="pg348">348</a></span>
  and in spring</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>it seemed to him as if his life dwelt, not in a bodily heart,
    but in some warm and tender tear, as if his heavy-laden soul were
    expanding and breaking away through some chink in its prison, and
    melting into a tone of music, a blue ether wave.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And <i>Titan</i> expresses that inner enfranchisement which Nature
  bestows upon us:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Exalted Nature! when we see and love thee, we love our
    fellow-men more warmly, and when we must pity or forget them, thou
    still remainest with us, reposing before the moist eye like a
    verdant chain of mountains in the evening red. Ah! before the soul
    in whose sight the morning dew of its ideals has faded to a cold,
    grey drizzle ... thou remainest, quickening Nature, with thy
    flowers and mountains and cataracts, a faithful comforter; and the
    bleeding son of the gods, cold and speechless, dashes the drop of
    anguish from his eyes, that they may rest, far and clear, on thy
    volcanoes, and on thy springs and on thy suns.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is sunset in his abstruse artistic handling:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The sun sinks, and the earth closes her great eye like that of a
    dying god. Then smoke the hills like altars; out of every wood
    ascends a chorus; the veils of day, the shadows, float around the
    enkindled transparent tree-tops, and fall upon the gay, gem-like
    flowers. And the burnished gold of the west throws back a dead gold
    on the east, and tinges with rosy light the hovering breast of the
    tremulous lark--the evening bell of Nature.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And this sunrise:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The flame of the sun now shot up ever nearer to the kindled
    morning clouds; at length in the heavens, in the brooks and ponds,
    and in the blooming cups of dew, a hundred suns rose together,
    while a thousand colours floated over the earth, and one pure
    dazzling white broke from the sky. It seemed as if an almighty
    earthquake had forced up from the ocean, yet dripping, a
    new-created blooming plain, stretching out beyond the bounds of
    vision, with all its young instincts and powers; the fire of earth
    glowed beneath the roots of the immense hanging garden, and the
    fire of heaven poured down its flames and burnt the colours into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg349" id="pg349">349</a></span>the
    mountain summits and the flowers. Between the porcelain towers of
    white mountains the coloured blooming heights stood as thrones of
    the Fruit-Goddess; over the far-spread camp of pleasure
    blossom-cups and sultry drops were pitched here and there like
    peopled tents; the ground was inlaid with swarming nurseries of
    grasses and little hearts, and one heart detached itself after
    another with wings, or fins, or feelers, from the hot breeding-cell
    of Nature, and hummed and sucked and smacked its little lips, and
    sung: and for every little proboscis some blossom-cup of; joy was
    already open. The darling child of the infinite mother, man, alone
    stood with bright joyful eyes upon the market-place of the living
    city of the sun, full of brilliance and noise, and gazed,
    delighted, around him into all its countless streets; but his
    eternal mother rested veiled in immensity, and only by the warmth
    which went to his heart did he feel that he was lying upon
    hers.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For very overflow of thought and imagery and ecstasy of feeling,
  Jean Paul never achieved a balanced beauty of expression.</p>

  <p>The ideal classic standard which Winckelmann and Lessing had laid
  down--simple and plastic, calm because objective, crystal-clear in
  thought and expression--and which Goethe and Schiller had sought to
  realize and imbue with modern ideas, was too strictly limited for the
  Romanticists. Hyperion's words expressed their taste more accurately:
  'O, man is a god when he dreams, a beggar when he thinks!' and they
  laid stress upon restless movement, fantastic, highly-coloured
  effects, a crass subjectivity, a reckless licence of the
  imagination.</p>

  <p>Actual and visible things were disregarded; they did not accord
  with this claim for infinity and the nebulous, for exploring the
  secret depths of the soul.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps a necessary reaction from Goethe's classicism; but
  it passed like a bad dream, after tending, thanks to its
  heterogeneous elements, now to the mediæval period, now to that of
  Storm and Stress, and now to Goethe, Herder, and <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg350" id="pg350">350</a></span>Winckelmann. It
  certainly contained germs of good, which have grown and flourished in
  our own day.</p>

  <p>In keeping with its whole character, the Romantic feeling for
  Nature was subjective and fantastic to excess, mystically
  enthusiastic, often with a dreamy symbolism at once deep and naive;
  its inmost core was pantheistic, with a pantheism shading off
  imperceptibly into mysticism.</p>

  <p>After <i>Werther</i>, there is perhaps no work of modern fiction
  in which Nature plays so artistic a part as in Holderlin's
  <i>Hyperion</i>.</p>

  <p>Embittered by life's failure to realize his ideals, he cries: 'But
  thou art still visible, sun in the sky! Thou art still green, sacred
  earth! The streams still rush to the sea, and shady trees rustle at
  noon. The spring's song of joy sings my mortal thoughts to sleep. The
  abundance of the universe nourishes and satiates my famished being to
  intoxication.'</p>

  <p>This mystical pantheism could not be more clearly expressed than
  here:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>O blessed Nature! I know not how it happens when I lift my eyes
    to your beauty; but all the joy of the sky is in the tears which I
    shed before you--a lover before the lady of his love. When the soft
    waves of the air play round my breast, my whole being is speechless
    and listens. Absorbed in the blue expanse, I often look up to the
    ether and down to the holy sea; and it seems as if a kindred spirit
    opened its arms to me, as if the pain of loneliness were lost in
    the divine life. To be one with all that lives, in blessed
    self-forgetfulness to return to the All of Nature, that is the
    height of thought and bliss--the sacred mountain height, the place
    of eternal rest, where noon loses its sultriness and thunder its
    voice, and the rough sea is like the waves in a field of wheat.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To such feeling as this the actualities are but fetters, hindering
  aspiration.</p>

  <p>'O, if great Nature be the daughter of a father, is the daughter's
  heart not his heart? Is not he her deepest feeling? But have I found
  it? Do I know it?'</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg351" id="pg351">351</a></span> He
  tries to discern the 'soul of Nature,' hears 'the melody of morning
  light begin with soft notes.' He says to the flower, 'You are my
  sister,' and to the springs, 'We are of one race': he finds symbolic
  resemblance between his heart and all the days and seasons: he feels
  the beauty of the 'land like paradise,' while scarcely ever, except
  in the poem <i>Heidelberg</i>, giving a clear sketch of scenery. A
  number of fine comparisons from Nature are scattered through his
  writings <a href="#m18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>The caresses of the charming breezes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>She light, clear, flattering sea.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

      <p>lives in us with fiery force, present everywhere immortal.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Earth, 'one of the flowers of the sky.'</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Beauty, that 'which is one and all.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He describes his love in a mystical form:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We were but one flower, and our souls lived in each other as
    flowers do, when they love and hide their joy within a closed
    calyx.... The clear starry night had now become my element, for the
    beautiful life of my love grew in the stillness as in the depths of
    earth gold grows mysteriously.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He delights 'thus to drink the joy of the world out of one cup
  with the lady of his love.'</p>

  <p>'Yea, man is a sun, seeing all and transfiguring all when he
  loves; and when he does not love, he is like a dark dwelling in which
  a little smelly lamp is burning.' All this is soft and feminine, but
  it has real poetic charm.</p>

  <p>Beautiful too, though sad and gloomy, is his <i>Song of
  Fate</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="i2">Nowhere may man abide,</p>

    <p>But painfully from hour to hour</p>

    <p>He stumbles blindly on to the unknown,</p>

    <p>As water falls from rock to rock</p>

    <p class="i2">The long year through.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg352" id="pg352">352</a></span>
  His pantheism finds expression in the odes--in <i>To Nature</i>, for
  instance:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Since my heart turneth upward to the sun</p>

    <p class="i2">As one that hears her voice,</p>

    <p>Hailing the stars as brothers, and the spring</p>

    <p class="i2">As melody divine;</p>

    <p>Since in the breath that stirs the wood thy soul,</p>

    <p class="i2">The soul of joy, doth move</p>

    <p>On the still waters of my heart--therefore,</p>

    <p class="i2">O Nature! these are golden days to me!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Tieck, too, was keenly alive to Nature. Spring<a href=
  "#m19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>Look all around thee how the spring advances!</p>

    <p>New life is playing through the gay green trees!</p>

    <p>See how in yonder bower the light leaf dances</p>

    <p>To the bird's tread and to the quivering breeze!</p>

    <p>How every blossom in the sunlight glances!</p>

    <p>The winter frost to his dark cavern flees,</p>

    <p>And earth, warm wakened, feels through every vein</p>

    <p>The kindling influence of the vernal rain.</p>

    <p>Now silvery streamlets, from the mountain stealing,</p>

    <p>Dance joyously the verdant vales along;</p>

    <p>Cold fear no more the songster's tongue is sealing,</p>

    <p>Down in the thick dark grove is heard his song.</p>

    <p>And all their bright and lovely hues revealing,</p>

    <p>A thousand plants the field and forest throng;</p>

    <p>Light comes upon the earth in radiant showers,</p>

    <p>And mingling rainbows play among the flowers.</p>
  </div>

  <p>All his writings seem intoxicated with Nature. The hero of his
  novel <i>William Lovell</i>, scamp though he is, a man of criminal
  egotism whose only law is licence, is deeply in love with Nature.</p>

  <p>He wrote from Florence:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Nature refreshes my soul with her endless beauty. I am often
    full of enthusiasm at the thousand charms of Nature and Art ... at
    last my longing to travel to wonderful distant places is satisfied.
    Even as a child, when I stood outside my father's country-house,
    and gazed at the distant mountains and discovered a windmill on the
    very line of the horizon, it seemed to beckon me as it turned, my
    blood pulsed more quickly, my mind flew to distant regions, a
    strange longing often filled my eyes with tears.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pg353" id="pg353">353</a></span>
    Often it seems to me as if the enigma in ourselves were about to be
    unriddled, as if we were suddenly to see the transformation of all
    our feelings and strange experiences. Night surrounded me with a
    hundred terrors, the transparent moonlight sky was like a crystal
    dome overhead--in this world the most unusual feelings were as
    shadows.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>'Franz Sternbald' had the same intoxicated feeling for Nature:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I should like to fill the whole world with songs of love, to
    move moonrise and sunrise to echo back my joys and sorrows; and
    trees, twigs, leaves, grasses to catch the melody and all repeat my
    music with a thousand tongues.<a href=
    "#m20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To the Romantic School, Music and Nature were a passion; they
  longed to resolve all their feelings, like Byron, at one flash, into
  music. 'For thought is too distant.' Night and the forest, moonlight
  and starlight, were in all their songs.</p>

  <p>There is a background of landscape all through <i>Franz
  Sternbald's Wanderings</i>.</p>

  <p>In the novels of the eighteenth century landscape had had no
  place; Hermes once gave a few lines to sunset, but excused it as an
  extravagance, and begged readers and critics not to think that he
  only wanted to fill up the page.</p>

  <p>Rousseau altered this; Sophie la Roche, in her
  <i>Freundschaftlichen Frauenzimmerbriefen</i>, introduced ruins,
  moonlight scenery, hills, vales, and flowering hedges, etc., into
  scenes of thought and feeling; and most of all, Goethe in
  <i>Werther</i> tunes scenery and soul to one key. In his later
  romances he avoided descriptions of scenery. Jean Paul, like Tieck in
  <i>Franz Sternbald</i>, never spares us one sunset or sunrise. Some
  of Tieck's concise descriptions are very telling, like Theodore
  Storm's at the present day:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Rosy light quivered on the blades of grass, and morning moved in
    waves along them.</p>

    <p>The redder the evening grew, the heavier became his dreams; the
    darkened trees, the shadows lengthening <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg354" id="pg354">354</a></span>across the
    fields, the smoke from the roofs of a little village, and the stars
    coming into view one by one in the sky--all this moved him deeply,
    moved him to a wistful compassion for himself.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As Franz wanders about the wood:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>He observes the trees reflected in a neighbouring pond. He had
    never looked at landscape with this pleasure, it had never been
    given to him to discern the various colours and their shadows, the
    charm of the stillness, the effect of the foliage, as now in the
    clear water. Till now he had never drawn a landscape, only looked
    at it as a necessary adjunct to many historical pictures, had never
    felt that lifeless Nature could herself compose something whole and
    complete in itself, and so worthy to be represented.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Tieck's shorter stories, fairy tales and others, shew taste for
  the mysterious and indefinite aspects of Nature--reflections in
  water, rays of light, cloud forms:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>They became to him the most fitting characters in which to
    record that indefinite inexpressible feeling which gave its special
    colour to his spiritual life.<a href="#m21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The pantheism of Boehme, with whom he was closely associated,
  always attracted him, and in Jena he came under the influence of
  Steffens, and also of Schelling, whose philosophy of Nature called
  Nature a mysterious poem, a dreaming mind. This mind it became the
  chief aim of Novalis, as well as Tieck, to decipher.</p>

  <p>From simple descriptions of Nature he went on to read mystic
  meanings into her, seeking, psychologically in his novels and
  mystically in his fairy tales, to fathom the connection between
  natural phenomena and elementary human feeling. <i>Blond Egbert</i>
  was the earliest example of this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Night looked sullenly through the windows, and the trees without
    rustled in the wet cold ... the moon looked fitfully through breaks
    in the driving clouds.<a href="#m22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the same book Bertha describes the horror of <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg355" id="pg355">355</a></span>loneliness, the
  vague longings, and then the overwhelming delight in new impressions,
  which seized her when she fled from home as a child and lost herself
  among the mountains.</p>

  <p><i>The Runenberg</i> gives in a very powerful way the idea of the
  weird fascination which the subterranean powers were supposed to
  exert over men, alluring and befooling them, and rousing their thirst
  for gold.</p>

  <p>The demoniacal elements in mountain scenery, its crags and
  abysses, are contrasted with idyllic plains. The tale is sprinkled
  over with descriptions of Nature, which give it a fairy-like
  effect.<a href="#m23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The most extraordinary product of this School was Novalis. With
  him everything resolved itself into presentiment, twilight, night,
  into vague longings for a vague distant goal, which he expressed by
  the search for 'the blue flower.' This is from <i>Heinrich von
  Ofterdingen</i>:</p>

  <p>'The cheerful pageant of the glorious evening rocked him in soft
  imaginings; the flower of his heart was visible now and then as by
  sheet lightning.' He looked at Nature with the mystic's eye, and
  described her fantastically:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I am never tired of looking minutely at the different plants.
    Growing plants are the direct language of the earth; each new leaf,
    each remarkable flower, is a mystery which projects itself, and
    because it cannot move with love and longing, nor attain to words,
    is a dumb, quiet plant. When in solitude one finds such a flower,
    does it not seem as if all around it were brightened, and, best of
    all, do not the little feathered notes around it remain near? One
    could weep for joy, and there, far from the world, stick hands and
    feet into the earth, to take root, and never more leave so
    delightful a spot. This green mysterious carpet of love is drawn
    over the whole earth.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is not surprising that night should attract this unnaturally
  excited imagination most of all:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Sacred, inexpressible, mysterious Night, delicious <span class=
    "pagenum"><a name="pg356" id="pg356">356</a></span>balsam drops
    from thy hands, from the poppy sheaf; thou upliftest the heavy
    wings of the Spirit.<a href="#m24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Night and death are delight and bliss.</p>

  <p>The fairy-like tale of <i>Hyacinth and Little Rose,</i> with its
  charming personifications, is refreshing after all this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The violet told the strawberry in confidence, she told her
    friend the gooseberry, who never ceased to jeer when Hyacinth went,
    so the whole garden and wood soon knew it, and when Hyacinth went
    out, voices from all sides cried out, 'Little Rose is my
    favourite.' When he goes into the wide world to find the land of
    Isis, he asks the way of the animals, and of springs, rocks, and
    trees, and the flowers smile at him, the springs offer him a fresh
    drink, and there is wonderful music when he comes home. 'O that men
    could understand the music of Nature!' cries the listener in the
    tale. Then follows a description of 'the sweet passion for the
    being of Nature and her enchanting raptures,' and the charm of the
    poetic imagination which finds 'a great sympathy with man's heart'
    in all the external world. For example, in the breath of wind,
    which 'with a thousand dark and dolorous notes seems to dissolve
    one's quiet grief into one deep melodious sigh of all Nature.'</p>

    <p>'And am I myself other than the stream when I gaze gloomily down
    into its waters and lose my thoughts in its flow?' And in ecstasy
    the youth exclaims: 'Whose heart does not leap for joy, when he
    feels Nature's innermost life in its fulness, when that powerful
    feeling, for which language has no other name than love and bliss,
    spreads like a vapour through his being, and he sinks, palpitating,
    on the dark alluring breast of Nature, and his poor self is lost in
    the overwhelming waves of joy?'<a href=
    "#m25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here we have the key to the romantic feeling for Nature--communion
  of the soul with Nature in a twilight mood of dreamy absorption.</p>

  <p>Yet amidst all this, real delight in romantic scenery was not
  quite lacking: witness Hulsen's<a href="#m26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
  <i>Observations on Nature on a Journey through Switzerland</i>; and
  the genuine lyric of Nature, untainted by mystic and sickly
  influences, was still to be heard, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "pg357" id="pg357">357</a></span>as in Eichendorff's beautiful songs
  and his <i>Tautgenichts</i>.</p>

  <p>The Romantic School, in fact, far as it erred from the path, did
  enlarge the life of feeling generally, and with that, feeling for
  Nature, and modern literature is still bound to it by a thousand
  threads.</p>

  <p>Our modern rapture has thus been reached by a path which, with
  many deviations in its course, has come to us from a remote past, and
  is still carrying us farther forward.</p>

  <p>Its present intensity is due to the growth of science, for
  although feeling has become more realistic and matter-of-fact in
  these days of electricity and the microscope, love for Nature has
  increased with knowledge. Science has even become the investigator of
  religion, and the pantheistic tendency of the great poets has passed
  into us, either in the idea of an all-present God, or in that of
  organic force working through matter--the indestructible active
  principle of life in the region of the visible. Our explorers combine
  enthusiasm for Nature with their tireless search for truth--for
  example, Humboldt, Haeckel, and Paul Güssfeldt; and though, as the
  shadow side to this light, travelling and admiration of Nature have
  become a fashion, yet who nowadays can watch a great sunset or a
  storm over the sea, and remain insensible to the impression?</p>

  <p>Landscape painting and poetry shew the same deviations from the
  straight line of development as in earlier times. Our garden craft,
  like our architecture, is eclectic; but the English park style is
  still the most adequate expression of prevalent taste: spaces of turf
  with tree groups, a view over land or sea, gradual change from garden
  to field; to which has been added a wider cultivation of foreign
  plants. In landscape painting the zigzag course is very marked:
  landscapes such as Bocklin's, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg358"
  id="pg358">358</a></span>entirely projected by the imagination and
  corresponding to nothing on earth, hang together in our galleries
  with the most faithful studies from Nature. It is the same with
  literature. In fiction, novels which perpetuate the sentimental
  rhapsodies of an early period, and open their chapters with forced
  descriptions of landscape, stand side by side with the masterly work
  of great writers--for example, Spielhagen, Wilhelmine von Hillern,
  and Theodore Storm.</p>

  <p>In poetry, the lyric of Nature is inexhaustible. Heine, the
  greatest lyrist after Goethe, though his poetry has, like the Nixie,
  an enchantingly fair body with a fish's tail, wrote in the <i>Travels
  in the Harz</i>: 'How infinitely blissful is the feeling when the
  outer world of phenomena blends and harmonizes with the inner world
  of feeling; when green trees, thoughts, birds' songs, sweet
  melancholy, the azure of heaven, memory, and the perfume of flowers,
  run together and form the loveliest of arabesques.'</p>

  <p>But his delight in Nature was spoilt by irony and straining after
  effect--for example, in <i>The Fig Tree</i>; and although <i>The
  Lotos Flower</i> is a gem, and the <i>North Sea Pictures</i> shew the
  fine eye of a poet who, like Byron and Shelley, can create myths, his
  personifications as a whole are affected, and his personal feeling is
  forced upon Nature for the sake of a witty effect.</p>

  <p>Every element of Nature has found skilled interpreters both in
  poetry and painting, and technical facility and truth of
  representation now stand on one level with the appreciation of her
  charms. <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg359" id=

  shady depths of forests, on towering mountain tops, or on the banks
  of great rivers, one sees the ruins or the still inhabited buildings
  which once served as the dwellings of the monks who, with the cross
  as their only weapon, were the pioneers of our modern culture. Their
  flight from the life of traffic and bustle in the larger towns was by
  no means a flight from the beauties of Nature.' The last statement is
  only partly true. In the prime of the monastic era the beauties of
  Nature were held to be a snare of the devil. Still, in choosing a
  site, beauty of position was constantly referred to as an auxiliary
  motive. 'Bernhard loved the valley,' 'but Bernhard chose mountains,'
  are significant phrases.</p>

  remorse, he descends the mountain without another word. The poor
  fellow had given himself up to innocent enjoyment for a moment,
  without thinking of the welfare of his soul, and instead of gloomy
  introspection, had looked into the enticing outer world. Western
  humanity was so morbid at that time, that the consciousness of having
  done this was enough to cause painful inner conflict to a man like
  Petrarch--a man of refined feeling, and scientific, though not a deep
  thinker.' Even granting this, which is too tragically put, the world

  this in beauty. It is everywhere washed by many rivers, and small

  <p><a name="i12" id="i12">12</a>: Fred Cohn, '<i>Die Gärten in alter
  und neuer Zeit,' D. Rundschau</i> 18, 1879. In Italy in the sixteenth
  century there was a change to this extent, that greenery was no
  longer clipt, but allowed to grow naturally, and the garden
  represented the transition from palace to landscape, from bare
  architectural forms to the free creations of Nature. The passion for
  flowers--the art of the pleasure garden, flourished in Holland and
  Germany. (Falke.)</p>

  <p><a name="i13" id="i13">13</a>: W.H. Riehl states (<i>Kulturstudien
  aus drei Jahrhunderten</i>) that Berlin, Augsburg, Leipzig,
  Darmstadt, and Mannheim were described in the seventeenth century as
  having 'very fine and delightful positions'; and the finest parts of
  the Black Forest, Harz and Thuringian mountains as 'very desolate,'
  deserted, and monotonous, or, at best, as not particularly pleasant
  scenery. If only a region were flat and treeless, a delicious
  landscape could be charmed out of it. Welcker, Court physician at
  Hesse Cassel, describing Schlangenbad in 1721, said that it lay in a
  desolate, unpleasing district, where nothing grew but foliage and
  grass, <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg365" id=
  "pg365">365</a></span>but that through ingenious planting of clipt
  trees in lines and cross lines, some sort of artistic effect had been
  produced. Clearly the principles of French garden-craft had become a
  widely accepted dogma of taste. Riehl contrasts the periwig period
  with the mediæval, and concludes that the mediæval backgrounds of
  pictures implied feeling for the wild and romantic. He says: 'In the
  Middle Ages the painters chose romantic jagged forms of mountains and
  rocks for backgrounds, hence the wild, bare, and arid counted as a
  prototype of beautiful scenery, while some centuries later such forms
  were held to be too rustic and irregular for beauty.' One cannot
  entirely agree with this. He weakens it himself in what follows. 'It
  was not a real scene which rose Alp-like before their mind's eye, but
  an imaginary and sacred one; their fantastic, romantic ideal called
  for rough and rugged environment': and adds, arguing in a circle,
  'Their minds passed then to real portraiture of Nature, and decided
  the landscape eye of the period.' My own opinion is that the
  loftiness of the 'heroic' mountain backgrounds seemed suitable for
  the sacred subjects which loomed so large and sublime in their own
  minds, and that these backgrounds did not reveal their ideal of
  landscape beauty, nor 'a romantic feeling for Nature,' nor 'a taste
  for the romantic,' nor yet a wondrous change of view in the periwig
  period.</p>

  him upon some limestone rock-work; white and yellow jasmine grew
  round, and laurels and myrtles hung down over his head. Here he would
  rest when he walked in the sun; on his left was a mossy Ara, a little

  amusing.</p>

  <p><a name="l12" id="l12">12</a>: Laprade adduces little of
  importance in his book <i>Le Sentiment de la Nature</i> (2nd
  edition), the first volume of which I have dealt with elsewhere. I
  have little in common with Laprade, although he is the only writer
  who has treated the subject comprehensively and historically. His
  standpoint is that of Catholic theology; he never separates feeling
  for Nature from religion, and is severe upon unbelievers. The book is
  well written, and in parts clever, but only touches the surface and
  misses much. His position is thus laid down: 'Le vrai sentiment de la
  Nature, le seul poétique, le seul fécond et puissant, le seul
  innocent de tout danger, est celui qui ne sépare jamais l'idée des
  choses visibles de la pensée de Dieu.' He accounts for the lack of
  any important expressions of feeling for Nature in French classics
  with: 'Le génie de la France est le génie de l'action.' and 'L'âme
  humaine est le but de la poésie.' He recognizes that even with
  Fénélon 'la Nature reste à ses yeux comme une simple décoration du
  drame que l'homme y joue, le poëte en lui ne la regarde jamais à
  travers les yeux du mystique.' Of the treatment of Nature in La
  Fontaine's Fables, he says: 'Ce n'est pas peindre la Nature, c'est
  l'abolir'; and draws this conclusion: 'Le sentiment de l'infini est
  absent de la poésie du dix-septième siècle aussi bien que le
  sentiment de la Nature'; and again: 'L'esprit général du dix-huitième
  siècle est la négation même de la poésie ... l'amour de la Nature
  n'était guerre autre <span class="pagenum"><a name="pg369" id=
  "pg369">369</a></span>chose qu'une haine déguisée et une déclaration
  de guerre a la société et a la réligion. Il n'y a pai trace du
  sentiment légitime et profond qui attire l'artiste et le poëte vers
  les splendeurs de la création, révélatrices du monde invisible. Ne
  demandez pas an dix-huitème siècle la poésie de la Nature, pas plus
  que celle du coeur.' Buffon shews 'l'état poétique des sciences de la
  Nature,' but his brilliant prose painting lacks 'la présence de Dieu,
  la révélation de l'infini les harmonies de l'âme et de la Nature
  n'existent pas pour Buffon.... plus de la rhétorique que de vrai
  sentiment de la Nature.'</p>

  die Schönheit der Nätur nebst desselben moralischen Betrachtungen
  über besondere Gegenstände der Naturlehre</i> is typical. Charites
  describes his conversion to the love of Nature by his friend
  Eukrates. Eukrates woke him at dawn and led him to a hill close by,
  as the sun rose. The fresh air, the birds' songs, and the wide
  landscape move him, and Eukrates points out that the love of Nature
  is the 'most natural of pleasures,' making <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="pg370" id="pg370">370</a></span>the labourer so
  happy that he forgets servitude and misery, and sings at his work.
  'This pleasure is always new to us, and the heart, provided it be not
  possessed by vanity or stormy passions, lies always open to it. Do
  you not know that they who are in trouble, and, above all, they who
  are in love, find their chief relief here? Is not a sick man better
  cheered by sunshine than by any other refreshment?' Then he points
  out Nature's harmonies and changes of colour, and warns Charites to
  avoid the storms of the passions. 'Yonder brook is a picture of our
  soul; so long as it runs quietly between its banks, the water is
  clear and grass and flowers border it; but when it swells and flows
  tumultuously, all this ornament is torn away, and it becomes turbid.
  To delight in Nature the mind must be free.... She is a sanctity only
  approached by pure souls.... As only the quiet stream shews the sky
  and the objects around, so it is only on quiet souls that Nature's
  pictures are painted; ruffled water reflects nothing.' He waxes
  eloquent about birds' songs, flowers, and brooks, and wanders by the
  hour in the woods, 'all his senses open to Nature's impressions,'
  which are 'rays from that source of all beauty, the sight of which
  will one day bless the soul.' His friend is soon convinced that
  Nature cannot be overpraised, and that her art is endlessly
  great.</p>

  c'est qu'il excelle à peindre le monde extérieur et le coeur humain
  l'un par l'autre, qu'il mêle les images de l'univers visible à
  l'expression des sentiments intimes, de manière à n'en former qu'un
  seul tissu.... Tous les éléments d'un objet d'une situation
  apparaissent à la fois, et dans leur harmonie, essentielle à cet
  incomparable esprit.' He is astonished at the symbolism in
  <i>Werthtr</i>: 'Chaque lettre répond à la saison ou elle est
  écrite.... l'idee et l'image s'identifient dans un fait suprême, dans
  un cri; il se fait entre l'émotion intime et l'impression du dehors
  une sorte de fusion.' And despite Goethe's Greek paganism and
  pantheism, he declares: 'Le nom de Goethe marque une de ces grandes
  dates, une de ces grandes révolutions de la poésie--la plus grande,
  nous le croyons, depuis Homer.' ... 'Goethe <span class=

  solitude ... it grew darker ... the birds of night began to shoot
  with fitful wing along their mazy courses ... unthinkingly he pulled
  a straggling root from the earth, and on the instant heard with
  affright a stifled moan underground, which winded downwards in
  doleful tones, and died plaintively away in the deep distance. The
  sound went through his inmost heart; it seized him as if he had

  expiring in its agony.' (Runenberg.)</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
