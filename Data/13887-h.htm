<h2><!-- Page 9 --><a name='Page_9'></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<br>


<p>This book is written with the object of laying before the public
a cookery book which will be useful not only to vegetarians, but
also to flesh eaters, who are often at a loss for recipes for
non-flesh dishes. Nowadays most people admit that "too much meat is
eaten"; but when the housewife tries to put before her family or
friends a meal in which meat is to be conspicuous by its absence,
she is often at a loss how to set about it.</p>

<p>Vegetarians also frequently stay with non-vegetarian friends, or
lodge with others who do not understand how to provide for them.
For such this book will especially prove useful, for in it will be
found a set of thirty menus, one for each day in a month, giving
suitable recipes with quantities for one person only. Throughout
this book it will be found that the use of wholemeal has been
introduced in the place of white flour. Those persons who do not
care to follow the hygienic principle in its entirety can easily
substitute white flour if preferred. The recipes have been written
bearing in mind the necessity for a wholesome diet; and they will
be found to be less rich than those in most of the cookery books
published. Should any one wish to make the dishes richer, it can
easily be done by an addition of butter, eggs, or cream.</p>

<p>Let me draw the attention of vegetarians to the use of soaked
sago in many dishes. This is a farinaceous food which should be
used much more largely in vegetarian cookery than it is. Thoroughly
soaked sago should be used in all dishes, savouries or sweets, in
which a substitute for suet is required to lighten the mixture;
that is, in boiled savouries or sweets which are largely made of
wholemeal, as, for instance, in vegetable haggis, roly-poly
pudding, and all fruit or vegetable puddings which are boiled in a
paste. When soaked sago is used (taking a teacupful of dry sago to
two breakfastcupfuls of meal) a light paste will be obtained which
would mislead any meat eater into the belief that suet or, at any
rate, baking powder had been used. Baking powder, tartaric acid,
soda and bicarbonate of soda, are all most injurious to the system,
and these chemicals have been left out of this book entirely. In
breads and cakes I have used a small quantity of yeast for the
rising of the dough; those who once have got accustomed to the use
of yeast will not find it any more trouble than using baking
powder. It may here be beneficial to give a few hints as to the
harm done by the use of the most commonly introduced chemicals,
namely, soda, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, tartaric acid,
and citric acid. Not only do they delay the digestion of the foods
in which they are used, and give rise to various stomach troubles,
but also cause rheumatism and gout, and often are the primary cause
of stone in the kidney and bladder. Another danger lies in the fact
that these chemicals are too dear to be supplied pure to the
public, which always demands cheap goods, and the result is that
many of the chemicals in the market are mixed with other still
worse poisons, like arsenic, for instance. Self-raising flour,
which is liked by so many on account of its convenience, is nothing
but ordinary flour mixed with some sort of baking powder; in the
same way egg powders are simply starch powders, coloured and
flavoured, mixed with baking powder. Tartaric acid and citric acid
also belong to the class of injurious chemicals. They are often
used in the making of acid drinks, when lemons are not handy. They
irritate the stomach violently, and often cause acute dyspepsia.
These few remarks will, I hope, convince the readers that all
<!-- Page 10 --><a name='Page_10'></a>these chemicals are best
avoided in culinary preparations. Even salt and spices are best
used in great moderation; if our dishes could be prepared without
them it would be far the best; but it takes a long time to wean
people entirely from the use of condiments; the first step towards
it is to use them as sparingly as possible.</p>

<p>I have tried to make this a hygienic cookery book; but there are
a number of dishes introduced which can hardly claim to be
hygienic; it has to be left to the good judgment of the readers to
use them on rare occasions only, and it will be better for the
health of each individual if the plainer dishes only are prepared
for the daily table. I wish here to impress on vegetarians, and
those who wish to give the diet a trial, not to eat much pulse;
this is the rock on which many "would-be vegetarians" come to
grief. They take these very concentrated, nitrogenous foods in
rather large quantities, because they have an idea that only they
will support them when the use of meat is abandoned. They are foods
which, to be beneficial to the system of the consumer, require a
great deal of muscular exertion on his part. The results to persons
of sedentary habits of eating pulse foods often are indigestion,
heavy and dull feelings, and general discomfort. In my own
household butter beans, the most concentrated of all foods, come on
the table perhaps once a month, lentils or peas perhaps once a
week. None but those persons who have strong digestive organs
should eat pulse foods at all; and then only when they have plenty
of physical work to do. I have known several people who tried
vegetarianism who have given up the trial in despair, and, when I
inquired closely into the causes, the abuse of pulse food was
generally the chief one.</p>

<p>I will now give a list of the composition of the various foods,
which may be instructive and useful to those to whom the study of
dietetics is new, as well as to vegetarians who may wish to use it
for reference. The list is copied from a little pamphlet by A.W.
Duncan, published by the Vegetarian Society in Manchester.</p>

the hands of the public. I hope that it will be found useful by
many and a help to those who wish to live in a way which is
conducive to health and at the same time innocent of slaughter and
cruelty. The health of the nation to a great extent is in the hands
of our cooks and housewives. If they learn to prepare wholesome and
pure food, those who are dependent on them will benefit by it.
Healthful cookery must result in health to the household and,
therefore, to the nation. Avoid disease-communicating foods, use
those only which are conducive to health, and you will be rewarded
by an increase of health and consequently of happiness.</p>

<div class="recipe"><a name="artichokesoup"></a>
<h4>ARTICHOKE SOUP.</h4>

<p>1 lb. each of artichokes and potatoes, 1 Spanish onion, 1 oz. of
butter, 1 pint of milk, and pepper and salt to taste. Peel, wash,
and cut into dice the artichokes, potatoes, and onion. Cook them
until tender in 1 quart of water with the butter and seasoning.
When the vegetables are tender rub them through a sieve. Return the
liquid to the saucepan, add the milk, and boil the soup up again.
Add water if the soup is too thick. Serve with Allinson plain
rusks, or small dice of bread fried crisp in butter or
vege-butter.</p>

<br>
 <a name="haricotsoup"></a>
<h4>HARICOT SOUP.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of haricot beans, 1/2 lb. of onions, 1 lb. of turnips, 2
carrots, 2 sticks of celery, 1 teaspoonful of mixed herbs, 1/2 oz.
of parsley, 1 oz. of butter, 2 quarts of water, pepper and salt to
taste. Cut up the vegetables and set them to boil in the water with
the haricot beans (which should have been steeped over night in
cold water), adding the butter, herbs, and seasoning. Cook all very
gently for 3-1/2 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally. When the beans
are quite tender, rub the soup through a sieve, adding more water
if needed; return it to the saucepan, add the parsley chopped up
finely, boil it up and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="barleysoup"></a>
<h4>BARLEY SOUP.</h4>

<p>8 oz. of pearl barley, 2 onions, 4 potatoes, 1/2 a teaspoonful
of thyme, 1 dessertspoonful of finely chopped parsley, 3-1/2 pints
of water, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter. Pick and wash the
barley, chop up the onions, slice the potatoes. Boil the whole
gently for 4 hours with the water, adding the butter, thyme, pepper
and salt to taste. When the barley is quite soft, add the milk and
parsley, boil the soup up, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="breadsoup"></a>
<h4>BREAD SOUP.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. of stale crusts of Allinson wholemeal bread, 4 onions, 2
turnips, 1 stick of celery, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 oz. of finely
chopped parsley, 8 pints of water, 1/2 pint of milk. Soak the
crusts in the water for 2 hours before they are put over the fire.
Cut up into small dice the vegetables; add them to the bread with
the butter and pepper and salt to taste. Allow all to simmer gently
for 1 hour, then rub the soup through a sieve, return it to the
saucepan, add the milk and parsley, and, if the flavour is liked, a
little grated nutmeg; boil the soup up and serve at once.</p>

<br>
 <a name="cabbagesoup"></a>
<h4>CABBAGE SOUP.</h4>

<p>1 fair-sized cabbage, a large Spanish onion, 1-1/2 oz. of
butter, pepper and salt to taste, 1/2 saltspoonful of nutmeg, 1-1/2
pints of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of Allinson fine wheatmeal. After
preparing and washing the cabbage, shred up very fine, chop up the
onion, set these two in a saucepan over the fire with 1 quart of
water, the butter and seasoning, and let all cook gently for 1
hour, or longer it the vegetables are not quite tender. Add the
milk and thickening when the vegetables are thoroughly tender, and
let all simmer gently for 10 minutes; serve with little squares of
toasted or fried bread, or Allinson plain rusks.</p>

<br>
 <a name="cabbagesoupfrench"></a>
<h4>CABBAGE SOUP (French).</h4>

<p>1 medium-sized cabbage, 1 lb. of potatoes, 1 oz. of butter, 3
pints of milk and water equal parts, pepper and salt to taste, 1
dessertspoonful of finely chopped parsley, and 2 blades of mace,
and 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal. Wash the cabbage
and shred it finely, peel the potatoes and cut them into small
dice; boil the vegetables in the milk and water until
<!-- Page 14 --><a name='Page_14'></a>quite tender, adding the
mace, butter, and seasoning. When quite soft, rub the wheatmeal
smooth with a little water, let it simmer with the soup for 5
minutes, add the parsley, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="capersoup"></a>
<h4>CAPER SOUP.</h4>

<p>2 pints of water, 1 pint of milk, 1 large tablespoonful of
capers, 1/2 lemon, 2 eggs, 1-1/2 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal,
1/2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Boil the milk and
water and butter, with seasoning to taste; thicken it with the
wheatmeal rubbed smooth with a little milk. Chop up the capers, add
them and let the soup cook gently for 10 minutes; take it off the
fire, beat up the eggs and add them carefully, that they may not
curdle; at the last add the juice of the half lemon, re-heat the
soup without allowing it to boil, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="carrotsoup1"></a>
<h4>CARROT SOUP (1).</h4>

<p>4 good-sized carrots, 1 head of celery, 1 onion, 3 oz. of
Allinson wholemeal bread without crust, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and
salt, and 1 blade of mace. Wash, scrape, and cut the carrots into
dice. Prepare and cut up the onions and celery. Set the vegetables
over the fire with 3 pints of water, adding the mace and seasoning.
Let all cook until quite soft, which will probably be in 1-1/2
hours. If the carrots are old, they will take longer cooking. When
the vegetables are tender, rub all through a sieve, return the soup
to the saucepan, add the butter, allow it to boil up, and serve
with sippets of toast.</p>

<br>
 <a name="carrotsoup2"></a>
<h4>CARROT SOUP (2).</h4>

<p>4 good-sized carrots, 1 small head of celery, 1 fair-sized
onion, 1 turnip, 3 oz. of breadcrumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of butter, 1 blade
of mace, pepper and salt to taste. Scrape and wash the vegetables,
and cut them up small; set them over the fire with 3 pints of
water, the butter, bread, and mace. Let all boil together, until
the vegetables are quite tender, and then rub them through a sieve.
Return the mixture to the saucepan, season with pepper and salt,
and if too thick add water to the soup, which should be as thick as
cream, boil the soup up, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="cauliflowersoup"></a>
<h4>CAULIFLOWER SOUP.</h4>

<p>1 medium-sized cauliflower, 1-1/2 pints of milk, 1 oz. of
butter, 2 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, pepper and salt to taste,
a little nutmeg, and the juice of a lemon. Prepare the cauliflower
by washing and breaking it into pieces, keeping the flowers whole,
and boil in 1-1/2 pints of water, adding the butter, nutmeg, and
seasoning. When the cauliflower is quite tender add the milk, boil
it up, and thicken the soup with the wheatmeal, which should first
be smoothed with a little cold water. Lastly, add the lemon juice,
and serve the soup with sippets of toast.</p>

<br>
 <a name="clearsoup"></a>
<h4>CLEAR SOUP.</h4>

put on the top, and then baked for 1 hour or so. This is a tasty
dish. Cold beans are very nice if warmed in a frying-pan with oil
or butter, and may be eaten with potatoes, vegetables, and sauce.
Mashed beans, flavoured with pepper, salt, and mace, and put into
pots make an excellent substitute for potted meat.</p>

<h4>BREAD AND CHEESE SAVOURY.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. of Allinson wholemeal bread, 3 oz. of grated cheese, 1
pint of milk, 3 eggs, pepper and salt to taste, a little nutmeg,
and some butter. Cut the bread into slices and butter them: arrange
in layers in a pie-dish, spreading some cheese between the layers,
and dusting with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Finish with a
good sprinkling of cheese. Whip up the eggs, mix them with the milk
and pour the mixture over the bread and cheese in the pie-dish.
Pour the custard back into the basin, and repeat the pouring over
the contents of the pie-dish. If this is done 2 or 3 times the top
slices of bread and butter get soaked and then bake better. This
should also be done when a bread and butter pudding is made. Bake
the savoury until brown, which it will be in about 3/4 of an
hour.</p>

 <a name="butterbeanswithparsley"></a>
<h4>BUTTER BEANS WITH PARSLEY SAUCE.</h4>

<p>Pick the beans, wash them, and steep them over night in boiling
water, just covering them. Allow 2 or 3 oz. of beans for each
person. In the morning, let them cook gently in the water they are
steeped in with the addition of a little butter, until quite soft,
which will be in about 2 hours. The beans should be cooked in only
enough water to keep them from burning, therefore, when it boils
away, add only just sufficient for absorption. The sauce is made
thus: 1 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal, a
handful of finely chopped parsley, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, pepper
and salt to taste. Boil the milk and thicken it with the flour,
which should first be smoothed with a little cold milk, then last
of all add the lemon juice, the seasoning, and the parsley. This
dish should be eaten with potatoes and green vegetables.</p>

add it to the mixture, beating all well together. If it is too dry,
add a very little milk, but only just enough to make the mixture
keep together. Form into rissoles, beat up the second egg, roll
them into the egg and raspings, and fry the rissoles a nice brown
in boiling butter or oil. Drain and serve.</p>

<h2>MACARONI</h2>

<br>
<p>Macaroni is one of the most nutritious farinaceous foods. It is
made from Italian wheat, which contains more flesh-forming matter
than butcher's meat. In the manufacture of macaroni some of the
bran is removed from the flour, but the meal left is still very
rich in flesh-forming matter. As the coarser particles of the bran
have been taken away, macaroni is slightly constipating, and must
therefore always be eaten with green vegetables, onions, or fruit.
Macaroni should always be boiled before being made into various
dishes. It may be cooked in plain water, or in milk and water; a
little salt may be added by those who use it, and care should be
taken to use just enough water to cook it in, so that when the
macaroni is done, little or no fluid may be left, but if any does
remain it should be saved for sauce, stock for soup, &amp;c., as it
contains valuable nutritive material. Macaroni takes from 20
minutes to 1 hour to cook, according to the kind used. That which
is slightly yellow is to be preferred to the white, as the latter
is usually poorer than the former in mineral salts and
flesh-forming substances. From 2 to 4 oz. may be regarded as the
amount to be allowed at a meal for grown-up persons.</p>

<p>A very simple nourishing and satisfying meal can be made from
macaroni plainly boiled; it may be eaten with any kind of
vegetables, or baked potatoes, or fried onions, and if desired,
with grated cheese, onion, caper, or parsley sauce.</p>

<br>


<div class="recipe"><a name="italianmacaroni"></a>
<h4>MACARONI (Italian).</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. of spaghetti or vermicelli, 2 oz. of butter, 2 eggs, 3
oz. of grated cheese, 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley,
pepper and salt to taste. Boil the macaroni till tender in 2 pints
of water, to which the butter has been added. When soft add
seasoning, the cheese, and the parsley. Beat the eggs well in the
dish in which the macaroni is to be served, pour over the mixture
of macaroni and other ingredients, mix all well with the eggs, and
serve. If neither spaghetti nor vermicelli are handy, use Naples
macaroni.</p>

<br>
 <a name="macaronicheese"></a>
<h4>MACARONI CHEESE.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. of macaroni, 8 oz. of grated cheese, some breadcrumbs,
pepper and salt to taste, and 1 oz. of butter. Boil the macaroni in
slightly salted water until soft. Then place a layer of it in a
pie-dish, sprinkle some of the grated cheese over it, dust with
pepper, and repeat the layers of macaroni and cheese, finishing
with a sprinkling of cheese, and the breadcrumbs. Cut the butter in
pieces, and place them here and there on the top. Bake it in a
moderately hot oven until brown. Eat with vegetables and tomato
sauce. For those who have a weak digestion plain boiled macaroni
with grated cheese added at table is better and lighter. Macaroni
requires from 25 minutes to 1/2 an hour cooking. The Genoa macaroni
takes longer, the thin spaghetti kind is done in from 15 to 20
minutes, and vermicelli and Italian paste are done in a few
minutes. Macaroni should be thrown into boiling water and be kept
boiling, as the pipes or pieces otherwise stick together. The
Italian paste is mostly used as an addition in clear soup.</p>

<br>
 <a name="macaronicream"></a>
<h4>MACARONI CREAM.</h4>

<p>6 oz. of macaroni, 3 oz. of cheese, 1/2 oz. of butter, 3/4 pint
of milk, 1 teaspoonful of Allinson cornflour, pepper and salt to
taste. Boil the macaroni until tender in only as much water as it
will absorb. Make a sauce of the milk, cornflour, and cheese (you
can use Parmesan, Gruy&egrave;re, or Canadian cheese). Place the
macaroni in a pie-dish, pour the sauce over it, grate some more
cheese over the top, and let the macaroni brown in the oven.</p>

<br>
 <a name="macaronisavoury"></a>
<h4>MACARONI SAVOURY.</h4>

<p>4 oz. of boiled macaroni, 4 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 3

1 lemon, 2 oz. of grated cheese, 1 tablespoonful of finely chopped
parsley, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg,
pepper and salt to taste. Cut the macaroni in small pieces. Make a
batter of the milk, eggs, and meal, mix into it all the other
ingredients, pour it into a buttered pie-dish, cut up the butter in
pieces and spread them on the top. Bake the savoury for 1 to 1-1/2

<h2><!-- Page 32 --><a name='Page_32'></a><b>RICE</b></h2>

<br>


<p>In many households it seems a difficulty to get rice cooked
properly, that is having all the grains separate. Very often it
comes to table in a soft, pulpy mass, which is certainly not
appetising. To cook it in a large saucepanful of water which is
then drained away is very wasteful, for a great deal of the
goodness of the rice is thrown away. The following recipe will be
found thoroughly reliable and satisfactory.</p>

<br>


<div class="recipe"><a name="howtocookrice"></a>
<h4>RICE, HOW TO COOK.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of good rice, 1 quart of water, 1 oz. of butter, salt to
taste. Wash the rice and set it over the fire with 1 quart of cold
water, the butter and salt. Let it come to the boil gently,
stirring it a little to prevent the rice from sticking to the
saucepan. When the rice boils, set it on the side and let it just
simmer. It will be sufficiently cooked in 15 to 20 minutes and each
grain will be separate. Rice should not be cooked too soft, only
just cooked through.</p>

<br>
 <a name="curriedrice"></a>
<h4>CURRIED RICE.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of Patna rice, 1 quart of cold water, 1 dessertspoonful of
curry, 1 oz. of butter, and salt to taste. Wash the rice, mix the
curry with the proper quantity of water, and set the rice over the
fire with it, adding the butter and seasoning. Let the rice come to
the boil slowly, and stir it a few times to prevent it sticking to
the saucepan. When the rice boils, cover it with a piece of
buttered paper, and let it cook very gently, not stirring it again.
When all the water is absorbed, serve the rice. Do not allow it to
get very soft; the rice will take from 15 to 20 minutes' cooking
only.</p>

<h4>CURRIED RICE AND TOMATOES.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. of Patna rice, 1 dessertspoonful of curry powder, salt
to taste, and 1 oz. of butter. Wash the rice; mix 1 pint of cold
water with the curry powder, put this over the fire with the rice,
butter, and salt. Cover the rice with a piece of buttered paper and
let it simmer gently until the water is absorbed. This will take
about 20 minutes. Rice cooked this way will have all the grains
separate. For the tomatoes proceed as follows: 1 lb. of tomatoes
and a little butter, pepper and salt. Wash the tomatoes and place
them in a flat tin with a few spoonfuls of water; dust them with
pepper and salt, and place little bits of butter on each tomato.
Bake them from 15 to 20 minutes, according to the size of the
tomatoes and the heat of the oven. Place the rice in the centre of
a hot flat dish, put the tomatoes round it, pour the liquid over
the rice, and serve.</p>

<h2><!-- Page 37 --><a name='Page_37'></a><b>VEGETABLES</b></h2>

<br>
<a name="green"></a>
<h4>GREEN VEGETABLES (General Remarks).</h4>

<p>I have not given recipes for the cooking of plain greens, as
they are prepared very much alike everywhere in England. There are
a number of recipes in this book giving savoury ways of preparing
them, and I will now make a few remarks on the cooking of plain
vegetables. The English way of boiling them is not at all a good
one, as most of the soluble vegetable salts, which are so important
to our system, are lost through it. Green vegetables are generally
boiled in a great deal of salt water; this is drained off when they
are tender, and the vegetables then served. A much better way for
all vegetables is to cook them in a very small quantity of water,
and adding a small piece of butter (1 oz. to 2 lb. of greens) and a
little salt. When the greens are tender, any water which is not
absorbed should be thickened with a little Allinson fine wheatmeal
and eaten with the vegetables. A great number of them, such as
<i>Cabbages, Savoys, Brussel sprouts, Scotch kail, turnip-tops,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>, can be prepared this way.</p>

<p>In the case of vegetables like <i>asparagus, cauliflower, sea
kale, parsnips, artichokes, carrots</i> or <i>celery</i>, which
cannot always be stewed in a little water, this should be saved as
stock for soups or sauces. Most of these vegetables are very nice
with a white sauce; carrots are particularly pleasant with parsley
sauce.</p>

<p><i>Spinach</i> is a vegetable which English cooks rarely prepare
nicely; the Continental way of preparing it is as follows: The
spinach is cooked without water, with a little salt; when quite
tender it is strained, turned on to a board, and chopped very
finely; then it is returned to the saucepan with a piece of butter,
a little nutmeg, or a few very finely chopped eschalots and some of
the juice previously strained. When the spinach is cooking a little
Allinson fine wheatmeal, smoothed in 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of milk,
is added to bind the spinach with the juice; cook it a few minutes
longer, and serve it with slices of hard-boiled egg on the top.
<i>Potatoes</i> also require a good deal of care. When peeled,
potatoes are plainly boiled, they should be placed over the fire
after the water has been strained; the potatoes should be lightly
shaken to allow the moisture to steam out. This makes them mealy
and more palatable. Potatoes which have been baked in their skins
should be pricked when tender, or the skins be cracked in some way,
otherwise they very soon become sodden. A very palatable way of
serving potatoes, is to peel them and bake them in a tin with a
little oil or butter, or vege-butter; they should be turned
occasionally, in order that they should brown evenly. This is not a
very hygienic way of preparing potatoes. From a health point of
view they are best baked in their skins, or steamed with or without
the skins. A good many vegetables may be steamed with advantage;
for instance, <i>cabbage, sprouts, turnips, parsnips, swedes,
Scotch kail, &amp;c.</i> Any way of preparing greens is better than
boiling them in a large saucepanful of water and throwing this
away. I may just mention that Scotch kail, after being boiled in a
little water, should be treated exactly as spinach, and is most
delicious in that way; an onion cooked with it greatly improves the
flavour.</p>

<br>
<div class="recipe">
 <a name="artichokesalasauceblanche"></a>
<h4>ARTICHOKES &Agrave; LA SAUCE BLANCHE.</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of artichokes, 1 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 3/4 pint
of milk, 1 egg, juice of 1/2 a lemon, pepper and salt to taste.
Peel the artichokes, and boil them in water until tender; cut them
into slices 1/2 an inch thick and place them on a dish. Make a
sauce of the milk and meal with seasoning; when <!-- Page 38 --><a
name='Page_38'></a>the sauce has thickened, remove it from the
fire, beat up the egg with the lemon juice and add both to the
sauce, pour it over the artichokes, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="artichokesalaparmesan"></a>
<h4>ARTICHOKES &Agrave; LA PARMESAN.</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of artichokes, 3/4 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of
Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 egg, juice of 1/2 a lemon, 2 oz. of
grated Parmesan or any other cooking cheese. Proceed as in the
recipe for "Celery &agrave; la Parmesan," add the cheese to the
sauce, and serve the same with sauce as above.</p>

<br>
 <a name="boiledasparagus"></a>
<h4>ASPARAGUS (BOILED).</h4>

<p>Scrape the white parts of the stalks quite clean, and put them
into cold water as they are done. Tie them up into bundles, and cut
them all the same length. Now put them into a saucepan, cover with
boiling water, add a little salt, and boil gently and steadily for
20 to 30 minutes. Take them out of the water as soon as they are
tender, and dish on to rounds of toast with the points to the
middle. Serve with them rich melted butter in a tureen.</p>

<br>
 <a name="cabbage"></a>
<h4>CABBAGE.</h4>

<p>Remove the outer coarse leaves, cut the cabbage in four pieces
lengthways, and well wash the pieces in salt water. The salt is
added because it kills any insects which may be present. Wash the
cabbage as often as is necessary in pure water after this to clean
it and remove the salt, and then shred it up fine. Set it over the
fire with 1/2 pint of water, 1 oz. of butter, a dash of pepper, and
a very little salt. Let it cook very gently for 2 hours; when it is
quite tender, the liquid can be thickened with a little fine
wheatmeal; smooth this with a little milk, or water if milk is not
handy; boil it up, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="carrotswithparsley"></a>
<h4>CARROTS WITH PARSLEY SAUCE.</h4>

<p>Scrub and wash as many carrots as are required. Cook them in a
little water or steam them until quite tender, then slice them and
place them in a saucepan. Make a white sauce as directed in the
recipe for "Onions and white sauce," and stir into it a handful of
finely-chopped parsley. Pour the sauce over the carrots, and let
them simmer for ten minutes. Serve very hot with baked
potatoes.</p>

<br>
 <a name="cauliflowerwithwhitesauce"></a>
<h4>CAULIFLOWER WITH WHITE SAUCE.</h4>

<p>Trim the cauliflower, cutting away only the bad and bruised
leaves and the coarse part of the stalk. Put it into salt water to
force out any insects in the cauliflower. After soaking, wash it
well in fresh water and boil quickly until tender, and serve with
white sauce.</p>

<br>
 <a name="italiancelery"></a>
<h4>CELERY (ITALIAN).</h4>

<p>2 heads of celery, 1/2 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, 1 egg, 1
cupful of breadcrumbs, pepper and salt to taste. Cut up the celery
into pieces, boil it in water for 10 minutes; drain it and put it
into the stewpan with the milk, 1/2 oz. butter, pepper and salt.
Simmer the celery gently until tender, put it aside to cool a
little, and add the egg well beaten. Butter a shallow dish, strew
it well with some of the breadcrumbs, and pour in the celery,
sprinkle the rest of the breadcrumbs over the top, put the butter
over it in little bits, and bake the celery until brown.</p>

<br>
 <a name="steamedcelerywithwhitecheesesauce"></a>
<h4>CELERY (STEAMED) WITH WHITE CHEESE SAUCE.</h4>

<p>Prepare the celery as in previous recipe, leaving it in long
pieces, and place it in a vegetable steamer, which consists of a
large saucepan over which is fitted a perforated top. Add a little
pepper and salt, and let the celery steam for 1-1/2 hours. For the
sauce you need: 1 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful
of Allinson cornflour, 1-1/2 oz. of grated cheese, pepper and salt
to taste. Boil the milk with the butter, thicken it with the
cornflour smoothed first with a spoonful of water, and last add the
grated cheese and seasoning; let the sauce simmer, stirring it
until the cheese is dissolved. Have ready some Allinson plain rusks
on a flat dish, place the celery on it, pour the sauce over, and
serve very hot.</p>

<br>
 <a name="stewedcelerywithwhitesauce"></a>
<h4>CELERY (STEWED) WITH WHITE SAUCE.</h4>

<p>2 or 3 heads of celery (according to quantity required), 2 oz.
of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1/2 pint of milk, pepper and
salt to taste. Remove the outer hard pieces from the celery, saving
them for flavouring soups or sauces; wash well and cut up in pieces
about 3 inches long. Set over the fire with 1/2 pint of water, the
butter and seasoning. Let cook gently until the <!-- Page 39 --><a
name='Page_39'></a>celery is quite tender, which will take about 1
hour; add the thickening and the milk. Let all gently simmer for a
few minutes, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="leeks"></a>
<h4>LEEKS.</h4>

<p>Remove the coarse part of the green stalks of the leeks. If the
leeks are gritty cut them right through and wash them well, and if
necessary use a brush to get out the sand. Tie the leeks in bunches
and steam them until tender, which will take about 1-1/2 hours.
Make a white sauce as for the cauliflower. Put the leeks on pieces
of dry toast on a flat dish, pour the sauce over them, and
serve.</p>

<br>


<h4>MUSHROOMS (STEWED).</h4>

<p>1 lb. of mushrooms, 1 oz. of butter, 1/2 pint of water, 1/2
teaspoonful of herbs, 1/2 saltspoonful of nutmeg, pepper and salt
to taste, juice of 1/2 a lemon, the yolk of 1 egg, 1
dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour. Peel and clean the
mushrooms, and wash them in water with a dash of vinegar in it.
Wipe them dry with a cloth; have the water and butter ready in a
saucepan with the herbs, and seasoning. Stew the mushrooms in this
for 10 to 15 minutes. Thicken with the cornflour, then stir in the
yolk of egg with the lemon juice, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="oniontortilla"></a>
<h4>ONION TORTILLA.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of Spanish onions, 1-1/2 oz. of butter or oil, 3 eggs.
Melt the butter in a frying-pan, slice the onions, and fry them for
10 or 15 minutes, beat the eggs, add them to the onions, season
with pepper and salt, and fry the whole a light brown on both
sides.</p>

<br>
 <a name="braisedonions"></a>
<h4>ONIONS (BRAISED).</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of onions, 2 oz. of butter, vege-butter, or oil, pepper
and salt to taste. Peel and slice the onions, and fry them a nice
brown in the butter. Then add enough water to make gravy, add
pepper and salt, and stew the onions for 20 minutes. Eat with
wholemeal toast. This is very savoury, and is much liked.</p>

<br>
 <a name="bakedspanishonions"></a>
<h4>ONIONS (SPANISH) (BAKED).</h4>

<p>Peel as many onions as are required, making an incision
crossways on the top, and put in a baking-dish with 1/2 oz. of
butter on each large onion, or half that quantity on small ones;
dust them over with pepper and salt, and bake them for 3 hours.
Keep them covered for 2 hours, and let them brown after that. Baste
the onions from time to time with the butter.</p>

<br>
 <a name="scotchkale"></a>
<h4>SCOTCH OR CURLY KAIL.</h4>

<p>Scotch kail is best after there has been frost on it. Wash the
kail, and cut away the coarse stalks, boil it for 1-1/2 to 2 hours
in a small quantity of water, adding a chopped up onion. Drain it
when soft and chop it fine like spinach. Into the saucepan in which
the kail was cooked put a piece of butter; melt it, and stir into
it 1 tablespoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal, and brown it very
slightly. Then add some of the drained-off kail wafer and stir it
smooth with the browned flour. Return the chopped Scotch kail to
the saucepan, add pepper and salt to taste; let it cook for a
minute, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="spinach"></a>
<h4>SPINACH.</h4>

<p>Wash the spinach thoroughly, and set it over the fire in a
saucepan without any water, as enough water will boil out of the
spinach to cook it. Heat it gently at first, stirring it a few
times to prevent it burning, until enough water has boiled out of
the spinach to prevent it from catching. Let the spinach cook 20
minutes, then strain it through a colander, pressing the water out
with a wooden spoon or plate. Put a piece of butter in the saucepan
in which the spinach was cooked; when melted, stir into it a
spoonful of Allinson fine wheatmeal, and keep stirring the meal and
butter for 1 minute over the fire. Return the spinach to the
saucepan, mix it well with the butter and meal, and add as much of
the strained-off water as is necessary to moisten it; add pepper
and salt to taste, and a little lemon juice. Let the spinach heat
well through before serving. Have ready 1 or 2 hard-boiled eggs cut

<h2><!-- Page 40 --><a name='Page_40'></a><b>EGG COOKERY.</b></h2>

<br>


<p>Eggs are a boon to cooks, especially when dishes are wanted
quickly. They enter into a great many savoury and sweet dishes, and
few cakes are made without them. They can be prepared in a great
variety of ways. Eggs are a good food when taken in moderation. As
they are a highly nutritious article of food, they should not be
indulged in too freely. Eggs contain both muscle and bone-forming
material, in fact everything required for building up the organism
of the young bird. The chemical composition of hen's and duck's
eggs are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<center>
<pre>
                Hen's egg. Duck's egg.
  Water ........   74.22    71.11
  Nitrogen .....   12.55    12.24
  Fat ..........   12.11    15.49
  Mineral matter    1.12     1.16
                  ------   ------
                  100.00   100.00
                  ======   ======

</pre>
</center>

<p>Eggs take a long time to digest if hard boiled. All the fat of
the egg is contained in the yolk, but the white of the egg is pure
albumen (or nitrogen) and water. Eggs are most easily digested raw
or very lightly boiled, and best cooked thus for invalids. The best
way of lightly boiling an egg is to put it in boiling water, set
the basin or saucepan on the side of the stove, and let it stand
just off the boil for five or six minutes. Eggs often crack when
they are put into enough boiling water to well cover them, owing to
the sudden expansion of the contents. If they are not covered with
water there is less danger of them cracking. One can easily tell
stale eggs from fresh ones by holding them up to a strong light. A
fresh egg looks clear and transparent, whilst stale ones look
cloudy and opaque. There are various ways of preserving eggs for
the winter; one of the best is by using the Allinson egg
preservative. Another very good way is to have stands made with
holes which will hold the eggs. Keep these stands in an airy place
in a good current of fresh air, and every week turn the eggs, so
that one week they stand the pointed end down, next week the
rounded end down.</p>

<div class="recipe"><a name="applesouffle"></a>
<h4>APPLE SOUFFL&Eacute;.</h4>

<p>4 eggs, 4 apples, 2 oz. of castor sugar (or more if the apples
are very sour), 1 gill of new milk or half milk and half cream, 1
oz. of Allinson cornflour, and the juice of 1 lemon. Pare, cut up,

<p>6 eggs, 1 teacupful of milk, thickened with 1 dessertspoonful of
Allinson fine wheatmeal, 2 oz. of grated cheese, pepper and salt to
taste. Butter a pie-dish, pour into it the thickened milk, break
the eggs over it, sprinkle the cheese over them, and season to
taste. Bake in a moderate oven until the eggs are just set.</p>

<br>
 <a name="eggandcheesefondu"></a>
<h4>EGG AND CHEESE FONDU.</h4>

<p>To each egg 1/2 its weight in grated cheese and a 1/2 oz. of
butter (if only 1 egg is prepared 1/2 oz. of butter must be used);
mustard, pepper, and salt to taste. Whip up the eggs, add 1
dessertspoonful of water for each egg, as in the previous recipe;
mix in the cheese, a little made mustard, and pepper and salt. Heat
the butter in a frying-pan or small stewpan. When hot stir in the
mixture of egg and cheese. Keep stirring it with a knife, until it
becomes a smooth and thickish mass. Put on hot buttered toast, and
serve. This is an extremely tasty French dish. The mixture, when
cold, is excellent for sandwiches.</p>

<br>
 <a name="eggandtomatosauce"></a>
<h4>EGG AND TOMATO SAUCE.</h4>

<p>4 eggs, 1 teacupful of tomato sauce, and 1/2 oz. of butter. Melt
the butter in a flat dish; break the eggs carefully into it without
breaking the yolks, and place the dish on the stove until the eggs
are set. Heat the tomato sauce, which should be well seasoned, and
pour it over the eggs. Serve very hot, with sippets of Allinson
wholemeal toast.</p>

<br>
 <a name="eggandtomatosandwiches"></a>
<h4>EGG AND TOMATO SANDWICHES.</h4>

<p>4 eggs, 1 teacupful of tinned tomatoes or 1/2 lb. fresh ones,
pepper and salt, 1 oz. of butter. Melt the butter in a frying-pan,
and cook the tomatoes in it until most of the liquid is steamed
away; set aside to cool. If fresh tomatoes are used, they should be
scalded and skinned before cooking. Beat up the eggs and stir them
into the cooled tomatoes, adding seasoning to taste. Stir the eggs
and tomatoes with a knife until set, then turn the mixture into a
bowl to get cold, and use for sandwiches.</p>

<br>
 <a name="eggsaladwithmayo"></a>
<h4>EGG SALAD WITH MAYONNAISE.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of cold boiled potatoes, 6 hard-boiled eggs, the juice of
1/2 a lemon, pepper and salt to taste. Cut the potatoes and eggs
into slices, dust them with pepper and salt, add the lemon juice,
and mix all well together. Make the mayonnaise as follows; 1-1/2
gills of good salad oil, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 saltspoonful of
mustard, lemon juice, pepper, and salt to taste. Take a clean cold
basin, and place in it the yolks of the eggs beaten up. Drop the
oil into them, drop by drop, stirring with a wooden spoon quickly
all the time. Great care should be taken, especially in the
beginning, as the eggs easily curdle when the oil is stirred in too
fast. When the mayonnaise gets very thick add carefully a little
lemon juice to thin it down, then add again oil and lemon juice
alternately until all the oil is used up. Smooth the mustard with
<!-- Page 42 --><a name='Page_42'></a>a little lemon juice, and
stir it in last of all with sufficient pepper and salt. Taste the
mayonnaise, and add lemon juice or seasoning as required. Vinegar
may be used instead of lemon juice if the latter is not
conveniently had. The mayonnaise should be made in a cold room, as
it may curdle if made in a hot room. Should an accident happen,
beat up another yolk of egg and start afresh with a little fresh
oil, and when going on well stir in, drop by drop, the curdled
mayonnaise. Mix part of it with the eggs and potatoes, and pour the
rest over the salad; garnish with watercress.</p>

<br>
 <a name="eggsalmagundiwithjam"></a>
<h4>EGG SALMAGUNDI WITH JAM.</h4>

<p>4 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, 1/2 a
teacupful of cream or milk, some apricot or other jam. Melt the
butter in a frying-pan. Beat the eggs, and mix with them the cream
or milk and the lemon juice. Pour the mixture into the butter, and
stir it over the fire until it thickens. Stir in some jam, and
serve with lady fingers, Allinson rusks, or bread fried in
butter.</p>

<br>
 <a name="eggsavoury"></a>
<h4>EGG SAVOURY.</h4>

<p>6 hard-boiled eggs, shelled and sliced; in summer use 1 large
breakfastcupful of boiled and chopped spinach; in winter Scotch
kale prepared the same way; some very thin slices of bread and

 <a name="mushroomsouffle"></a>
<h4>MUSHROOM SOUFFL&Eacute;.</h4>

<p>4 eggs, 1 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 oz. of butter, 6 oz.
of mushrooms, pepper and salt to taste. Peel, wash, and cut in
small pieces the mushrooms, and stew them in 3/4 of a teacupful of
water. When the mushrooms have stewed 10 minutes, drain off the
liquid, which should be a teacupful. Melt the butter in a little
saucepan, stir into it the wheatmeal, and when this is well mixed
with the butter, add the mushroom liquor, stirring the mixture well
until quite smooth and thick and coming away from the sides of the
saucepan. Then stir in the mushrooms, and turn all into a basin and

and mix them lightly with the rest. Turn the mixture into a
buttered pie-dish or Souffl&eacute; tin, and bake the
Souffl&eacute; 15 minutes.</p>

<br>
 <a name="poachedeggs"></a>
<h4>POACHED EGGS.</h4>

<p>Unless an egg-poacher is used, eggs are best poached in a large
frying-pan nearly filled with water. A little vinegar and salt
should be added to the water, as the eggs will then set more
quickly. Each egg should first be broken into a separate cup, and
then slipped into the rapidly boiling water; cover them up and
allow them to boil only just long enough to have the whites set,
which will take about 2 minutes. Quite newly laid eggs take a
little longer. Have ready hot buttered toast, remove the eggs from
the water with an egg-slice, and slip them on the toast. Always
have plates and dishes very hot for all kinds of egg dishes.
Poached eggs are also a very nice accompaniment to vegetables, like
spinach, Scotch kale, &amp;c., when they are served laid on the
vegetables.</p>

<br>
 <a name="potatosouffle"></a>
<h4>POTATO SOUFFL&Eacute;.</h4>

butter in a basin, which is done by stirring it round the sides of
the basin until soft and creamy, when it will make a slight
crackling noise. Stir in the yolks of the eggs, the sugar, and
almonds; beat for 10 minutes, then stir in the potatoes and
breadcrumbs, and last of all the whites of the eggs whipped to a
stiff froth. Turn the mixture into a well-buttered dish, and bake
in a moderately hot oven from 3/4 of an hour to 1 hour.</p>

<br>
 <a name="ratafiasouffle"></a>
<h4>RATAFIA SOUFFL&Eacute;.</h4>

<p>6 eggs, 2 oz. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz.
of castor sugar, the grated rind of 1/2 lemon, 1/2 pint of milk, 3
oz. of ratafias. Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour,
mix well, and then add the milk, stirring all until the mixture is
quite smooth and thick and comes away from the sides of the
saucepan. Let it cool a little, then stir in the yolks of the
<!-- Page 44 --><a name='Page_44'></a>eggs well beaten, the lemon
rind, the sugar, and lastly, the whites of the eggs whipped to a
stiff froth. Turn the mixture into a buttered pie-dish or cake tin,
with alternate layers of ratafias. Bake from 1/2 an hour to 3/4 of
an hour in a moderately hot oven, and serve immediately with stewed
fruit.</p>

latter is used for flavouring. When the rice is tender remove the
peel; or flavour with vanilla essence, and let all cool. Separate
the yolks of the eggs from the whites, and beat each separately
into the rice for 2 or 3 minutes. Whip the whites of the eggs to a
stiff froth, and stir them lightly into the mixture. Have ready a
buttered Souffl&eacute; tin, pour the mixture into it, and bake the
Souffl&eacute; for 20 minutes in a hot oven. Sprinkle with castor
sugar, and serve at once.</p>

<br>


<p>These wholesome dishes are not used sufficiently by English
people, for very few know the value of them. All may use these
foods with benefit, and two dinners each week of them with Allinson
wholemeal bread will prevent many a serious illness. They are
natural food in a plain state, and supply the system with vegetable
salts and acids in the best form. In winter, salads may be made
with endive, mustard and cress, watercress, round lettuces, celery,
or celery root, or even finely cut raw red or white cabbage;
pepper, salt, oil, and vinegar are added as above. As a second
course, milk or bread pudding. Salads are invaluable in cases of
gout, rheumatism, gallstones, stone in the kidney or bladder, and
in a gravelly condition of the water and impure condition of the
system.</p>

<br>


<p>Flesh-eaters have the gravy of meat to eat with their
vegetables, and when they give up the use of flesh they are often
at a loss for a good substitute. Sauces may be useful in more ways
than one. When not too highly spiced or seasoned they help to
prevent thirst, as they supply the system with fluid, and when made
with the liquor in which vegetables have been boiled they retain
many valuable salts which would otherwise have been lost. When
foods are eaten in a natural condition no sauces are required, but
when food is changed by cooking many persons require it to be made
more appetising, as it is called. The use of sauces is thus seen to
be an aid to help down plain and wholesome food, and being fluid
they cause the food to be more thoroughly broken up and made into a
porridgy mass before it is swallowed. From a health point of view
artificial sauces are not good, but if made as I direct very little
harm will result.</p>

<p>Brown Gravy, Fried Onion Sauce, or Herb Gravy must be used with
great caution, or not at all by those who are troubled with
heartburn, acidity, biliousness, or skin eruptions of any kind.</p>

<p>The water in which vegetables (except cabbage or potatoes) have
been boiled is better for making sauces than ordinary water.</p>

<br>

<br>
 <a name="milkpudding"></a>
<h4>MILK PUDDING.</h4>

<p>The general rule for milk puddings is to take 4 oz. of
farinaceous food of any kind to 1 quart of milk. The best way to
prepare most of these puddings is to let the ingredients gently
cook on the top of the stove and then to turn them into a pie-dish
to finish them in the oven for 4 hour or a little longer, according
to the heat of the oven. Should eggs be added, they should be
beaten well, then mixed with the pudding before it goes into the
oven. Most farinaceous milk puddings are improved by the use of
Allinson fine wheatmeal with the other ingredients. For instance,
use 2 oz. of giant sago and 2 oz. of wheatmeal to 1 quart of milk;
or for semolina pudding, the same quantities of wheatmeal and
semolina; and for vermicelli pudding the same, with sugar and
flavouring to taste.</p>

<br>


<p>Special recipes for every kind of fruit tart are not given, as
the same rules apply to all. For the crust either of the recipes
given for pie-crusts may be used, and the fruit tarts can be made
either open, with a bottom crust only, with top and bottom crust,
or with a top crust only. When any dried fruit is used, like
prunes, dried apricots, apple-rings, &amp;c., these should first be
stewed till tender, and sweetened if necessary, and allowed to
cool; then place as much of the fruit as is required into your
tart, cover it with a crust, and bake until the crust is done. If
an open tart is made, only very little juice should be used, as it
would make the crust heavy.</p>

<p>Summer fruit, like strawberries, raspberries, currants,
cherries, and gooseberries need not be previously cooked. Mix the
fruit with the necessary sugar, and it the tart is made with a top
crust only, a little water can be added and an egg-cup or a little
tea-cup should be placed in the pie-dish upside down to keep up the
crust.</p>

<div class="recipe"><a name="almondcustard"></a>
<h4>ALMOND CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson
cornflour, 1 wineglassful of rosewater, sugar to taste, 1/2 lb.
ground almonds. Boil the milk with the sugar and almonds; smooth
the cornflour with the rosewater and stir it into the boiling milk,
let it boil up for a minute. Beat up the eggs, leaving out 3 of the
whites of the eggs, which are to be beaten to a stiff froth. Let
the milk cool a little, then stir in the eggs very gradually,
taking care not to curdle them; stir over the fire until the
custard is nearly boiling, then let it cool, stirring occasionally;
pour it into a glass dish, and pile the whipped whites of the eggs
on the top of the custard just before serving.</p>

<br>
 <a name="bakedapplecustard"></a>
<h4>BAKED APPLE CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>8 large apples, moist sugar to taste, half a teacupful of water
and the juice of half a lemon, 1 pint of custard made with Allinson
custard powder. Peel, cut and core the apples and put into a lined
saucepan with the water, sugar, and lemon juice, stew till tender
and rub through a sieve; when cold put the fruit at the bottom of a
pie-dish and pour the custard over, grate a little nutmeg over the
top, bake lightly, and serve cold.</p>

<br>
 <a name="bakedcustard"></a>
<h4>BAKED CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, sugar, and flavouring to taste. Heat
the milk until nearly boiling, sweeten it with sugar, and add any
kind of flavouring. Whip up the eggs, and mix them carefully with
the hot milk. Pour the custard into a buttered pie-dish, and bake
it in a moderately hot oven until set. If the milk and eggs are
mixed cold and then baked the custard goes watery; it is therefore
important to bear in mind that the milk should first be heated.
Serve with stewed fruit.</p>

<br>
 <a name="caramelcustard"></a>
<h4>CARAMEL CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>1-1/2 pints of milk, 4 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful of sugar, 1/2
lemon and 4 oz. of castor sugar for caramel. Put the dry castor
sugar into an enamelled saucepan and let it melt and turn a rich
brown over the fire, stirring all the time. When the sugar is
melted and browned stir into it about 2 tablespoonfuls of hot
water, and the juice of 1/2 lemon. Then pour the caramel into a
mould or cake-tin, and let it run all round the sides of the tin.
Meanwhile heat the milk near boiling-point, and add the vanilla and
sugar. Whip up the eggs, stir carefully into them the hot milk, so
as not to curdle the eggs. Then pour the custard into the tin on
the caramel and stand the tin in a larger tin with hot water, place
it in the oven, and bake in a moderately hot oven for about 20
minutes or until the custard is set. Allow it to get cold, turn
out, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="caramelcupcustard"></a>
<h4>CARAMEL CUP CUSTARD (French).</h4>

<p>Make the custard as in the recipe for "Cup Custard." Take 4 oz.
of castor sugar; put it over a brisk fire in a small enamelled
saucepan, keep stirring it until quite melted and a rich brown.
Then cautiously add 2 tablespoonfuls of boiling water, taking care
not to be scalded by the spluttering sugar. Gradually stir the
caramel into the hot custard. Let it cool, and serve in custard
glasses.</p>

<br>
 <a name="cupcustard"></a>
<h4>CUP CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>6 whole eggs or 10 yolks of eggs, 1 quart of milk, sugar and
vanilla to taste. Beat the eggs well while the milk is being
heated. Use vanilla pods to flavour&mdash;they are better than the
essence, which is alcoholic; split a piece of the pod 3 or 4 inches
long, and let it soak in the milk for 1 hour before it is set over
the fire, so as to extract the flavour from the vanilla. Sweeten
the <!-- Page 75 --><a name='Page_75'></a>milk and let it come
nearly to boiling-point. Carefully stir the milk into the beaten
eggs, adding only a little at a time, so as not to curdle the eggs.
When all is mixed, pour the custard into a jug, which should be
placed in a saucepanful of boiling water. Keep stirring the custard
with a wooden spoon, and as soon as the custard begins to coat the
spoon remove the saucepan from the fire, and continue stirring the
custard until it is well thickened. In doing as here directed there
is no risk of the custard curdling, for directly the water ceases
to boil it cannot curdle the custard, although it is hot enough to
finish thickening it. If the milk is nearly boiling when mixed with
the eggs, the custard will only take from 5 to 10 minutes to
finish. When the custard is done place the jug in which it was made
in a bowl of cold water, stir it often while cooling to prevent a
skin forming on the top. Remove the vanilla pod and pour the
custard into glasses. Should the custard be required very thick, 8
eggs should be used, or the milk can first be thickened with a
dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour before mixing it with the 6
eggs. This is an excellent plan; it saves eggs, and the custard
tastes just as rich as if more eggs were used. Serve in custard
glasses, or in a glass dish.</p>

<br>
 <a name="allinsonscustard"></a>
<h4>CUSTARD (ALLINSON).</h4>

<p>1 pint of milk or cream, 2 oz. of lump sugar and 1 packet of
Allinson custard powder. Put the contents of the packet into a
basin and mix to a smooth, thin paste with about 2 tablespoonfuls
of the milk; boil the remainder of milk with the sugar, and when
quite boiling pour quickly into the basin, stirring thoroughly;
stir occasionally until quite cold, then pour into custard glasses
and grate a little nutmeg on the top, or put in a glass dish and
serve with stewed or tinned fruits, or the custard can be used with
Christmas or plum pudding instead of sauce.</p>

<p>When the custard has been standing over night, it should be well
stirred before using.</p>

custard powder, out of a pint of milk take 8 tablespoonfuls and mix
well with the flour, custard powder, &amp;c., boil the remainder of
milk with sugar to taste and 1 oz. of butter and when quite boiling
pour on to the custard powder, stir quickly for a minute, then pour
into the pastry case, grate a little nutmeg on the top and bake
till of a golden brown; serve either hot or cold.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk, 1/2 pint of ready boiled wheat (boiled in
water), 1/4 lb. of sultanas and currants mixed, sugar to taste, 4
eggs, a stick of cinnamon. Mix the milk with the wheat (which
should be fresh), the sugar and fruit, adding the cinnamon, and let
all cook gently over a low fire, stirring frequently; when the
mixture is nicely thickened remove it from the fire and let it
cool; beat up the eggs and gradually mix them with the rest, taking
great care not to curdle them. Stir the frumenty over the fire, but
do not allow to boil. Serve hot or cold. The wheat should be fresh
and soaked for 24 hours, and then cooked from 3 to 5 hours.</p>

<h4>GOOSEBERRY CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>Make some good puff paste and line a pie-dish with it, putting a
double row round the edge. With 1/2 lb. of castor sugar stew 1 lb.
of green gooseberries until the skins are tender, then rub them
through a sieve. Scald 1 pint of milk, mix 1 tablespoonful of
Allinson cornflour to a smooth paste with cold milk, add it to the
milk when boiling, let it boil for 5 minutes, gently stirring it
all the time, then turn it into a bowl and let it become cool. Add
1/4 lb. of castor sugar, 2 oz. of butter melted and dropped in
gradually whilst the mixture is beaten, then put in the well-beaten
yolks of 6 eggs, add the mashed gooseberries in small quantities,
and lastly the whites of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth; beat
all together for a minute to mix well. Pour this into the lined
pie-dish and bake 25 or 30 minutes; serve in the pie-dish. This can
be made from any kind of acid fruit, and is as good cold as
hot.</p>

the macaroni in 1 pint of milk, and add a little water it needed;
when quite tender place it on a glass dish to cool; make a custard
of the rest of the milk and the other ingredients; flavour it well
with vanilla; when the custard is cool pour it over the macaroni,
and serve with or without stewed fruit.</p>

<br>
 <a name="macarooncustard"></a>
<h4>MACAROON CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. of macaroons, 1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful
of Allinson cornflour, sugar and vanilla essence to taste. Boil the
milk and stir into it the cornflour smoothed with a little of the
milk; whip up the eggs, and carefully stir in the milk (which
should have been allowed to go off the boil) without curdling it;
add sugar and vanilla to taste, and stir the custard over the fire
until it thickens, placing it in a jug into a saucepan of boiling
water. Arrange the macaroons in a glass dish, and when the custard
is cool enough not to crack the dish, pour it over them and
sprinkle some ground almonds on the top. Serve cold.</p>

<br>
 <a name="orangecustard"></a>
<h4>ORANGE CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>The juice of 6 oranges and of 1/2 a lemon, 6 eggs, 6 oz. of
sugar, and 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour. Add enough
water to the fruit juices to make 1-1/2 pints of liquid. Set this
over the fire with the sugar; meanwhile smooth the cornflour with a
little cold water, and thicken the liquid with it when boiling. Set
aside the saucepan, (which should be an enamelled one) so as to
cool the contents a little. Beat up the eggs, gradually stir into
them the thickened liquid, and then proceed with the custard as in
the previous recipe. This is a German sweet, and very
delicious.</p>

<br>
 <a name="raspberrycustard"></a>
<h4>RASPBERRY CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>1-1/2 pints of raspberries, 1/2 pint of red currants, 6 oz. of
sugar, 7 eggs, 1 dessertspoonful of Allinson cornflour. Mix the
fruit, and let it cook from 5 to 10 minutes with 1 pint of water;
strain the juice well through a piece of muslin or a fine
hair-sieve. There should be 1 quart of juice; if necessary add a
little more water; return the juice to the saucepan, add the sugar
and reheat the liquid; when it boils thicken it with the cornflour,
then set it aside to cool. Beat up the eggs, add them carefully
after the fruit juice has somewhat cooled; stir the custard over
the fire until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil, as the
eggs would curdle. Serve cold in custard glasses, or in a glass
dish poured over macaroons or sponge cakes. You can make a fruit
custard in this way, with strawberries, cherries, red currants, or
any juicy summer fruit.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applecake"></a>
<h4>APPLE CAKE</h4>

<p>6 oz. each of Allinson fine wheatmeal and white flour, 4-1/2 oz.
of butter, 1 egg, a little cold water, 1-1/2 lbs. of apples, 1
heaped-up teaspoonful of cinnamon, and 3 oz. of castor sugar. Rub
the butter into the meal and flour, beat up the egg and add it, and
as much cold water as is required to make a smooth paste; roll out
the greater part of it 1/4 inch thick, and line a flat buttered tin
with it. Pare, core, and cut the apples into thin divisions,
arrange them in close rows on the paste point down, leaving 1 inch
of edge uncovered; sift the sugar and cinnamon over the apples;
roll out thinly the rest of the paste, cover the apples with it,
turn up the edges of the bottom crust over the edges of the top
crust, make 2 incisions in the crust, and bake the cake until brown
in a moderately hot oven; when cold sift castor sugar over it, slip
the cake off the tin, cut into pieces, and serve.</p>

 <a name="applecharlotteII"></a>
<h4>APPLE CHARLOTTE.</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of good cooking apples, 2 oz. of chopped almonds, 4 oz.
of currants and sultanas mixed, 1 stick of cinnamon about 3 inches
long, sugar to taste, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, and Allinson bread
and butter cut very thinly. Pare, core, and cut up the apples, and
stew them with a teacupful of water and the cinnamon, until the
apples have become a pulp; remove the cinnamon, and add sugar,
lemon juice, the almonds, and the currants and sultanas, previously
picked, washed, and dried; mix all well and allow the mixture to
cool; butter a pie-dish and line it with thin slices of bread and
butter, then place on it a layer of apple mixture, repeat the
layers, finishing with slices of bread and butter; bake for 3/4
hour in a moderate oven.</p>

<h4>APPLES (DRYING).</h4>

<p>Those who have apple-trees are often at a loss to know what to
do with the windfalls. The apples come down on some days by the
bushel, and it is impossible to use them all up for apple pie,
puddings, or jelly. An excellent way to keep them for winter use is
to dry them. It gives a little trouble, but one is well repaid for
it, for the home-dried apples are superior in flavour to any bought
apple-rings or pippins. Peel your apples, cut away the cores and
all the worm-eaten parts&mdash;for nearly the whole of the
windfalls are more or less worm-eaten. The good parts cut into thin
pieces, spread them on large sheets of paper in the sun. In the
evening (before the dew falls), they should be taken indoors and
spread on tins (but with paper underneath), on the cool kitchen
stove, and if the oven is only just warm, placed in the oven well
spread out; of course they require frequent turning about, both in
the sun and on the stove. Next day they may again be spread in the
sun, and will probably be quite dry in the course of the day.
Should the weather be rainy, the apples must be dried indoors only,
and extra care must then be taken that they are neither scorched
nor cooked on the stove. Whilst cooking is going on they will dry
nicely on sheets of paper on the plate-rack. When the apples are
quite dry, which is when the outside is not moist at all, fill them
into brown paper bags and hang them up in an airy, dry place. The
apples <!-- Page 78 --><a name='Page_78'></a>will be found
delicious in flavour when stewed, and most acceptable when fresh
fruit is scarce. I have dried several bushels of apples in this way
every year.</p>

<br>
 <a name="appledumplings"></a>
<h4>APPLE DUMPLINGS.</h4>

<p>Core as many apples as may be required. Fill the holes with a
mixture of sugar and cinnamon; make a paste for a short crust, roll
it out, and wrap each apple in it. Bake the dumplings about 30 or
40 minutes in the oven, or boil them the same time in plenty of
water, placing the dumplings in the water when it boils fast. Serve
with cream or sweet white sauce.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applefool"></a>
<h4>APPLE FOOL.</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of apples, 1/2 lb. of dates, 3/4 pint of milk, 1/4 pint
of cream, 6 cloves tied in muslin, and a little sugar. Pare, core,
and cut up the apples, stone the dates, and gently stew the fruit
with a teacupful of water and the cloves until quite tender; when
sufficiently cooked, remove the cloves, and rub the fruit through a
sieve; gradually mix in the milk, which should be boiling, then the
cream; serve cold with sponge-cake fingers.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applefritters"></a>
<h4>APPLE FRITTERS.</h4>

<p>3 good juicy cooking apples, 3 eggs, 6 oz. of Allinson fine
wheatmeal, 1/2 pint of milk, and sugar to taste. Pare and core the
apples, and cut them into rounds 1/4 inch thick; make a batter with
the milk, meal, and the eggs well beaten, adding sugar to taste.
Have a frying-pan ready on the fire with boiling oil, vege-butter,
or butter, dip the apple slices into the batter and fry the
fritters until golden brown; drain them on blotting paper, and keep
them hot in the oven until all are done.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applejelly"></a>
<h4>APPLE JELLY.</h4>

<p>1 pint of water to each 1 lb. of apples. Wash and cut up the
apples, and boil them in the water until tender; then pour them
into a jelly bag and let drain well; take 1 lb. of loaf sugar to
each pint of juice, and the juice of 1 lemon to each quart of
liquid. Boil the liquid, skimming carefully, until the jelly sets
when cold if a drop is tried on a plate. It may take from 2 hours
to 3 hours in boiling.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applepancakes"></a>
<h4>APPLE PANCAKES.</h4>

<p>Make the batter as directed in the recipe for "Apple Fritters,"
peel 2 apples, and cut them in thin slices, mix them with the
batter, add sugar and cinnamon to taste, a little lemon juice if
liked, and fry the pancakes in the usual way.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applepudding"></a>
<h4>APPLE PUDDING.</h4>

<p>1-1/2 lbs. of apples, 1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, sugar to
taste, 1/2 lb. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, and 2-1/2 oz. of butter
or vege-butter. Pare, core, and cut up the apples; make a paste of
the meal, butter and a little cold water; roll the paste out, line
a pudding basin with the greater part of it, put in the apples, and
sprinkle over them the cinnamon and 4 oz. of sugar&mdash;a little
more should the apples be very sour; cover the apples with the rest
of the paste, and press the edges together round the sides; tie a
cloth over the basin and boil the pudding for 2-1/2 to 3 hours in a
saucepan with boiling water.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applepuddingnottingham"></a>
<h4>APPLE PUDDING (Nottingham).</h4>

<p>6 baking apples, 2 oz. of sugar, 1 heaped up teaspoonful of
ground cinnamon, 3/4 pint of milk, 3 eggs, 6 oz. of Allinson
wholemeal, and 1 oz. of butter. Core the apples, mix the sugar and
cinnamon, and fill the hole where the core was with it; put the
apples into a buttered pie-dish; make a batter of the milk, eggs,
and meal, melt the butter and mix it into the batter; pour it over
the apples, and bake the pudding for 2 hours in a moderate
oven.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applesago"></a>
<h4>APPLE SAGO.</h4>

<p>5 oz. of sago, 1-1/2 lbs. of apples, the juice of a lemon, a
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, and sugar to taste. Wash the sago
and cook it in 1-1/2 pints of water, to which the cinnamon is
added; meanwhile have the apples ready, pared, cored, and cut up;
cook them in very little water, just enough to keep the apples from
burning; when they are quite soft rub them through a sieve and mix
them with the cooking sago, adding sugar and lemon juice; let all
cook gently for a few minutes or until the sago is quite soft; put
the mixture into a wetted mould, and turn out when cold.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applesauce2"></a>
<h4>APPLE SAUCE.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of good cooking apples, sugar to taste. Pare, core, and
cut in pieces the apples, cook them in a few spoonfuls of water to
prevent them burning; <!-- Page 79 --><a name='Page_79'></a>when
quite soft rub the apple through a sieve, and sweeten the sauce to
taste. Rubbing the sauce through a sieve ensures the sauce being
free from pieces should the apple not pulp evenly.</p>

<br>
 <a name="appletartopen"></a>
<h4>APPLE TART (OPEN).</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of apples, 1 cupful of currants and sultanas, 2 oz. of
chopped almonds, sugar to taste, 1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon
or the rind of 1/2 lemon (which latter should be removed after
cooking with the apples), 12 oz. or Allinson fine wheatmeal, and
4-1/2 oz. of butter. Pare, core, and cut up the apples; stew them
in very little water, only just enough to keep from burning; when
nearly done add the currants, sultanas, almonds, cinnamon, and
sugar; let all simmer together until the apples have become a pulp;
let the fruit cool; make a paste of the meal, butter, and a little
water; roll it out and line a round, flat dish with it, and brush
the paste over with white of eggs; turn the apple mixture on the
paste; cut the rest of the paste into strips 3/8 of an inch wide,
and lay them over the apples in diamond shape, each 1 inch from the
other, so as to make a kind of trellis arrangement of the pastry.
If enough paste is left, lay a thin strip right round the dish to
finish off the edge, mark it nicely with a fork or spoon, and bake
the tart for 3/4 hour. Serve with white sauce or custard.</p>

<br>
 <a name="applesrice"></a>
<h4>APPLES (RICE)</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of apples, 1/2 lb. of rice, the rind of 1/2 lemon (or a
piece of stick cinnamon if preferred), 4 oz. of sultanas, sugar to
taste, 1 oz. of butter, and, if the apples are not sour, the juice
of a lemon. Boil the rice in 3 pints of water with the lemon rind,
then add the apples, pared, cored, and sliced, the sultanas,
butter, lemon juice, and sugar; let all simmer gently for 1/2 hour,
or until quite tender; if too dry add a little more water; remove
the lemon rind before serving.</p>

<br>
 <a name="evepudding"></a>
<h4>EVE PUDDING.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. each of apples and breadcrumbs, and 1/2 lb. of currants
and sultanas mixed, 5 eggs well beaten, sugar to taste, the grated
rind and juice of 1 lemon, and 2 oz. of butter. Peel, core, and
chop small the apples, mix them with the breadcrumbs, sugar,
currants, and sultanas (washed and picked), the lemon juice and
rind, and the butter, previously melted; whip up the eggs and mix
them well with the other ingredients; turn the mixture into a
buttered mould, tie with a cloth, and steam the pudding for 3
hours.</p>

<h2><!-- Page 80 --><a name='Page_80'></a><b>BREAD AND
CAKES</b></h2>

<br>


<h4>THE ADVANTAGES OF WHOLEMEAL BREAD.</h4>

<p>People are now concerning themselves about the foods they eat,
and inquiring into their properties, composition, and suitability.
One food that is now receiving a good deal of attention is bread,
and we ought to be sure that this is of the best kind, for as a
nation we eat daily a pound of it per head. We consume more of this
article of food than of any other, and this is as it ought to be,
for bread is the staff of life, and many of the other things we eat
are garnishings. It is said we cannot live on bread alone, but this
is untrue if the loaf is a proper one; at one time our prisoners
were fed on it alone, and the peasantry of many countries live on
very little else.</p>

<p>Not many years ago books treating of food and nutrition always
gave milk as the standard food, and so it is for calves and babies.
Nowadays we use a grain food as the standard, and of all grains
wheat is the one which is nearest perfection, or which supplies to
the body those elements that it requires, and in best proportions.
A perfect food must contain carbonaceous, nitrogenous, and mineral
matter in definite quantities; there must be from four to six parts
of carbonaceous or heat and force-forming matter to one of
nitrogen, and from two to four per cent. of mineral matter; also a
certain bulk of innutritious matter for exciting secretion, for
separating the particles of food so that the various gastric and
intestinal juices may penetrate and dissolve out all the nutriment,
and for carrying off the excess of the biliary and other intestinal
secretions with the f&aelig;ces.</p>

<p>A grain of wheat consists of an outer hard covering or skin, a
layer of nitrogenous matter directly under this, and an inner
kernel of almost pure starch. The average composition of wheat is
this:&mdash;</p>

<center>
<pre>
  Nitrogen             12
  Carbon               72
  Mineral Matter        4
  Water                12
                      ---
                      100
                      ===

</pre>
</center>

<p>From this analysis we observe that the nitrogenous matter is to
the carbonaceous in the proportion of one-sixth, which is the
composition of a perfect food. Besides taking part in this
composition, the bran, being in a great measure insoluble, passes
in bulk through the bowels, assisting daily laxation&mdash;a most
important consideration. If wheat is such a perfect food, it must
follow that wholemeal bread must be best for our daily use. That
such is the case, evidence on every side shows; those who eat it
are healthier, stronger, and more cheerful than those who do not,
all other things being equal. Wholemeal bread comes nearer the
standard of a perfect food than does the wheaten grain, as in
fermentation some of the starch is destroyed, and thus the
proportion of nitrogen is slightly increased.</p>

<p>The next question is, how shall we prepare the grain so as to
make the best bread from it? This is done by grinding the grain as
finely as possible with stones, and then using the resulting flour
for bread-making. The grain should be first cleaned and brushed,
and passed over a magnet to cleanse it from any bits of steel or
iron it may have acquired from the various processes it goes
through, and then finely ground. To ensure fine grinding, it is
always advisable to kiln-dry it first. When ground, nothing must be
taken from it, nor must anything be added to the flour, and from
this bread should be made. Baking powder, soda, and tartaric acid,
or soda and hydrochloric acid, or ammonia and hydrochloric
<!-- Page 81 --><a name='Page_81'></a>acid, or other chemical
agents, must never be used for raising bread, as these substances
are injurious, and affect the human system for harm. The only
ferment that should be used is yeast; of this the French variety is
best. If brewer's yeast is used it must be first well washed,
otherwise it gives a bitter flavour to the loaf. A small quantity
of salt may be used, but not much, otherwise it adds an injurious
agent to the bread.</p>

<div class="recipe"><a name="barleybannocks"></a>
<h4>BARLEY BANNOCKS.</h4>

<p>Put 1/2 pint of milk into a saucepan allow it to boil; then
sprinkle in barley meal, stirring it constantly to prevent lumps
till the mixture is quite thick and almost unstirrable. Turn the
mass out on a meal-besprinkled board and leave to cool. When cool
enough to knead, work it quite stiff with dry meal, take a portion
off, roll it as thin as a wafer, and bake it on a hot girdle; when
done on one side, turn and cook on the other. The girdle is to be
swept clean after each bannock. Eat hot or cold with butter.</p>

<br>
 <a name="slycakes"></a>
<h4>SLY CAKES.</h4>

<p>1 lb. Allinson wholemeal flour, 8 oz. butter, 8 oz. currants, 2
oz. sugar, and 6 drops essence of lemon; mix the flour and sugar,
and make it into a smooth paste with water, but do not make it very
wet. Roll out 3 times, and spread in the butter as for pastry; roll
it very thin, and cut into rounds or square cakes. Spread half of
them very thickly with currants, press the others very gently on
the top, so as to form a sandwich, and bake in a quick oven till a
light brown.</p>

<br>
 <a name="spongecake1"></a>
<h4>SPONGE CAKE (1).</h4>

<p>6 oz. fine wheatmeal, 1/2 lb. castor sugar, 4 eggs, any

knitting needle comes out clean.</p>

<br>
 <!-- Page 86 --><a name='Page_86'></a><a name=
"rolypolyspongecake"></a>
<h4>SPONGE CAKE ROLY-POLY.</h4>

<p>3 eggs, the weight of 2 in fine wheatmeal, of 8 in castor sugar,
some raspberry and currant jam. Mix the ingredients as directed in
"Sponge Cake," line a large, square, flat baking tin with buttered
paper, pour the mixture into it, and bake it in a fairly hot oven
from 7 to 12 minutes, or until baked through. Have a sheet of white
kitchen paper on the kitchen table, on which sprinkle some white
sugar. Turn the cake out of the tin on to the paper, spread the
cake with jam, and roll up. This should be done quickly, for if the
cake is allowed to cool it will not roll.</p>

<br>
 <a name="unfermentedbread"></a>
<h4>UNFERMENTED BREAD.</h4>

<p>This is as sweet and pure a bread as the finger-rolls, and keeps
fresh for several days, as it has to be mixed fairly moist. 2 lbs.
of Allinson wholemeal, 1-1/2 pints of milk and water; mix these to
a thick paste, and put the mixture into some small greased bread
tins. Loaves the size of the twopenny loaves will want 1-1/2 hours
in a hot oven.</p>

<br>
 <a name="unfermentedfingerrolls"></a>
<h4>UNFERMENTED FINGER-ROLLS.</h4>

<p>These are bread in the simplest and purest form, and liked by
most. 1 lb. of Allinson wholemeal, a good 1/2 pint of milk and
water mixed; mix the meal and the milk and water into a dough,
knead it a few minutes, then make the dough into finger-rolls on a
floured pastry-board, rolling the finger-rolls about 3 inches long
with the flat hand. Place them on a floured baking-tin, and bake
them in a sharp oven from 1/2 an hour to 1 hour. The time will
depend on the heat of the oven. In a very hot oven the rolls will
be well baked in 1/2 an hour.</p>

<br>
 <a name="victoriasandwiches"></a>
<h4>VICTORIA SANDWICH.</h4>

<p>Proceed the same as in "Sponge Cake Roly-Poly," but bake the
mixture in 2 round, flat tins; spread jam on one, and cover with
the other cake.</p>

<br>
 <a name="fermentedwholemealbread"></a>
<h4>WHOLEMEAL BREAD (FERMENTED).</h4>

<p>This will be found useful where a large family has to be
provided for, or where it is desirable to bake bread for several
days. 7 lbs. of Allinson wholemeal, 2-1/2 pints of warm water
(about 85&deg; Faht.), 1 teaspoonful salt, 1/2 oz. of yeast;
dissolve the yeast in the water, add the salt, put the meal into a
pan, make a hole in the centre of the meal, pour in the water with
the yeast and salt, and mix the whole into a dough. Allow it to
stand, covered with a cloth, 1-1/2 hours in front of the fire,
turning the pan sometimes, so that the dough may get warm evenly.
Then knead the dough well through, and if necessary add a little
more warm water. Make the dough into round loaves, or fill it into
greased tins, and bake it for 1-1/2 hours. The oven should be
fairly hot. To know whether the bread is done, a clean skewer or
knife should be passed through a loaf. It it comes out clean the
bread is done; if it sticks it not sufficiently baked. When it is
desired to have a soft crust, the loaves may be baked under tins in
the oven.</p>

<br>
 <a name="wholemealcake"></a>
<h4>WHOLEMEAL CAKE.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of wholemeal, 4 oz. of sugar, 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon, 1
breakfastcupful of currants and sultanas mixed, well-washed and
picked over, 3 oz. of chopped sweet almonds, 1 dozen ground bitter
almonds, 3 eggs, 1/4 oz. of German yeast, 1/4 lb. Vegebutter, and
some warm milk. Rub the butter into the meal, add the fruit,
cinnamon, almonds and sugar, and the eggs well beaten. Dissolve the
yeast in a cupful of warm milk (not hot milk) add it to the other
ingredients, and make all into a moist dough, adding as much more
milk as is required to make the dough sufficiently moist for the
spoon to beat all together. Cover the pan in which you mix the cake
with a cloth, place it in front of the fire, and allow the dough to
rise 1-1/2 hours, turning the pan round occasionally that the dough
may be equally warm. Then fill the dough into one or several
well-greased tins, and bake the cake or cakes from 1 to 1-1/2 hours
(according to the size) in a hot oven. If the cake browns too soon,
cover it over with a sheet of paper.</p>

<br>
 <a name="wholemealgems"></a>
<h4>WHOLEMEAL GEMS.</h4>

<p>Mix Allinson wholemeal flour with cold water into a batter,
pouring this into greased and hot gem pans, and baking for 3/4 of
an hour. All bread should be left for a day or two to set before it
is eaten, otherwise it is apt to lie heavy on the stomach and cause
a feeling of weight and uncomfortableness.</p>

<br>
 <!-- Page 87 --><a name='Page_87'></a><a name=
"wholemealrockcakes"></a>
<h4>WHOLEMEAL ROCK CAKES.</h4>

<p>1 lb. of meal, 3 oz. of butter or vege-butter, 1/4 lb. of sugar,
a cupful of currants and sultanas mixed, 3 oz. of blanched almonds,
chopped fine, 1 teaspoonful of cinnamon, or the grated rind of half
a lemon, 3 eggs, and very little milk (about 3/4 of a teacup). Rub
the butter into the meal, add the fruit, almonds, sugar, and
cinnamon, beat up the eggs with the milk, and mix the whole to a
stiff paste. Flour 1 or 2 flat tins, place little lumps of the
paste on them, and bake the cakes in a quick oven 25 to 35 minutes.
Particular care must be taken that the paste should not be too
moist, as in that case the cakes would run. Vege-butter is a
vegetable butter, made from the oil which is extracted from
cocoanuts and clarified. It can be obtained from some of the larger
stores, also from several dep&ocirc;ts of food specialities. It is
much cheaper than butter, and being very rich, goes further.</p>

<p>6 oz. of rice, 1 pint of milk, 8 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of fresh
butter, 6 oz. of apricot marmalade, 3 eggs. Let the rice swell in
the milk with the butter and the sugar over a slow fire until it is
tender&mdash;this will take about 1/2 of an hour; when the rice is
done, strain off any milk there may be left. Mix in the apricot
marmalade and the beaten eggs, stir it well over the fire until the
eggs are set; then spread the mixture on a dish, about 1/2 an inch
thick. When it is quite cold, cut it in long strips, dip them in a
batter, and fry them a nice brown. Strew sifted sugar over them,
and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="snowballs"></a>
<h4>SNOWBALLS.</h4>

<p>1-1/2 pints of milk, 4 eggs, sugar and vanilla to taste, and 1
tablespoonful of cornflour. Boil the milk with sugar and a piece of
vanilla or with 1 dessertspoonful of vanilla essence. Smooth the
cornflour with a little cold milk, and thicken the milk with it.
Whip the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth with 1 spoonful
of castor sugar, and drop spoonfuls of the froth into the boiling
milk. Allow to boil until the balls are well set, turning them over
that both sides may get done. Lift the balls out with a slice, and
place them in a glass dish. Beat up the yolks of the eggs, stir
them carefully in the hot milk; let the custard cool, and pour it
into the glass dish, but not over the snowballs, which should
remain white.</p>

<br>
 <a name="spongemould"></a>
<h4>SPONGE MOULD.</h4>

<p>9 stale sponge cakes, some raspberry jam, 2 pints of milk, 8 oz.
of Allinson cornflour, sugar to taste, a few drops of almond
essence. Halve the sponge cakes, spread them with jam, arrange them
in a buttered mould, and soak them with 1/2 pint of the milk
boiling hot. Boil the rest of the milk and thicken it with the
cornflour as for blancmange; flavour with the essence and sugar;
pour the mixture over the sponge cakes, and turn all out when
cold.</p>

<br>
 <a name="stewedpearsandvanillacream"></a>
<h4>STEWED PEARS AND VANILLA CREAM.</h4>

<p>Get 1 tin of pears, open it, and turn the contents into an
enamelled stewpan, <!-- Page 90 --><a name='Page_90'></a>add some
sugar and liquid cochineal to colour the fruit, and let them stew a
few minutes. Take out the pears carefully without breaking them,
and let the syrup cook until it is thick. When the pears are cold
lay them on a dish with the cores upwards, and with a spoon scoop
out the core, and fill the space left with whipped cream flavoured
with vanilla and sweetened; sprinkle them with finely shredded
blanched almonds or pistachios, and pour the syrup round them.</p>

<br>
 <a name="swisscreams"></a>
<h4>SWISS CREAMS.</h4>

<p>4 oz. of macaroons, a little raisin wine and 1 pint of custard,
made with Allinson custard powder; lay the macaroons in a glass
dish and pour over enough raisin wine to soak them, make the
custard in the usual way, let it cool and then pour over the cakes;
when quite cold garnish with pieces of bright coloured jelly.</p>

<br>
 <a name="tapiocaice"></a>
<h4>TAPIOCA ICE.</h4>

<p>1 teacupful of tapioca, 1/2 teacupful of sifted sugar, 1 tinned
pineapple. Soak the tapioca over night in cold water; in the
morning boil it in 1 quart of water until perfectly clear, and add
the sugar and pineapple syrup. Chop up the pineapple and mix it
with the boiling hot tapioca; turn the mixture into a wet mould.
When cold turn it out and serve with cream and sugar.</p>

<br>
 <a name="tipsycake"></a>
<h4>TIPSY CAKE.</h4>

<p>12 small sponge cakes, 1/2 lb. jam, 1 pint of custard made with
Allinson custard powder. Soak the sponge cakes in a little raisin
wine, arrange them on a deep glass dish in four layers, spread a
little jam on each layer and pour the custard round, decorate the
top with candid cherries and almonds blanched and split.</p>

<h2><!-- Page 91 --><a name='Page_91'></a><b>A WEEK'S MENU</b></h2>

<br>


<p>I have written the following menus to help those who are
beginning vegetarianism. When first starting, most housewives do
not know what to provide, and this is a source of anxiety. I
occasionally meet some who have been vegetarians a long time, but
confess that they do not know how to provide a nice meal. They
usually eat the plainest foods, because they know of no tasty
dishes. When visitors come, we like to provide tempting dishes for
them, and show them that appetising meals can be prepared without
the carcases of animals. I only give seven menus, that is, one for
each day of the week; but our dishes can be so varied that we can
have a different menu daily for weeks without any repetition. The
recipes here written give a fair idea to start with. Instead of
always using butter beans, or haricot beans, as directed in one of
these menus, lentils or split peas can be substituted. I have not
included macaroni cheese in these menus, because this dish is so
generally known; it can be introduced into any vegetarian dinner. I
have allowed three courses at the dinner, but they are really not
necessary. I give them to make the menus more complete. A
substantial soup and a pudding, or a savoury with vegetables and
sauce and a pudding, are sufficient for a good meal. In our own
household we rarely have more than two courses, and often only one
course. This article will be of assistance to all those who are
wishing to try a healthful and humane diet, and to those meat
eaters who wish to provide tasty meals for vegetarian friends.</p>

<br>


<div class="recipe">
<h4>TOMATO SOUP.</h4>

<p>1 tin of tomatoes or 2 lbs. of fresh ones, 1 large Spanish onion
or 1/2 lb. of smaller ones, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to
taste, 1 oz. of vermicelli and 2 bay leaves. Peel the onions and
chop up roughly; brown them with the butter in the saucepan in
which the soup is made. When the onion is browned, add the tomatoes
(the fresh ones must be sliced) and 3 pints of water. Let all cook
together for 1/2 an hour. Then drain the liquid through a sieve
without rubbing anything through. Return the liquid to the
saucepan, add the seasoning and the vermicelli; then allow the soup
to cook until the vermicelli is soft, which will be in about 10
minutes. Sago, tapioca, or a little dried julienne may be used
instead of the vermicelli.</p>

<br>


<h4>VEGETABLE PIE.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. each of tomatoes, turnips, carrots, potatoes, 1
tablespoonful of sago, 1 teaspoonful of mixed herbs, 3 hard-boiled
eggs, 2 oz. of butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Prepare the
vegetables, scald and skin the tomatoes, cut them in pieces not
bigger than a walnut, stew them in the butter and 1 pint of water
until nearly tender, add the pepper and salt and the mixed herbs.
When cooked, pour the vegetables into a pie-dish, sprinkle in the
sago, add water to make gravy if necessary. Cut the hard-boiled
eggs in quarters and place them on the top of the vegetables, cover
with a crust made from Allinson wholemeal, and bake until it is
brown.</p>

<br>


<h4>SHORT CRUST.</h4>

<p>10 oz. of Allinson wholemeal, 8 oz. of butter or vege-butter, 1
teacupful of cold water. Rub the butter into the meal, add the
water, mixing the paste with a knife. Roll it out, cut strips to
line the rim of the pie-dish, cover the vegetable with the crust,
decorate it, and bake the pie as directed.</p>

<br>


<h4>GOLDEN SYRUP PUDDING.</h4>

<p>10 oz. of Allinson wholemeal, 3 eggs, 1 pint of milk, and 1/2
lb. of golden syrup. Grease a pudding basin, and pour the golden
syrup into it; make a batter with the milk, meal, and eggs, and
<!-- Page 92 --><a name='Page_92'></a>pour this into the pudding
basin on the syrup, but do not stir the batter up with the syrup.
Place a piece of buttered paper on the top of the batter, tie a
cloth over the basin unless you have a basin with a fitting metal
lid, and steam the pudding for 2 1/2 hours in boiling water. Do not
allow any water to boil into the pudding. Dip the basin with the
pudding in it for 1 minute in cold water before turning it out, for
then it comes out more easily.</p>

<h2><i><b>MENU II.</b></i></h2>

<br>


<div class="recipe">
<h4>CLEAR CELERY SOUP.</h4>

<p>1 large head of celery or 2 small ones, 1 large Spanish onion, 2
oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, and 1 blade of mace. Chop
the onion and fry it brown in the butter (or vege-butter) in the
saucepan in which the soup is to be made. When brown, add 4 pints
of water, the celery washed and cut into pieces, the mace, the
pepper and salt. Let all cook until the celery is quite soft, then
drain the liquid from the vegetables. Return it to the saucepan,
boil the soup up, and add 1 oz. of vermicelli, sago, or Italian
paste; let the soup cook until this is quite soft, and serve with
sippets of Allinson wholemeal toast.</p>

<br>


<h4>BUTTER BEANS WITH PARSLEY SAUCE.</h4>

<p>Pick the beans, wash them and steep them over night in boiling
water, just covering them. Allow 2 or 3 oz. of beans for each
person. In the morning let them cook gently in the water they are
steeped in, with the addition of a little butter, until quite soft,
which will be in about 2 hours. The beans should be cooked in only
enough water to keep them from burning; therefore, when it boils
away, add only just sufficient for absorption. The sauce is made
thus: 1 pint of milk, 1 tablespoonful of Allinson wholemeal, a
handful of finely chopped parsley, the juice of 1/2 a lemon, pepper
and salt to taste. Boil the milk and thicken it with the meal,
which should first be smoothed with a little cold milk, then last
of all add the lemon juice, the seasoning, and the parsley. This
dish should be eaten with potatoes and green vegetables.</p>

<br>


<h4>GROUND RICE PUDDING.</h4>

<p>1 quart of milk, 6 oz. of ground rice, 1 egg, and any kind of
jam. Boil the milk, stir into it the ground rice previously
smoothed with some of the cold milk. Let the mixture gook gently
for 5 minutes, stir frequently, draw the saucepan to the side, and
when it has ceased to boil add the egg well whipped, and mix well.
Pour half of the mixture into a pie-dish, spread a layer of jam
over it, then pour the rest of the pudding mixture over the jam,
and let it brown lightly in the oven.</p>

<br>


<div class="recipe">
<h4>CARROT SOUP.</h4>

<p>4 good-sized carrots, 1 small head of celery, 1 fair sized
onion, a turnip, 3 oz. of Allinson breadcrumbs, 1-1/2 oz. of
butter, 1 blade of mace, pepper and salt to taste. Scrape and wash
the vegetables, and cut them up small; set them over the fire with
3 pints of water, the butter, bread, and mace. Let all boil
together until the vegetables are quite tender, and then rub them
through a sieve. Return the mixture to the saucepan, season with
pepper and salt, and if too thick add water to the soup, which
should be as thick as cream. Boil the soup up, and serve.</p>

<br>


<h4>CURRIED RICE AND TOMATOES.</h4>

<p>1/2 lb. of Patna rice, 1 dessertspoonful of curry powder, salt
to taste, and 1 oz. of butter. Wash the rice, put it over the fire
in cold water, let it just boil up, then drain the water off. Mix 1
pint of cold water with the curry powder, put this over the fire
with the rice, butter, and salt. Cover the rice with a piece of
buttered paper and let it simmer gently until the water is
absorbed. This will take about 20 minutes. Rice cooked this way
will have all the grains separate. For the tomatoes proceed as
follows: 1 lb. of tomatoes and a little butter, pepper, and salt.
Wash the tomatoes and place them in a flat tin with a few spoonfuls
of water; dust them with pepper and salt, and place little bits of
butter on each tomato. Bake them from 15 to 20 minutes, according
to the size of the tomatoes and the heat of the oven. Place the
rice in the centre of a hot flat dish, put the tomatoes round it,
pour the liquid over the rice, and serve.</p>

<br>


<h4>APPLE CHARLOTTE.</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of cooking apples, 1 teacupful of mixed currants and
sultanas, 1 <!-- Page 93 --><a name='Page_93'></a>heaped-up
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, 2 oz. of blanched and chopped
almonds, sugar to taste, Allinson wholemeal bread, and butter.
Pare, core, and cut up the apples and set them to cook with a
teacupful of water. Some apples require much more water than
others. When they are soft add the fruit picked and washed, the
cinnamon, and the almonds and sugar. Cut very thin slices of bread
and butter, line a buttered pie-dish with them. Place a layer of
apples over the buttered bread, and repeat the layers of bread and
apples until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of bread and
butter. Bake from 3/4 of an hour to 1 hour.</p>

<div class="recipe">
<h4>RICE SOUP.</h4>

<p>3 oz. of rice, 4 oz. of grated cheese, 1 breakfastcupful of
tomato juice, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Boil the
rice till tender in 2-1/2 pints of water, with the butter and
seasoning. When quite soft, add the tomato juice and the cheese;
stir until the soup boils and the cheese is dissolved, and serve.
If too much of the water has boiled away, add a little more.</p>

<br>


<h4>HOT-POT.</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of potatoes, 3/4 lb. of onions, 1 breakfastcupful of
tinned tomatoes or 1/2 lb. of sliced fresh ones, 1 teaspoonful of
mixed herbs, 1-1/2 oz. butter, pepper and salt to taste. Those who
do not like tomatoes can leave them out, and the dish will still be
very savoury. The potatoes should be peeled, washed, and cut into
thin slices, and the onions peeled and cut into thin slices.
Arrange the vegetables and tomatoes in layers; dust a little pepper
and salt between the layer, and finish with a layer of potatoes.
Cut the butter into little bits, place them on the top of the
potatoes, fill the dish with hot water, and bake the hot-pot for 2
hours or more in a hot oven. Add a little more hot water if
necessary while baking to make up for what is lost in the
cooking.</p>

<br>


<h4>CABINET PUDDING.</h4>

<p>4 slices of Allinson bread toasted, 1-1/4 pints of milk, 8 eggs,
1 oz. of butter, sugar to taste, 2 oz. of chopped almonds, 1
teacupful of mixed currants and sultanas and any kind of
flavouring&mdash;cinammon, lemon, vanilla, or almond essence. Crush
the toast in your hands, and soak it in the milk. Whip the eggs up,
melt the butter, and add both to the soaked toast. Thoroughly mix
all the various ingredients together. Butter a pie-dish and pour
the pudding mixture into it; put a few bits of butter on the top,
and bake the pudding for 1 hour in a moderately hot oven.</p>

<h4>LEEK SOUP.</h4>

<p>2 bunches of leeks, 1-1/2 pints of milk, 1 oz. of butter, 1 lb.
of potatoes, pepper and salt to taste, and the juice of 1 lemon.
Cut off the coarse part of the green ends of the leeks, and cut the
leeks lengthways, so as to be able to brush out the grit. Wash the
leeks well, and see no grit remains, then out them in short pieces.
Peel, wash, and cut up the potatoes, then cook both vegetables with
2 pints of water. When the vegetables are quite tender, rub them
through a sieve. Return the mixture to the saucepan, add the
butter, milk, and seasoning, and boil the soup up again. Before
serving, add the Lemon juice; serve with sippets of toast or
Allinson rusks.</p>

<p>4 slices Allinson bread toast, 8 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 3 oz. of
butter, 1 lb. of mushrooms, 1 small onion chopped fine, and pepper
and salt to taste. Crush the toast with your hand and soak it in
the milk; add the eggs well whipped. Peel, wash, and out up the
mushrooms, and fry them and the onion in the butter. When they have
cooked in the butter for 10 minutes add them to the other
ingredients, and season with pepper and salt. Pour the mixture into
a greased pie-dish and bake the savoury for 1 hour. Serve with
green vegetables, potatoes, and tomato sauce.</p>

<p>1 quart of milk, 2 oz. of potato flour, 2 oz. of Allinson fine
wheatmeal, 1 heaped-up tablespoonful of cocoa, 1 dessertspoonful of
vanilla essence, and sugar to taste. Smooth the potato flour,
wheatmeal, and cocoa with some of the milk. Add sugar to the rest
of the milk, boil it up and thicken it with the smoothed
ingredients. Let all simmer for 10 minutes, stir frequently,
<!-- Page 94 --><a name='Page_94'></a>add the vanilla, and mix it
well through. Pour the mixture into a wetted mould; turn out when
cold, and serve plain or with cold white sauce.</p>

<h4>ARTICHOKE SOUP.</h4>

<p>1 lb. each of artichokes and potatoes, 1 Spanish onion, 1 oz. of
butter, 1 pint of milk, and pepper and salt to taste. Peel, wash,

<br>


<h4>YORKSHIRE PUDDING.</h4>

<p>4 eggs, 1/2 lb. of Allinson fine wheatmeal, 1 pint of milk,
pepper and salt to taste, 1 oz. of butter. Thoroughly beat the
eggs, make a batter of them with the flour and milk, and season it.
Well butter a shallow tin, pour in the batter, and cut the rest of
the butter in bits. Scatter them over the batter and bake it 3/4 of
an hour. Serve with vegetables, potatoes, and sauce. To use half
each of Allinson breakfast oats and wheatmeal flour will be found
very tasty.</p>

<br>


<h4>BAKED CARAMEL CUSTARD.</h4>

<p>1-1/2 pints of milk, 5 eggs, vanilla essence, 4 oz. of castor
sugar for the caramel, and a little more sugar to sweeten the
custard. Heat the milk, whip up the eggs, and carefully stir the
hot milk into the beaten eggs; flavour with vanilla and sugar to
taste. Meanwhile put the castor sugar into a small enamelled
saucepan and stir it over a quick fire until it is quite melted and
brown. Add about 2 tablespoonfuls of hot water to the caramel, stir
thoroughly, and pour it into a tin mould or a cake tin. Let the
caramel run all round the sides of the tin; pour in the custard,
and bake it in a moderate oven, standing in a larger tin of boiling
water, until the custard is set. Let it get cold, turn out, and
serve. This is a very dainty sweet dish.</p>

<h4>POTATO SOUP.</h4>

<p>2 lbs. of potatoes, 1/2 a stick of celery or the outer stalks of
a head of celery, saving the heart for table use, 1 large Spanish
onion, 1 pint of milk, 1 oz. of butter, a heaped-up tablespoonful
of finely chopped Parsley, and pepper and salt to taste. Peel,

dusting with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Finish with a good
sprinkling of cheese. Whip up the eggs, mix them with the milk, and
pour the mixture over the bread and cheese in the pie-dish. Pour
the custard back into the basin, and repeat the pouring over the
contents of the pie-dish. If this is done two or three times, the
top slices of bread and butter get soaked, and then bake better.
This should also be done when a bread and butter pudding is made.
Bake the savoury until brown, which it will be in about 3/4 of an
hour.</p>

<br>


<h4>ORANGE MOULD.</h4>

juices to make 1 quart of liquid; put 1-1/2 pints of this over the
fire with the sugar. With the rest smooth the cornflour and mix
with it the eggs well beaten. When the liquid in the saucepan is
near the boil, stir into it the mixture of egg and cornflour. Keep
stirring the mixture over a gentle fire until it has cooked 5

<h4>BARLEY.</h4>

<p>The plants <i>Hordeum Distichon</i> and <i>Hordeum Vulgare</i>
supply most of the barley used in this country. Barley has been
used as a food from time out of mind. We find frequent mention of
it in the Bible, and in old Latin and Greek books. According to
Pliny, an ancient Roman writer, the gladiators were called
Hordearii, or "barley eaters," because they were fed on this grain
whilst training. These Hordearii were like our pugilists, except
that they often fought to the death. Barley has been used from very
ancient days for making an intoxicating drink. In Nubia, the liquor
made from barley was called Bouzah, from which we get our English
word "booze," meaning an intoxicating drink. The first intoxicant
drink made in this country was ale, and it was made from barley.
Hops were not used for beer or ale in those days. Barley is a good
food, and was the chief food of our peasantry until the beginning
of the nineteenth century. Barley contains about 7 per cent. of
sugar, and its flesh-forming matter is in the form of casin the
same as is found in cheese. This casin is not elastic like the
gluten of wheat, so that one cannot make a light bread from barley.
Here is the chemical composition of barley meal:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class='note'><a name='Footnote_A_9'></a><a href=
'#FNanchor_A_9'>[A]</a> There is 2.5 per cent. of fat in barley,
and 7 per cent. of sugar.</div>
</center>

<p>From this analysis we can judge that barley contains all the
constituents of a good food. In it we find casin and albumen for
our muscles; starch, sugar, and fat to keep us warm and give force;
and there is a fair percentage of mineral matter for our bones and
teeth.</p>

<p>Allinson's prepared barley may be eaten as porridge or pudding
(see directions), and is much more nourishing than rice pudding; it
is also good for adding to broth or soup, and to vegetable stews,
and is most useful for making gruel and barley water. Barley water
contains a great deal of nourishment, more than beef tea, and it
can be drunk as a change from tea, coffee, and cocoa. During
illness I advise and use barley water and milk, mixed in equal
parts, and find this mixture invaluable.</p>

<br>


<div class="recipe"><a name="barleyforbabies"></a>
<h4>BARLEY FOR BABIES.</h4>

<p>Put 1 teaspoonful of Allinson's barley into a breakfast cup; mix
this perfectly smooth with cold milk and cold water in equal parts,
until the cup is full. Pour into a saucepan and bring to the boil,
stirring all the time to prevent it getting lumpy.</p>

<br>
 <a name="barleygruel"></a>
<h4>BARLEY GRUEL.</h4>

<p>Mix 1 large tablespoonful of Allinson's barley with a little
cold water, add to this 1 pint of boiling milk and water, boil
together a few minutes, take from the fire, let cool, then eat. A
little nutmeg gives a pleasant flavour.</p>

<br>
 <a name="barleyforinvalidsandadults"></a>
<h4>BARLEY FOR INVALIDS AND ADULTS.</h4>

<p>Use 3 teaspoonfuls of Allinson's barley to 1/2 pint of milk and
water, and prepare as "Barley for Babies."</p>

<br>
 <!-- Page 99 --><a name='Page_99'></a><a name="barleyjelly"></a>
<h4>BARLEY JELLY.</h4>

<p>Wash, then steep, 6 oz. of pearl barley for 6 hours, pour 31/2
pints of boiling water upon it, stew it quickly in a covered jar in
a hot oven till perfectly soft and the water absorbed. When half
done, add 6 oz. of sugar and a few drops of essence of lemon. 21/2
hours is the correct time for stewing the barley, and it is then a
better colour than if longer in preparation. Pour it into a mould
to set.</p>

<br>
 <a name="barleyporridge"></a>
<h4>BARLEY PORRIDGE.</h4>

<p>Take 3 tablespoonfuls of Allinson's barley, mix smoothly with
1/2 pint of cold water, add 1/2 pint of boiling milk, and boil 5 to
10 minutes. Pour on shallow plates to cool, then eat with Allinson
wholemeal bread, biscuits, rusks, or toast, or stewed fruits.</p>

<br>
 <a name="barleypuddings"></a>
<h4>BARLEY PUDDINGS.</h4>

<p>Take 2 tablespoonfuls of Allinson's barley, mix smoothly with a
little milk, pour upon it the remainder of 1 pint of milk, flavour
and sweeten to taste, boil 2 or 3 minutes, then add 2 eggs lightly
beaten, pour into a pie-dish, and bake to a golden brown. Eat with
stewed, fresh, or dried fruits.</p>

<br>
 <a name="barleywater"></a>
<h4>BARLEY WATER.</h4>

<p>Mix smoothly 2 tablespoonfuls of Allinson's barley with a little
cold water, then add it to 1 quart of water in a saucepan, and
bring to the boil. Pour into a jug, and when cool add the juice of
1 or 2 oranges or lemons. A little sugar may be added when
permissible.</p>

<br>
 <a name="blackcurranttea"></a>
<h4>BLACK CURRANT TEA.</h4>

<p>1 large tablespoonful of black currant jam, 1 pint boiling
water. Stir well together, strain when cold, and serve with a
little crushed ice if allowed.</p>

<br>
 <a name="brantea"></a>
<h4>BRAN TEA.</h4>

<p>Mix 1 oz. of bran with 1 pint of water, boil for 1/2 hour,
strain, and drink cool. A little orange or lemon juice is a
pleasant addition. When this is used as a drink at breakfast or
tea, a little sugar may be added to it.</p>

<br>
 <a name="brunak"></a>
<h4>BRUNAK.</h4>

<p>Take 1-1/2 or 2 teaspoonfuls of Brunak for each large cupful
required, mix it with sufficient water, and boil for 2 or 3 minutes
to get the full flavour, then strain and add hot milk and sugar to
taste. Can be made in a coffee-pot, teapot, or jug if preferred.
May be stood on the hob to draw; or if you have any left over from
a previous meal it can be boiled up again and served as freshly
made.</p>

<br>
 <a name="cocoa"></a>
<h4>COCOA.</h4>

<p>Put 1 teaspoonful of N.F. cocoa into a breakfast cup; make into
a paste with a little cold milk. Fill the cup with milk and water
in equal parts, pour into lined saucepan, and boil for 1 minute,
stirring carefully. This is best without sugar, and should be given
cool.</p>

<br>
 <a name="lemonwater"></a>
<h4>LEMON WATER.</h4>

<p>Squeeze the juice of 1/2 a Lemon into a tumbler of warm or cold
water; add just sufficient sugar to take off the tartness. Or the
lemon may be peeled first, then cut in slices, and boiling water
poured over them; a little of the peel grated in, and sugar added
to taste.</p>

<br>
 <a name="oatmealporridge"></a>
<h4>OATMEAL PORRIDGE.</h4>

<p>Most people, I think, may know how to make porridge; but it is
useful to know that if you take 1 pint of water to each heaped-up
breakfastcupful of Allinson breakfast oats, you have just the
amount of water for a fairly firm porridge. When the water has
boiled, and you have stirred in the oats, place the saucepan on the
side of the stove on an asbestos mat. Only an occasional stirring
will be required, and there is no fear of burning the porridge. If
the porridge is preferred thinner, 1 even cupful to 1 pint of water
will be found the proportion.</p>

<br>
 <a name="oatmealwater"></a>
<h4>OATMEAL WATER.</h4>

<p>This is very useful in cases of illness, and is a most pleasant
drink in hot weather, when it can be flavoured with lemon juice and
sweetened a little. To 1 quart of water take 3 oz. of coarse
oatmeal or Allinson breakfast oats. Let it simmer gently on the
stove for about 2 hours. Then rub it through a fine sieve or gravy
strainer; rub it well through, adding a little more hot water when
rubbed dry, so as to get all the goodness out of the oatmeal. If it
is thick when it has been rubbed through sufficiently, thin it down
with water or hot milk&mdash;half oatmeal water and half milk is a
good mixture. Nothing better <!-- Page 100 --><a name=
'Page_100'></a>can be given to adults or children in cases of colds
or feverish attacks. It is nourishing and soothing, and in cases of
diarrhoea remedial.</p>

<br>
 <a name="ricepudding"></a>
<h4>RICE PUDDING.</h4>

<p>Wash the rice, put it into a pie-dish, cover with cold water,
and bake until the rice is nearly soft throughout. Beat up 1 egg
with milk, mix with this a little cinnamon or other flavouring, and
pour it over the rice; add sugar to taste, and bake until set.</p>

<p>Sago, tapioca, semolina, and hominy puddings are made after the
manner of rice pudding.</p>

should be given cool.</p>

COOKERY</b></h2>

<br>


<h4>I.</h4>

<a name="breakfasts"></a>
<h4>BREAKFASTS.</h4>

<br>


<p>As breakfast is the first meal of the day, it must vary in
quantity and quality according to the work afterwards to be done.
The literary man will best be suited with a light meal, whilst
those engaged in hard work will require a heavier one. The clerk,
student, business man, or professional man, will find one of the
three following breakfasts to suit him well:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. I.&mdash;Allinson wholemeal bread, 6 to 8 oz., cut thick,
with a scrape of butter; with this take from 6 to 8 oz. of ripe,
raw fruit, or seasonable green stuff; at the end of the meal have a
cup of cool, thin, and not too sweet cocoa, or Brunak, or a cup of
cool milk and water, bran tea, or even a cup of water that has been
boiled and allowed to go nearly cold. An egg may be taken at this
meal by those luxuriously inclined, and if not of a costive habit.
The fruits allowed are all the seasonable ones, or dried prunes if
there is a tendency to constipation. The green stuffs include
watercress, tomatoes, celery, cucumber, and salads. Lettuce must be
eaten sparingly at this meal, as it causes a sleepy feeling. Sugar
must be used in strict moderation; jam, or fruits stewed with much
sugar must be avoided, as they cause mental confusion and
disinclination for brain work.</p>

<p>No. II.&mdash;3 to 4 oz. of Allinson wholemeal or crushed wheat,
coarse oatmeal or groats, hominy, maize or barley meal may be
boiled for 1/2 an hour with milk and water, a very little salt
being taken by those who use it. When ready, the porridge should be
poured upon platters or soup-plates, allowed to cool, and then
eaten with bread. Stewed fruits may be eaten with the porridge, or
fresh fruit may be taken afterwards. When porridge is made with
water, and then eaten with milk, too much fluid enters the stomach,
digestion is delayed, and waterbrash frequently occurs. Meals
absorb at least thrice their weight of water in cooking, so that 4
oz. of meal will make at least 16 oz. of porridge. Sugar, syrup,
treacle, or molasses should not be eaten with porridge, as they are
apt to cause acid risings in the mouth, heartburn, and flatulence.
In summer, wholemeal and barleymeal make the best porridges, and
they may be taken cold; in autumn, winter, and early spring,
oatmeal or hominy are the best, and may be eaten lukewarm. When
porridges are eaten, no other course should be taken afterwards,
but the entire meal should be made of porridge, bread, and fruit.
Neither cocoa nor any other fluids should be taken after a porridge
meal, or the stomach becomes filled with too much liquid, and
indigestion results. To make the best flavoured porridge, the
coarse meal or crushed grain should be stewed in the oven for an
hour or two; it may be made the day before it is required, and just
warmed through before being brought to the table. This may be eaten
with Allinson wholemeal bread and a small quantity of milk, or
fresh or stewed fruit.</p>

<p>No. III.&mdash;Cut 4 to 6 oz. of Allinson wholemeal bread into
dice, put into a basin, and pour over about 1/2 a pint of boiling
milk, or milk and water; cover the basin with a plate, let it stand
ten minutes, and then eat slowly. Sugar or salt should not be added
to the bread and milk. An apple, pear, orange, grapes, banana, or
other seasonable fruit may be eaten afterwards. No other foods
should be eaten at this meal, but only the bread, milk, and
fruit.</p>

<p>Labourers, artisans, and those engaged <!-- Page 103 --><a name=
'Page_103'></a>in hard physical work may take any of the above
breakfasts. If they take No. I., they may allow themselves from 8
to 10 oz. of bread, and should drink a large cup of Brunak
afterwards, as their work requires a fair amount of liquid to carry
off some of the heat caused by the burning up of food whilst they
are at work. If No. II. breakfast is taken, 6 to 8 oz. of meal may
be allowed. If No. III. breakfast is eaten, then 6 or 8 oz. of
bread and 2 pint of milk may be taken.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Women require about a quarter less food than men do,
and must arrange the quantity accordingly.</p>

<h2><b>II.</b></h2>

<a name="middaymeals"></a>
<h4>MIDDAY MEALS.</h4>

<br>


<p>The meal in the middle of the day must vary according to the
work to be done after it. If much mental strain has to be borne or
business done, the meal must be a light one, and should be lunch
rather than dinner. Those engaged in hard physical work should make
their chief meal about midday, and have a light repast in the
evening.</p>

<p>LUNCH.&mdash;One of the simplest lunches is that composed of
Allinson wholemeal bread and fruit. From 6 to 8 oz. of bread may be
eaten, and about 1/2 lb. of any raw fruit that is in season;
afterwards a glass of lemon water or bran tea, Brunak, or a cup of
thin, cool, and not too sweet cocoa may be taken, or a tumbler of
milk and water slowly sipped. The fruit may be advantageously
replaced by a salad, which is a pleasant change from fruit, and
sits as lightly on the stomach. Wholemeal biscuits and fruit, with
a cup of fluid, form another good lunch. A basin of any kind of
porridge with milk, but without sugar, also makes a light and good
midday repast; or a basin of thin vegetable soup and bread, or
macaroni, or even plain vegetables. The best lunch of all will be
found in Allinson wholemeal bread, and salad or fruit, as it is not
wise to burden the system with too much cooked food, and one never
feels so light after made dishes as after bread and fruit.</p>

<p>Labouring men who wish to take something with them to work will
find 12 oz. of Allinson wholemeal bread, 1/2 lb. fresh fruit, and a
large mug of Brunak or cocoa satisfy them well; or instead of cocoa
they may have milk and water, lemon water, lemonade, oatmeal water,
or some harmless non-alcoholic drink. Another good meal is made
from 1/2 lb. of the wholemeal bread and butter, and a 1/4 lb. of
peas pudding spread between the slices. The peas can be flavoured
with a little pepper, salt, and mustard by those who still cling to
condiments. 12 oz. of the wholemeal bread, 2 or 3 oz. of cheese,
some raw fruit, or an onion, celery, watercress, or other
greenstuff, with a large cup of fluid, form another good meal. 1/2
lb. of coarse oatmeal or crushed wheat made into porridge the day
before, and warmed up at midday, will last a man well until he gets
home at night. Or a boiled bread pudding may be taken to work,
warmed and eaten. This is made from the wholemeal bread, which is
soaked in hot water until soft, then crushed or crumbled, some
currants or raisins are then mixed with this, a little soaked sago
stirred in; lastly, a very little sugar and spice are added as a
flavouring. This mixture is then tied up in a pudding cloth and
boiled, or it may be put in a pudding basin covered with a cloth,
and boiled in a saucepan. A pleasing addition to this pudding is
some finely chopped almonds, or Brazil nuts.</p>

<a name="dinners"></a>
<h4>DINNERS.</h4>

<br>


<p>As dinner is the chief meal of the day it should consist of
substantial food. It may be taken in the middle of the day by those
who work hard; but if taken at night, at least five hours must
elapse before going to bed, so that the stomach may have done its
work before sleep comes on.</p>

<p>A dinner may consist of many courses or different dishes, but
the simpler the dishes and the less numerous the courses the
better. A person who makes his meal from one dish only is the
wisest of all. He who limits himself to two courses does well, but
he who takes more than three courses lays up for himself stomach
troubles or disorder of the system. When only one course is had,
then good solid food must be eaten; when two courses are the rule,
a moderate amount of each should be taken; and it three different
dishes are provided, a proportionately lighter quantity of each.
Various dishes may be served for the dinner <!-- Page 104 --><a
name='Page_104'></a>meal, such as soups, omelettes, savouries,
pies, batters, and sweet courses.</p>

<p>The plainest dinner any one can eat is that composed of Allinson
wholemeal bread and raw fruit. A man in full work may eat from 12
to 16 oz. of the wholemeal bread, and about the same quantity of
ripe raw fruit. The bread is best dry, the next best is when a thin
scrape of butter is spread on it. If hard physical work has to be
done, a cup of Brunak, cocoa, milk and water, or lemon water,
should be drunk at the end of the meal. In winter these fluids
might be taken warmed, but in summer they are best cool or cold.
This wholesome fare can be varied in a variety of ways; some might
like a salad instead of the fruit, and others may prefer cold
vegetables. A few Brazil nuts, almonds, walnuts, some Spanish nuts,
or a piece of cocoanut may be eaten with the bread in winter.
Others not subject to piles, constipation, or eczema, &amp;c., may
take 2 oz. of cheese and an onion with their bread, or a
hard-boiled egg. This simple meal can be easily carried to work, or
on a journey. Wholemeal biscuits or Allinson rusks may be used
instead of bread if one is on a walking tour, cycling trip, or
boating excursion, or even on ordinary occasions for a change.</p>

<p>Of cooked dinners, the simplest is that composed of potatoes
baked, steamed, or boiled in their skins, eaten with another
vegetable, sauce, and the wholemeal bread. Baked potatoes are the
most wholesome, and their skins should always be eaten; steamed
potatoes are next; whilst boiled ones, especially if peeled, are
not nearly so good. Any seasonable vegetable may be steamed and
eaten with the potatoes, such as cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts,
broccoli, carrot, turnip, beetroot, parsnips, or boiled celery, or
onions. Recipes for the sauces used with this course will be found
in another part of the book; they may be parsley, onion, caper,
tomato, or brown gravy sauce. This dinner may be varied by adding
to it a poached, fried, or boiled egg. As a second course, baked
apples, or stewed fresh fruit and bread may be eaten; or Allinson
bread pudding, or rice, sago, tapioca, or macaroni pudding with
stewed fruit. Persons troubled with piles, varicose veins,
varicocele, or constipation must avoid this dinner as much as
possible. If they do eat it they must be sure to eat the skins of
the potatoes, and take the Allinson bread pudding or bread and
fruit afterwards, avoiding puddings of rice, sago, tapioca, or
macaroni.</p>

<a name="eveningmeal"></a>
<h4>EVENING MEAL.</h4>

<br>


<p>Evening meal or tea meal should be the last meal at which solid
food is eaten. It should always be a light one, and the later it is
eaten the less substantial it should be. Heavy or hard work after
tea is no excuse for a supper. This meal must be taken at least
three hours before retiring. From 4 to 6 oz. of Allinson wholemeal
bread may be allowed with a poached or lightly boiled egg, a salad,
or fruit, or some kind of green food. The fluid drunk may be
Brunak, cocoa, milk and water, bran tea, or even plain water,
boiled and taken cool. Those who are restless at night, nervous, or
sleepless must not drink tea at this meal. Fruit in the evening is
not considered good, and when taken it should be cooked rather than
raw. Boiled celery will be found to be lighter on the stomach at
this meal than the raw vegetable. When it is boiled, as little
water as possible should be used; the water that the celery is
boiled in may be thickened with Allinson fine wheatmeal, made into
sauce, and poured over the cooked celery; by this means we do not
loose the valuable salts dissolved out of the food by boiling.
Mustard and cress, watercress, radishes, and spring onions may be
eaten if the evening meal is taken 4 or 5 hours before going to
bed. Those who are away from home all day, and who take their food
to their work may have some kind of milk pudding at this meal.
Wheatmeal blancmange, or cold milk pudding may occasionally be
eaten those who are costive will find a boiled onion or some
braized onions very useful. Boil the onion in as little water as
possible and serve up with the liquor it is boiled in. To prepare
braized onions, fry them first until nicely brown, using butter or
olive oil, then add a cupful of boiling water to the contents of
the frying pan, cover with a plate, and let cook for an hour. This
is not really a rich food, but one easy of digestion and of great
use to the sleepless. Those who want to rise early must make their
last meal a light <!-- Page 105 --><a name='Page_105'></a>one.
Those troubled with dreams or restlessness must do the same. Very
little fluid should be taken last thing at night, as it causes
persons to rise frequently to empty the bladder.</p>

<a name="suppers"></a>
<h4>SUPPERS.</h4>

<br>


<p>Hygienic livers will never take such meals, even if tea has been
early, or hard work done since the tea meal was taken. No solid
food must be eaten. The most that should be consumed is a cup of
Brunak, cocoa, lemon water, bran tea, or even boiled water, but
never milk. In winter warm drinks may be taken, and in summer cool
ones.</p>

<a name="drinks"></a>
<h4>DRINKS.</h4>

<br>


<p>LEMON WATER is made by squeezing the juice of 1/2 a lemon into a
tumbler of warm or cold water; to this is added just enough sugar
to take off the tartness. Some peel the lemon first, then cut in
slices, pour boiling water over the slices, grate in a little of
the peel, and add sugar to taste.</p>

<p>BRUNAK.&mdash;Take 1-1/2 to 2 teaspoonfuls of Brunak for each
large cupful required, mix it with sufficient water, and boil for 2
or 3 minutes to get the full flavour, then strain and add hot milk
and sugar to taste. Can be made in a coffee-pot, teapot, or jug if
preferred. May be stood on the hob to draw; or it you have any left
over from a previous meal it can be boiled up again and served as
freshly made.</p>

<p>COCOA.&mdash;This is best made by putting a teaspoonful of any
good cocoa, such as Allinson's, into a breakfast cup; boiling water
is then poured upon this and stirred; 1 tablespoonful of milk must
be added to each cup, and 1 teaspoonful of sugar where sugar is
used, or 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of condensed milk and no extra
sugar.</p>

<p>BRAN TEA.&mdash;Mix 1 oz. of bran with 1 pint of water; boil for
1/2 an hour, strain, and drink cool. A little orange or lemon juice
is a pleasant addition. When this is used as a drink at breakfast
or tea, a little milk and sugar may be added to it.</p>

<p>CHOCOLATE.&mdash;Allow 1 bar of Allinson's chocolate for each
cup of fluid. Break the chocolate in bits, put into a saucepan, add
a little boiling water, put on the fire, and stir until the
chocolate is dissolved, then add rest of fluid and boil 2 or 3
minutes. Pour the chocolate into cups, and add about 1
tablespoonful of fresh milk to each cup, but no extra sugar. The
milk may be added to the chocolate whilst boiling, if desired.</p>

<a name='WHOLEMEAL_COOKERY'></a>
<h2><!-- Page 106 --><a name='Page_106'></a><b>WHOLEMEAL
COOKERY</b></h2>

<br>


<p>Most of my readers have received great benefit from eating
wholemeal bread instead of white, and they may all gain further
good it they will use Allinson wholemeal flour in place of white
for all cooking purposes. Those who are at all constipated, or who
suffer from piles, varicose veins, varicocele, back pain, &amp;c.,
should never use white flour in cooking. Those who are inclined to
stoutness should use wholemeal flour rather than white. Hygienists
and health-reformers should not permit white flour to enter their
houses, unless it is to make bill-stickers' paste or some like
stuff. Toothless children must not be given any food but milk and
water until they cut at least two teeth.</p>

<p>Every kind of cookery can be done with wholemeal flour. In
making ordinary white sauce or vegetable sauce, this is how we make
it; Chop fine some onion or parsley; boil in a small quantity of
water, stir in wholemeal flour and milk, add a little pepper and
salt, thin with hot water, and thus produce a sauce that helps down
vegetables and potatoes. In making a brown sauce we put a little
butter or olive oil in the frying-pan; let it bubble and sputter,
dredge in Allinson wholemeal flour, stir it round with a knife
until browned, add boiling water, pepper, salt, a little ketchup,
and you then have a nice brown sauce for many dishes. If we wish to
make it very tasty we fry a finely chopped onion first and add that
to it. White sweet sauce is made from wholemeal flour, milk, sugar,
and a little cinnamon, cloves, lemon juice, vanilla, or other
flavouring. Yorkshire puddings, Norfolk dumplings, batter puddings,
and such puddings can all be made with wholemeal flour, and are
more nourishing and healthy, and do not lie so heavy as those made
from white flour. Pancakes can be made from wholemeal flour just as
well as from white.</p>

<p>All kinds of pastry, pie-crusts, under crusts, &amp;c., are best
made from Allinson wholemeal, and if much butter, lard, or dripping
is used they will lie just as heavy, and cause heartburn just as
much as those made with white flour. There is a substitute for
pie-crusts that is very tasty, and not at all harmful. We call it
"batter," and it can be used for savoury dishes as well as sweet
ones.</p>

<br>


<div class="recipe"><a name="savourydishesmadewithbatter"></a>
<h4>SAVOURY DISHES MADE WITH BATTER.</h4>

<p>Fry some potatoes, then some onions, put them in layers in a
pie-dish; next make a batter of Allinson wholemeal flour, 1 or 2
eggs, milk, and a little pepper with salt; pour over the fried
vegetables as they lie in the dish, bake in the oven from 1/2 an
hour to 1 hour, until, in fact, the batter has formed a crust; eat
with the usual vegetables. Or chop fine cold vegetables of any
kind, fry onions and add to them, put in a pie-dish, pour some of
the batter as above over them, and bake. All kinds of cold
vegetables, cold soup, porridge, &amp;c., can go into this, and
tinned or fresh tomatoes will make it more savoury. Tomatoes may be
wiped, put in a pie-dish, batter poured over, and then baked, and
are very tasty this way. Butter adds to the flavour of these
dishes, but does not make them more wholesome or more
nourishing.</p>

<br>
 <a name="stewedfruitpudding"></a>
<h4>STEWED FRUIT PUDDING.</h4>

<p>Cut Allinson wholemeal bread into slices a little over a 1/4 of
an inch thick, line a pie-dish with these, having first cut off the
hard crusts. Then fill the dish with hot stewed fruit of any kind,
and at once cover it with a layer of bread, gently pressed on the
hot fruit. Turn <!-- Page 107 --><a name='Page_107'></a>out when
cold on to a flat dish, pour over it a white sauce, and serve.</p>

<br>
 <a name="substantialbreadpuddings"></a>
<h4>SUBSTANTIAL BREAD PUDDINGS.</h4>

<p>Soak crusts or slices of Allinson bread in hot water, then break
fine in a pie-dish, add to this soaked currants, raisins, chopped
nuts or almonds, a beaten-up egg, and milk, with sugar and spice,
and bake in the oven. Or tie the whole up in a pudding-cloth and
boil. Serve with white sauce or eat with stewed fresh fruit. These
puddings can be eaten hot or cold; labourers can take them to their
work for dinner, and their children cannot have a better meal to
take to school.</p>

<br>
 <a name="sweetbatter"></a>
<h4>SWEET BATTER.</h4>

<p>Mix Allinson wholemeal flour, milk, 1 or 2 eggs together, and a
little sugar and cinnamon, and it is ready for use. Stew ripe
cherries, gooseberries, currants, raspberries, plums, damsons, or
other ripe fruit in a jar, pour into a pie-dish; pour into the
batter named above, bake, and this is a good substitute for a fruit
pie. Prunes can be treated the same way, or the batter can be
cooked in the saucepan, poured into a mould, allowed to go cold and
set; then it forms wholemeal blancmange, and may be eaten with
stewed fresh fruit. Rusks, cheesecakes, buns, biscuits, and other
like articles as Madeira cake, pound cake, wedding cake, &amp;c.,
can all be made of wholemeal flour.</p>

<br>
 <a name="wholemealsoup"></a>
<h4>WHOLEMEAL SOUP.</h4>

<p>Chop fine any kinds of greens or vegetables, stew in a little
water until thoroughly done, then add plenty of hot water, with
pepper and salt to taste, and a 1/4 of an hour before serving, pour
in a cupful of the "Sweet Batter," and you get a thick, nourishing
soup. To make it more savoury, fry your vegetables before making
into soup.</p>

<h1>The PERFECT BREAD</h1>

<br>


<div class="recipe"><img src="images/image04.jpg" width="302"
height="259" alt="Allinson loaf" border="0" align="left">

<p>The Perfect Bread and the Perfect <i>Food</i> is the best
description of Allinson Wholemeal Bread, which combines the maximum
of nutriment at a minimum cost. Other essentials of perfection are
amply proved by the following facts:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Palatability.</b> Allinson Bread retains to the full the
delicious flavour of fresh-gleaned wheat.</p>

<p><b>Nourishment.</b> Containing the whole of the grain, it
consistently affords that 100% of Brain, Bone and Muscle building
qualities provided by unadulterated wheat.</p>

<p>&mdash;Which wheat is so scientifically cleaned and ground by a
patented stone mill process that Allinson Bread is perfectly
digestible under all conditions.</p>

<p><b>Economy.</b> In view of recent advice tendered by the
Government on food economy, the <i>Fact</i> that a 2 lb. (approx.)
Allinson loaf contains as much real nutriment as a pound of beef
(costing <!-- Page 121 --><a name='Page_121'></a>nearly three times
as much) is a point of economy that none can afford to
overlook.</p>

<p>Apart from the questions of economy and nourishment, Allinson
Wholemeal Bread is undoubtedly the ideal diet when eaten with fresh
fruit or salads.</p>

<p><b>In Addition</b>, Allinson Bread is unique as the
health-maintaining diet because it retains those essentials of the
wheat expressly designed by Nature as a Natural and all sufficient
corrective.</p>

<br>


<p><b>Free Sample 2 lb. Loaf.</b></p>

<p>Send 4d. stamps (to pay carriage) for free 2 lb. sample loaf and
N.F. Biscuits, together with free illustrated booklet on "Bread and
Health," name and address of nearest Allinson Baker, and
particulars of monthly prize distribution of 23 cash prizes and 100

to a mother's milk. Usually the milk of the cow is given as a
substitute for mother's milk. It takes the place of mother's milk
fairly well, but it has its drawbacks, the chief one is that it
curdles in heavy cheese-like masses, which lie heavy on the
stomach, are long in digesting, and cause discomfort. The aim of
the scientific and practical physician is to prevent this heavy
curdling while allowing cow's milk to be taken.</p>

<p><b>Some Doctors Advise</b> lime water to be added to the milk;
this causes the milk to curdle in flakes, but it hinders digestion,
gives rise to constipation, and may lead to stone in the bladder.
Some advise barley, wheat, oatmeal or rice Water, etc., to be added
to the cow's milk. These often answer the purpose, but they have
their drawbacks. They all are a trouble to make; barley and rice
water are constipating, and oatmeal water is heating.</p>

<p><b>Knowing these Drawbacks</b> I invented Natural Food. This,
when added to cow's milk, will prevent it curdling in heavy masses,
<!-- Page 127 --><a name='Page_127'></a>is easily prepared, and
besides this, it contains all that the growing baby needs, and thus
is a valuable addition to the milk; it nourishes all the organs but
clogs none. Nine-tenths of the foods made for babies are made on
wrong lines. They either contain too much sugar, or they are too
starchy, or they are deficient in bone-forming materials, or in
laxative principles, or else they contain injurious chemicals.</p>

<p><b>When Inventing Natural Food</b> I tried to overcome every
obstacle and make it the best Food for infants in the market; the
success that has followed its use justifies me in saying that it is
second to none. I am a practical physician, and it is my boast that
I rarely lose a child in illness, and when babies are reared as I
advise they are usually the admiration of all, and live to be a
source of delight to their parents.</p>

<p><b>This is the Way</b> to prepare the food for babies. One part
of water is added to two parts of fresh milk, and to each half-pint
of this mixture is added a fairly heaped-up teaspoonful of Natural
Food; mix well, put on the fire, bring to the boil, and when cool
the food is<img src="images/image11.jpg" width="149" height="185"
alt="DR. ALLINSON'S Food FOR BABIES" border="0" align="left">
ready. All food should be given cool, or not warmer than the
temperature of the human blood. In place of a thermometer, the tip
of the little finger is a good tester; if the food does not feel
hot to this test it will be of the right temperature. Sugar should
not be added to the food, nor should tinned or condensed milk be
ordinarily used. Only under exceptional circumstances should tinned
milk be used, as on board ship, or when fresh milk cannot be had.
Also quite as invaluable for nursing mothers and invalids.</p>

align="right"> tasty, nourish every organ and tissue of the body,
and not be too bulky. We have many foods that will fulfil one or
two of these conditions, but it is rare to find all combined in
one, as in "Power." Power is pleasant to the taste&mdash;nutritious
and most <i>sustaining</i>. It contains everything necessary for
supporting the human frame. It combines proteid elements for
building up the muscles; hydro-carbons and carbo-hydrates for
heating the body and suppyling the requisite energy for work;
mineral matters for bone and teeth; and lastly, a certain amount of
"filling" material to occupy the stomach and bowels, cause daily
laxation, and so carry away the bile and various other digestive
juices, the retention of which means disease.</p>

<p>It is made in the form of crisp pellets, gives exercise to the
teeth, keeps them in good order, and stimulates the salivary
glands. Further, Power is a Natural Corrective of inestimable
worth. It may form the correct diet for young children and the
aged. It is perfectly digestible and will prove a tower of strength
and a standby under all conditions of life and work.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
