EFORE the war," she sighs.  "Before the war."
<DIV>  Then blinks 'er eyes, an' tries to work a smile.</DIV>
"Ole scenes," she sez, "don't look the same no more.
<DIV>  Ole ways," she sez, "seems to 'ave changed their style,</DIV>
<DIV>  The pleasures that we 'ad don't seem worth while--</DIV>
Them simple joys that passed an hour away--
<DIV>  An' troubles, that we used to so revile,</DIV>
'Ow small they look," she sez. "'Ow small to-day.<BR /><BR />


"This war!" sighs ole Mar Flood. An' when I seen
<DIV>The ole girl sittin' in our parlour there, </DIV>
Tellin' 'er troubles to my wife, Doreen,
<DIV>As though the talkin' eased 'er load uv care, </DIV>
<DIV>I thinks uv mothers, 'ere an' everywhere, </DIV>
Smilin' a bit while they are grievin' sore
<DIV>For grown-up babies, fightin' Over There; </DIV>
An' then I 'ears 'em sigh, "Before the war."
<BR /><BR />
My wife 'as took the social 'abit bad.
<DIV>I ain't averse--one more new word I've learned--</DIV>
Averse to tea, when tea is to be 'ad;
<DIV>An' when it comes I reckon that it's earned. </DIV>
<DIV>It's jist a drink, as fur as I'm concerned, </DIV>
Good for a bloke that's toilin' on the land;
<DIV>But when a caller comes, 'ere I am turned </DIV>
Into a social butterfly, off-'and.
<BR /><BR />
Then drinkin' tea becomes an 'oly rite.
<DIV>So's I won't bring the fam'ly to disgrace </DIV>
I gits a bit uv coachin' overnight
<DIV>On ridin' winners in this bun-fed race.</DIV>
<DIV>I 'ave to change me shirt, an' wash me face, </DIV>
An' look reel neat, from me waist up at least,
<DIV>An' sling remarks in at the proper place, </DIV>
An' not makes noises drinkin', like a beast.
<BR /><BR />

"'Ave some more cake. Another slice, now do.
<DIV>An' won't yeh 'ave a second cup uv tea? </DIV>
'Ow is the children?"  Ar, it makes me blue!
<DIV>This boodoor 'abit ain't no good to me.</DIV>
<DIV>I likes to take me tucker plain an' free: </DIV>
Tea an' a chunk out on the job for choice,
<DIV>So I can stoke with no one there to see. </DIV>
Besides, I 'aven't got no comp'ny voice.
<BR /><BR />

Uv course, I've 'ad it all out with the wife.
<DIV>I argues that there's work that must be done, </DIV>
An' tells 'er that I 'ates this tony life.
<DIV>She sez there's jooties that we must not shun. </DIV>
<DIV>You bet that ends it; so I joins the fun,</DIV>
An' puts 'em all at ease with silly grins--
<DIV>Slings bits uv repartee like "'Ave a bun," </DIV>
An' passes bread an' butter, for me sins.
<BR /><BR />

Since I've been marri'd, say, I've chucked some things,
<DIV>An' learned a whole lot more to fill the space.</DIV>
I've slung all slang; crook words 'ave taken wings,
<DIV>An' I 'ave learned to entertain with grace.</DIV>
<DIV>But when ole Missus Flood comes round our place </DIV>
I don't object to 'er, for all 'er sighs;
<DIV>Becos I likes 'er ways, I likes 'er face, </DIV>
An', most uv all, she 'as them mother's eyes.
<BR /><BR />

"Before the war," she sighs, the poor ole girl.
<DIV> 'Er talk it gets me thinkin' in between, </DIV>
While I'm assistin' at this social whirl. . . .
<DIV>She comes across for comfort to Doreen,</DIV>
<DIV>To talk about the things that might 'ave been </DIV>
If Syd 'ad not been killed at Suvla Bay,
<DIV>Or Jim not done a bunk at seventeen, </DIV>
An' not been 'eard uv since 'e went away.
<BR /><BR />

They 'ave a little farm right next to us--
<DIV> 'Er an' 'er 'usband--where they live alone. </DIV>
Spite uv 'er cares, she ain't the sort to fuss
<DIV>Or serve up sudden tears an' sob an' moan, </DIV>
<DIV>An' since I've known 'er some'ow I 'ave grown </DIV>
To see in 'er, an' all the grief she's bore,
<DIV>A million brave ole mothers 'oo 'ave known </DIV>
Deep sorrer since them days before the war.
<BR /><BR />

"Before the war," she sez. "Yeh mind our Syd?
<DIV>Poor lad. . . . But then, yeh never met young Jim--</DIV>
'Im 'oo was charged with things 'e never did.
<DIV>Ah, both uv you'd 'ave been reel chums with 'im. </DIV>
<DIV> 'Igh-spirited 'e was, a perfect limb. </DIV>
It's six long years now since 'e went away
<DIV>Ay, drove away." 'Er poor ole eyes git dim. </DIV>
"That was," she sighs, "that was me blackest day.
<BR /><BR />

"Me blackest day!Wot am I sayin' now? <DIV>There was the day the parson come to tell </DIV>
The news about our Syd. . . . An', yet, some'ow . . . .
<DIV>My little Jim!" She pauses for a spell. . . .</DIV>
<DIV> "Your 'olly'ocks is doin' reely well," </DIV>
She sez, an' battles 'ard to brighten up.
<DIV> "An' them there pinks uv yours, 'ow sweet they smell. </DIV>
An'--Thanks! I think I will 'ave one more cup."
<BR /><BR />

As fur as I can get the strength uv it,
<DIV>Them Floods 'ave 'ad a reel tough row to hoe. </DIV>
First off, young Jim, 'oo plays it 'igh a bit,
<DIV>Narks the ole man a treat, an' slings the show. </DIV>
<DIV>Then come the war, an' Syd 'e 'as to go.</DIV>
'E run 'is final up at Suvla Bay--
<DIV>One uv the Aussies I was proud to know. </DIV>
An' Jim's cracked 'ardy since 'e went away.
<BR /><BR />

'Er Jim!  These mothers! Lord, they're all the same.
<DIV>I wonder if Doreen will be that kind..</DIV>
Syd was the son 'oo played the reel man's game;
<DIV>But Jim 'oo sloped an' left no word be'ind, </DIV>
<DIV>His is the picter shinin' in 'er mind.</DIV>
'Igh-spirited!	I've 'eard that tale before.
<DIV>I sometimes think she'd take it rather kind </DIV>
To 'ear that 'is 'igh spirits run to war.
<BR /><BR />

"Before the war," she sez. "Ah, times was good.
<DIV>The little farm out there, an' jist us four </DIV>
Workin' to make a decent liveli'ood.
<DIV>Our Syd an' Jim! . . . Poor Jim! It grieves me sore; </DIV>
<DIV>For Dad won't 'ave 'im mentioned 'ome no more.</DIV>
'E's 'urt, I know, cos 'e thinks Jim 'urt me.
<DIV>As if 'e could, the bonny boy I bore. . . . </DIV>
But I must off 'ome now, an' git Dad's tea."
<BR /><BR />

I seen 'er to the gate.	(Take it frum me,
<DIV>I'm some perlite.)  She sez, "Yeh mustn't mind </DIV>
Me talkin' so uv Jim, but when I see
<DIV>Your face it brings 'im back; 'e's jist your kind. </DIV>
<DIV>Not quite so 'an'some, p'r'aps, nor so refined. </DIV>
I've got some toys uv 'is," she sez. "But there--
<DIV>This is ole woman's talk, an' you be'ind</DIV>
With all yer work, an' little time to spare."
<BR /><BR />

She gives me 'and a squeeze an' turns away,
<DIV>Sobbin', I thort; but when she looks be'ind, </DIV>
Smilin', an' wavin', like she felt reel gay,
<DIV>I wonders 'ow the women works that blind, </DIV>
<DIV>An' jist waves back; then goes inside to find </DIV>
A lookin'-glass, an' takes a reel good look. . . .
<DIV> "'Not quite so 'an'some, p'r'aps, nor so refined!'  </DIV>
Gawd 'elp yeh, Jim," I thinks. "Yeh must be crook."

F I'd 'a' played me Jack on that there Ten,"
<DIV>Sez Peter Begg, "I might 'a' made the lot." 	</DIV>
"'Ow could yeh?" barks ole Poole. "'Ow' could yeh, when
<DIV>I 'ad me Queen be'ind?" Sez Begg, "Wot rot!</DIV>
I slung away me King to take that trick. <BR />
<I>Which</I> one! Say, ain't yer 'ead a trifle thick?
<BR /><BR />
Now, don't yeh see that when I plays me King
<DIV>I give yer Queen a chance, an' lost the slam." </DIV>
But Poole, 'e sez 'e don't see no sich thing,
<DIV>So Begg gits 'ot, an' starts to loose a "Damn." </DIV>
'E twigs the missus jist in time to check,<BR />
An' makes it "Dash," an' gits red down 'is neck.
<BR /><BR />


There's me an' Peter Begg, an' ole man Poole--
<DIV>Neighbours uv mine, that farm a bit close by--</DIV>
Jist once a week or so we makes a school,
<DIV>An' gives this game uv Dummy Bridge a fly. </DIV>
Doreen, she 'as 'er sewin' be the fire,<BR />

The kid's in bed; an' 'ere's me 'eart's desire.
<BR />
<BR />

'Ome-comfort, peace, the picter uv me wife
<DIV>'Appy at work, me neighbours gathered round </DIV>
All friendly-like--wot more is there in life?
<DIV>I've searched a bit, but, better I ain't found. </DIV>
Doreen, she seems content, but in 'er eye<BR />

I've seen reel pity when the talk gits 'igh.
<BR />
<BR />

This ev'nin' we 'ad started off reel 'ot:
<DIV>Two little slams, an' Poole, without a score, </DIV>
Still lookin' sore about the cards 'e'd got--
<DIV>When, sudden-like, a knock comes to the door. </DIV>
"A visitor," growls Begg, "to crool our game." <BR />

An' looks at me, as though I was to blame.
<BR />
<BR />

Jist as Doreen goes out, I seen 'er grin.
<DIV>"Deal 'em up quick!" I whispers. "Grab yer 'and, </DIV>
An' look reel occupied when they comes in.
<DIV>Per'aps they'll 'ave the sense to understand. </DIV>
If it's a man, maybe 'e'll make a four;<BR />

But if"--Then Missus Flood comes in the door.
<BR />
<BR />

'Twas ole Mar Flood, 'er face wrapped in a smile.
<DIV>"Now, boys," she sez, "don't let me spoil yer game. </DIV>
I'll jist chat with Doreen a little while;
<DIV>But if yeh stop I'll be ashamed I came." </DIV>
An' then she waves a letter in 'er 'and.<BR />

Sez she, "Our Jim's a soldier!  Ain't it grand?"

<BR />
<BR />
"Good boy," sez Poole.	"Let's see.I make it 'earts."
<DIV>"Doubled!" shouts Begg. . . . "An' 'e's been in a fight," </DIV>
Sez Missus Flood, "out in them furrin' parts.
<DIV>French, I suppose. I can't pronounce it right. </DIV>
'E's been once wounded, somewhere in the leg. . . ." <BR />

"'Ere, Bill! Yeh gone to sleep?" asks Peter Begg.
<BR />
<BR />
I plays me Queen uv Spades; an' plays 'er bad.
<DIV>Begg snorts. . . . "My boy," sighs Missus Flood. "My Jim." . . .</DIV>
"King 'ere," laughs Poole.  "That's the last Spade I 'ad." . . .
<DIV>Doreen she smiles: "I'm glad yeh've 'eard from 'im.". . . </DIV>
"We're done," groans Begg. "Why did yeh nurse yer Ace?". . .<BR />

"My Jim!" An' there was sunlight in 'er face.
<BR />
<BR />
"I always thought a lot uv Jim, I did,"
<DIV>Sez Begg. "'E does yeh credit. 'Ere, your deal." </DIV>
"That's so," sez Poole. "'E was an all-right kid.
<DIV>No trumps? I'm sorry that's the way yeh feel. </DIV>
'Twill take yeh all yer time to make the book." . . . <BR />

An' then Doreen sends me a wireless look.
<BR />
<BR />

I gets the S.O.S.; but Begg is keen.
<DIV>"My deal," 'e yaps. "Wot rotten cards I get." </DIV>
Ole Missus Flood sits closer to Doreen.
<DIV>"The best," she whispers, "I ain't told yeh yet."</DIV>
I strains me ears, an' leads me King uv Trumps.<BR />

"Ace 'ere!" grins Begg.	Poole throws 'is Queen--an' thumps.
<BR />
<BR />

"That saves me Jack!" 'owls Begg. "Tough luck, ole sport." . . .
<DIV>Sez Missus Flood, "Jim's won a medal too </DIV>
For doin' somethin' brave at Bullycourt." . . .
<DIV>"Play on, play on," growls Begg. "It's up to you." </DIV>
Then I reneges, an' trumps me partner's Ace,<BR />

An' Poole gets sudden murder in 'is face.
<BR />
<BR />

"I'm sick uv this 'ere game," 'e grunts. "It's tame."
<DIV>"Righto," I chips. "Suppose we toss it in?" </DIV>
Begg don't say nothin'; so we sling the game.
<DIV>On my wife's face I twigs a tiny grin. </DIV>
"Finished?" sez she, su'prised. 'Well, p'r'aps it's right.<BR />

It looks to me like 'earts was trumps to-night."
<BR />
<BR />
An' so they was.  An', say, the game was grand.
<DIV>Two hours we sat while that ole mother told </DIV>
About 'er Jim, 'is letter in 'er 'and,
<DIV>An', on 'er face, a glowin' look that rolled </DIV>
The miles all up that lie 'twixt France an' 'ere, <BR />
An' found 'er son, an' brought 'im very near.
<BR />
<BR />
A game uv Bridge it was, with 'earts for trumps.
<DIV>We was the dummies, sittin' silent there.</DIV>
I knoo the men, like me, was feelin' chumps:
<DIV>Foolin' with cards while this was in the air.</DIV>
It took Doreen to shove us in our place; <BR />
An' mother 'eld the lot, right from the Ace.
<BR /><BR />
She told us 'ow 'e said 'e'd writ before,
<DIV>An' 'ow the letters must lave gone astray; </DIV>
An' 'ow the stern ole father still was sore,
<DIV>But looked like 'e'd be soft'nin', day by day; </DIV>
'Ow pride in Jim peeps out be'ind 'is frown, <BR />
An' 'ow the ole fool 'opes to 'ide it down.<BR /><BR />

"I knoo," she sez. "I never doubted Jim.
<DIV>But wot could any mother say or do </DIV>
When pryin' folks asked wot become uv 'im,
<DIV>But drop 'er eyes an' say she never knoo. </DIV>
Now I can lift me 'ead to that sly glance,<BR />
An' say, 'Jim's fightin', with the rest, in France.'"
<BR /><BR />
An' when she's gone, us four we don't require
<DIV>No gossipin' to keep us in imploy.</DIV>
Ole Poole sits starin' 'ard into the fire.
<DIV>I guessed that 'e was thinkin' uv 'is boy, </DIV>
'Oo's been right in it from the very start; <BR />
An' Poole was thinkin' uv a father's part.
<BR /><BR />
An' then 'e speaks: "This war 'as turned us 'ard.
<DIV>Suppose, four year ago, yeh said to me</DIV>
That I'd sit 'eedless, starin' at a card
<DIV>While that ole mother told--Good Lord!" sez 'e</DIV>
"It takes the women for to put us wise<BR />
To playin' games in war-time," an' 'e sighs.
<BR /><BR />
An' 'ere Doren sets out ot put 'im right.
<DIV> "There's games an' games," she sez."When women starts</DIV>
A hand at Bridge like she 'as played to-night
<DIV>It's Nature teachin' 'em to make it 'earts.</DIV>
The other suits are yours," she sez; "but then,<BR />
That's as it should be, seein' you are men."
<BR /><BR />
"Maybe," sez Poole; an' both gits up to go.
<DIV>I stands beside the door when they are gone,</DIV>
Watchin' their lantern swingin' to an' fro,
<DIV>An' 'ears Begg's voice as they goes trudgin' on:</DIV>
"If you 'ad led that Queen we might 'ave made. . . ." <BR />
"Rubbidge!" shouts Poole."You mucked it with yer Spade!"

<IMG SRC="images/I2.png" ALT="&quot;I" width="15%" align="middle">
've knowed ole Flood this last five year or more; <BR />

I knoo 'im when 'is Syd went to the war.
<DIV>A proud ole man 'e was. But I've watched 'im, </DIV>
<DIV>An' seen 'is look when people spoke uv Jim: </DIV>
As sour a look as most coves want to see.<BR />
It made me glad that this 'ere Jim weren't me.
<BR /><BR />
I sized up Flood the first day that we met--<BR />
Stubborn as blazes when 'is mind is set,
<DIV>Ole-fashioned in 'is looks an' in 'is ways, </DIV>
<DIV>Believin' it is honesty that pays;</DIV>
An' still dead set, in spite uv bumps 'e's got, <BR />
To keep on honest if it pays or not.
<BR /><BR />
Poor ole Dad Flood, 'e is too old to fight <BR />
By close on thirty year; but, if I'm right
<DIV>About 'is doin's an' about 'is grit, </DIV>
<DIV> 'E's done a fair bit over 'is fair bit. </DIV>
They are too old to fight, but, all the same, <BR />
'Is kind's quite young enough to play the game.
<BR /><BR />
I've 'eard it called, this war--an' it's the truth--<BR />
I've 'eard it called the sacrifice uv youth.
<DIV>An' all this land 'as reckernized it too,</DIV>
<DIV>An' gives the boys the praises that is doo. </DIV>
I've 'eard the cheers for ev'ry fightin' lad; <BR />
But, up to now, I ain't 'eard none for Dad.
<BR /><BR />
Ole Flood, an' all 'is kind throughout the land, <BR />
They ain't been 'eralded with no brass band,
<DIV>Or been much thought about; but, take my tip, </DIV>
<DIV>The war 'as found 'em with a stiffened lip, </DIV>
'Umpin' a load they thought they'd dropped for good, <BR />
Crackin' reel 'ardy, an'--jist sawin' wood.
<BR /><BR />
Dad Flood, 'is back is bent, 'is strength is gone;<BR />
'E'd done 'is bit before this war come on.
<DIV>At sixty-five 'e thought 'is work was done; </DIV>
<DIV> 'E gave the farmin' over to 'is son, </DIV>
An' jist sat back in peace, with 'is ole wife,<BR />
To spend content the ev'nin' uv 'is life.
<BR /><BR />
Then come the war. An' when Syd 'esitates <BR />
Between the ole folk an' 'is fightin' mates,
<DIV>The ole man goes outside an' grabs a hoe. </DIV>
<DIV>Sez 'e, "Yeh want to, an' yeh ought to go. </DIV>
Wot's stoppin' yeh?" 'E straightens 'is ole frame. <BR />
"Ain't I farmed long enough to know the game?"
<BR /><BR />
There weren't no more to say. An' Syd went--West: <BR />
Into the sunset with ole Aussie's best.
<DIV>But no one ever 'eard no groans from Dad. </DIV>
<DIV>Though all 'is pride an' 'ope was in that lad </DIV>
'E showed no sign excep' to grow more grim. <BR />
'Is son was gone--an' it was up to 'im.
<BR /><BR />
One day last month when I was down at Flood's <BR />
I seen 'im strugglin' with a bag uv spuds.
<DIV> "Look 'ere," I sez, "you let me spell yeh, Dad. </DIV>
<DIV>You 'umpin' loads like that's a bit too bad." </DIV>
'E gives a grunt that's more than 'arf a groan. <BR />
"Wot's up?" 'e snaps. "Got no work uv yer own?"
<BR /><BR />
That's 'im.  But I've been tippin' that the pace <BR />
Would tell; an' when 'is wife comes to our place,
<DIV>An' sez that Dad is ill an' took to bed,</DIV>
<DIV>Flat out with work--though that ain't wot she said--</DIV>
I ain't su'prised; an' tells 'er when I'm thro'<BR />
I'll come across an' see wot I can do.
<BR /><BR />

I went across, an'--I come back again.<BR />
Strike me! it's no use reas'nin' with some men.
<DIV>Stubborn ole cows! I'm sick uv them ole fools. </DIV>
<DIV>The way 'e yells, "Keep yer 'ands off my tools!" </DIV>
Yeh'd think I was a thief. 'Is missus said <BR />
I'd better slope, or 'e'd be out uv bed.
<BR /><BR />
'E 'eard us talkin' through the open door. <BR />
"'Oo's that?" 'e croaks, altho' 'e tries to roar.
<DIV>An' when 'is wife ixplains it's only me </DIV>
<DIV>To 'elp a bit: "I want no charity!"</DIV>
'E barks. "I'll do me work meself, yeh 'ear?" <BR />
An' then 'e gits so snarky that I clear.
<BR /><BR />
But 'e'll do me. I like the ole boy's nerve. <BR />
We don't do nothin' that 'e don't deserve;
<DIV>But me an' Peter Begg an' ole man Poole, </DIV>
<DIV>We fairly 'as our work cut out to fool</DIV>
The sly ole fox, when we sneaks down each day <BR />
An' works a while to keep things under way. <BR /><BR />



We digs a bit, an' ploughs a bit, an' chops <BR />
The wood, an' does the needful to 'is crops.
<DIV>We does it soft, an' when 'e 'ears a row </DIV>
<DIV> 'Is missus tells 'im it's the dog or cow. </DIV>
'E sez that it's queer noises for a pup.<BR />
An'--there'll be ructions when ole Flood gits up.
<BR /><BR />
It ain't all overwork that's laid 'im out.<BR />
Ole Pride in 'im is fightin' 'ard with Doubt.
<DIV>To-day 'is wife sez, "Somethin's strange in 'im, </DIV>
<DIV>For in 'is sleep sometimes 'e calls for Jim.</DIV>
It's six long years," she sez, an' stops to shake <BR />
'Er 'ead. "But 'e don't mention 'im awake."<BR /><BR />

Dad Flood. I thought 'im jist a stiff-necked fool<BR />
Before the war; but, as I sez to Poole,
<DIV>This war 'as tested more than fightin' men. </DIV>
<DIV>But, say, 'e is an 'oly terror when</DIV>
Friends try to 'elp 'im earn a bite an' sup. <BR />
Oh, there'll be 'Ell to pay when 'e gits up!

Then 'e digs 'arf a fag out uv 'is vest, <BR />
Borrers me matches, an' I gives 'im best.
<BR /><BR />
The first I 'eard about it Poole told me.<BR />
"There is a bloke called Smith at Flood's," sez 'e;
<DIV>Come there this mornin', sez 'e's come to stay, </DIV>

Sez 'e was sent there be a pal named Flood; <BR />
An' talks uv contracts sealed with Flanders mud.
<BR /><BR />
"No matter wot they say, 'e only grins,"<BR />
Sez Poole. "'E's rather wobbly on 'is pins.
<DIV>Seems like a soldier bloke. An' Peter Begg </DIV>
                <img src="images/space.png"  ALT="indent"

'E sez one leg <BR />
Works be machinery, but I dunno.<BR />
I only know 'e's there an' 'e won't go.
<BR /><BR />
"'E grins," sez Poole, "at ev'rything they say. <BR />
Dad Flood 'as nearly 'ad a fit to-day.
<DIV> 'E's cursed, an' ordered 'im clean off the place;</DIV>

Jist goes on grinnin', an' 'e sez, quite carm,  <BR />
'E's come to do a bit around the farm."
 <BR /><BR />
The tale don't sound too good to me at all. <BR />
"If 'e's a crook," I sez, "'e wants a fall.
<DIV>Maybe 'e's dilly. I'll go down an' see. </DIV>
     <img src="images/space.png" ALT="indent"

'E'll grin at me<BR />
When I 'ave done, if 'e needs dealin' with." <BR />
So I goes down to interview this Smith.
<BR /><BR />

'E 'ad a fork out in the tater patch.<BR />
Sez 'e, "Why 'ello, Digger. Got a match?"
<DIV> "Digger?" I sez. "Well, you ain't digger 'ere. </DIV>
  <img src="images/space.png" ALT="indent"
width="200" height="1">
You better clear.<BR />
You ought to know that you can't dig them spuds. <BR />
They don't belong to you; they're ole Dad Flood's."
<BR /><BR />

"Can't I?" 'e grins. "I'll do the best I can, <BR />
Considerin' I'm only 'arf a man.
<DIV>Give us a light. I can't get none from Flood, </DIV>

I parts; an' 'e stands grinnin' at me still; <BR />
An' then 'e sez, "'Ave yeh fergot me, Bill?"
<BR /><BR />

I looks, an' seen a tough bloke, short an' thin.<BR />
Then, Lord! I recomembers that ole grin.
<DIV> "It's little Smith!" I 'owls, "uv Collin'wood.</DIV>

<BR /><BR />
"Yer on to it," 'e sez. "Nex' day we sailed. <BR />
Now 'arf uv me's back 'ome, an' 'arf they nailed.
<DIV>An' Mick. . . . Ar, well, Fritz took me down a peg." </DIV>

"It ain't too bad," 'e sez, with 'is ole smile; <BR />
"But when I starts to dig it cramps me style.
<BR /><BR />

"But I ain't grouchin'.	It was worth the fun.  <BR />
We 'ad some picnic stoushin' Brother 'Un--
<DIV>The only fight I've 'ad that some John 'Op </DIV>

width=150 height="1">                   Don't come an' stop.<BR />
They pulled me leg a treat, but, all the same, <BR />
There's nothin' over 'ere to beat the game. <BR /><BR />

"An' now," 'e sez, "I'm 'ere to do a job<BR />
I promised, if it was me luck to lob

           <img src="images/space.png" ALT="indent"

"As clear as mud," I sez. "But I can't work<BR />
Me brains to 'old yer pace.
Say, wot's the lurk?"
<BR /><BR />


So then 'e puts me wise. It seems that 'im <BR />
An' this 'ere Flood--I tips it must be Jim--
<DIV>Was cobbers up in France, an' things occurred. </DIV>
    <img src="images/space.png" ALT="indent"
width="200" height="1">                             (I got 'is word<BR />
Things did occur up there).
But, anyway, <BR />
Seems Flood done somethin' good for 'im one day.
<BR /><BR />
Then Smith 'e promised if 'e came back 'ome <BR />
Before 'is cobber o'er the flamin' foam,
<DIV> 'E'd see the ole folks 'ere, an' 'e agreed, </DIV>
         <img src="images/space.png" ALT="indent"
width=150 height="1">                If there was need,<BR />
'E'd stay an' do a bit around the farm<BR />
So long as 'e 'ad one sound, dinkum arm.
<BR /><BR />


"So, 'ere I am," 'e sez, an' grins again.<BR />
"A promise is a promise 'mong us men."
<DIV>Sez I, "You come along up to the 'ouse. </DIV>
 <img src="images/space.png"  ALT="indent"
width=150 height="1">                Ole Dad won't rouse <BR />
When once 'e's got yer strength, an' as for Mar, <BR />
She'll kiss yeh when she finds out 'oo yeh are."
<BR /><BR />


So we goes up, an' finds 'em both fair dazed <BR />

Mar sez 'e must be starved, an' right away<BR />
The kettle's on, she's busy with a tray.

I want things straightened in my life.

"Kindness an' love seem good to me.
<DIV>I want a new, white page</DIV>

We're sittin' talkin' by the fence,

Paintin' the sky all gold an' pink. <BR />
Said 'e, "When it's like that, I think--"

Said 'e, "I think, when it's jist so,<BR />

An' partly wot the padre said,
<DIV>It gits me when I stare</DIV>
Out West when it's like that is now.<BR />
There must be somethin' else--some'ow.
<BR /><BR />

"I've thought a lot," said Digger Smith--
<DIV>"Out There I thought a lot.</DIV>
I thought uv death, an' all the rest,<BR />
An' uv me mates, good mates gone West;
<DIV>An' it ain't much I've got;</DIV>

'E's got me beat, 'as little Smith.
<DIV>I knoo 'im years ago</DIV>
I knoo 'im as a reel tough boy <BR />
'Oo roughed it up with 'oly joy;

An' when I ask Mar Flood she sighs--<BR />

She sez 'e's got them soldier's eyes

An' we must give 'im wholesome food <BR />
An' lead 'is thoughts to somethin' good
<DIV>An' never let 'im fret.</DIV>
But 'e ain't frettin', seems to me; <BR />
More--puzzled, fur as I can see.
<BR /><BR />


The clouds above the hills was tore
<DIV>Apart, until, some'ow,</DIV>
It seemed like some big, shinin' gate.<BR />
Said 'e, "Why, lad, I tell yeh straight,

"They talk uv love 'twixt men," said 'e.

"'Old on," I said; "it seems to me

Wot does she want with 'arf a man?"
<BR /><BR />

It weren't no use. 'E wouldn't talk

Said 'e, "Now, dinkum, talkin' square,<BR />
When you git gazin' over there
<DIV>Don't you 'arf want to cry?</DIV>
I wouldn't be su'prised to see<BR />
An angel comin' out," said 'e.

"Gone West!" said Digger Smith. "Ah, lad,
<DIV>I've seen 'em goin' West,</DIV>
An' often wonder, when I look, <BR />
If they 'ave 'ad it dealt 'em crook,

They earned twice over by the spell <BR />
They spent down in that dinkum 'Ell."

The gold was creepin' up, the sun

It don't seem strange a man should cry <BR />
To see that glory in the sky

AINT my idea uv argument to call a man a fool, <BR />
An' I ain't lookin' round for bricks to 'eave at ole man Poole;
<DIV>But when 'e gets disputin' 'e's inclined to lose 'is 'ead.</DIV>
<DIV>It ain't so much 'is choice uv words as 'ow the words is said.</DIV>
<BR />

'E's sich a coot for takin' sides, as I sez to Doreen.<BR />
Sez she, "'Ow can 'e, by 'imself ?"Wotever that may mean.
<DIV>My wife sez little things sometimes that nearly git me riled. </DIV>
<DIV>I knoo she meant more than she said be that soft way she smiled.</DIV>
<BR />

To-day, when I was 'arrowin', Poole comes down to the fence<BR />
To get the loan uv my long spade; an' uses that pretence
<DIV>To 'ave a bit uv friendly talk, an' one word leads to more, </DIV>
<DIV>As is the way with ole man Poole, as I've remarked before. </DIV>
<BR />

The spade reminds 'im 'ow 'e done some diggin' in 'is day, <BR />
An' diggin' brings the talk to earth, an' earth leads on to clay,
<DIV>Then clay quite natural reminds a thinkin' bloke uv bricks, </DIV>
<DIV>An' mortar brings up mud, an' then, uv course, it's politics.</DIV><BR />

Now, Poole sticks be 'is Party, an' I don't deny 'is right; <BR />
But when 'e starts abusin' mine 'e's lookin' for a fight.
<DIV>So I delivers good 'ome truths about 'is crowd; then Poole </DIV>
<DIV>Wags 'is ole beard across the fence an' tells me I'm a fool.</DIV>
<BR />

Now, that's the dizzy limit; so I lays aside the reins,<BR />
An' starts to prove 'e's storin' mud where most blokes keeps
       their brains.
<DIV> 'E decorates 'is answers, an' we're goin' it ding-dong,</DIV>
<DIV>When this returned bloke, Digger Smith, comes sauntering along.</DIV>
<BR />

Poole's gripped the fence as though 'e means to tear the rails
     in two,<BR />
An' eyes my waggin' finger like 'e wants to 'ave a chew.
<DIV>Then Digger Smith 'e grins at Poole, an' then 'e looks at me, </DIV>
<DIV>An' sez, quite soft an' friendly-like, "Winnin' the war?" sez 'e.</DIV>
<BR />

Now, Poole deserves it, an' I'm pleased the lad give 'im that jolt. <BR />
'E goes fair mad in argument when once 'e gets a holt.
<DIV> "Yeh make me sad," sez Digger Smith; "the both uv you," sez 'e.</DIV>
<DIV> "The both uv us!  Gawstruth!" sez I.  "You ain't includin' me?"</DIV>
<BR />

"Well, it takes two to make a row," sez little Digger Smith. <BR />
"A bloke can't argue 'less 'e 'as a bloke to argue with.
<DIV>I've come 'ome from a dinkum scrap to find this land uv light </DIV>
<DIV>Is chasin' its own tail around an' callin' it a fight.</DIV>
<BR />
"We've seen a thing or two, us blokes 'oo've fought on many fronts;<BR />
An' we've 'ad time to think a bit between the fightin' stunts.
<DIV>We've seen big things, an' thought big things, an' all the </DIV>
       silly fuss,
<DIV>That used to get us rattled once, seems very small to us.</DIV>
<BR />

"An' when a bloke's fought for a land an' gets laid on the shelf <BR />

It pains 'im to come 'ome an' find it scrappin' with itself;
<DIV>An' scrappin' all for nothin', or for things that look so </DIV>
      small--
<DIV>To us, 'oo've been in bigger things, they don't seem reel at all.</DIV>
<BR />


"P'r'aps we 'ave 'ad some skite knocked out, an' p'r'aps we see
     more clear,<BR />
But seems to us there's plenty cleanin'-up to do round 'ere.
<DIV>We've learnt a little thing or two, an' we 'ave unlearnt 'eaps, </DIV>
<DIV>An' silly partisans, with us, is counted out for keeps.</DIV>
<BR />

"This takin' sides jist for the sake uv takin' sides--Aw, 'Struth! <BR />
I used to do them things one time, back in me foolish youth.
<DIV>Out There, when I remembered things, I've kicked meself reel good.</DIV>
<DIV>In football days I barracked once red 'ot for Collin'wood.</DIV>
<BR />

"I didn't want to see a game, nor see no justice done. <BR />
It never mattered wot occurred as long as my side won.
<DIV>The other side was narks an' cows an' rotters to a man; </DIV>
<DIV>But mine was all reel bonzer chaps.  I was a partisan.</DIV>
<BR /><BR />

"It might sound like swelled-'ead," sez Smith.  "But show me, if yeh can." . . .<BR />
"'Old 'ard," sez Poole. "Jist tell me this: wot is a partisan?"
<DIV>Then Digger Smith starts to ixplain; Poole interrupts
      straight out;</DIV>
<DIV>An' I wades in to give my views, an' 'as to nearly shout.</DIV>
<BR /><BR />

We battles on for one good hour. My team sleeps where it stands;<BR />
An' Poole 'as tossed the spade away to talk with both 'is 'ands;
<DIV>An' Smith 'as dropped the maul 'e 'ad. Then I looks round to see</DIV>
<DIV>Doreen quite close. She smiles at us. "Winnin' the war?" sez she.</DIV>

Talkin' to Missus Flood, an' she  <BR />

I've chucked the matrimony plan,"  <BR />

This Digger Smith 'as fairly got  <BR />
Me rampin' with 'is "'arf man" rot.
<DIV> 'E 'as a timber leg, it's true;</DIV>
<DIV>But 'e can do the work uv two. </DIV>
Besides, the things 'e's done Out There  <BR />
Makes 'im one man an' some to spare.
 <BR /> <BR />

I knoo 'is question was jist kid. <BR />
'E'd met this girl; I know 'e did.
<DIV>  'E knoo Jim Flood an' 'er was booked </DIV>
<DIV>  For double when the 'Un was cooked.  </DIV>
But, seein' 'er, it used to start<BR />
'Im thinkin' uv another tart.
<BR /><BR />

"Oh, 'er?" sez I.  "She is a pearl. <BR />
I've 'eard she used to be Jim's girl;
<DIV>  But she was jist a child when Jim </DIV>
<DIV>  Got out. She 'as forgotten 'im."</DIV>
I knows jist wot was in 'is mind,<BR />
An' sez, "Wade in, if you're inclined."
<BR /><BR />

'E give me sich a narsty look<BR />
I thought 'e meant to answer crook;
<DIV>  But, "I ain't out for jokes," sez 'e </DIV>
<DIV>  "Yeh needn't sling that stuff to me.</DIV>
I only was jist thinkin'--p'r'aps . . . . . <BR />
There's some," 'e sez, "that sticks to chaps.
<BR /><BR />

"Some girls," sez 'e, "keeps true to chaps, <BR />
An' wed 'em when they've done with scraps,
<DIV>  An' come 'ome whole. Yeh don't ixpec' </DIV>
<DIV>  No tart to tie up to a wreck?</DIV>
Besides," 'e sez. . . .  "Well, any'ow, <BR />
That girl's all right; I know it now.
<BR /><BR />

"I know," sez Smith. "I got it right. <BR />
Jim used to talk to me at night
<DIV>  About a little girl 'e tracked.</DIV>
<DIV>  'Er name is Flo.  Ain't that a fact? </DIV>
That's 'er. I know she writes to 'im<BR />
Each mail.  She ain't forgotten Jim.
<BR /><BR />


"I'd like to swap my luck for Jim's <BR />
If 'e comes 'ome with all 'is limbs.
<DIV>  An', if 'e don't--well, I dunno. </DIV>
<DIV>  I've taken notice uv this Flo, </DIV>
An' wonder if"--'e stares at me--<BR />
"If there is more like 'er" sez 'e.
<BR /><BR />

Now, Digger Smith 'as learned a lot <BR />
Out fightin' there, but 'e ain't got
<DIV>  The cunnin' for to 'ide 'is 'eart.</DIV>
<DIV>  'E's too dam honest, for a start;</DIV>
'Is mind's dead simple to a friend.<BR />
I've read 'im through from end to end.
<BR /><BR />

I've learned from things 'e 'asn't said <BR />
Jist wot's been runnin in 'is 'ead.
<DIV>  I know there is a girl, somewhere; </DIV>
<DIV>  Some one 'oo 'ad the 'eart to care </DIV>
For 'im when 'e went to the war.<BR />
I know all that, an' somethin' more.
<BR /><BR />
I know that since 'e came back 'ere  <BR />
'E 'asn't seen that girl for fear
<DIV>She'd turn 'im down--give 'im the bird, </DIV>
<DIV>An' 'and 'im out the frozen word, </DIV>
Because 'e's left a leg in France; <BR />
An' 'e's afraid to take a chance.
 <BR /> <BR />

Well, not afraid, per'aps, but--shook. <BR />
It's jist the form 'is nerves 'ave took.
<DIV>Now 'e's been watchin' Flo an' seen</DIV>
<DIV> 'Er style, an' 'ow she's always keen</DIV>
For news uv Jim.Then 'e starts out<BR />
To 'ope, an' 'esitate, an' doubt.
 <BR /> <BR />


'E wonders if 'is own girl spoke<BR />
Jist this same way about 'er bloke.
<DIV> 'E wonders if in 'is girl's eyes</DIV>
<DIV>That same look came; an' then 'e sighs,</DIV>
An' dulls 'is senses with the dope<BR />
That 'arf a man ain't got no 'ope.
<BR /><BR />



'E makes me tired.  But, all the same,<BR />
I tries to work a little game.
<DIV> "Look 'ere," I sez.
"About this Flo. </DIV>
<DIV>Jim mightn't come back 'ome, yeh know. </DIV>
You 'ave a fly; yeh're sure to score; <BR />
Besides, all's fair in love an' war."
<BR /><BR />


"Sling that!" 'e sez; but I goes on<BR />
"Ole Jim won't blame yeh when she's gone.
<DIV> 'E knows, the same as me an' you, </DIV>
<DIV>These silly tarts, they can't keep true." </DIV>
I piles it on until I've got<BR />
'Im where I want 'im--jumpin' 'ot.
<BR /><BR />

An' then 'e sez, "'Ere, sling that talk!<BR />
I might be groggy in me walk;
<DIV>But if yeh say them things to me</DIV>
<DIV>I'm man enough to crack yeh; see?"</DIV>
"Righto," sez I.  "That was me plan.<BR />
Now wot about this 'arf a man?"
<BR /><BR />

'E stares at me, an' then sez, slow,<BR />
"Wot is yer game? Wot do yeh know?"
<DIV> "Nothin'," I tells 'im, "only this</DIV>
<DIV>When there's a waitin' tart to kiss</DIV>
Yeh're only 'arf a man; but when<BR />
There's blokes to fight, yeh're twenty men."
<BR /><BR />

"Wot tart?" 'e asks. "Yeh mean this Flo?"<BR />
"P'r'aps not," I sez.  "You ought to know."
<DIV>I waits to let me words sink in.</DIV>
<DIV>An' then--'e beats me with that grin. </DIV>
"Match-makin', Bill?" 'e laughs.  "Oh, 'Ell! <BR />
You take up knittin' for a spell."

HY do they do it? I dunno,"
<DIV>Sez Digger Smith. "Yeh got me beat. </DIV>
Some uv the yarns yeh 'ear is true,<BR />

An' some is rather umptydoo,
<DIV>An' some is--indiscreet.</DIV>
But them that don't get to the crowd, <BR />
Them is the ones would make yeh proud."
<BR /><BR />

With Digger Smith an' other blokes
<DIV>'Oo 'ave returned it's much the same </DIV>
They'll talk uv wot they've seen an' done<BR />
When they've been out to 'ave their fun;
<DIV>But no word uv the game.</DIV>
On fights an' all the tale uv blood <BR />
Their talk, as they remark, is dud.
<BR /><BR />

It's so with soldiers, I 'ave 'eard,
<DIV>All times.  The things that they 'ave done, </DIV>
War-mad, with blood before their eyes,<BR />
An' in their ears wild fightin' cries,
<DIV>They ever after shun.</DIV>
P'r'aps they forget; or find it well<BR />
Not to recall too much uv 'Ell.
<BR /><BR />

An' when they won't loose up their talk
<DIV>It's 'ard for us to understand</DIV>
'Ow all those boys we used to know,<BR />
Ole Billo, Jim an' Tom an' Joe,
<DIV>Done things to beat the band.</DIV>
We knoo they'd fight; but they've became <BR />
'Ead ringers at the fightin' game.
<BR /><BR />

Well, wot I've 'eard from Digger Smith
<DIV>An' other soldier blokes like 'im</DIV>
I've put together bit by bit,<BR />
An' chewed a long time over it;
<DIV>An' now I've got a dim</DIV>
An' 'azy notion in me 'ead<BR />
Why they is battlers, born an' bred.
<BR /><BR />

Wot did they know uv war first off,
<DIV>When they joined up? Wot did I know </DIV>
When I was tossed out on me neck<BR />
As if I was a shattered wreck
<DIV>The time I tried to go?</DIV>
Flat feet! Me feet 'as len'th an' brea'th<BR />
Enough to kick a 'Un to death!
<BR /><BR />


They don't know nothin', bein' reared
<DIV>Out 'ere where war 'as never spread--</DIV>
"A land by bloodless conquest won,"<BR />
As some son uv a writin' gun
<DIV>Sez in a book I read</DIV>
They don't know nix but wot they're told <BR />
At school; an' that sticks till they're old.
<BR /><BR />

Yeh've got to take the kid at school,
<DIV>Gettin' 'is 'ist'ry lesson learned--</DIV>
Then tales uv Nelson an' uv Drake, <BR />
Uv Wellin'ton an' Fightin' Blake.
<DIV> 'Is little 'eart 'as burned</DIV>
To get right out an' 'ave a go, <BR />
An' sock it into some base foe.
<BR /><BR />

Nothin' but glory fills 'is mind;
<DIV>The British charge is somethin' grand; </DIV>
The soldier that 'e reads about<BR />
Don't 'ave no time for fear an' doubt;
<DIV>'E's the 'eroic brand.</DIV>
So, when that boy gets in the game, <BR />
'E jist wades in an' does the same.
<BR /><BR />

Not bein' old 'ands at the stunt,
<DIV>They simply does as they are told; </DIV>
But, bein' Aussies--Spare me days!--<BR />
They never thinks uv other ways,
<DIV>But does it brave an' bold. </DIV>
That's 'arf; an' for the other part <BR />
Yeh got to go back to the start.
<BR /><BR />

Yeh've got to go right back to Dad,
<DIV>To Gran'dad and the pioneers, </DIV>
'Oo packed up all their bag uv tricks<BR />
An' come out 'ere in fifty-six,
<DIV>An' battled thro' the years;</DIV>
Our Gran'dads; _and their women, too_,<BR />
That 'ad the grit to face the new.
<BR /><BR />

It's that old stock; an', more than that,
<DIV>It's Bill an' Jim an' ev'ry son </DIV>
Gettin' three good meat meals a day <BR />
An' 'eaps uv chance to go an' play
<DIV>Out in the bonzer sun.</DIV>
It's partly that; but, don't forget, <BR />
When it's all said, there's somethin' yet.
<BR /><BR />

There's somethin' yet; an' there I'm beat.
<DIV>Crowds uv these lads I've known, but then, </DIV>
They 'ave got somethin' from this war, <BR />
Somethin' they never 'ad before,
<DIV>That makes 'en better men. </DIV>
Better? There's no word I can get <BR />
To name it right.  There's somethin' yet.
<BR /><BR />

We 'ear a lot about reward;
<DIV>We praise, an' sling the cheers about; </DIV>
But there was debts we can't repay <BR />
Piled up on us one single day--
<DIV>When that first list come out. </DIV>
There ain't no way to pay that debt. <BR />
Do wot we can--there's somethin' yet.

'E's give me nerves; so now I'll let 'im be."
 <BR /> <BR />
Doreen an' ole Mar Flood 'as got a scheme.
<DIV>They've been conspirin' for a week or more </DIV>
About this Digger Smith, an' now they dream
<DIV>They've got 'is fucher waitin' in cool store </DIV>
To 'and 'im out, an' fix 'im up for life. <BR />
But they've got Buckley's, as I tells me wife.
 <BR /> <BR />

I've seen 'em whisperin' up in our room.
<DIV>Now they wants me to join in the debate; </DIV>
But, "Nix," I tells 'em. "I ain't in the boom,
<DIV>An' Digger Smith ain't risin' to me bait; </DIV>
'E's fur too fly a fish for me to catch, <BR />
An' two designin' women ain't 'is match."

I puts me foot down firm, an' tells 'em, No!
<DIV>Their silly plan's a thing I wouldn't touch. </DIV>
An' then me wife, for 'arf an hour or so,
<DIV>Talks to me confident, of nothin' much; </DIV>
Then, 'fore I know it, I am all red 'ot <BR />
Into the scheme, an' leader uv the plot.
 <BR /> <BR />
'Twas Mar Flood starts it. She got 'old uv 'im--
<DIV>You know the way they 'ave with poor, weak men--</DIV>
She drops a tear or two concernin' Jim;
<DIV>Tells 'im wot women 'ave to bear; an' then</DIV>
She got 'im talkin', like a woman can. <BR />
'E never would 'ave squeaked to any man.
 <BR /> <BR />
She leads 'im on--It's crook the way they scheme
<DIV>To talk about this girl 'e's left be'ind.</DIV>
Not that she's pryin'!	Why, she wouldn't dream!--
<DIV>But speakin' uv it might jist ease 'is mind. </DIV>
Then, 'fore 'e knows, 'e's told, to 'is su'prise,  <BR />
Name an' address--an' colour uv 'er eyes!
 <BR /> <BR />

An' then she's off 'ere plottin' with Doreen--
<DIV>Bustin' a confidence, I tells 'em, flat.</DIV>
But all me roustin' leaves 'em both serene
<DIV>Women don't see a little thing like that. </DIV>
An' I ain't cooled off yet before they've got  <BR />
Me workin' for 'em in this crooked plot.
 <BR /> <BR />

Nex' day Mar Flood she takes 'er Sund'y dress
<DIV>An' 'er best little bonnet up to town.</DIV>
'Er game's to see the girl at this address
<DIV>An' word 'er in regard to comin' down </DIV>
To take Smith be su'prise.  My part's to fix  <BR />
A meetin' so there won't be any mix.
 <BR /> <BR />

I tips, some'ow, that girl won't 'esitate.
<DIV>She don't.  She comes right back with Mar nex' day, </DIV>

All uv a fluster. When I seen 'er state
<DIV>I thinks I'd best see Digger straight away; </DIV>
'Cos, if I don't, 'e's bound to 'ear the row,  <BR />
With 'er: "Where is 'e?  Can't I see 'im now?"
 <BR /> <BR />

I finds 'im in the paddick down at Flood's.
<DIV>I 'ums an' 'ars a bit about the crops.</DIV>
'E don't say nothin': goes on baggin' spuds.
<DIV> "'Ow would yeh like," I sez to 'im, an' stops. </DIV>
"'Ow would it be" . . . 'E stands an' looks at me  <BR />
"Now, wot the 'Ell's got into you?" sez 'e. <BR /> <BR />

That don't restore me confidence a bit.
<DIV>The drarmer isn't goin' as I tipped. </DIV>
I corfs, an' makes another shot at it;
<DIV>While 'e looks at me like 'e thinks I'm dipped. </DIV>
"Well--jist suppose," I sez; an' then I turn <BR />
An' see 'er standin' there among the fern.
 <BR /> <BR />
She don't want no prelimin'ries, this tart;
<DIV>She's broke away before they rung the bell; </DIV>
She's beat the gun, an' got a flyin' start.
<DIV>Smith makes a funny noise, an' I sez, "'Ell" </DIV>
Because I tumbles that I'm out uv place: <BR />
But, as I went, I caught sight uv 'er face.
 <BR /> <BR />

That's all I want to know.  An', as I ran,
<DIV>I 'ears 'er cry, "My man!  Man an' a 'arf! </DIV>
Don't fool me with yer talk uv 'arf a man!". . . .
<DIV>An' then I 'ears ole Digger start to larf.</DIV>

 WONDERED wot was doin'.  First I seen
<BR />
Ole Missus Flood wave signals to Doreen.
<DIV>I'm in the paddick slashin' down some ferns; </DIV>
<DIV>She's comin' up the road; an' if she turns </DIV>
An 'andspring I won't be su'prised a bit,<BR />
The way she's caperin', an' goin' it.
<BR /><BR />

She yells out some remark when she gets near, <BR />
Which I don't catch, I'm too fur off to 'ear.
<DIV>An' then Doreen comes prancin' to our door, </DIV>
<DIV>An' Missus Flood she sprints, an' yells some more; </DIV>
My wife runs to the gate an' waves 'er arms. . . . <BR />
But I lays low; I'm used to these alarms.
<BR /><BR />

A marri'd bloke, in time, 'e learns a bit; <BR />
An' 'e ain't over keen to throw a fit
<DIV>Each time the women calls the fire-reel out. </DIV>
<DIV>It's jist a trifle 'e'll know all about</DIV>
When things get normal.	That's a point I learn; <BR />
So I saws wood, an' keeps on cuttin' fern.
<BR /><BR />

At least, I cut a few.  I got to give<BR />
Reel fac's, an' own I was inquisitive;
<DIV>An' these 'ere fireworks gets me fair perplexed. </DIV>
<DIV>I watch the 'ouse to see wot 'appens next;</DIV>
But nothin's doin'.  They jist goes on in,
<BR />
An' leaves me wonderin' wot's caused the din.
<BR /><BR />

I stands it for a full 'arf-hour or more; <BR />
Then gets dead sick uv starin' at the door.
<DIV>I goes down to the 'ouse an' 'unts about</DIV>
<DIV>To find some 'baccer, which I 'ave no doubt </DIV>
Is in me trousers pocket all the while.<BR />
When I goes in, the talk stops, an' they smile.
<BR /><BR />

I sez I've lost me smoke, an' search a bit, <BR />
An' ask Doreen wot 'as became uv it,
<DIV>An' turns the mantelshelf all upside-down, </DIV>
<DIV>An' looks inside the teapot, with a frown; </DIV>
Then gives it up, an' owns I'd like a drink;<BR />
When Missus Flood sez, "Bill, _wot do you think_?"
<BR /><BR />

Now, ain't that like a woman?  Spare me days, <BR />
I'll never get resigned to all their ways.
<DIV>When they 'as news to tell they smile, an' wink, </DIV>
<DIV>An' bottle it, an' ask yeh wot yeh think.</DIV>
It's jist a silly game uv theirs, an' so,<BR />
I gives the countersign: "Wot?  I dunno."
<BR /><BR />

"Then guess," she sez.	Well, I'm a patient bloke, <BR />
So I sits down an' starts to cut a smoke.<BR />
<DIV>  (To play this game yeh've got to persevere.) </DIV>
<DIV>"Couldn't," I sez, "if I guessed for a year"; </DIV>
Then lights me pipe, an' waits for 'er to speak. <BR />
At last she sez, "<I>Jim's comin' back next week</I>!"
<BR /><BR />

"Go on," sez I; an' puffs away awhile<BR />
Quite unconcerned.  But for to see 'er smile
<DIV>Was jist a treat: 'er eyes was shinin' bright, </DIV>
<DIV>An' she'd grow'd ten years younger in a night. </DIV>
Jist 'ere, Doreen she sez to me, "Good Lor, <BR />
Wot do yeh want <I>two</I> plugs uv 'baccer for?"
<BR /><BR />

I takes me pipe out uv me mouth an' stares,<BR />
An' stammers, "Must 'ave found a piece--somewheres."
<DIV>But, by the way she smiles--so extra sweet--</DIV>
<DIV>I know she twigs me game, an' I am beat. </DIV>
"Fancy," she sez. "Yeh're absent-minded, dear. <BR />
Sure there was nothin' else yeh wanted 'ere?"
<BR /><BR />

"Nothin'," I sez, an' feels a first-prize fool; <BR />
An' goes outside, an' grabs the nearest tool.
<DIV>It was the crosscut; so I works like mad </DIV>
<DIV>To keep me self-respeck from goin' bad. </DIV>
"This game," I tells meself, "will do yeh good. <BR />
You ain't proficient, yet, at sawin' wood."

OW, be the Hokey Fly!" sez Peter Begg. <BR />
"Suppose 'e comes 'ome with a wooden leg.<BR />
<DIV>Suppose 'e isn't fit to darnce at all, </DIV>
<DIV>Then, ain't we 'asty fixin' up this ball? </DIV>
A little tournament at Bridge is my <BR />
Idear," sez Peter.  "Be the Hokey Fly!"
<BR /><BR />

Ole Peter Begg is gettin' on in years.<BR />
'E owns a reel good farm; an' all 'e fears
<DIV>Is that some girl will land 'im, by are by, </DIV>
<DIV>An' share it with 'im--be the Hokey Fly. </DIV>
That's 'is pet swear-word, an' I dunno wot <BR />
'E's meanin', but 'e uses it a lot.
<BR /><BR />

"Darncin'!" growls Begg. We're fixin' up the 'all <BR />
With bits uv green stuff for a little ball
<DIV>To welcome Jim, 'oo's comin' 'ome nex' day. </DIV>
<DIV>We're 'angin' flags around to make things gay, </DIV>
An' shiftin' chairs, an' candle-greasin' floors, <BR />
'As is our way when blokes come 'ome from wars.
<BR /><BR />

"A little game uv Bridge," sez Peter Begg, <BR />
"Would be more decent like, an' p'r'aps a keg
<DIV>Uv somethin' if the 'ero's feelin' dry. </DIV>
<DIV>But this 'ere darncin'!  Be the Hokey Fly, </DIV>
These selfish women never thinks at all <BR />
About the guest; they only wants the ball.
<BR /><BR />

"Now, cards," sez Begg, "amuses ev'ry one. <BR />
An' then our soldier guest could 'ave 'is fun
<DIV>If 'e'd lost <I>both</I> 'is legs.	 It makes me sick</DIV>
<DIV> 'Ere! Don't yeh spread that candle-grease too thick </DIV>
Yeh're wastin' it; an' us men 'as to buy<BR />
Enough for nonsense, be the Hokey Fly!"
<BR /><BR />

Begg, 'e ain't never keen on wastin' much. <BR />
"Peter," I sez, "it's you that needs a crutch.
<DIV>Why don't yeh get a wife, an' settle down?" </DIV>
<DIV> 'E looks reel fierce, an' answers, with a frown,</DIV>
"Do you think I am goin' to be rooked<BR />
For 'arf me tucker, jist to get it cooked?"<BR /><BR />

I lets it go at that, an' does me job; <BR />
An' when a little later on I lob
<DIV>Along the 'omeward track, down by Flood's gate </DIV>
<DIV>I meet ole Digger Smith, an' stops to state</DIV>
Me views about the weather an' the war. . . . <BR />
'E tells me Jim gets 'ere nex' day, at four.
<BR /><BR />

An' as we talk, I sees along the road<BR />
A strange bloke 'umpin' some queer sort uv load.
<DIV>I points 'im out to Smith an' sez; "'Oo's that? </DIV>
<DIV>Looks like a soldier, don't 'e, be 'is 'at?" </DIV>
"Stranger," sez Digger, "be the cut uv 'im."<BR />
But, trust a mother's eyes. . . . "<I>It's Jim! My Jim</I>!<BR /><BR />

"My Jim!" I 'ears; an', scootin' up the track <BR />
Come Missus Flood, with Flo close at 'er back.
<DIV>It was a race, for lover an' for son;</DIV>
<DIV>They finished neck an' neck; but mother won, </DIV>
For it was 'er that got the first good 'ug.<BR />
(I'm so took back I stands there like a mug.)
<BR /><BR />

<I>Then</I> come Flo's turn; an' Jim an' Digger they <BR />
Shake 'ands without no fancy, gran'-stand play.
<DIV>Yeh'd think they parted yesterd'y, them two. </DIV>
<DIV>For all the wild 'eroics that they do.</DIV>
"Yeh done it, lad," sez Jim.  "I knoo yeh would." <BR />
"You bet," sez Smith; "but I'm all to the good."<BR />
<BR />

Then, uv a sudden, all their tongues is loosed. <BR />
They finds me there an' I am intrajuiced;
<DIV>An' Jim tells 'ow it was 'e come to land</DIV>
<DIV>So soon, while Mar an' Flo each 'olds a 'and. </DIV>
But, jist as sudden, they all stop an' stare<BR />
Down to the 'ouse, at Dad Flood standin' there.
<BR /><BR />

'E's got 'is 'and up shadin' off the sun.<BR />
Then 'e starts up to them; but Dad don't run
<DIV>'E isn't 'owlin' for 'is lost boy's kiss;</DIV>
<DIV>'E's got 'is own sweet way in things like this. </DIV>
'E wanders up, an' stands an' looks at Jim. <BR />
An', spare me days, that look was extra grim!
<BR /><BR />
I seen the mother pluckin' at 'er dress;<BR />
I seen the girl's white face an' 'er distress.
<DIV>An' Digger Smith, 'e looks reel queer to me </DIV>
<DIV>Grinnin' inside 'imself 'e seemed to be.</DIV>
At last Dad sez--oh, 'e's a tough ole gun!<BR />
"Well, are yeh sorry now for wot yeh done?"
<BR /><BR />
Jim gives a start; but answers with a grin, <BR />
"Well, Dad, I 'ave been learnin' discipline.
<DIV>An' tho' I ain't quite sure wot did occur</DIV>
<DIV>Way back"--'e's grinnin' worse--"I'm sorry, sir." </DIV>
(It beats me, that, about these soldier blokes <BR />
They're always grinnin', like all things was jokes.)
<BR /><BR />
P'r'aps Dad is gettin' dull in 'is ole age; <BR />
But 'e don't seem to see Jim's cammyflage.
<DIV>P'r'aps 'e don't want to; for, in 'is ole eye, </DIV>
<DIV>I seen a twinkle as 'e give reply.</DIV>
"Nex' week," 'e sez, "we will begin to cart <BR />
The taters.  Yeh can make another start."
<BR /><BR />


But then 'e grabs Jim's 'and.  I seen the joy<BR />
In mother's eyes.  "Now, welcome 'ome, me boy,"
<DIV>Sez Dad; an' then 'e adds, "Yeh've made me proud;" </DIV>
<DIV>That's all.  An' 'e don't add it none too loud.</DIV>
Dad don't express 'is feelin's in a shout; <BR />
It cost 'im somethin' to git that much out.<BR /><BR />

 .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp;&nbsp;    . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp;   &nbsp;   .
<BR /><BR />

We 'ad the darnce.  An', spite uv all Begg's fears, <BR />
Jim darnced like 'e could keep it up for years;
<DIV>Mostly with Flo.  We don't let up till three; </DIV>
<DIV>An' then ole Peter Begg, Doreen an' me </DIV>
We walk together 'ome, an' on the way,<BR />
Doreen 'as quite a lot uv things to say.
<BR /><BR />

"Did you see Flo?" sez she.  "Don't she look grand? <BR />
That Jim's the luckiest in all the land--
<DIV>An' little Smith--that girl uv 'is, I'm sure, </DIV>
<DIV>She'll bring 'im 'appiness that will endure." </DIV>
She 'ugs my arm, then sez, "'Usband or wife, <BR />
If it's the right one, is the wealth uv life."
<BR /><BR />

I sneaks a look at Begg, an' answers, "Yes, <BR />
Yeh're right, ole girl; that's the reel 'appiness.
<DIV>An' if ole, lonely growlers was to know </DIV>
<DIV>The worth uv 'appy marridge 'ere below, </DIV>
They'd swap their bank-books for a wife," sez I. <BR />

REAMIN'?" I sez to Digger Smith.
<DIV>"Buck up, ole sport, an' smile. </DIV>
Ain't there enough uv joy to-day <BR />
To drive the bogey man away
<DIV>An' make reel things worth while? </DIV>
A bloke would think, to see you stare,<BR />
There's visions on the 'ill-tops there."
<BR /><BR />

"Dreamin'," sez Digger Smith.  "Why not?
<DIV>An' there is visions too.</DIV>
An' when I get 'em sorted out, <BR />
An' strafe that little bogey, Doubt,
<DIV>I'll start me life all new.</DIV>
Oh, I ain't crook; but packed in 'ere <BR />
Is thoughts: enough to last a year.
<BR /><BR />

"I'm thinkin' things," sez Digger Smith.
<DIV> "I'm thinkin' big an' fine</DIV>
Uv Life an' Love an' all the rest,<BR />
An' wot is right an' wot is best,
<DIV>An' 'ow much will be mine.</DIV>
Not that I'm wantin' overmuch<BR />
Some work, some play, an' food an' such."
<BR /><BR />

"See 'ere," I sez. "You 'ark to me.
<DIV>I've done some thinkin' too.</DIV>
An' this 'ere land, for wot yeh did,<BR />
Owes some few million solid quid
<DIV>To fightin' blokes like you.</DIV>
So don't be too dam modest or<BR />
Yeh'll git less than yeh're lookin' for."
<BR /><BR />

"Money?" sez Digger.  "Loot?" sez 'e
<DIV>"Aw, give that talk a rest!</DIV>
I'm sick uv it.  I didn't say<BR />
That I was thinkin' all uv pay,
<DIV>But wot was right an' best.</DIV>
An' that ain't in the crazy game<BR />
Uv grabbin' wealth an' chasin' fame.
<BR /><BR />

"Do you think us blokes Over There,
<DIV>When things was goin' strong, </DIV>
Was keepin' ledgers day be day<BR />
An' reck'nin' wot the crowd would pay?
<DIV>Pull off!  Yeh got it wrong.</DIV>
Do you think all the boys gone West<BR />
Wants great swank 'ead-stones on their chest?
<BR /><BR />

"You chaps at 'ome 'as small ideer
<DIV>Uv wot we think an' feel.</DIV>
We done our bit an' seen it thro', <BR />
An' all that we are askin' you
<DIV>Is jist a fair, square deal.</DIV>
We want this land we battled for <BR />
To settle up--an' somethin' more.
<BR /><BR />

"We want the land we battled for
<DIV>To be a land worth while.</DIV>
We're sick uv greed, an' 'ate, an' strife,<BR />
An' all the mess that's made uv life." . . .
<DIV>'E stopped a bit to smile.</DIV>
"I got these thoughts Out There becos<BR />
We learnt wot mateship reely was."
<BR /><BR />

 .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp;&nbsp;    . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp;   &nbsp;

<BR /><BR />

The hills be'ind the orchard trees
<DIV>Was showin' misty blue.</DIV>
The ev'nin' light was growin' dim; <BR />
An' down I sat 'longside uv 'im,
<DIV>An' done some dreamin' too.</DIV>
I dreams uv war; an' wot is paid<BR />
By blokes that went an' blokes that stayed.<BR /><BR />

I dreams uv honour an' reward,
<DIV>An' 'ow to pay a debt.</DIV>
For partin' cash, an' buyin' farms, <BR />
An' fittin' chaps with legs an' arms
<DIV>Ain't all--there's somethin' yet. </DIV>
There's still a solid balance due;<BR />
An' now it's up to me an' you.
<BR /><BR />

There's men I know ain't yet woke up,
<DIV>Or reckernized that debt--</DIV>
Proud men 'oo wouldn't take yeh down <BR />
Or owe their grocer 'arf-a-crown--
<DIV>They ain't considered, yet,</DIV>
There's somethin' owin'--to the dead, <BR />
An' Diggers live for more than bread.
<BR /><BR />

"<I>We</I> learnt wot mateship was," 'e sez.
<DIV>"Us Diggers found the good </DIV>
That's hid away somewhere in chaps, <BR />
An' ain't searched for enough, per'aps,
<DIV>Or prized, or understood.</DIV>
But all this game uv grab an' greed <BR />
An' silly 'ate--Why, where's the need?"
<BR /><BR />

The hills be'ind the orchard trees
<DIV>Jist caught the settin' sun.</DIV>
A bloke might easy think that there, <BR />
'Way back be'ind the range somewhere,
<DIV>Where streaks uv sunlight run, </DIV>
There was a land, swep' clear uv doubt,<BR />
Where men finds wot they dreams about.
<BR /><BR />


 .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp;&nbsp;    . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp; &nbsp;   . &nbsp; &nbsp;  .&nbsp;   &nbsp;
<BR /><BR />

"Beauty," sez Digger, sudden-like, <BR />
<DIV> "An' love, an' kindliness;</DIV>
The chance to live a clean, straight life, <BR />
A dinkum deal for kids an' wife
<DIV>A man needs nothin' less. . . . </DIV>
Maybe they'll get it when I go<BR />
To push up daisies.  I dunno."
<BR /><BR />

"Dreamin'," sez Digger Smith. "Why not?
<DIV>There's visions on the hill.". . .</DIV>
Then I gets up an' steals away, <BR />
An' leaves 'im with the dyin' day,
<DIV>Dreamin' an' doubtin' still. . . . </DIV>
Cobber, it's up to me an' you <BR />
To see that 'arf 'is dream comes true.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
