    <p class="heading">PREFACE.</p>

    <p>This volume needs no elaborate preface. A general sketch of
    the voyage which it describes was published in the 'Times'
    immediately after our return to England. That letter is
    reprinted here as a convenient summary of the 'Sunbeam's'
    performances. But these prefatory lines would indeed be
    incomplete if they did not contain a well-deserved tribute to
    the industry and accuracy of the author. The voyage would not
    have been undertaken, and assuredly it would never have been
    completed, without the impulse derived from her perseverance
    and determination. Still less would any sufficient record of
    the scenes and experiences of the long voyage have been
    preserved had it not been for her painstaking desire not only
    to see everything thoroughly, but to record her impressions
    faithfully and accurately. The practised skill of a
    professional writer cannot <span class="pagenum">Page
    viii<a name="Page_viii"
       id="Page_viii"></a></span>reasonably be expected in these
       simple pages, but their object will have been attained if
       they are the means of enabling more home-keeping friends to
       share in the keen enjoyment of the scenes and adventures
       they describe.</p>

    <p>The vessel which has carried us so rapidly and safely round
    the globe claims a brief description. She was designed by Mr.
    St. Clare Byrne, of Liverpool and may be technically defined as
    a screw composite three-masted topsail-yard schooner. The
    engines, by Messrs. Laird, are of 70 nominal or 350 indicated
    horse-power, and developed a speed of 10.13 knots at the
    measured mile. The bunkers contain 80 tons of coal. The average
    daily consumption is 4 tons, and the speed 8 knots in fine
    weather. The principal dimensions of the hull are&mdash;length
    for tonnage, 157 ft.; beam extreme, 27 ft. 6 in.; displacement
    tonnage, 531 tons; area of midship section, 202 sq. ft.</p>

    <p>At noon on July 1st, 1876, we said good-bye to the friends
    who had come to Chatham to see us off, and began the first
    stage of our voyage by steaming down to Sheerness, saluting our
    old friend the 'Duncan,' Admiral Chads's flagship, and passing
    through a perfect fleet of craft of all kinds. There was a
    fresh contrary wind, and the Channel was as disagreeable as
    usual under the circumstances. Next afternoon we were off
    Hastings, where we had intended to stop and dine and meet some
    friends; but, unfortunately the weather was not sufficiently
    favourable <span class="pagenum">Page 2<a name="Page_2"
       id="Page_2"></a></span> for us to land; so we made a long
       tack out to sea, and, in the evening, found ourselves once
       more near the land, off Beachy Head. While becalmed off
       Brighton, we all&mdash;children included&mdash;availed
       ourselves of the opportunity to go overboard and have our
       first swim, which we thoroughly enjoyed. We had steam up
       before ten, and again proceeded on our course. It was very
       hot, and sitting under the awning turned out to be the
       pleasantest occupation. The contrast between the weather of
       the two following days was very great, and afforded a
       forcible illustration of the uncertainties, perhaps the
       fascinations, of yachting. We steamed quietly on, past the
       'Owers' lightship, and the crowds of yachts at Ryde, and
       dropped anchor off Cowes at six o'clock.</p>

    <p>On the morning of the 6th a light breeze sprang up, and
    enabled us to go through the Needles with sails up and funnel
    down, a performance of which all on board felt very proud, as
    many yachtsmen had pronounced it to be an impossibility for our
    vessel to beat out in so light a breeze.</p>

    <p>We were forty-three on board, all told, as will be seen by
    reference to the list I have given. We had with us, besides,
    two dogs, three birds, and a charming Persian kitten belonging
    to the baby. The kitten soon disappeared, and it was feared she
    must have gone overboard down the hawse pipe. There was a faint
    hope, however, that she might have been packed away with the
    new sails, which had been stowed in a great hurry the day
    before. Unhappily she was never found again, and the children
    were inconsolable until they discovered, at Torquay, an
    effective substitute for 'Lily.'</p>

    <p>The Channel was tolerably smooth outside the Isle of Wight,
    and during the afternoon we were able to hold on our course
    direct for Ushant. After midnight, however, the wind worked
    gradually round to the W.S.W., and blew directly in our teeth.
    A terribly heavy sea got up; and, as we were making little or
    no progress, it was decided to <span class="pagenum">Page
    3<a name="Page_3"
       id="Page_3"></a></span>put in to Torquay or Dartmouth, and
       there await a change. We anchored in Torbay, about half a
       mile from the pier, at 8.30 a.m., and soon afterwards went
       ashore to bathe. We found, however, that the high rocks
       which surround the snug little bathing cove made the water
       as cold as ice.</p>

    <p>Nothing more having been heard of our poor little kitten, we
    can only conclude that she has gone overboard. Just as we were
    leaving the railway-station, however, we saw a small white
    kitten with a blue ribbon round its neck; and all the children
    at once exclaimed, 'There's our Lily!' We made inquiries, and
    found that it belonged to the young woman at the refreshment
    room, who, after some demur, allowed us to take it away with
    us, in compliance with Muriel's anxious wish, expressed on her
    face.</p>

    <p>About ten o'clock we got under way, but lay-to for
    breakfast. We then had a regular beat of it down
    Channel&mdash;everybody being ill. We formed a
    melancholy-looking little row down the lee side of the ship,
    though I must say that we were quite as cheery as might have
    been expected under the circumstances. It was bright and sunny
    overhead, which made things more bearable.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, July 9th</i>.&mdash;A calm at 2 a.m. Orders were
    given to get up steam; but the new coals from Chatham were slow
    to light, though good to keep up steam when once fairly
    kindled. For four long hours, therefore, we lolloped about in
    the trough of a heavy sea, the sails flapping as the vessel
    rolled. By the time the steam was up so was the breeze&mdash;a
    contrary one, of course. We accordingly steamed and sailed all
    day, taking more water on board, though not really in any great
    quantity, than I had ever seen the good ship do before. She
    carries a larger supply of coal and other stores than usual,
    and no doubt the square yards on the foremast make her pitch
    more heavily. We were all very sorry for ourselves, and
    'church,' postponed from eleven until four o'clock, brought
    together but a small congregation.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 4<a name="Page_4"
       id="Page_4"></a></span> On the 8th we were fairly away from
       Old England, and on the next day off Ushant, which we
       rounded at about 4.30 p.m., at the distance of a mile and a
       half; the sea was tremendous, the waves breaking in columns
       of spray against the sharp needle-like rocks that form the
       point of the island. The only excitement during the day was
       afforded by the visit of a pilot-boat (without any fish on
       board), whose owner was very anxious to take us into Brest,
       'safe from the coming storm,' which he predicted. In
       addition to our other discomforts, it now rained hard; and
       by half-past six I think nearly all our party had made up
       their minds that bed would be the most comfortable
       place.</p>

    <p>Two days later we sailed into lovely, bright, warm, sunny
    weather, with a strong north-easterly breeze, a following sea,
    and an occasional long roll from the westward. But as the sun
    rose, the wind increased, and we got rather knocked about by
    the sea. A good deal of water came on board, and it was
    impossible to sit anywhere in comfort, unless lashed or firmly
    wedged in. We were, however, going ten knots through the water,
    on our course, under our new square head canvas; and this fact
    made up for a good deal of discomfort.</p>

    <p>The thirty extra tons of spare sails, spars, and provisions,
    the fifteen tons of water, and the eighty-four tons of coal,
    made a great difference in our buoyancy, and the sea came
    popping in and out at the most unexpected places; much to the
    delight of the children, who, with bare feet and legs, and
    armed with mops and sponges, waged mimic war against the
    intruder and each other, singing and dancing to their hearts'
    content. This amusement was occasionally interrupted by a
    heavier roll than usual, sending them all into the lee
    scuppers, sousing them from head to foot, and necessitating a
    thorough change of clothing, despite their urgent protest that
    sea-water never hurt anybody.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 5<a name="Page_5"
       id="Page_5"></a></span> After our five o'clock dinner,
       however, we very nearly met with a most serious accident. We
       were all sitting or standing about the stern of the vessel,
       admiring the magnificent dark blue billows following us,
       with their curling white crests, mountains high. Each wave,
       as it approached, appeared as if it must overwhelm us,
       instead of which, it rushed grandly by, rolling and shaking
       us from stem to stern, and sending fountains of spray on
       board.</p>

    <p>Tom was looking at the stern compass, Allnutt being close to
    him. Mr. Bingham and Mr. Freer were smoking, half-way between
    the quarter-deck and the after-companion, where Captain Brown,
    Dr. Potter, Muriel, and I, were standing. Captain Lecky, seated
    on a large coil of rope, placed on the box of the rudder, was
    spinning Mabelle a yarn. A new hand was steering, and just at
    the moment when an unusually big wave overtook us, he
    unfortunately allowed the vessel to broach-to a little. In a
    second the sea came pouring over <span class="pagenum">Page
    6<a name="Page_6"
       id="Page_6"></a></span>the stern, above Allnutt's head. The
       boy was nearly washed overboard, but he managed to catch
       hold of the rail, and, with great presence of mind, stuck
       his knees into the bulwarks. Kindred, our boatswain, seeing
       his danger, rushed forward to save him, but was knocked down
       by the return wave, from which he emerged gasping. The coil
       of rope, on which Captain Lecky and Mabelle were seated, was
       completely floated by the sea. Providentially, however, he
       had taken a double turn round his wrist with a reefing
       point, and, throwing his other arm round Mabelle, held on
       like grim death; otherwise nothing could have saved them.
       She was perfectly self-possessed, and only said quietly,
       'Hold on, Captain Lecky, hold on!' to which he replied, 'All
       right.' I asked her afterwards if she thought she was going
       overboard, and she answered, 'I did not <i>think</i> at all,
       mamma, but felt sure we were gone.' Captain Lecky, being
       accustomed to very large ships, had not in the least
       realised how near we were to the water in our little vessel,
       and was proportionately taken by surprise. All the rest of
       the party were drenched, with the exception of Muriel, whom
       Captain Brown held high above the water in his arms, and who
       lost no time in remarking, in the midst of the general
       confusion, 'I'm not at all wet, I'm not.' Happily, the
       children don't know what fear is. The maids, however, were
       very frightened, as some of the sea had got down into the
       nursery, and the skylights had to be screwed down. Our
       studding-sail boom, too, broke with a loud crack when the
       ship broached-to, and the jaws of the fore-boom gave
       way.</p>

    <p>Soon after this adventure we all went to bed, full of
    thankfulness that it had ended as well as it did; but, alas,
    not, so far as I was concerned, to rest in peace. In about two
    hours I was awakened by a tremendous weight of water suddenly
    descending upon me and flooding the bed. I immediately sprang
    out, only to find myself in another pool on the floor. It was
    pitch dark, and I could <span class="pagenum">Page
    7<a name="Page_7"
       id="Page_7"></a></span>not think what had happened; so I
       rushed on deck, and found that, the weather having moderated
       a little, some kind sailor, knowing my love of fresh air,
       had opened the skylight rather too soon; and one of the
       angry waves had popped on board, deluging the cabin.</p>

    <p>I got a light, and proceeded to mop up, as best I could, and
    then endeavoured to find a dry place to sleep in. This,
    however, was no easy task, for my own bed was drenched, and
    every other berth occupied. The deck, too, was ankle-deep in
    water, as I found when I tried to get across to the deck-house
    sofa. At last I lay down on the floor, wrapped up in my ulster,
    and wedged between the foot stanchion of our swing bed and the
    wardrobe athwart-ship; so that as the yacht rolled heavily, my
    feet were often higher than my head. Consequently, what sleep I
    snatched turned into nightmare, of which the fixed idea was a
    broken head from the three hundredweight of lead at the bottom
    of our bed, swinging wildly from side to side and up and down,
    as the vessel rolled and pitched, suggesting all manner of
    accidents. When morning came at last, the weather cleared a
    good deal, though the breeze continued. All hands were soon
    busily employed in repairing damages; and very picturesque the
    deck and rigging of the 'Sunbeam' looked, with the various
    groups of men, occupied upon the ropes, spars, and sails.
    Towards evening the wind fell light, and we had to get up
    steam. The night was the first really warm one we had enjoyed,
    and the stars shone out brightly. The sea, which had been of a
    lovely blue colour during the day, showed a slight
    phosphorescence after dark.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, July 13th</i>.&mdash;When I went on deck, at
    half-past six, I found a grey, steamy, calm morning, promising
    a very hot day, without wind.</p>

    <p>About 10.30 a.m., the cry of 'Sail on the port beam!' caused
    general excitement, and in a few minutes every telescope and
    glass in the ship had been brought to bear
    <span class="pagenum">Page 8<a name="Page_8"
       id="Page_8"></a></span> upon the object which attracted our
       attention, and which was soon pronounced to be a wreck.
       Orders were given to starboard the helm, and to steer direct
       for the vessel; and many were the conjectures hazarded, and
       the questions asked of the fortunate holders of glasses.
       'What is she?' 'Is there any one on board?' 'Where does she
       come from?' 'Can you read her name?' 'Does she look as if
       she had been long abandoned?' Soon we were near enough to
       send a boat's crew on board, whilst we watched their
       movements anxiously from the bridge. We could now read her
       name&mdash;the 'Carolina'&mdash;surmounted by a gorgeous
       yellow decoration on her stern. She was of between two and
       three hundred tons burden, and was painted a light blue,
       with a red streak. Beneath her white bowsprit the gaudy
       image of a woman served as a figure-head. The two masts had
       been snapped short off about three feet from the deck, and
       the bulwarks were gone, only the covering board and
       stanchions remaining, so that each wave washed over and
       through her. The roof and supports of the deck-house and the
       companions were still left standing, but the sides had
       disappeared, and the ship's deck was burst up in such a
       manner as to remind one of a quail's back.</p>

    <p>We saw the men on board poking about, apparently very
    pleased with what they had found; and soon our boat returned to
    the yacht for some breakers<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
       id="FNanchor_1_1">,</a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
       class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as the 'Carolina' had been laden
       with port wine and cork, and the men wished to bring some of
       the former on board. I changed my dress, and, putting on my
       sea boots, started for the wreck.</p>

    <p>We found the men rather excited over their discovery. The
    wine must have been <i>very</i> new and <i>very</i> strong, for
    the smell from it, as it slopped about all over the deck, was
    almost enough to intoxicate anybody. One pipe had already been
    emptied into the breakers and barrels, and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 9<a name="Page_9"
       id="Page_9"></a></span> great efforts were made to get some
       of the casks out whole; but this was found to be impossible,
       without devoting more time to the operation than we chose to
       spare. The men managed to remove three half-empty casks with
       their heads stove in, which they threw overboard, but the
       full ones would have required special appliances to raise
       them through the hatches. It proved exceedingly difficult to
       get at the wine, which was stowed underneath the cork, and
       there was also a quantity of cabin bulkheads and fittings
       floating about, under the influence of the long swell of the
       Atlantic. It was a curious sight, standing on the roof of
       the deck-house, to look into the hold, full of floating
       bales of cork, barrels, and pieces of wood, and to watch the
       sea surging up in every direction, through and over the
       deck, which was level with the water's edge. I saw an
       excellent modern iron cooking-stove washing about from side
       to side; but almost every other moveable article, including
       spars and ropes, had apparently been removed by previous
       boarders. <span class="pagenum">Page 10<a name="Page_10"
       id="Page_10"></a></span></p>

    <p>It would have delayed us too long to tow the vessel into the
    nearest port, 375 miles distant, or we might have claimed the
    salvage money, estimated by the experts at 1,500<i>l</i>. She
    was too low in the water for it to be possible for us, with our
    limited appliances, to blow her up; so we were obliged to leave
    her floating about as a derelict, a fertile source of danger to
    all ships crossing her track. With her buoyant cargo, and with
    the trade winds slowly wafting her to smoother seas, it may
    probably be some years before she breaks up. I only hope that
    no good ship may run full speed on to her, some dark night, for
    the 'Carolina' would prove almost as formidable an obstacle as
    a sunken rock.</p>

    <p>Tom was now signalling for us to go on board again, and for
    a few minutes I was rather afraid we should have had a little
    trouble in getting the men off, as their excitement had not
    decreased; but after a trifling delay and some rather rough
    play amongst themselves, they became steady again, and we
    returned to the yacht with our various prizes.</p>

    <p>A 'Mother Carey's chicken' hovered round the wreck while we
    were on board, and followed us to the 'Sunbeam;' and although a
    flat calm and a heavy swell prevailed at the time, we all
    looked upon our visitor as the harbinger of a breeze. In this
    instance, at least, the well-known sailor's superstition was
    justified; for, before the evening, the wind sprang up, and
    'fires out and sails up' was the order of the day. We were soon
    bowling merrily along at the rate of seven knots an hour, while
    a clear starlight night and a heavy dew gave promise of a fine
    morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, July 14th</i>.&mdash;We still have a light wind,
    right aft, accompanied by a heavy roll from the westward, which
    makes it impossible to sit anywhere with comfort, and difficult
    even to read. By 6 a.m. the sun had become very powerful,
    though its heat was tempered by the breeze,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 11<a name="Page_11"
       id="Page_11"></a></span>which gradually increased throughout
       the day, until, having set all our fore-and-aft canvas, as
       well as our square sails, we glided steadily along, in
       delightful contrast to the uneasy motion of the morning, and
       of the past few days. Under the awning&mdash;with the most
       heavenly blue sky above, and the still darker clear blue sea
       beneath, stretching away in gentle ripples as far as the eye
       could reach&mdash;it was simply perfect.</p>

    <p>Our little party get on extremely well together, though a
    week ago they were strangers to each other. We are all so busy
    that we do not see much of one another except at meals, and
    then we have plenty to talk about. Captain Lecky imparts to us
    some of his valuable information about scientific navigation
    and the law of storms, and he and Tom and Captain Brown work
    hard at these subjects. Mr. Freer follows in the same path; Mr.
    Bingham draws and reads; Dr. Potter helps me to teach the
    children, who, I am happy to say, are as well as possible. I
    read and write a great deal, and learn Spanish, so that the
    days are all too short for what we have to do. The servants are
    settling down well into their places, and the commissariat
    department does great credit to the cooks and stewards. The
    maids get on satisfactorily, but are a little nervous on rough
    nights. We hope not to have many more just at present, for we
    are now approaching calmer latitudes.</p>

    <p>In the course of the day, whilst Tom and I were sitting in
    the stern, the man at the wheel suddenly exclaimed, 'There's
    land on the port bow.' We knew, from the distance we had run,
    that this could not be the case, and after looking at it
    through the glasses, Tom pronounced the supposed land to be a
    thick wall of fog, advancing towards us <i>against</i> the
    wind. Captain Brown and Captain Lecky came from below, and
    hastened to get in the studding-sails, in anticipation of the
    coming squall. In a few minutes we had lost our fair breeze and
    brilliant sunshine, all our sails <span class="pagenum">Page
    12<a name="Page_12"
       id="Page_12"></a></span>were taken flat aback, and we found
       ourselves enveloped in a dense fog, which made it impossible
       for us to see the length of the vessel. It was an
       extraordinary phenomenon. Captain Lecky, who, in the course
       of his many voyages, has passed within a few miles of this
       exact spot more than a hundred and fifty times, had never
       seen anything in the least like it. As night came on the fog
       increased, and the boats were prepared ready for lowering.
       Two men went to the wheel, and two to the bows to look out,
       while an officer was stationed on the bridge with
       steam-whistle and bell ready for an emergency; so that, in
       case we ran into anything, or anything ran into us, we
       should at least have the satisfaction of knowing that, so
       far as we were concerned, it had all been done strictly
       according to Act of Parliament.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, July 15th</i>.&mdash;Between midnight and 4
    a.m. the fog disappeared, as suddenly as it had come on. We
    must have passed through a wide belt of it. At 5.30 a.m., when
    Tom called me to see a steamer go by, it was quite clear. The
    vessel was the 'Roman,' and she passed so close to us that we
    made our number, and exchanged salutations with the officers on
    the bridge.</p>

    <p>Towards the afternoon a nice breeze sprang up, and we were
    able to bank fires and sail.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, July 16th</i>.&mdash;Porto Santo being visible on
    the port bow, a quarter of a mile ahead, by 3.55 a.m. this
    morning, our three navigators congratulated themselves and each
    other on the good land-fall they had made.</p>

    <p>It looks a curious little island, and is situated about
    thirty-five miles north-east of Madeira, with a high peak in
    the centre, of which we could only see the extreme point,
    appearing above the clouds.</p>

    <p>It is interesting to know that it was from his observation
    of the drift-wood and d&eacute;bris washed on to the eastern
    shore that Columbus, who had married the daughter of the
    Governor of Porto Santo, derived his first impressions of the
    existence of the New World. Here it was that he first realised
    there might possibly be a large and unknown country to the
    westward; here it was that he first conceived
    <span class="pagenum">Page 14<a name="Page_14"
       id="Page_14"></a></span> the project of exploring the
       hitherto unknown ocean and of discovering what new countries
       might bound its western shores.</p>

    <p>An hour later we saw Fora and its light, at the extreme east
    of Madeira, and could soon distinguish the mountains in the
    centre of the latter island. As we rapidly approached the land,
    the beauty of the scenery became more fully apparent. A mass of
    dark purple volcanic rocks, clothed on the top with the richest
    vegetation, with patches of all sorts of colour on their sides,
    rises boldly from the sea. There are several small detached
    rocks, and one curious pointed little island, with an arch
    right through the middle of it, rather like the Perc&eacute;
    Rock on the coast of Nova Scotia. We steamed slowly along the
    east coast, passing many pretty hamlets, nestled in bays or
    perched on the side of the hills, and observing how every
    possible nook and corner seemed to be terraced and cultivated.
    Sugar-canes, Indian corn, vines, and many varieties of tropical
    and semi-tropical plants, grow luxuriantly in this lovely
    climate. Nearly all the cottages in the island are inhabited by
    a simple people, many of whom have never left their native
    villages, even to look at the magnificent view from the top of
    the surrounding mountains, or to gaze on the sea, by which they
    are encompassed.</p>

    <p>We dropped our anchor in the bay of Funchal at about twelve
    o'clock, and before breakfast was over found ourselves
    surrounded by a perfect flotilla of boats, though none of them
    dared approach very near until the health-officer had come
    alongside and pronounced us free from infection. At this moment
    all are complaining much of the heat, which since yesterday has
    been very great, and is caused by the wind called 'Este,'
    blowing direct from the African deserts. It was 79&deg; in the
    coolest place on board, and 84&deg; on shore in the shade, in
    the middle of the day.</p>

    <p>The African mail steamer, 'Ethiopia,' last from Bonny, West
    Coast of Africa, whence she arrived the day before
    <span class="pagenum">Page 15<a name="Page_15"
       id="Page_15"></a></span> yesterday, was lying in the bay,
       and the children went on board with some of our party to see
       her cargo of monkeys, parrots, and pineapples. The result
       was an importation of five parrots on board the 'Sunbeam;'
       but the monkeys were too big for us. Captain Dane, who paid
       us a return visit, said that the temperature here appeared
       quite cool to him, as for the last few weeks his thermometer
       had varied from 82&deg; to 96&deg; in the shade.</p>

    <p>We had service at 4 p.m., and at 5 p.m. went ashore in a
    native boat, furnished with bilge pieces, to keep her straight
    when beached, and to avoid the surf, for it was too rough for
    our own boats. At the water's edge a curious sort of double
    sleigh, drawn by two oxen, was waiting. Into this we stepped,
    setting off with considerable rapidity up the steep shingly
    beach, under a beautiful row of trees, to the 'Pra&ccedil;a,'
    where the greater portion of the population were walking up and
    down, or sitting under the shade of the magnolias. These plants
    here attain the size of forest-trees, and their large white
    wax-like flowers shed a most delightful fragrance on the
    evening air. There were graceful pepper vines too, and a great
    variety of trees only known to us in England in the form of
    small shrubs. This being a festival day, the streets were
    crowded with people from town and country, in their holiday
    attire. The door-posts and balconies of the houses were
    wreathed with flowers, the designs in many cases being very
    pretty. One arcade in particular was quite lovely, with arches
    made of double red geranium, mixed with the feathery-looking
    pepper leaves, while the uprights were covered with amaryllis
    and white arum lilies. The streets were strewn with roses and
    branches of myrtle, which, bruised by the feet of the
    passers-by and the runners of the bullock sleigh, emitted a
    delicious aromatic odour.</p>

    <p>The trellises in the gardens seem overgrown with
    stephanotis, mauve and purple passion-flowers, and all kinds of
    rare creepers, the purple and white hibiscus shoots up
    <span class="pagenum">Page 16<a name="Page_16"
       id="Page_16"></a></span>some fourteen to sixteen feet in
       height; bananas, full of fruit and flower, strelitzias,
       heliotrope, geraniums, and pelargoniums, bloom all around in
       large shrubs, mixed with palms and mimosas of every variety;
       and the whole formed such an enchanting picture that we were
       loth to tear ourselves away.</p>

    <p>A ride of about twenty minutes in the bullock sleigh, up a
    steep hill, by the side of a rocky torrent, whose banks were
    overgrown with caladiums and vines, brought us to our
    destination, Til, whence we had a splendid view of the town and
    bay stretching beneath us. During the ascent we passed several
    cottages, whose inhabitants stood airing themselves on the
    threshold after the great heat of the day, and through the open
    doorways we occasionally got a peep into the gardens beyond,
    full of bright flowers and luxuriant with vines, fig-trees, and
    bananas. As we sat in the terrace garden at Til we enjoyed the
    sweet scent of the flowers we could no longer see, and listened
    to the cool splash of the water in the fountain below; whilst
    Allnutt, with unceasing energy, searched amongst the bushes for
    moths, of which he found a large number.</p>

    <p>We jogged down the hill a great deal faster than we had come
    up, stopping only for a short time in the now more than ever
    crowded 'Pra&ccedil;a,' to listen to one or two airs played by
    the Portuguese band, before we got back to the yacht at about
    half-past ten.</p>

    <p>Next morning we were off to the fish-market by seven
    o'clock, but it was not a good time for our visit, as there had
    been no moon on the previous night; and, though there were fish
    of various kinds, saw nothing specially worthy of notice. The
    picturesque costumes of the people were, however, interesting.
    We afterwards went to the fruit-market, though it was not
    specially worth seeing, for most of the fruit and vegetables
    are brought in boats from villages on the sea-shore; and, as it
    is necessary to wait until the sea-breeze springs up, they do
    not arrive until <span class="pagenum">Page 17<a name="Page_17"
       id="Page_17"></a></span>midday. After our walk the children
       and I went down to the beach and bathed, taking care not to
       go too far out on account of the sharks, of which we had
       been warned. We undressed and dressed in tents, not unlike
       clothes-horses, with a bit of matting thrown over them, in
       which the heat was intense. The beach is very steep; and as
       one gets out of one's depth immediately, indifferent
       swimmers put on a couple of bladders&mdash;which stick out
       behind their backs and produce a strange effect&mdash;or
       else take a bathing-man into the water with them. I
       preferred the latter course; and we all had a pleasant
       bathe.</p>

    <p>The natives seem almost amphibious in their habits, and the
    yacht is surrounded all day by boats full of small boys, who
    will dive to any depth for sixpence, a dozen of them
    spluttering and fighting for the coin in the water at the same
    time. They will go down on one side of the yacht too, and bob
    up on the other, almost before you have time to run across the
    deck to witness their reappearance. <span class="pagenum">Page
    18<a name="Page_18"
       id="Page_18"></a></span></p>

    <p>The Loo Rock, with its old fortress, close to our anchorage,
    forms a picturesque object; and the scene from the yacht,
    enlivened by the presence of numerous market-boats, laden with
    fruit and vegetables, is very pretty. We lie about 150 yards
    from the shore, just under Mr. Danero's quinta. The cliff just
    here is overhung with bougainvill&aelig;as, geraniums,
    fuchsias, aloes, prickly pears, and other flowers, which grow
    luxuriantly quite down to the water's edge, wherever they can
    contrive to find a root-hold.</p>

    <p>After five o'clock tea we rode up the Mount and through the
    woods on horseback, along a road gay with masses of wild
    geranium, hydrangea, amaryllis, and fuchsia. We dismounted at a
    lovely place, which contains a large number of rare trees and
    plants, brought from all parts of the world. Here were enormous
    camellias, as well as purple, red, and white azaleas, Guernsey
    lilies, all growing in the greatest profusion.</p>

    <p>Our descent of the Mount, by means of a form of conveyance
    commonly used on the island, was very amusing. At the summit we
    found basket-work sleighs, each constructed to hold two people,
    and attended by a couple of men, lashed together. Into these we
    stepped, and were immediately pushed down the hill at a
    tremendous pace. The gliding motion is delightful, and was
    altogether a novelty to us. The men manage the sleighs with
    great skill, steering them in the most wonderful manner round
    the sharp angles in the zigzag road, and making use of their
    bare feet as brakes when necessary. The turns were occasionally
    so abrupt, that it seemed almost impossible that we could avoid
    being upset; but we reached the bottom quite safely. The
    children were especially delighted with the trip, and indeed we
    all enjoyed it immensely. The only danger is the risk of fire
    from the friction of the steel runners against the gravel
    road.</p>

    <p>After paying a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Blandy, whose house is
    beautifully situated, we dined at the hotel, and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 19<a name="Page_19"
       id="Page_19"></a></span>afterwards sat in the lovely
       semi-tropical garden until it was time to go on board to
       bed.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, July 18th</i>.&mdash;We were called at 4.30
    a.m., and went ashore soon after six to meet some friends, with
    whom we had arranged to ride up to the Gran Corral, and to
    breakfast there, 5,000 feet above the level of the sea.</p>

    <p>It soon became evident that the time we had selected for
    landing was the fashionable bathing hour. In fact, it required
    some skill on our part to keep the boat clear of the crowds of
    people of both sexes and all ages, who were taking their
    morning dip. It was most absurd to see entire families, from
    the bald-headed and spectacled grandfather to the baby who
    could scarcely walk, all disporting themselves in the water
    together, many of them supported by the very inelegant-looking
    bladders I have mentioned. There was a little delay in mounting
    our horses, under the shade of the fig-trees; but when we were
    once off, a party of eleven, the cavalcade became quite
    formidable. As we clattered up the paved streets, between
    vineyard and garden walls, 'curiosity opened her lattice,' on
    more than one occasion, to ascertain the cause of the unwonted
    commotion. The views on our way, as we sometimes climbed a
    steep ascent or descended a deep ravine, were very varied, but
    always beautiful. About half-way up we stopped to rest under a
    delightful trellis of vines, by the side of a rushing mountain
    stream, bordered with ferns; then, leaving the vineyards and
    gardens behind us, we passed through forests of shady Spanish
    chestnut trees, beneath which stretched the luxurious
    greensward.</p>

    <p>At ten o'clock we quitted this grateful shade, and arrived
    at the neck of the pass, facing the Gran Corral, where we had
    to make our choice of ascending a conical hill, on our left, or
    the Torrinhas Peak, on our right. The latter was chosen, as
    promising the better view, although it
    <span class="pagenum">Page 20<a name="Page_20"
       id="Page_20"></a></span>was rather farther off, so we were
       accordingly seized upon by some of the crowd of peasants who
       surrounded us, and who at once proceeded to push and pull us
       up a steep slippery grass slope, interspersed with large
       boulders. The view from the top, looking down a sheer
       precipice of some 1,500 feet in depth into the valley below,
       was lovely. Quite at the bottom, amid the numerous ravines
       and small spurs of rocks by which the valley is intersected,
       we could distinguish some small patches of cultivated
       ground. Above our heads towered the jagged crests of the
       highest peaks, Pico Ruivo and others, which we had already
       seen from the yacht, when we first sighted the island.</p>

    <p>A pleasant walk over some grassy slopes, and two more hard
    scrambles, took us to the summit of the Torrinhas Peak; but the
    charming and extensive view towards Camara de Lobos, and the
    bay and town of Funchal, was an ample reward for all our
    trouble. It did not take us long to get back to the welcome
    shade of the chestnut trees, for we were all ravenously hungry,
    it being now eleven o'clock. But, alas! breakfast had not
    arrived: so we had no resource but to mount our horses again
    and ride down to meet it. Mr. Miles, of the hotel, had not kept
    his word; he had promised that our provisions should be sent up
    to us by nine o'clock, and it was midday before we met the men
    carrying the hampers on their heads. There was now nothing for
    it but to organise a picnic on the terrace of Mr. Veitch's
    deserted villa, beneath the shade of camellia, fuchsia, myrtle,
    magnolia, and pepper-trees, from whence we could also enjoy the
    fine view of the fertile valley beneath us and the blue sea
    sparkling beyond.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, July 19th</i>.&mdash;We were so tired after
    our exertions of yesterday, that it was nine o'clock before we
    all mustered for our morning swim, which I think we enjoyed the
    more from the fact of our having previously been prevented by
    the sharks, or rather by the rumour of
    sharks.<span class="pagenum">Page 21<a name="Page_21"
       id="Page_21"></a></span></p>

    <p>We were engaged to lunch at Mr. and Mrs. Blandy's, but I was
    so weary that I did not go ashore until about six o'clock in
    the evening, and then I went first to the English cemetery,
    which is very prettily laid out and well kept. The various
    paths are shaded by pepper-trees, entwined with
    bougainvill&aelig;a, while in many places the railings are
    completely covered by long trailing masses of stephanotis in
    full bloom. Some of the inscriptions on the tombs are extremely
    touching, and it is sad to see, as is almost always the case in
    places much resorted to by invalids, how large a proportion of
    those who lie buried here have been cut off in the very flower
    of their youth. Indeed, the residents at Madeira complain that
    it is a melancholy drawback to the charms of this beautiful
    island, that the friendship frequently formed between them and
    people who come hither in search of health, is in so many cases
    brought to an early and sad termination. Having seen and
    admired Mrs. Foljambe's charming garden by daylight, we
    returned on board to receive some friends. Unfortunately they
    were not very good sailors, and, out of our party of twenty,
    one lady had to go ashore at once, and another before dinner
    was over.</p>

    <p>They all admired the yacht very much, particularly the
    various cozy corners in the deck-house. It was a lovely night;
    and after the departure of our guests, at about ten o'clock, we
    steamed out of the bay, where we found a nice light breeze,
    which enabled us to sail.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, July 20th</i>.&mdash;All to-day has been taken
    up in arranging our photographs, journals, &amp;c. &amp;c., and
    in preparing for our visit to Teneriffe. About twelve o'clock
    the wind fell light and we tried fishing, but without success,
    though several bonitos or flying-fish were seen. It was very
    hot, and it seemed quite a relief when, at eight o'clock in the
    evening, we began steaming, thus creating a breeze for
    ourselves.<span class="pagenum">Page 22<a name="Page_22"
       id="Page_22"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Friday, July 21st</i>.&mdash;We all rose early, and were
    full of excitement to catch the first glimpse of the famous
    Peak of Teneriffe. There was a nice breeze from the north-east,
    the true trade wind, we hope, which ought to carry us down
    nearly to the Line. The morning being rather hazy, it was quite
    ten o'clock before we saw the Peak, towering above the clouds,
    right ahead, about fifty-nine miles off. As we approached, it
    appeared less perpendicular than we had expected, or than it is
    generally represented in pictures. The other mountains too, in
    the centre of the island, from the midst of which it rises, are
    so very lofty that, in spite of its conical sugar-loaf top, it
    is difficult at first to realise that the Peak is 12,180 feet
    high. <span class="pagenum">Page 23<a name="Page_23"
       id="Page_23"></a></span></p>

    <p>We dropped anchor under its shadow in the harbour of Orotava
    in preference to the capital, Santa Cruz, both on account of
    its being a healthier place, and also in order to be nearer to
    the Peak, which we wished to ascend.</p>

    <p>The heat having made the rest of our party rather lazy,
    Captain Lecky and I volunteered to go on shore to see the
    Vice-Consul, Mr. Goodall, and try to make arrangements for our
    expedition. It was only 2 p.m., and very hot work, walking
    through the deserted streets, but luckily we had not far to go,
    and the house was nice and cool when we got there. Mr. Goodall
    sent off at once for a carriage, despatching a messenger also
    to the mountains for horses and guides, which there was some
    difficulty in obtaining at such short notice.</p>

    <p>Having organised the expedition we re-embarked to dine on
    board the yacht, and I went to bed at seven, to be called
    again, however, at half-past ten o'clock. After a light supper,
    we landed and went to the Vice-Consul's arriving there exactly
    at midnight. But no horses were forthcoming, so we lay down on
    our rugs in the patio, and endeavoured to sleep, as we knew we
    should require all our strength for the expedition before
    us.</p>

    <p>There were sundry false alarms of a start, as the horses
    arrived by ones and twos from the neighbouring villages,
    accompanied by their respective owners. By two o'clock all our
    steeds, twelve in number, had assembled, and in another quarter
    of an hour we were leaving the town by a steep stony path,
    bordered by low walls. There was no moon, and for the first two
    hours it was very dark. At the end of that time we could see
    the first glimmer of dawn, and were shortly afterwards able to
    distinguish each other and to observe the beautiful view which
    lay below us as we wended our way up and up between small
    patches of cultivation. Soon we climbed above the clouds, which
    presented a most curious appearance as we looked down upon
    them. The strata through which we had passed was so
    <span class="pagenum">Page 24<a name="Page_24"
       id="Page_24"></a></span>dense and so white, that it looked
       exactly like an enormous glacier, covered with fresh fallen
       snow, extending for miles and miles; while the projecting
       tops of the other Canary Islands appeared only like great
       solitary rocks.</p>

    <p>The sun had already become very oppressive, and at half-past
    seven we stopped to breakfast and to water the horses.
    Half-past eight found us in the saddle again, and we commenced
    to traverse a dreary plain of yellowish white pumice-stone,
    interspersed with huge blocks of obsidian, thrown from the
    mouth of the volcano. At first the monotony of the scene was
    relieved by large bushes of yellow broom in full flower, and
    still larger bushes of the beautiful <i>Retama blanca</i>,
    quite covered with lovely white bloom, scenting the air with
    its delicious fragrance, and resembling huge tufts of feathers,
    eight or nine feet high. As we proceeded, however, we left all
    traces of vegetation behind us. It was like the Great Sahara.
    On every side a vast expanse of yellow pumice-stone sand spread
    around us, an occasional block of rock sticking up here and
    there, and looking as if it had indeed been fused in a mighty
    furnace. By half-past ten we had reached the 'Estancia de los
    Ingleses,' 9,639 feet above the level of the sea, where the
    baggage and some of the horses had to be left behind, the
    saddles being transferred to mules for the very steep climb
    before us. After a drink of water all round, we started again,
    and commenced the ascent of the almost perpendicular stream of
    lava and stone, which forms the only practicable route to the
    top. Our poor beasts were only able to go a few paces at a time
    without stopping to regain their breath. The loose ashes and
    lava fortunately gave them a good foothold, or it would have
    been quite impossible for them to get along at all. One was
    only encouraged to proceed by the sight of one's friends above,
    looking like flies clinging to the face of a wall. The road, if
    such it can be called, ran in zigzags, each of which was about
    the length of two horses, so that we were in turns
    <span class="pagenum">Page 25<a name="Page_25"
       id="Page_25"></a></span>one above another. There were a few
       slips and slides and tumbles, but no important casualties;
       and in about an hour and a half we had reached the 'Alta
       Vista,' a tiny plateau, where the horses were to be
       left.</p>

    <p>The expedition so far had been such a fatiguing one, and the
    heat was so great, that the children and I decided to remain
    here, and to let the gentlemen proceed alone to the summit of
    the Peak. We tried to find some shade, but the sun was so
    immediately above us that this was almost an impossibility.
    However, we managed to squeeze ourselves under some slightly
    overhanging rocks, and I took some photographs while the
    children slept. The guides soon returned with water-barrels
    full of ice, procured from a cavern above, where there is a
    stream of water constantly running; and nothing could have been
    more grateful and refreshing.</p>

    <p>It was more than three hours before Tom and Captain Lecky
    reappeared, to be soon followed by the rest of the party.
    Whilst they rested and refreshed themselves with ice, they
    described the ascent as fatiguing in the extreme, in fact,
    almost an impossibility for a lady. First they had scrambled
    over huge blocks of rough lava to the tiny plain of the
    Rambleta, 11,466 feet above the level of the sea, after which
    they had to climb up the cone itself, 530 feet in height, and
    sloping at an angle of 44 degrees. It is composed of ashes and
    calcined chalk, into which their feet sank, while, for every
    two steps they made forwards and upwards, they slipped one
    backwards. But those who reached the top were rewarded for
    their exertions by a glorious view, and by the wonderful
    appearance of the summit of the Peak. The ground beneath their
    feet was hot, while sulphurous vapours and smoke issued from
    various small fissures around them, though there has been no
    actual eruption from this crater of the volcano since 1704.
    They brought down with them a beautiful piece of calcined
    chalk, covered with crystals of sulphur and arsenic, and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 26<a name="Page_26"
       id="Page_26"></a></span>some other specimens. Parched and
       dry as the ground looked where I was resting, a few grains
       of barley, dropped by mules on the occasion of a previous
       visit, had taken root and had grown up into ear; and there
       were also a few roots of a sort of dog-violet, showing its
       delicate lavender-coloured flowers 11,000 feet above the
       sea, and far beyond the level of any other vegetation.</p>

    <p>It was impossible to ride down to the spot where we had left
    the baggage animals, and the descent was consequently very
    fatiguing, and even painful. At every step our feet sank into a
    mass of loose scori&aelig; and ashes; and so we went slipping,
    sliding, and stumbling along, sometimes running against a rock,
    and sometimes nearly pitching forward on our faces. All this
    too beneath a blazing sun, with the thermometer at 78&deg;, and
    not a vestige of shade. At last Tom and I reached the bottom,
    where, after partaking of luncheon and draughts of quinine, we
    lay down under the shadow of a great rock to recruit our weary
    frames.</p>

    <p>Refreshed by our meal, we started at six o'clock on our
    return journey, and went down a good deal faster than we came
    up. Before the end of the pumice-stone or Retama plains had
    been reached, it was nearly dark. Sundry small accidents
    occurring to stirrup-leathers, bridles, and girths&mdash;for
    the saddlery was not of the best description&mdash;delayed us
    slightly, and as Tom, Dr. Potter, Allnutt, and the guide had
    got on ahead, we soon lost sight of them. After an interval of
    uncertainty, the other guides confessed that they did not know
    the way back in the dark. This was not pleasant, for the roads
    were terrible, and during the whole of our journey up, from the
    port to the Peak, we had met only four people in all&mdash;two
    goatherds with their flocks, and two 'neveros,' bringing down
    ice to the town. There was therefore not much chance of gaining
    information from any one on our way down. We wandered about
    among low bushes, down watercourses, and over rocks for a long
    time. Horns were blown, and other means of attracting attention
    <span class="pagenum">Page 27<a name="Page_27"
       id="Page_27"></a></span>were tried; first one and then
       another of the party meanwhile coming more or less to grief.
       My good little horse fell down three times, though we did
       not part company, and once he went up a steep bank by
       mistake, instead of going down a very nasty watercourse,
       which I do not wonder at his objecting to. I managed to jump
       off in time, and so no harm was done; but it was rather
       anxious work.</p>

    <p>About ten o'clock we saw a light in the distance, and with
    much shouting woke up the inhabitants of the cottage whence it
    proceeded, promising to reward them liberally if they would
    only show us our way back. Three of them consented to do this,
    and provided themselves accordingly with pine-torches, wrapped
    round with bracken and leaves. One, a very fine man, dressed in
    white, with his arm extended above his head, bearing the light,
    led the way; another walked in front of my horse, while the
    third brought up the rear. They conducted us down the most
    frightfully steep paths until we had descended beneath the
    clouds, when the light from our torches threw our shadows in
    gigantic form upon the mists above, reminding us of the legend
    of the 'Spectre of the Brocken.' At last the torches began to
    go out, one by one, and just as the last light was expiring we
    arrived at a small village, where we of course found that
    everybody was asleep. After some delay, during which Mabelle
    and I were so tired that we lay down in the street to rest,
    more torches were procured and a fresh guide, who led us into
    the comparatively good path towards Puerto Orotava. Finally,
    half an hour after midnight, we arrived at the house of the
    Vice-Consul, who had provided refreshments for us, and whose
    nephew was still very kindly sitting up awaiting our return.
    But we were too tired to do anything but go straight on board
    the yacht, where, after some supper and champagne, we were
    indeed glad to retire to our berths. This was at 3.30 a.m.,
    exactly twenty-nine hours since we had been called on Friday
    night.<span class="pagenum">Page 28<a name="Page_28"
       id="Page_28"></a></span></p>

    <p>It is certainly too long an expedition to be performed in
    one day. Tents should be taken, and arrangements made for
    camping out for one, if not two, nights; but, in the case of
    such a large party as ours, this would have been a great
    business, as everything must be carried to so great a height,
    up such steep places, and over such bad roads. Still, there are
    so many objects and places of interest, not only on, but
    around, the Peak, that it is a pity to see them only when
    hurried and fatigued.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, July 23rd</i>.&mdash;Orders had been given not to
    call us nor to wash decks, and it was consequently half-past
    ten before any one awoke, and midday before the first of our
    party put in an appearance on deck.</p>

    <p>Long before this, the 'Sunbeam' had been inundated with
    visitors from the shore. We had given a general invitation to
    the friends of the Vice-Consul to come and see the yacht; and
    they accordingly arrived in due course, accompanied in many
    cases by a large circle of acquaintances. Those who came first
    were conducted below and all over the vessel, but the number
    ultimately became so great that, in self-defence, we were
    obliged to limit their wanderings to the deck, opening the
    skylights wide, however, to enable them to see as much as
    possible of the saloon and cabins.</p>

    <p>From breakfast-time until prayers, at three o'clock, when
    the yacht was closed for an hour, there was a constant stream
    of visitors from the shore. It was a great nuisance; but still
    it seemed unkind to refuse to allow them to see what they had
    never seen before, and might possibly never have an opportunity
    of seeing again. All steamers and sailing-ships, as a rule, go
    to Santa Cruz; and the fame of our vessel having been spread
    abroad by our visitors of Friday, many of the poor people had
    come from villages far away over the mountains. We could not
    help feeling a certain respect for the determined way in which
    physical infirmity was mastered by curiosity
    <span class="pagenum">Page 29<a name="Page_29"
       id="Page_29"></a></span>for, though many experienced very
       serious inconvenience from the motion of the vessel, they
       still persevered in their examination.</p>

    <p>About five o'clock we went ashore ourselves, and drove up to
    Villa Orotava. The wide road is macadamised and marked with
    kilometre stones, and is planted on either side with
    pepper-trees, plane-trees, and the <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>,
    which has grown 35 metres, or 115 feet, in seven years. The
    hedges are formed of blue plumbago, scarlet geranium, yellow
    acacia, lavender-coloured heliotrope, white jasmine, and pink
    and white roses.</p>

    <p>After driving a few miles, we turned down an old paved road
    towards the sea, and, by dint of a considerable amount of
    shaking, arrived at the celebrated Botanical Gardens, mentioned
    by Humboldt and others. We passed through a small house, with a
    fine dragon-tree on either side, and entered the gardens, where
    we found a valuable collection of trees and shrubs of almost
    every known species. The kind and courteous Curator, Don
    Hermann Wildgaret, accompanied us, and explained the
    peculiarities of the many interesting plants, from Europe,
    Asia, Africa, America, Australia, New Zealand, and the various
    islands of the North and South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The
    climate of Teneriffe is so equable, that the island forms a
    true garden of acclimatisation for the vegetable productions of
    the various countries of the world; by the judicious
    expenditure of a little more money, this establishment might be
    made an important means of introducing to Europe many new and
    valuable plants. At present the annual income is 5,000 francs,
    the salary of the Curator being 1,000 francs.</p>

    <p>A rough drive over paved roads, commanding extensive views
    of sea and rocks, and of some palm-trees on a promontory in the
    distance, brought us, at about seven o'clock, to the boat,
    which was waiting our return. We arrived in due course on board
    the 'Sunbeam,' laden with bouquets of

       dinner we all retired to bed, not having yet recovered from
       the fatigues of yesterday.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, July 24th</i>.&mdash;What one gains in the beauty
    and abundance of vegetable life here, one loses in its rapid
    and premature decay. Fruit gathered in the morning is scarcely
    fit to eat at night, and the flowers brought on board yesterday
    evening were dead to-day at 4.30 a.m.; whilst some of the roses
    we brought from Cowes lasted until we reached Madeira, though
    it must be owned so many fell to pieces that my cabin used to
    be daily swept with rose-leaves instead of tea-leaves.</p>

    <p>We went ashore soon after six, and drove straight to the
    garden of the Marquis de Sonzal, where there is a beautiful
    palm-tree, 101 feet high, the remains of an enormous
    dragon-tree, old even in the fifteenth century, besides hedges
    of myrtle, jasmine, and clematis, and flowers of every
    description in full bloom. The dragon-tree is a species of
    drac&aelig;na, and looks rather like a gigantic candelabra,
    composed of a number of yuccas, perched on the top of a gnarled
    and somewhat deformed stem, half palm half cactus. Another
    beautiful garden was next visited, belonging to the Marquis de
    la Candia, who received us and showed us his coffee and
    plantains in full growth, as well as a magnificent Spanish
    chestnut-tree, co&euml;val with the dragon-tree. Out of one of
    its almost decayed branches a so-called young tree was growing,
    but it would have been thought very respectable and middle-aged
    in any other locality.</p>

    <p>Every one here, as in Madeira, has been more or less ruined
    by the failure of the vines. Most of the large landed
    proprietors have left their estates to take care of themselves;
    and the peasants, for the last few years, have been emigrating
    by hundreds to Caraccas, in Venezuela. Things are, however,
    beginning to look up a little now. The cultivation of cochineal
    appears to succeed, though the price is low; coffee answers
    well; and permission has been obtained from the Spanish
    Government to grow tobacco, <span class="pagenum">Page
    31<a name="Page_31"
       id="Page_31"></a></span>accompanied by a promise to
       purchase, at a certain fixed rate, all that can be produced.
       Still, people talk of the Island of Teneriffe as something
       very different now from what it was twenty-five or thirty
       years ago, both as regards the number of its inhabitants and
       the activity of its commerce, and mourn over 'the good old
       times;'&mdash;a custom I have remarked in many other
       places!</p>

    <p>The Marquis de la Candia and Don Hermann Wildgaret returned
    on board with us to breakfast. The anchor had been weighed, and
    the 'Sunbeam' was slowly steaming up and down, waiting for us.
    The stream of visitors had been as great and as constant as
    ever during our absence, in spite of the heavy roll of the sea,
    and the deck seemed <span class="pagenum">Page
    32<a name="Page_32"
       id="Page_32"></a></span>quite covered with baskets of
       flowers and fruit, kindly sent on board by the people who
       had been over the yacht the day before. Amongst the latest
       arrivals were some very handsome Spanish ladies, beautifully
       dressed in black, with mantillas, each of whom was
       accompanied by a young man carrying a basin. It must, I
       fear, be confessed that this was rather a trial to the
       gravity of all on board. It certainly was an instance of the
       pursuit of knowledge, or the gratification of curiosity,
       under considerable difficulties.</p>

    <p>Immediately after breakfast, our friends bade us adieu, and
    went ashore in the shore-boat, while we steamed along the north
    side of the island, past the splendid cliffs of Buenavista,
    rising 2,000 feet sheer from the sea, to Cape Teno, the extreme
    western point of Teneriffe. In the distance we could see the
    Great Canary, Palma, and Hierro, and soon passed close to the
    rocky island of Gomera. Here, too, the dark cliffs, of volcanic
    form and origin, are magnificent, and as we were almost
    becalmed by the high land whilst we sailed along the north
    shore of the island, we had ample opportunities of admiring its
    rugged beauty. During the night we approached Palma, another
    large island of the Canary group, containing one of the most
    remarkable <i>calderas</i>, or large basins, formed by volcanic
    action in the world.</p>

            <span><i>A wet sheet and a flowing
            sea</i>,<br /></span> <span><i>A wind that follows
            fast</i><br /></span> <span><i>And fills the white and

        </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday, July 25th</i>.&mdash;There was not much wind
    during the night, and Palma was consequently still visible when
    I came on deck at daybreak. We had a light fair wind in the
    morning, accompanied by a heavy swell, which caused us to roll
    so much that I found it very difficult to do anything. Several
    shoals of flying fish skimmed past us along the surface of the
    water, occasionally rising to a considerable height above it.
    Their beautiful wings, glittering in the bright sunlight,
    looked like delicate silver filigree-work. In the night one
    flew on board, only to be preserved in spirits by Dr.
    Potter.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, July 29th</i>.&mdash;For the last three days we
    have been going on quietly with fair, warm weather, but a nice
    fresh breeze sprang up to-day. At midday the sun was so exactly
    vertical over our heads, that it was literally possible to
    stand under the shadow of one's own hatbrim, and be sheltered
    all round. Our navigators experienced considerable difficulty
    in taking their noon-tide observations, as the sun appeared to
    dodge about in every direction.</p>

    <p>About two o'clock we made the high land of St. Antonio, one
    of the Cape de Verde Islands, and, soon afterwards, the lower
    land of St Vincent. Some doubt existing as to the prevalence of
    fever at the latter place, Tom <span class="pagenum">Page
    34<a name="Page_34"
       id="Page_34"></a></span>decided not to stop there, for fear
       of having to undergo quarantine at Rio de Janeiro. We
       therefore shortened sail, and passed slowly between the
       islands to the anchorage beyond the Bird Rock. This is a
       very small island, of perfectly conical form, covered with
       thousands of sea-fowl, who live here undisturbed by any
       other inhabitants. The town of Porto Grande, with its rows
       of white houses on the sea-shore, at the base of the rocky
       crags, looked clean and comfortable in the evening light.
       During the day, however, it must be a hot and glaring place,
       for there are no trees to afford shade, nor, indeed, any
       kind of vegetation. The water, too, is bad, and all supplies
       for passing steamers are brought from the other islands, at
       very uncertain intervals. It is still a great
       coaling-station, though not so much used as it was formerly,
       before the opening of the Suez Canal. The ships come out
       with coal, and go away in ballast (there is nothing else to
       be had here), procured from a point near the town, to Rio or
       elsewhere, where they pick up their homeward cargo of fruit,
       &amp;c.</p>

    <p>The absence of twilight in these latitudes, both at dawn and
    sunset, is certainly very remarkable. This morning, at four
    o'clock, the stars were shining brightly; ten minutes later the
    day had commenced to break; and at half-past four the sun had
    risen above the horizon, and was gilding the surrounding
    mountain tops.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, July 30th</i>.&mdash;About 10 a.m. we were off
    Tarafal Bay&mdash;a most hopeless-looking place for supplies.
    High rocky mountains, sandy slopes, and black volcanic beach,
    composed a scene of arid desolation, in the midst of which was
    situated one small white house, with four windows and a
    thatched roof, surrounded by a little green patch of
    sugar-canes and cocoa-nut palms.</p>

    <p>But the result proved the sageness of the advice contained
    in the old proverb, not to trust to appearances only; for,
    whilst we were at breakfast, Mr. Martinez, the son of the owner
    of the one whitewashed cottage to be seen, came on
    <span class="pagenum">Page 35<a name="Page_35"
       id="Page_35"></a></span>board. To our surprise, he spoke
       English extremely well, and promised us all sorts of
       supplies, if we could wait until three o'clock in the
       afternoon. Having agreed to do this, we shortly afterwards
       went ashore in his boat, with a crew of more than half-naked
       negroes, and a hot row of about three miles brought us to
       the shore, where, after some little difficulty, we succeeded
       in effecting a landing. Our feet immediately sank into the
       hot black sand, composed entirely of volcanic deposits and
       small pieces, or rather grains, of amber, through which we
       had a fatiguing walk until we reached some palm-trees,
       shading a little pool of water. Here we left some of the
       men, with instructions to fill the breakers they had brought
       with them, while we walked on along the beach, past the
       remains of an English schooner that caught fire not far from
       this island, and was run ashore by her captain, thirty years
       ago. Her iron anchor, chain, and wheel still remained,
       together with two queer little iron cannon, which I should
       have much liked to carry off as a memorial of our visit. We
       then turned up a narrow shadeless path, bordered by stone
       walls, leading away from the sea, past a sugar-mill and a
       ruin. A few almond, castor-oil, and fig trees were growing
       amongst the sugar-canes, and as we mounted the hill we could
       see some thirty round straw huts, like beehives, on the
       sandy slopes beside the little stream. An abrupt turn in the
       mountains, amid which, at a distance of three leagues, this
       tiny river takes its rise, hides it from the sea, so that
       the narrow valley which it fertilises looks like a small
       oasis in the desert of rocks and sand.</p>

    <p>Mr. Martinez's house, where we sat for some time, and
    beneath the windows of which the one stream of the island runs,
    was comparatively cool. Outside, the negro washerwomen were
    busy washing clothes in large turtle-shell tubs, assisted, or
    hindered, by the 'washerwoman-bird,' a kind of white crane, who
    appeared quite tame, playing about just like a kitten, pecking
    at the clothes or the women's feet, <span class="pagenum">Page
    36<a name="Page_36"
       id="Page_36"></a></span>and then running away and hiding
       behind a tree. The stream was full of water-cresses, while
       the burnt-up little garden contained an abundance of
       beautiful flowers. There were scarlet and yellow mimosas, of
       many kinds, combining every shade of exquisite green velvety
       foliage, alpinias, with pink, waxy flowers and crimson and
       gold centres, oleanders, begonias, hibiscus, allamandas, and
       arum and other lilies.</p>

    <p>Mr. Bingham sketched, I took some photographs, Dr. Potter
    and the children caught butterflies, and the rest of our party
    wandered about. Every five minutes a negro arrived with a
    portion of our supplies. One brought a sheep, another a
    milch-goat for baby, while the rest contributed, severally, a
    couple of cocoa-nuts, a papaya, three mangoes, a few
    water-cresses, a sack of sweet potatoes, a bottle of milk,
    three or four quinces, a bunch of bananas, a little honey,
    half-a-dozen cabbages, some veal and pork, and so on; until it
    appeared as if every little garden on either side of the three
    leagues of stream must have yielded up its entire produce, and
    we had accumulated sacks full of cocoa-nuts and potatoes,
    hundreds of eggs, and dozens of chickens and ducks. It was very
    amusing to see the things arrive. They were brought in by
    people varying in colour from dark yellow to the blackest
    ebony, and ranging in size from fine stalwart men, over six
    feet in height, to tiny little blackies of about three feet
    six, with curly hair, snowy teeth, and mischievous, beady eyes.
    The arrival of the provision boat and the transfer of its
    miscellaneous cargo to the 'Sunbeam' was quite an amusing
    sight. The pretty black goat and the sheep bleated, the fowls
    cackled, and the ducks quacked, while the negroes chatted and
    laughed as they handed and hauled on board fish of all shapes
    and sizes, bunches of bananas, piles of cocoa-nuts, sacks of
    potatoes, and many other things, finishing up with a tiny black
    boy, about three years old, whom I think they would rather have
    liked to leave behind with us, if we would only have taken him.
    The <span class="pagenum">Page 37<a name="Page_37"
       id="Page_37"></a></span>fish proved excellent, though some
       of them really seemed almost too pretty to eat. A brilliant
       gold fish, weighing about three pounds, and something like a
       grey mullet in flavour, was perhaps the best. The prices
       were very curious. Chickens a shilling each, ducks five
       shillings, goats thirty shillings, and sheep ten shillings.
       Vegetables, fruit, and flowers were extremely cheap; but the
       charge for water, fetched from the spring in our own
       breakers by our own crew, with but little assistance from
       four or five negroes, was 3<i>l</i>. 18<i>s</i>. However, as
       ours is the only yacht, with one exception, that has ever
       visited this island, there was nothing for it except to pay
       the bill without demur. <span class="pagenum">Page
       38<a name="Page_38"
       id="Page_38"></a></span></p>

    <p>I never in my life felt so warm as I did to-day on shore,
    though the inhabitants say it will not be <i>really</i> hot for
    two months yet; I never before saw cocoa-nut palms growing; and
    I never tasted a mango until this morning; so I have
    experienced three new sensations in one day.</p>

    <p>The night was fearfully close, muggy, and thundery, the
    temperature in the cabins being 89&deg;, in spite of open
    sky-lights and port-holes. Generally speaking, it has not
    hitherto been as hot as we expected, especially on board the
    yacht itself. On deck there is almost always a nice breeze, but
    below it is certainly warm.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, August 1st</i>.&mdash;Yesterday we were still
    under sail, but to-day it has been necessary to steam, for the
    wind has fallen too light. There was a heavy roll from the
    south, and the weather continued hot and oppressive. In the
    cabins the thermometer stood at 89&deg; during the whole of the
    night, in spite of all our efforts to improve the temperature.
    We therefore put three of the children in the deck-house to
    sleep, opening the doors and windows; and some of the rest of
    our party slept on deck in hammocks. In anticipation of the
    heavy equatorial rains, which Captain Lecky had predicted might
    commence to-day, we had had the awnings put up; a fortunate
    piece of foresight, for, before midnight, the rain came down in
    torrents.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, August 2nd</i>.&mdash;At daybreak the sky was
    covered with heavy black clouds, and the atmosphere was as hot
    and muggy as ever. We had a great deal of rain during the day,
    and took advantage of the opportunity to fill every available
    tub, bucket, and basin, to say nothing of the awnings. It came
    down in such sheets that mackintoshes were comparatively
    useless, and we had soon filled our seventeen breakers, the
    cistern, and the boats, from which we had removed the covers,
    with very good, though somewhat dirty, washing water.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, August 4th</i>.&mdash;We were only 289 miles off
    Sierra Leone in the morning, and at noon therefore Tom
    <span class="pagenum">Page 39<a name="Page_39"
       id="Page_39"></a></span>decided to put about. Having done
       so, we found that we went along much more easily and quite
       as fast on the other tack. We maintained a good rate of
       speed on our new course, which was now nearly due west,
       passing a large barque with every stitch of canvas set, hand
       over hand.</p>

    <p>We are still in the Guinea current, and the temperature of
    the water is 82&deg;, even in the early morning; but the heat
    of the sun does not seem to have much effect upon it, as it
    does not vary to any great extent during the day.</p>

    <p>In the evening we saw the Southern Cross for the first time,
    and were much disappointed in its appearance. The fourth star
    is of smaller magnitude than the others, and the whole group is
    only for a very short time in a really upright position,
    inclining almost always either to one side or the other, as it
    rises and sets.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, August 8th</i>.&mdash;We crossed the line at
    daylight.</p>

    <p>This event caused much fun and excitement, both in cabin and
    forecastle. The conventional hair was put across the field of
    the telescope for the unsophisticated 'really to see the line,'
    and many firmly believed they did see it, and discussed its
    appearance at some length. Jim Allen, one of our tallest
    sailors, and coxswain of the gig, dressed in blue, with long
    oakum wig and beard, gilt paper crown, and trident and fish
    impaled in one hand, was seated on a gun-carriage, and made a
    capital Father Neptune. <span class="pagenum">Page
    40<a name="Page_40"
       id="Page_40"></a></span>Our somewhat portly engineer, Mr.
       Rowbotham, with fur-trimmed dressing gown and cap, and bent
       form, leaning on a stick, his face partially concealed by a
       long grey beard, and a large band-box of pills on one arm,
       made an equally good doctor to his Marine Majesty, while the
       part of Mrs. Trident was ably filled by one of the youngest
       sailors, dressed in some of the maids' clothes; but the
       accompanying pictures will give a better idea than any
       description of mine.</p>

    <p>Soon afterwards we saw an enormous shoal of grampuses, large
    black fish, about 25 feet in length, something between a
    dolphin and a whale, with the very ugliest jaws, or rather
    snouts, imaginable. They are of a predatory and ferocious
    disposition, attacking not only sharks, dolphins, and
    porpoises, but even whales, more than twice their own size. We
    also passed through enormous quantities of flying-fish, no
    doubt driven to the surface by dolphins and bonitos. They were
    much larger and stronger in the wing than any we have hitherto
    seen.</p>

    <p>Lulu's puppies, born yesterday, have been respectively named
    Butterfly (who survived her birth only an hour), Poseidon,
    Aphrodite, Amphitrite, and Thetis&mdash;names suggested by

    supposed equatorial palace.</p>

    <p>At noon we were 250 miles off St. Paul's Rocks.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, August 10th</i>.&mdash;A very hot, showery day.
    Saw two large ships in the distance. In the morning we were
    almost becalmed for a time, but the breeze returned
    <span class="pagenum">Page 41<a name="Page_41"
       id="Page_41"></a></span>during the afternoon, and we were
       able to proceed on our course. I think this has been the
       most lovely of the many exquisite days we have enjoyed since
       we left England. It commenced with a magnificent sunrise,
       and ended with an equally gorgeous sunset, only to be
       succeeded by a beautiful moonlight night, so clear and
       bright that we could see to read ordinary print on deck.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, August 12th</i>.&mdash;At noon we were 300
    miles off Bahia, a place we have made up our minds not to
    visit, as it would lengthen our voyage considerably, and there
    is not much to see there. We have therefore decided to proceed
    direct to Rio, where we are looking forward to arrive on
    Wednesday or Thursday next.</p>

    <p>The night was showery, with a good deal of wind and sea.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, August 13th</i>.&mdash;Sailing in the tropics is
    really very delightful! When going to the westward, there is
    almost always, at this season of the year, a favourable breeze,
    and the weather is generally either quite fair or moderately
    so.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>Whispered to it, westward, westward,<br /></span>
            <span>And with speed it darted forward.<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We had service at 11.15 a.m., and again at 5.30 p.m. The
    choir has considerably improved; one of our new men plays the
    violin very well, and frequently
    accompanies<span class="pagenum">Page 42<a name="Page_42"
       id="Page_42"></a></span> the children and the nurse in their
       songs. On a clear calm night, beneath a tropical sky, when
       the members of this little group assemble on deck, and, by
       the light of a lantern, sing some of their simple songs, the
       effect produced is both melodious and picturesque.</p>

    <p>The wind dropped at about 10 p.m., and we had an unpleasant
    amount of roll during the night, sails flapping, spars
    creaking, and booms swinging as if they would pull the masts
    out of the vessel.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, August 14th</i>.&mdash;This morning we saw a
    small schooner ahead, and thinking from her manoeuvres that she
    wished to speak us, we made our number and ran towards her. We
    soon found out, however, that she was a whaler, in chase of two
    large grampuses. She had two men on the look-out in the
    cross-trees, in a sort of iron cage; and though she was of much
    smaller tonnage than the 'Sunbeam,' she carried five big boats,
    one of which, full of men, was ready to be lowered into the
    water, the <span class="pagenum">Page 43<a name="Page_43"
       id="Page_43"></a></span>instant they had approached
       sufficiently near to the whale or grampus. These seas used
       formerly to abound with whalers, but they are now much less
       numerous, the seasons having been bad of late.</p>

    <p>To-night the stars were especially brilliant, and we spent
    some hours in trying to make out their names. Vega, our polar
    star for some time to come, shone conspicuously bright, and the
    Southern Cross could be seen to great advantage.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, August 16th</i>.&mdash;We had a fine fair
    breeze all day, and at 5 p.m. there was a cry from the
    mast-head of 'Land ahead!' Great excitement immediately
    prevailed on board, and Tom and Captain Brown rushed, for about
    the twelfth time, to the foretop to see if the report was true.
    They were soon able to announce that Cape Frio was visible on
    the port bow, about thirty-five miles distant. After even a
    fortnight at sea, an indescribable sensation is produced by
    this cry, and by the subsequent sight of the land itself. When
    we came up on deck this evening, after dinner, we all gazed on
    the lighthouse on the still distant shore as if we had never
    beheld such a thing in our lives before. The colour and
    temperature of the water had perceptibly changed, the former
    from a beautiful, clear, dark ultramarine to a muddy green;
    innumerable small birds, moths, locusts, and grasshoppers came
    on board; and, having given special orders that we were to be
    called early the next morning, we went to bed in the fond hope
    that we should be able to enter Rio harbour at daybreak.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, August 17th</i>.&mdash;'L'homme propose; Dieu
    dispose.' Steam was up at midnight, but by that time it was
    blowing half a gale of wind from the south-west, with such a
    steep short sea that the screw was scarcely ever properly
    immersed, but went racing round and round in the air with
    tremendous velocity, as we pitched and rolled about. Our
    progress was therefore at the rate of
    <span class="pagenum">Page 44<a name="Page_44"
       id="Page_44"></a></span>something rather under a mile an
       hour, and at daybreak, instead of entering the harbour of
       Rio, as we had hoped to do, we found ourselves close to Cape
       Frio.</p>

    <p>About 8 a.m. matters mended, the wind moderating and
    changing its direction slightly; so that, under steam and sail,
    we were soon going along the coast at the rate of four or five
    miles an hour. The surf was breaking with a loud roar upon the
    white sandy beach, while the spray was carried by the force of
    the wind far inland, over the strip of flat fertile-looking
    country, lying between the sea and a chain of low
    sugarloaf-shaped mountains, parallel with the shore, and only a
    short distance off.</p>

    <p>Our course lay between the mainland and the islands of Maya
    and Payo, where the groves of bananas and other trees looked
    very miserable in the wind. The tall isolated palm-trees, whose
    elastic stems bowed readily before the fury of the blast,
    looked, as they were twisted and whirled hither and thither,
    like umbrellas turned inside out. Passing the false Sugarloaf
    mountain, as it is called, we next opened out the true one, the
    Gavia, and the chain of mountains beyond, the outlines of which
    bear an extraordinary resemblance to the figure of a man lying
    on his back, the profile of the face being very like that of
    the late Duke of Wellington. As the sun sank in gorgeous
    splendour behind these hills, I think I never saw a grander or
    more beautiful sight; though the sky was so red and
    stormy-looking that our hopes of a fine day to-morrow were but
    faint.</p>

    <p>Before entering the harbour, a bar had to be crossed, which
    is a dangerous operation all the world over. The skylights and
    hatches were fastened down, and those of our party who did not
    like being shut up below took their places on the bridge,
    where, for the first time since we left England, it felt really
    quite cold. As we advanced, the beautiful harbour, with its
    long rows of glittering gas-lights, extending for miles on
    either side of the bay, and <span class="pagenum">Page
    45<a name="Page_45"
       id="Page_45"></a></span>illuminating the city and suburbs,
       gradually became visible. On our left lay the two islands,
       Rodonda and Raza, on the latter of which is situated a
       lighthouse. The wind was blowing off the land when we
       reached the bar, so that, after all our preparations, there
       was hardly any sea to encounter, and the moment we were
       over, the water on the other side was perfectly smooth. A
       gun and a blue light from Fort Santa Cruz, answered
       immediately by a similar signal from Fort Santa Lucia,
       announced our arrival, and we shortly afterwards dropped our
       anchor in the quarantine ground of Rio close to Botafogo
       Bay, in the noble harbour of Nictheroy.</p>

    <p>After dinner it rained heavily, and continued to do so
    during the whole night.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, August 18th</i>.&mdash;The clouds still hung
    heavy on the hills, or rather mountains, which surround the
    bay, occasionally descending in the form of torrents of rain,
    and hiding everything from our view.</p>

    <p>Early in the morning we weighed anchor and steamed up the
    bay to the man-of-war anchorage, a much pleasanter situation
    than the quarantine harbour, where we had brought up last
    night. About 9.30 a.m. the health officers came on board, and
    half an hour later we had a visit from the custom-house
    official, who required Tom to sign and seal a declaration upon
    oath that he had no cargo on board, and not more coal than we
    absolutely required for our own consumption.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 47<a name="Page_47"
       id="Page_47"></a></span></p>

    <p>About eleven o'clock we put on our mackintoshes and thick
    boots, and, accompanied by an interpreter, who (together with
    several washerwomen) had suddenly made his appearance on board,
    rowed ashore, pushing our way through crowds of boats laden
    with fruit and vegetables. The landing-place was close to the
    market, at some broken-down steps, and was crowded with
    chattering negroes, of every shade of colour. The quays seemed
    covered with piles of fruit and vegetables, discharged from the
    boats, the principal produce being sugar-cane, bananas, and
    oranges. Each side street that we came to was a little river,
    which had to be crossed, or rather forded, after paddling
    through the mud in the main thoroughfare.</p>

    <p>Our first visit was to the post-office&mdash;'no
    letters'&mdash;then to the British Consulate&mdash;'no
    letters'&mdash;and finally to the Legation, but there was
    nobody at home there; so we set off for the H&ocirc;tel des
    Etrangers, to breakfast. Our way lay through the straggling
    suburbs of the city for about two miles, and as we drove along
    we could see and admire, despite the heavy rain, the
    magnificent groves of palm-trees, and the brilliancy and beauty
    of the tropical vegetation in the various private and public
    gardens that we passed.</p>

    <p>After breakfast we returned to the Legation, where we were
    most kindly received, but, much to our regret, no letters were
    forthcoming. We next paid a visit to some of the shops in the
    Rua do Ouvidor, for the sale of imitations of flowers, made
    from the undyed feathers of birds, and a large number of the
    more expensive varieties of ordinary artificial flowers, each
    petal consisting of the entire throat or breast of a
    humming-bird, and the leaves are made from the wings of
    beetles. They are very rare and beautiful, their manufacture
    being quite a <i>sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;</i> of this city. The
    prices asked astonished us greatly; the cost of five sprays,
    which I had been commissioned to buy, was 29<i>l</i>., and the
    price of all the others <span class="pagenum">Page
    48<a name="Page_48"
       id="Page_48"></a></span> was proportionately high. But then
       they wear for ever. I have had some for nine years, and they
       are as good now as when they were bought.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, August 19th</i>.&mdash;Though far from
    brilliant, the weather improved, and we were able to enjoy
    occasional glimpses of the beautiful scenery around us.</p>

    <p>Mr. Gough and Mr. O'Conor breakfasted with us on board, and
    we afterwards proceeded in a 'bond' to the Botanical Gardens,
    about seven miles out of the city. These 'bonds,' which are a
    great institution here, are large carriages, either open or
    closed, drawn sometimes by one, sometimes by two, sometimes by
    three mules. They go at a great pace, and run very smoothly.
    Ordinary carriages are dear; and as tramways have been laid
    down in almost every street and road, driving is a rather
    difficult affair. On our road we passed several
    delightful-looking private gardens. The railings were
    completely covered, some with white stephanotis and scarlet
    lapageria, others with a beautiful orange-coloured creeper and
    lilac bougainvill&aelig;a, or passion-flowers of many colours
    and variety. Inside we could see large trees with green and
    yellow stripes, croton-oil plants, spotted and veined
    caladiums, and drac&aelig;nas, the whole being shaded by
    orange-trees.</p>

    <p>Along the edge of Botafogo Bay there is a delightful drive,
    beneath a splendid avenue of imperial palms, extending to the
    gates of the Botanical Gardens. Each specimen rises straight up
    like the column of an Egyptian temple, and is crowned with a
    feathery tuft of large shiny dark green leaves, some thirty
    feet in length. The clumps of bamboos, too, were very fine, and
    nearly all the trees seemed to be full of curious orchids and
    parasites of every sort and kind.</p>

    <p>We had an agreeable drive back in the cool evening to dinner
    at the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe. The food was excellent, and
    included some delicious tiny queer-shaped oysters, which are
    found on the mangrove-trees, overhanging the water higher up
    the bay. We afterwards went to a <span class="pagenum">Page
    49<a name="Page_49"
       id="Page_49"></a></span>pleasant little reception, where we
       enjoyed the splendid singing of some young Brazilian ladies,
       and the subsequent row off to the yacht, in the moonlight,
       was not the least delightful part of the programme.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, August 20th</i>.&mdash;At last a really fine day.
    We could now, for the first time, thoroughly appreciate the
    beauties of the noble bay of Nictheroy, though the distant
    Organ mountains were still hidden from our view. In the
    morning, we went to church on board H.M.S. 'Volage,' afterwards
    rowing across the bay to Icaraky, where we took the tramway to
    Santa Rosa. On our way we again passed many charming villas and
    gardens, similar to those we had admired yesterday, while the
    glorious and ever-attractive tropical vegetation abounded
    everywhere. In spite of the great heat, the children seemed
    untiring in the pursuit of butterflies, of which they succeeded
    in catching many beautiful specimens.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, August 21st</i>.&mdash;After an early breakfast,
    we started off to have a look at the market. The greatest
    bustle and animation prevailed, and there were people and
    things to see and observe in endless variety. The fish-market
    was full of finny monsters of the deep, all new and strange to
    us, whose odd Brazilian names would convey to a stranger but
    little idea of the fish themselves. There was an enormous
    rockfish, weighing about 300 pounds, with hideous face and
    shiny back and fins; there were large ray, and skate, and
    cuttle-fish&mdash;the <i>pieuvre</i> of Victor Hugo's
    'Travailleurs de la Mer'&mdash;besides baskets full of the
    large prawns for which the coast is famous, eight or ten inches
    long, and with antenn&aelig; of twelve or fourteen inches in
    length. They make up in size for want of quality, for they are
    insipid and tasteless, though, being tender, they make
    excellent curry. The oysters, on the other hand, are
    particularly small, but of the most delicious flavour. They are
    brought from a park, higher up the bay, where, as I have said,
    they grow on posts and the branches of the mangrove-tree,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 50<a name="Page_50"
       id="Page_50"></a></span> which hang down into the water. We
       also saw a large quantity of fine mackerel, a good many
       turtle and porpoises, and a few hammer-headed sharks. The
       latter are very curious creatures, not unlike an ordinary
       shark, but with a remarkable hammer-shaped projection on
       either side of their noses for which it is difficult to
       imagine a use.</p>

    <p>In the fruit-market were many familiar bright-coloured
    fruits; for it is now the depth of winter at Rio, and the
    various kinds that we saw were all such as would bear transport
    to England. Fat, jet-black negresses, wearing turbans on their
    heads, strings of coloured beads on their necks and arms, and
    single long white garments, which appeared to be continually
    slipping off their shoulders, here presided over
    brilliant-looking heaps of oranges, bananas, pineapples,
    passion-fruit, tomatoes, apples, pears, capsicums and peppers,
    sugar-cane, cabbage-palms, cherimoyas, and bread-fruit.</p>

    <p>In another part of the market all sorts of live birds were
    for sale, with a few live beasts, such as deer, monkeys, pigs,
    guinea-pigs in profusion, rats, cats, dogs, marmosets, and a
    dear little lion-monkey, very small and rather red, with a
    beautiful head and mane, who roared exactly like a real lion in
    miniature. We saw also cages full of small flamingoes, snipe of
    various kinds, and a great many birds of smaller size, with
    feathers of all shades of blue, red, and green, and metallic
    hues of brilliant lustre, besides parrots, macaws, cockatoos
    innumerable, and torchas, on stands. The torcha is a
    bright-coloured black and yellow bird, about as big as a
    starling, which puts its little head on one side and takes
    flies from one's fingers in the prettiest and most enticing
    manner. Unfortunately, it is impossible to introduce it into
    England, as it cannot stand the change of climate. The other
    birds included guinea-fowls, ducks, cocks and hens, pigeons,
    doves, quails, &amp;c., and many other varieties less familiar
    or quite unknown to us. Altogether <span class="pagenum">Page
    51<a name="Page_51"
       id="Page_51"></a></span>the visit was an extremely
       interesting one, and well repaid us for our early
       rising.</p>

    <p>At eleven o'clock we started for the Petropolis steamer,
    which took us alongside a wooden pier, from the end of which
    the train started, and we were soon wending our way through
    sugar and coffee plantations, formed in the midst of the forest
    of palms and other tropical trees. An Englishman has made a
    large clearing here, and has established a fine farm, which he
    hopes to work successfully by means of immigrant labour.</p>

    <p>After a journey of twenty minutes in the train, we reached
    the station, at the foot of a hill, where we found several
    four-mule carriages awaiting our arrival. The drive up from the
    station to the town, over a pass in the Organ mountains, was
    superb. At each turn of the road we had an ever-varying view of
    the city of Rio and its magnificent bay. And then the banks of
    this tropical high-road! From out a mass of rich verdure grew
    lovely scarlet begonias, and spotted caladiums, shaded by
    graceful tree-ferns and overhung by trees full of exquisite
    parasites and orchids. Among these, the most conspicuous, after
    the palms, are the tall thin-stemmed sloth-trees, so called
    from their being a favourite resort of the sloth, who with
    great difficulty crawls up into one of them, remains there
    until he has demolished every leaf, and then passes on to the
    next tree.</p>

    <p>The pace of the mules, up the steep incline, under a
    broiling sun, was really wonderful. Half-way up we stopped to
    change, at a buvette, where we procured some excellent Brazilia
    coffee, of fine but exceedingly bitter flavour. Our next halt,
    midway between the buvette and the top of the hill, was at a
    spring of clear sparkling water, where we had an opportunity of
    collecting some ferns and flowers; and on reaching the summit
    we stopped once more, to enjoy the fine view over the Pass and
    the bay of Nictheroy. The descent towards Petropolis then
    <span class="pagenum">Page 52<a name="Page_52"
       id="Page_52"></a></span>commenced; it lies in the hollow of
       the hills, with a river flowing through the centre of its
       broad streets, on either side of which are villas and
       avenues of noble trees. Altogether it reminded me of
       Bagn&egrave;res-de-Luchon, in the Pyrenees, though the
       general effect is unfortunately marred by the gay and rather
       too fantastic painting of some of the houses.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, August 22nd</i>.&mdash;We were called at
    half-past five, and, after a hasty breakfast, started on
    horseback by seven o'clock for the Virgin Forest, about six
    miles from Petropolis. After leaving the town and its suburbs,
    we pursued our way by rough winding paths, across which huge
    moths and butterflies flitted, and humming-birds buzzed in the
    almond-trees. After a ride of an hour and a half, we entered
    the silence and gloom of a vast forest. On every side extended
    a tangled mass of wild, luxuriant vegetation: giant-palms, and
    tree-ferns, and parasites are to be seen in all directions,
    growing wherever they can find root-hold. Sometimes they kill
    the tree which they favour with their attentions&mdash;one
    creeper, in particular, being called 'Mata-pao' or 'Kill-tree;'
    but, as a rule, they seem to get on very well together, and to
    depend mutually upon one another for nourishment and support.
    The most striking of these creepers is, perhaps, the liane,
    whose tendrils grow straight downwards to the ground, twisting
    themselves together in knots and bundles. Occasionally one
    sees, suspended from a tree, at a height of some fifty feet, a
    large lump of moss, from which scarlet orchids are growing;
    looking like an enormous hanging flower-basket. All colours in
    Brazil, whether of birds, insects, or flowers, are brilliant in
    the extreme. Blue, violet, orange, scarlet, and yellow are
    found in the richest profusion, and no pale or faint tints are
    to be seen. Even white seems purer, clearer, and deeper than
    the white of other countries.</p>

    <p>We had a long wet walk in the forest; the mosses and ferns
    being kept moist and green by the innumerable little
    <span class="pagenum">Page 53<a name="Page_53"
       id="Page_53"></a></span>streams of water which abound
       everywhere. Owing to the thickness of the surrounding
       jungle, it was impossible to stray from our very narrow
       path, notwithstanding the attractions of humming-birds,
       butterflies, and flowers. At last we came to an opening in
       the wood, whence we had a splendid view seawards, and where
       it was decided to turn round and retrace our steps through
       the forest. After walking some distance we found our horses
       waiting, and after a hot but pleasant ride reached
       Petropolis by twelve o'clock, in time for breakfast.
       Letter-writing and butterfly-catching occupied the afternoon
       until four o'clock, when I was taken out for a drive in a
       comfortable little phaeton, with a pretty pair of horses,
       while the rest of the party walked out to see a little more
       of Petropolis and its environs. We drove past the Emperor's
       palace&mdash;an Italian villa, standing in the middle of a
       large garden&mdash;the new church, and the houses of the
       principal inhabitants, most of which are shut up just now,
       as everybody is out of town, but it all looked very green
       and pleasant. It was interesting to see a curious breed of
       dogs, descended from the bloodhounds formerly used in
       hunting the poor Indians.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, August 23rd</i>.&mdash;At six o'clock we
    assembled all on the balcony of the hotel to wait for the
    coach, which arrived shortly afterwards. There was some little
    delay and squabbling before we all found ourselves safely
    established on the coach, but starting was quite another
    matter, for the four white mules resolutely refused to move,
    without a vast amount of screaming and shouting and plunging.
    We had to pull up once or twice before we got clear of the
    town, to allow more passengers to be somehow or other squeezed
    in, and at each fresh start similar objections on the part of
    the mules had to be overcome.</p>

    <p>The air felt fresh when we started, but before we had
    proceeded far we came into a thick, cold, wet fog, which, after
    the heat of the last few weeks, seemed to pierce us to the very
    marrow. Eight miles farther on the four frisky
    <span class="pagenum">Page 54<a name="Page_54"
       id="Page_54"></a></span>white mules were exchanged for five
       steady dun-coloured ones, which were in their turn replaced
       after a seven-mile stage by four nice bays, who took us
       along at a tremendous pace. The sun began by this time to
       penetrate the mist, and the surrounding country became
       visible. We found that we were following the course of the
       river, passing through an avenue of coral-trees, loaded with
       the most brilliant flowers and fruit imaginable, and full of
       parroquets and fluttering birds of many hues.</p>

    <p>We stopped at several small villages, and at about 11 a.m.
    reached Entre Rios, having changed mules seven times, and done
    the 59-1/2 miles in four hours and fifty minutes, including
    stoppages&mdash;pretty good work, especially as the heat during
    the latter portion of the journey had been as great as the cold
    was at the commencement. The term 'cold' must here be taken
    only in a relative sense, for the thermometer was never lower
    than 48&deg;, though, having been accustomed for a long while
    to 85&deg;, we felt the change severely.</p>

    <p>After a capital breakfast at the inn near the station, we
    got into the train and began a very hot dusty journey over the
    Serra to Palmeiras, which place was reached at 4 p.m. We were
    met on our arrival by Dr. Gunning, who kindly made room for Tom
    and me at his house, the rest of our party proceeding to the
    hotel. The view from the windows of the house, which is
    situated on the very edge of a hill, over the mountains of the
    Serra, glowing with the light of the setting sun, was perfectly
    enchanting; and after a refreshing cold bath one was able to
    appreciate it as it deserved. A short stroll into the forest
    adjoining the house proved rich in treasures, for in a few
    minutes I had gathered twenty-six varieties of ferns, including
    gold and silver ferns, two creeping ferns, and many other
    kinds. The moon rose, and the fireflies flashed about among the
    palm-trees, as we sat in the verandah before dinner, while in
    several places on the distant hills we could see circles of
    bright <span class="pagenum">Page 55<a name="Page_55"
       id="Page_55"></a></span>flames, where the forest had been
       set on fire in order to make clearings.</p>

    <p>We were up next morning in time to see the sun rise from
    behind the mountains, and as it gradually became warmer the
    humming-birds and butterflies came out and buzzed and flitted
    among the flowers in front of our windows. We had planned to
    devote the day to a visit to Barra, and it was, therefore,
    necessary to hurry to the station by eight o'clock to meet the
    train, where we stopped twenty minutes to breakfast at what
    appeared to be a capital hotel, built above the station. The
    rooms were large and lofty, everything was scrupulously clean,
    and the dishes most appetising-looking. Our carriage was then
    shunted and hooked on to the other train, and we proceeded to
    the station of Santa Anna, where Mr. Faro met us with eight
    mules and horses, and a large old-fashioned carriage, which
    held some of us, the rest of the party galloping on in front.
    We galloped also, and upset one unfortunate horse, luckily
    without doing him any harm. After a couple of miles of a rough
    road we arrived at the gates of the Baron's grounds, where the
    old negro slave-coachman amused us very much by <i>ordering</i>
    his young master to conduct the equestrians round to the house
    by another way. Beneath the avenue of palm-trees, leading from
    the gates to the house, grew orange, lemon, and citron trees,
    trained as espaliers, while behind them again tall rose-bushes
    and pomegranates showed their bright faces. Driving through an
    archway we arrived at the house, and, with much politeness and
    many bows, were conducted indoors, in order that we might rest
    ourselves and get rid of some of the dust of our journey.</p>

    <p>Santa Anna is one of the largest coffee fazendas in this
    part of Brazil. The house occupies three sides of a square, in
    the middle of which heaps of coffee were spread out to dry in
    the sun. The centre building is the dwelling-house, with a
    narrow strip of garden, full of sweet-smelling flowers,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 56<a name="Page_56"
       id="Page_56"></a></span>in front of it; the right wing is
       occupied by the slaves' shops and warehouses, and by the
       chapel; while the left wing contains the stables, domestic
       offices, and other slave-rooms.</p>

    <p>By law, masters are bound to give their slaves one day's
    rest in every seven, and any work the slaves may choose to do
    on that day is paid for at the same rate as free labour. But
    the day selected for this purpose is not necessarily Sunday;
    and on adjoining fazendas different days are invariably chosen,
    in order to prevent the slaves from meeting and getting into
    mischief. Thursday (to-day) was Sunday on this estate, and we
    soon saw all the slaves mustering in <span class="pagenum">Page
    57<a name="Page_57"
       id="Page_57"></a></span> holiday attire in the shade of one
       of the verandahs. They were first inspected, and then ranged
       in order, the children being placed in front, the young
       women next, then the old women, the old men, and finally the
       young men. In this order they marched into the corridor
       facing the chapel, to hear mass. The priest and his acolyte,
       in gorgeous robes, performed the usual service, and the
       slaves chanted the responses in alternate companies, so that
       sopranos, contraltos, tenors, and basses, contrasted in a
       striking and effective manner. The singing, indeed, was
       excellent; far better than in many churches at home. After
       the conclusion of the mass the master shook hands with
       everybody, exchanged good wishes with his slaves, and
       dismissed them. While they were dawdling about, gossiping in
       the verandah, I had a closer look at the babies, which had
       all been brought to church. They seemed of every shade of
       colour, the complexions of some being quite fair, but the
       youngest, a dear little woolly-headed thing, was black as
       jet, and only three weeks old. The children all seemed to be
       on very good terms with their master and his overseers, and
       not a bit afraid of them. They are fed most liberally, and
       looked fat and healthy. For breakfast they have coffee and
       bread; for dinner, fresh pork alternately with dried beef,
       and black beans (the staple food of the poor of this
       country); and for supper they have coffee, bread, and
       mandioca, or tapioca.</p>

    <p>Returning to the house, we sat down, a party of thirty, to
    an elaborate breakfast, the table being covered with all sorts
    of Brazilian delicacies, after which several complimentary
    speeches were made, and we all started off to walk round the
    fazenda. Our first visit was to the little schoolchildren,
    thirty-four in number, who sang very nicely. Then to the
    hospital, a clean, airy building, in which there were happily
    but few patients, and next we inspected the new machinery,
    worked by water-power, for cleaning the coffee and preparing it
    for market. The harvest lasts from May to August. The best
    quality of coffee is picked before it is
    <span class="pagenum">Page 58<a name="Page_58"
       id="Page_58"></a></span>quite ripe, crushed to free it from
       the husk, and then dried in the sun, sometimes in heaps, and
       sometimes raked out flat, in order to gain the full benefit
       of the heat. It is afterwards gathered up into baskets and
       carefully picked over, and this, being very light work, is
       generally performed by young married women with babies.
       There were nineteen tiny piccaninnies, in baskets, beside
       their mothers, in one room we entered, and in another there
       were twenty just able to run about.</p>

    <p>Cassava is an important article of food here, and it was
    interesting to watch the various processes by which it is
    turned into flour, tapioca, or starch. As it is largely
    exported, there seems no reason why it should not be introduced
    into India, for the ease with which it is cultivated and
    propagated, the extremes of temperature it will bear, and the
    abundance of its crop, all tend to recommend it. We went on to
    look at the maize being shelled, crushed, and ground into
    coarse or fine flour, for cakes and bread, and the process of
    crushing the sugar-cane, turning its juice into sugar and rum,
    and its refuse into potash. All the food manufactured here is
    used on the estate; coffee alone is exported. I felt thoroughly
    exhausted by the time we returned to the house, only to
    exchange adieus and step into the carriage on our way to Barra
    by rail <i>en route</i> to Rio de Janeiro. After passing
    through several long tunnels at the top of the Serra, the line
    drops down to Palmeiras, after which the descent became very
    picturesque, as we passed, by steep inclines, through virgin
    forests full of creepers, ferns, flowers, and orchids. The
    sunset was magnificent, and the subsequent coolness of the
    atmosphere most grateful. Leaving the Emperor's palace of
    S&atilde;o Christov&atilde;o behind, Rio was entered from a
    fresh side. It seemed a long drive through the streets to the
    H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe, where, after an excellent though
    hurried dinner, we contrived to be in time for a private
    representation at the Alcazar. As a rule, ladies do not go to
    this theatre, but there were a good many there
    <span class="pagenum">Page 59<a name="Page_59"
       id="Page_59"></a></span>on the present occasion. Neither the
       play nor the actors, however, were very interesting, and all
       our party were excessively tired; so we left early, and had
       a delightful row off to the yacht, in the bright
       moonlight.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, August 28th</i>.&mdash;We have all been so much
    interested in the advertisements we read in the daily papers of
    slaves to be sold or hired, that arrangements were made with a
    Brazilian gentleman for some of our party to have an
    opportunity of seeing the way in which these transactions are
    carried on. No Englishman is allowed to hold slaves here, and
    it is part of the business of the Legation to see that this law
    is strictly enforced. The secrets of their trade are
    accordingly jealously guarded by the natives, especially from
    the English. The gentlemen had therefore to disguise themselves
    as much as possible, one pretending to be a rich Yankee, who
    had purchased large estates between Santos and San Paulo, which
    he had determined to work with slave instead of coolie labour.
    He was supposed to have come to Rio to select some slaves, but
    would be obliged to see and consult his partner before deciding
    on purchase. They were taken to a small shop in the city, and,
    after some delay, were conducted to a room upstairs, where they
    waited a quarter of an hour. Twenty-two men and eleven women
    and children were then brought in for inspection. They declared
    themselves suitable for a variety of occupations, in-door and
    out, and all appeared to look anxiously at their possible
    purchaser, with a view to ascertain what they had to hope for
    in the future. One couple in particular, a brother and sister,
    about fourteen and fifteen years old respectively, were most
    anxious not to be separated, but to be sold together; and the
    tiny children seemed quite frightened at being spoken to or
    touched by the white men. Eight men and five women having been
    specially selected as fit subjects for further consideration,
    the visit terminated.</p>

    <p>The daily Brazilian papers are full of advertisements of
    slaves for sale, and descriptions of men, pigs, children,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 60<a name="Page_60"
       id="Page_60"></a></span>cows, pianos, women, houses,
       &amp;c., to be disposed of, are inserted in the most
       indiscriminate manner. In one short half-column of the
       'Jornal do Commercio,' published within the last day or two,
       the following announcements, amongst many similar ones,
       appear side by side:&mdash;</p>

       id="Page_61"></a></span>Gardens, where it had been arranged
       that horses should meet us; but our party was such a large
       one, including children and servants, that some little
       difficulty occurred at this point in making a fair start. It
       was therefore late before we started, the clouds were
       beginning to creep down the sides of the hills, and it had
       grown very dusk by the time we reached the Chinisi river.
       Soon afterwards the rain began to come down in such tropical
       torrents, that our thin summer clothing was soaked through
       and through long before we reached the Tijuca. At last, to
       our great joy, we saw ahead of us large plantations of
       bananas, and then some gas-lights, which exist even in this
       remote locality. We followed them for some little distance,
       but my horse appeared to have such a very decided opinion as
       to the proper direction for us to take, that we finally
       decided to let him have his own way, for it was by this time
       pitch dark, and none of us had ever been this road before.
       As we hoped, the horse knew his own stables, and we soon
       arrived at the door of White's hotel, miserable, drenched
       objects, looking forward to a complete change of clothing.
       Unfortunately the cart with our luggage had not arrived, so
       it was in clothes borrowed from kind friends that we at last
       sat down, a party of about forty, to a sort of
       table-d'h&ocirc;te dinner, and it continued to pour with
       rain during the whole evening, only clearing up just at
       bed-time.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, August 29th</i>.&mdash;After all the fine
    weather we have had lately, it was provoking to find, on
    getting up this morning, that the rain still came steadily
    down. Daylight enabled us to see what a quaint-looking place
    this hotel is. It consists of a series of low wooden detached
    buildings, mostly one story high, with verandahs on both sides,
    built round a long courtyard, in the centre of which are a
    garden and some large trees. It is more like a boarding-house,
    however, than an hotel, as there is a fixed daily charge for
    visitors, who have to be provided with a letter of
    introduction! The situation and gardens are good; it contains
    <span class="pagenum">Page 62<a name="Page_62"
       id="Page_62"></a></span>among other luxuries a drawing-room,
       with a delightful swimming-bath for ladies, and another for
       gentlemen. A mountain stream is turned into two large square
       reservoirs, where you can disport yourself under the shade
       of bananas and palm trees, while orange trees, daturas,
       poinsettias, and other plants, in full bloom, drop their
       fragrant flowers into the crystal water. There is also a
       nice little bathing-house, with a douche outside; and the
       general arrangements seem really perfect. The views from the
       walks around the hotel and in the forest above are
       beautiful, as, indeed, they are from every eminence in the
       neighbourhood of Rio.</p>

    <p>During the morning, the weather cleared sufficiently for us
    to go down to 'The Boulders,' huge masses of rock, either of
    the glacial period, or else thrown out from some mighty volcano
    into the valley beneath. Here they form great caverns and
    caves, overhung with creepers, and so blocked up at the
    entrance, that it is difficult to find the way into them. The
    effect of the alternate darkness and light, amid twisted
    creepers, some like gigantic snakes, others neatly coiled in
    true man-of-war fashion, is very striking and fantastic. Every
    crevice is full of ferns and orchids and curious plants, while
    moths and butterflies flit about in every direction. Imagine,
    if you can, scarlet butterflies gaily spotted, yellow
    butterflies with orange edgings, butterflies with dark blue
    velvety-looking upper wings, the under surface studded with
    bright owl-like peacock eyes, grey Atlas moths, and, crowning
    beauty of all, metallic blue butterflies, which are positively
    dazzling, even when seen in a shop, dead. Imagine what they
    must be like, as they dart hither and thither, reflecting the
    bright sunshine from their wings, or enveloped in the sombre
    shade of a forest. Most of them measure from two to ten inches
    in length from wing to wing, and many others flit about,
    equally remarkable for their beauty, though not so large.
    Swallow-tails, of various colours, with tails almost as long,
    in proportion to their bodies, as those of their feathered
    <span class="pagenum">Page 63<a name="Page_63"
       id="Page_63"></a></span>namesakes; god-parents and
       'eighty-eights,' with the figures 88 plainly marked on the
       reverse side of their rich blue or crimson wings. In fact,
       if nature could by any possibility be gaudy, one might
       almost say that she is so in this part of the world.</p>

    <p>From 'The Boulders' we went down a kind of natural staircase
    in the rock to the small cascade, which, owing to the recent
    rains, appeared to the best advantage, the black rocks and
    thick vegetation forming a fine background to the sheet of
    flowing white water and foam. Our way lay first through some
    castor-oil plantations, and then along the side of a stream,
    fringed with rare ferns, scarlet begonias, and grey ageratum.
    We returned to the hotel, too late for the general luncheon,
    and, after a short rest, went out for a gallop in the direction
    of the peak of Tijuca, past the large waterfall, the 'Ladies'
    Mile,' and 'Grey's View.' The forest is Government property;
    the roads are therefore excellent, and are in many places
    planted with flowers and shrubs, rare even here. It seems a
    waste of money, however; for there is hardly any one to make
    use of the wide roads, and the forest would appear quite as
    beautiful in its pristine luxuriance. To our eyes the addition
    of flowers from other countries is no improvement, though the
    feeling is otherwise here. More than once I have had a bouquet
    of common stocks given to me as a grand present, while orchids,
    gardenias, stephanotis, large purple, pink, and white azaleas,
    orange-blossom, and roses, were growing around in unheeded
    profusion.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, August 30th</i>.&mdash;Once more a wet
    morning; but as it cleared towards noon, we ordered horses and
    some luncheon, and went up to Pedro Bonito. The ride was
    pleasant enough at first, but as we mounted higher and higher,
    we got into the clouds and lost the view. Finally, there seemed
    nothing for it but to halt near the top, under a grove of
    orange-trees, lunch in the pouring rain, and return without
    having reached the summit.<span class="pagenum">Page
    64<a name="Page_64"
       id="Page_64"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Friday, September 1st</i>.&mdash;At three o'clock this
    morning, when I awoke, I saw at last a bright, clear sky, and
    at five, finding that there was every prospect of a beautiful
    sunrise, we sent for horses, ate our early breakfast, and set
    off for the peak of Tijuca. Step by step we climbed, first
    through the grounds of the hotel, then through the forest, till
    we reached 'The Bamboos,' a favourite halting-place, by the
    side of a stream, near which grow, in waving tufts, the
    graceful trees which lend their name to the spot. It was very
    beautiful in the hill-side forest, with a new prospect opening
    out at every step, and set in an ever-varying natural framework
    of foliage and flowers. There was not sufficient time to
    linger, however, as we would fain have done, in the cool and
    shady paths, occasionally illumed by the bright rays of the
    sun, shining through the foliage of noble palms, the fronds of
    tree-ferns, and the spiral stems of many-coloured creepers.</p>

    <p>Before reaching the top of the peak, there are twenty-nine
    wooden and ninety-six stone steps to be ascended, at the foot
    of which we tied our horses. An iron chain is hung by the side
    to assist you, without which it would be rather giddy work, for
    the steps are steep, and there is a sheer precipice on one side
    of them. Arrived at the top, the scene was glorious; on every
    side mountains beyond mountains stretch far away into the
    distance, and one can see as far north as Cape Frio, and
    southwards as far as Rio Grande do Sul, while beneath lies the
    bay of Rio, with its innumerable islands, islets, and
    indentations. All too soon we had to scramble down again, and
    mount our horses for a hurried return to the hotel, there being
    barely time for lunch and a scramble to the yacht.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, September 4th</i>.&mdash;We were all up very
    early this morning, superintending the preparations for our
    eldest boy's departure for England. The yacht had been gaily
    dressed with flags, in honour of the anniversary of the
    Emperor's wedding-day; but it must be confessed that
    <span class="pagenum">Page 65<a name="Page_65"
       id="Page_65"></a></span>our own feelings were hardly in
       accordance with these external symbols of joy. Breakfast was
       a melancholy meal, and I fear that the visitors from the
       'Volage' were not very well entertained. After breakfast, we
       went ashore to the market, to get a couple of lion-monkeys,
       which had been kept for us, and which Tab was to take home
       with him to present to the Zoological Gardens. At one
       o'clock the steam-launch from the 'Volage' came alongside
       and embarked the luggage and servants. Half an hour later it
       returned for us; then came many tearful farewells to the
       crew, and we set off. We knew the parting had to be made,
       but this did not lessen our grief: for although it is at all
       times hard to say good-bye for a long period to those
       nearest and dearest to you, it is especially so in a foreign
       land, with the prospect of a long voyage on both sides.
       Moreover, it is extremely uncertain when we shall hear of
       our boy's safe arrival; not, I fear, until we get to
       Valparaiso, and then only by telegram&mdash;a long time to
       look forward to. Over the next half-hour I had better draw a
       veil.</p>

    <p>At two o'clock precisely, just after we had left the
    steamer, the starting bell rang, and the 'Cotopaxi' steamed
    away. As she passed the yacht, all our flags were dipped and
    the guns fired. Then we could see her rolling on the bar, for,
    calm as the water was in the bay, there was a heavy swell
    outside; and then, all too soon, we lost sight of her, as she
    sank,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>' ... with all we love, below the
            verge.'<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We heard to-day that, the Saturday before our first arrival
    at Rio, the bar was quite impassable, even for a man-of-war,
    and that, although she succeeded the next day, the sea was
    extremely rough.</p>

    <p>On our return to the 'Sunbeam,' I went to bed to rest, and
    the remainder of the party went ashore. A great many visitors
    came on board in the course of the afternoon; some remained to
    dine with us. At half-past nine we all went on shore again to a
    ball at the Casino, the grand <span class="pagenum">Page
    66<a name="Page_66"
       id="Page_66"></a></span>public room in Rio, to which we had
       been invited some days ago. It seemed a splendid place,
       beautifully decorated in white and gold and crimson, with
       frescoes and pictures let into the walls, and surrounded by
       galleries. It is capable of containing fifteen hundred
       persons, and I believe that there were even more than that
       number present on the occasion of the ball given to the Duke
       of Edinburgh some years ago. The arrangement of the large
       cloakrooms, refreshment-rooms, and passages downstairs, and
       the balconies and supper-rooms upstairs, is very convenient.
       The ball this evening being comparatively a small affair,
       the lower rooms only were used, and proved amply sufficient.
       There were not a great many ladies present, but amongst
       those we saw some were extremely pretty, and all were
       exquisitely dressed in the latest fashions from Paris. The
       toilettes of the younger ones looked fresh and simple, while
       those of the married ladies displayed considerable richness
       and taste; for although Brazilian ladies do not go out much,
       and, as a rule, remain <i>en peignoir</i> until late in the
       afternoon, they never fail to exhibit great judgment in the
       selection of their costumes.</p>

    <p>The floor was excellent, but the band made rather too much
    noise, and the dancing was different, both in style and
    arrangement, from what we are accustomed to at home.</p>

    <p>The time had now come when we had to say farewell to the
    many kind friends whom we have met here, and who have made life
    so pleasant to us during the last three weeks, in order that we
    might return to the yacht, to complete our preparation for an
    early start. The last leave-takings were soon over, and, with
    mutually expressed hopes that we might ere long meet some of
    our friends in England, Tom and I drove off, in the bright
    moonlight, to the quay, where our boat was waiting for us. The
    other members of our party found the attractions of the ball so
    irresistible that they were unable to tear themselves away
    until a much later nour.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, September 5th</i>.&mdash;We got under way at 6
    a.m., and soon bade adieu to Rio, where we have spent so many
    happy days, and to our friends on board H.M.S. 'Volage' and
    'Ready,' with whom we interchanged salutes in passing. It was a
    dull wet morning, and we could not see much of the beauties we
    were leaving behind us. The peak of Tijuca and the summit of
    the Corcovado were scarcely visible, and the Sugarloaf and
    Gavia looked cold and grey in the early mist. It was not long
    before we were rolling on the bar, and then tumbling about in
    very uncomfortable fashion in the rough sea outside. One by one
    we all disappeared below, where most of us remained
    <span class="pagenum">Page 68<a name="Page_68"
       id="Page_68"></a></span>during the greater part of the day.
       As for me, I went to bed for good at six o'clock in the
       evening, but was called up again at ten, to see some large
       bonitos playing about the bows of the yacht. It was really
       worth the trouble of getting up and climbing quite into the
       bows of the vessel to watch them, as they gambolled and
       frisked about, brightly illumined by the phosphorescence of
       the water, now swimming together steadily in pairs or fours,
       now starting in sudden pursuit of one of their number, who
       would make an independent rush forward in advance of his
       companions.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, September 9th</i>.&mdash;The last three days
    have been showery, with squalls which have freshened to a gale,
    and we are now scudding along, under all storm canvas, followed
    by crowds of cape-pigeons and cape-hens, and a few albatrosses.
    Towards this evening, however, the wind fell light, and we got
    up steam, in order to be prepared for any emergency, as a calm
    is frequently succeeded on this coast by a <i>pampero</i>, and
    we are now approaching a lee shore.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, September 10th</i>.&mdash;Tom has been on deck
    nearly all night. The shore is very low and difficult to
    distinguish, and the lights are badly kept. If the
    lighthouse-keeper happens to have plenty of oil, and is not out
    shooting or fishing, he lights his lamp; otherwise, he omits to
    perform this rather important part of his duties. The
    lighthouses can therefore hardly be said to be of much use.
    About 5 a.m. Kindred rushed down into our cabin, and woke Tom,
    calling out, 'Land to leeward, sir!' and then rushed up on deck
    again. The first glimmer of dawn had enabled him to see that we
    were running straight on to the low sandy shore, about three
    miles off, a very strong current having set us ten miles out of
    our course. The yacht's head was accordingly at once put round,
    and steaming seaward we soon left all danger behind. The sun
    rose brilliantly, and the weather during the day was very fine.
    Morning <span class="pagenum">Page 69<a name="Page_69"
       id="Page_69"></a></span>service was impossible, owing to the
       necessity for a constant observation of the land; but, after
       making the lighthouse on Santa Maria, we had prayers at 4.30
       p.m., with the hymn, 'For those at Sea.' In the night we
       made the light on Flores, burning brightly, and before
       morning those in the harbour of Monte Video.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, September 11th</i>.&mdash;After making the Flores
    light we proceeded slowly, and dropped our anchor in the outer
    roads of Monte Video at 4 a.m. At seven o'clock we got it up
    again, and by eight were anchored close to the shore. We found
    that our arrival was expected, and the health-officers' boat
    was soon alongside. Next came an officer from the United
    States' man-of-war 'Frolic,' with polite messages and offers of
    service; and then a steam-launch belonging to the Pacific
    Company, and another from the Consul, Major Monro, with piles
    of letters and newspapers for us.</p>

    <p>Monte Video, as seen from the water, is not an
    imposing-looking place. On the opposite side of the entrance to
    the harbour rises a hill, called the Cerro, 450 feet high, from
    which the town derives its name, and further inland, on the
    town side, is another eminence, 200 feet high, called the
    Cerrito. With these exceptions the surrounding country looks
    perfectly flat, without even a tree to break the monotony.</p>

    <p>Soon after breakfast we went ashore&mdash;in more senses of
    the word than one; for they have commenced to build a mole for
    the protection of small vessels, which, in its unfinished
    state, is not yet visible above the water. The consequence was
    that, at a distance of about half a mile from the
    landing-steps, we rowed straight on to the submerged stonework,
    but fortunately got off again very quickly, without having
    sustained any damage. On landing, we found ourselves opposite
    the Custom House, a fine building, with which we afterwards
    made a closer acquaintance.<span class="pagenum">Page
    70<a name="Page_70"
       id="Page_70"></a></span></p>

    <p>There is a large and very good hotel here, l'H&ocirc;tel
    Oriental. It is a handsome building outside, and the interior
    is full of marble courts, stone corridors, and lofty rooms,
    deliciously cool in the hottest weather. Having procured a
    carriage, Tom and I and the children drove through the streets,
    which are wide and handsome, though badly paved, and so full of
    holes that it is a wonder how the springs of a carriage can
    last a week. The houses seem built chiefly in the Italian style
    of architecture, with fine stucco fronts, and in many cases
    marble floors and facings, while the courtyards, seen through
    the grilles, blazed with flowers. All the lower windows were
    strongly barred, a precaution by no means unnecessary against
    the effects of the revolutions, which are of such frequent
    occurrence in this country. To enable the inhabitants the
    better to enjoy the sea-breeze, the tops of the houses are all
    flat, which gives the town, from a distance, somewhat of an
    eastern appearance. There are a great many Italian immigrants
    here, and most of the building and plastering work is done by
    them.</p>

    <p>The Paseo del Molino is the best part of the town, where all
    the rich merchants reside in quintas, surrounded by pretty
    gardens. They are very fantastic in their ideas of
    architectural style, and appear to bestow their patronage
    impartially, not to say indiscriminately, upon Gothic
    cathedrals, Alhambra palaces, Swiss cottages, Italian villas,
    and Turkish mosques. Except for this variety, the suburb has
    somewhat the appearance of the outskirts of many of the towns
    on the Riviera, with the same sub-tropical surroundings. These
    are, however, hard times on the River Plate, and more than half
    the quintas are deserted and falling into ruins. On our way
    back, by the Union Road, we met a great many of the native
    bullock-carts going home from market. These huge conveyances
    are covered with hides, and are drawn by teams of from two to
    twelve bullocks, yoked in pairs, and driven
    <span class="pagenum">Page 71<a name="Page_71"
       id="Page_71"></a></span> by a man on horseback, who carries
       a sharp-pointed goad, with which he prods the animals all
       round, at intervals. Dressed in a full white linen shirt and
       trousers, with his bright poncho and curious saddle-gear, he
       forms no unimportant figure in the picturesque scene. In the
       large market-place there are hundreds of these carts, with
       their owners encamped around them.</p>

    <p>When we at last arrived on board the yacht again, at three
    o'clock, we found that the miseries of coaling were not yet
    over, and that there had been numerous visitors from the shore.
    Everything on deck looked black, while below all was pitch dark
    and airless, every opening and crevice having been closed and
    covered with tarpaulin, to keep out the coal dust. It took
    seven hours to complete the work, instead of two, as was hoped
    and promised, so our chance of starting to-day is over. This
    seemed the more disappointing, because, had we foreseen the
    delay, we might have made other arrangements for seeing more on
    shore.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, September 12th</i>.&mdash;The anchor was up, and
    we were already beginning to steam away when I came on deck
    this morning, just in time to see the first faint streaks of
    dawn appearing in the grey sky. The River Plate here is over a
    hundred miles wide, and its banks are very flat; so there was
    nothing to be seen, except the two little hills of Cerro and
    Cerrito and the town of Monte Video, fast vanishing in the
    distance. The channels are badly buoyed, and there are shoals
    and wrecks on all sides. The lightships are simply old hulks,
    with no special marks by which to distinguish them; and as they
    themselves look exactly like wrecks, they are not of much
    assistance in the navigation, which is very confusing, and
    sometimes perilous. Once we very nearly ran aground, but
    discovered just in time that the vessel we were steering for
    with confidence was only a wreck, on a dangerous shoal, and
    that the lightship itself was further ahead. The yacht was
    immediately put about, and we just skirted the bank in turning.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 72<a name="Page_72"

    <p>The weather improved during the day, and a fine sunset was
    followed by a clear starlight night. At 10.30 p.m. we dropped
    our anchor outside all the other vessels in the roads at Buenos
    Ayres, eight miles from the shore. The lightship only carried
    an ordinary riding light, like any other vessel, so that it was
    almost impossible, unless you knew the port very well, to go in
    closer to the land at night.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, September 13th</i>.&mdash;Daylight did not
    enable us to distinguish the town, for the river here is wide
    and the banks are low, and we were lying a long way from the
    shore, outside a great many fine-looking ships, at anchor in
    the roads. About nine o'clock a German captain, in a large
    whale-boat, came alongside and told us we were nearly eight
    miles from Buenos Ayres. Tom arranged with him to take us
    ashore; and accordingly we soon started. The water was smooth
    and there was a nice breeze, and we sailed gallantly along for
    about two hours, until we reached the town. After anchoring, we
    transshipped ourselves into a small boat, in which we were
    rowed to some steps, at the end of the long rickety mole, where
    we landed. Some of the planks of the pier were missing, leaving
    great holes, big enough to fall through, and others were so
    loose that when you stepped upon one end of them the other flew
    up almost into your face.</p>

    <p>Our first business was to secure the services of a pilot, to
    take us up to Rosario. The best man on the river was sent for;
    but when he came he did not recommend our undertaking the
    voyage, as the water is very low at present, and we might get
    stuck on a sandbank, and be detained for some days, although no
    further harm would be likely to occur to us. We decided,
    therefore, as our time is precious, to give up the idea of
    making the expedition in the yacht, and to go in the ordinary
    river-boat instead.</p>

    <p>Under the guidance of some gentlemen, we then went to the
    Central Railway Station to send off some telegrams,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 73<a name="Page_73"
       id="Page_73"></a></span>and thence to the River Plate Bank.
       The treasury contains 600,000<i>l</i>. in British
       sovereigns, locked up in three strong safes, besides
       paper-money and securities to the amount of
       2,000,000<i>l</i>. It was the Rosario branch of this bank
       which was recently robbed of 15,000<i>l</i>. by an armed
       government force; an unprecedented proceeding in the history
       of nations, and one that might have led to the interference
       of foreign powers.</p>

    <p>There was time afterwards to go round and see something of
    the city, which, like many other South American towns, is built
    in square blocks, all the streets running exactly at right
    angles one to another. There is a fine plaza, or grand square,
    in which are situated the cathedral, theatre, &amp;c., the
    centre being occupied by a garden, containing statues and
    fountains. The various banks, with their marble facings,
    Corinthian columns, and splendid halls, are magnificent
    buildings, and look more like palaces than places of business.
    Some of the private houses, too, seem very handsome. Outside
    they are all faced with marble, to a certain height from the
    ground, the interior, consisting of courtyard within courtyard,
    being rather like that of a Pompeian house.</p>

    <p>We next went to the agricultural show, which, though not an
    imposing affair to our eyes, appeared really very creditable to
    those who had organised it. The horses and cattle looked small,
    but there were some good specimens of sheep&mdash;specially the
    <i>rombonellis</i> and <i>negrettis</i>, whose long fine wool
    was, however, only to be discovered by first turning aside a
    thick plaster of mud, beneath which it was concealed. We saw
    also some curious animals, natives of the country, such as
    vicu&ntilde;as, llamas, bizcachas, and various kinds of deer, a
    very mixed lot of poultry and dogs, and two magnificent Persian
    cats. Another department of the show was allotted to the
    commercial products of the country, animal, vegetable, and
    mineral; the whole forming a very interesting collection.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 74<a name="Page_74"
       id="Page_74"></a></span></p>

    <p>In re-embarking, the disagreeable process of this morning
    had to be repeated&mdash;rickety pier, rotten steps, and small
    boat included&mdash;before we reached the whale-boat, after
    which we had an eight miles' sail out to the yacht. It was a
    cold, dull night, and getting on board proved rather difficult
    work, owing to the rough sea.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, September 14th</i>.&mdash;The pilot came on
    board at seven o'clock to take us in nearer the shore, but,
    after all, we found ourselves obliged to anchor again five
    miles off. No ship drawing more than ten feet can get inside
    the sand-banks, which makes it a wretched place to lie in,
    especially as the weather at this time of year is very
    uncertain. You may go ashore from your ship on a fine clear
    morning, and before you return a gale may have sprung up,
    accompanied by a frightful sea. Open boats are therefore quite
    unsafe, a state of things which has given rise to the existence
    of a class of fine boats, specially built for the service,
    which attend all the ships lying in the roads. They are
    half-decked, will sail in any weather, and can be easily
    managed by two men.</p>

    <p>About ten o'clock we went ashore again in the whale-boat,
    which Tom had engaged to wait on us during our stay, and made
    the best of our way to a warehouse to look at some ponchos,
    which are the speciality of this part of South America.
    Everybody wears one, from the beggar to the highest official.
    The best kind of ponchos are very expensive, being made from a
    particular part of the finest hair of the vicu&ntilde;a,
    hand-woven by women, in the province of Catamarca. The genuine
    article is difficult to get, even here. In the shops the price
    usually varies from 30<i>l</i>. to 80<i>l</i>.; but we were
    shown some at a rather lower price&mdash;from 20<i>l</i>. to
    60<i>l</i>. each. They are soft as silk, perfectly waterproof,
    and will wear, it is said, for ever. We met a fine-looking man
    in one of beautiful quality yesterday. He told us that it
    originally cost 30<i>l</i>. in Catamarca, twenty years ago, and
    that he gave 20<i>l</i>. for it, second-hand, ten
    <span class="pagenum">Page 75<a name="Page_75"
       id="Page_75"></a></span>years ago; and, with the exception
       of a few slight tears, it is now as good as ever. Before we
       came here, we were strongly advised, in case we should
       happen to go on a rough expedition up country, not to be
       tempted to take with us any <i>good</i> ponchos, as the
       Gauchos, or half-bred Indians of the Pampas, who are great
       connoisseurs of these articles, and can distinguish their
       quality at a glance, would not hesitate to cut our throats
       in order to obtain possession of them.</p>

    <p>The material of which they are made is of the closest
    texture, and as the hair has never been dressed or dyed it
    retains all its natural oil and original colour, the latter
    varying from a very pretty yellow fawn to a pale cream-colour.
    The majority of the ponchos worn here are, however, made at
    Manchester, of a cheap and inferior material. They look exactly
    like the real thing at first sight, but are neither so light
    nor so warm, nor do they wear at all well. Occasionally they
    are made of silk, but more often of bright-coloured wool. In
    shape a poncho is simply a square shawl with a hole in the
    middle for the head of the wearer. On horseback the appearance
    is particularly picturesque, and it forms also a convenient
    cloak, which comes well over the saddle, before and behind, and
    leaves the arms, though covered, perfectly free.</p>

    <p>The natives, as a rule, wear a second poncho, generally of a
    different colour, tucked into the waistband of their long full
    linen drawers (<i>calzoncillos</i>), so as to make a pair of
    short baggy over-trousers. A poor man is content with a shirt,
    drawers, and two ponchos. A rich man has many rows of fringe
    and frills of lace at the bottom of his <i>calzoncillos</i>,
    and wears a short coat, with silver buttons, and a gorgeous
    silver belt, covered with dollars. His horse-fittings and
    massive stirrups (to say nothing of his enormous spurs) will be
    of solid silver, and his arms inlaid with the same metal. He
    will sometimes give as much as from 10<i>l</i>. to 20<i>l</i>.
    for a pair of stirrups alone, and the rest of his dress
    <span class="pagenum">Page 76<a name="Page_76"
       id="Page_76"></a></span>and equipment is proportionately
       expensive. The cost of the silver articles is little more
       than the value of the metal itself, which is of very pure
       quality, and is only roughly worked by the Indians or
       Gauchos. But as Manchester provides the ponchos, so does
       Birmingham the saddlery and fittings, especially those in
       use in the neighbourhood of towns.</p>

    <p>After inspecting the ponchos, we breakfasted with some
    friends, and about noon started in the train for Campana. The
    line passes at first through the streets of Buenos Ayres, and
    thence into the open country, beautifully green, and undulating
    like the waves of the sea. Near the town and the suburb of
    Belgrano are a great many peach-tree plantations, the fruit of
    which is used for fattening pigs while the wood serves for
    roasting them. There is also some scrubby brushwood, and a few
    large native trees; but these are soon left behind, and are
    succeeded by far-spreading rich pasture land, and occasional
    lagunes.</p>

    <p>We saw for the first time the holes of the bizcachas, or
    prairie-dogs, outside which the little prairie-owls keep guard.
    There appeared to be always one, and generally two, of these
    birds, standing, like sentinels, at the entrance to each hole,
    with their wise-looking heads on one side, pictures of prudence
    and watchfulness. The bird and the beast are great friends, and
    are seldom to be found apart. We also passed several enormous
    flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, most of them quite
    unattended, though some were being driven by men on horseback.
    There were quantities of plovers, and a great many partridges,
    of two kinds, large and small, and the numerous lagunes were
    covered with and surrounded by water-fowl of all
    kinds&mdash;wild swans and ducks, snipe, white storks, grey
    herons, black cormorants, and scarlet flamingoes, the
    last-named standing at the edge of the water, catching fish,
    and occasionally diving below the surface. On the very top of
    some of the telegraph-posts were the nests of the oven-bird,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 77<a name="Page_77"
       id="Page_77"></a></span>looking like carved round blocks of
       wood, placed there for ornament. These nests are made of
       mud, and are perfectly spherical in form, the interior being
       divided into two quite distinct chambers.</p>

    <p>Campana was reached by four o'clock, the train running
    straight on to the pier, alongside of which the two vessels
    were lying, with steam up. Passengers, baggage, and freight
    were immediately transferred from the train to the boats; and
    we soon found ourselves steaming along in the 'Uruguay,'
    between the willow-hung banks of the broad Parana. The country,
    though otherwise flat and uninteresting, looks very pretty just
    now, in its new spring coat of bright green.</p>

    <p>We passed several small towns, amongst others, San Pedro and
    San Nicolas, which are quite important-looking places, with a
    good deal of shipping, and occasionally stopped to pick up
    passengers, who had come in boats and steam-launches from
    far-distant villages, situated on lagunes, which our steamer
    could not enter.</p>

    <p>Just before arriving at each stopping-place, we had a race
    with the 'Proveedor,' and whenever she became visible at a bend
    in the river, half a ton more coal was immediately heaped on to
    our fires by the captain's order&mdash;a piece of
    <span class="pagenum">Page 78<a name="Page_78"
       id="Page_78"></a></span>reckless extravagance, for, do what
       they would, they could not make us gain five minutes. The
       competition is, however, very fierce, and I suppose the two
       companies will not be satisfied until they have ruined one
       another; whereas, if each would run a steamer on alternate
       days, they and the public would be equally benefited. The
       fares are exceedingly reasonable, being less than 3<i>l</i>.
       for the whole journey from Buenos Ayres to Rosario,
       including all charges.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, September 15th</i>.&mdash;A violent storm of
    thunder and lightning, apparently just above our heads, woke us
    at six o'clock this morning. Torrents of rain followed, and
    continued to fall until we dropped our anchor at Rosario, at
    8.45 a.m., just as we were in the middle of breakfast, in our
    cozy little stern cabin. Half an hour later we landed, though
    the rain still came down in sheets, but the steamer was now
    alongside the pier, and close carriages had been provided. A
    few minutes' drive through ill-paved streets brought us to the
    Hotel Universel, a handsome, spacious building, with marble
    courtyards, full of trees, plants, and flowers, into which all
    the sitting-rooms open. Above are galleries, round which the
    various bed-rooms are in like manner ranged. It all looked nice
    and cool, and suitable for hot weather, but it was certainly
    rather draughty and cheerless on such a cold, pouring wet day,
    and all our efforts to make our large room, in which there were
    four immense windows, at all comfortable, were vain.</p>

    <p>Rosario, like Buenos Ayres, is built in squares. The streets
    are generally well paved with black and white marble, but the
    roadways are composed of little round stones, and are full of
    holes and inequalities, so that, in crossing the road after
    heavy rain, one steps from the <i>trottoir</i> into a very
    slough of despond. The universal tramway runs down the centre
    of every street.</p>

    <p>After luncheon we made a fresh start for Carcara&ntilde;a by
    a special train, to which were attached two goods-vans, full of
    horses, and a carriage truck, containing a most
    <span class="pagenum">Page 79<a name="Page_79"
       id="Page_79"></a></span>comfortable American carriage, in
       shape not unlike a Victoria, only much lighter and with very
       high wheels. After a short journey through a rich, flat,
       grass country, we arrived at Roldan, the first colony of the
       Central Argentine Land Company. Here we all alighted, the
       horses were taken out of the vans, saddled, bridled, and
       harnessed, and the gentlemen rode and I drove round the
       colony, along what are generally roads, but to-day were
       sheets of water. We saw many colonists, of every grade, from
       those still occupying the one-roomed wooden cottages,
       originally supplied by the Land Company, standing in the
       midst of ill-cultivated fields, to those who had built for
       themselves good houses in the town, or nice cottages, with
       pretty gardens, surrounded by well-tilled lands.</p>

    <p>The drive ended at the mill belonging to a retired officer
    of the British army, who has settled here with his wife and two
    dear little children. Here we had tea and a pleasant chat, and
    then returned to the train and proceeded to Carcara&ntilde;a,
    the next station on the line. Now, however, instead of the rich
    pasture lands and flourishing crops which we had hitherto seen
    on all sides, our road lay through a desolate-looking district,
    bearing too evident signs of the destructive power of the
    locust. People travelling with us tell us that, less than a
    week ago, the pasture here was as fresh and green as could be
    desired, and the various crops were a foot high; but that, in
    the short space of a few hours, the care and industry of the
    last ten months were rendered utterly vain and useless, and the
    poor colonists found their verdant fields converted into a
    barren waste by these rapacious insects.</p>

    <p>Carcara&ntilde;a may be called the Richmond&mdash;one might
    almost say the Brighton&mdash;of Rosario. It stands on a river,
    the Carcara&ntilde;al, to the banks of which an omnibus runs
    twice a day from the railway-station, during the season, to
    take people to bathe. Near the station is also an excellent
    little hotel, containing a large dining-room and a few
    bed-rooms, <span class="pagenum">Page 80<a name="Page_80"
       id="Page_80"></a></span>kept by two Frenchwomen; and here
       the Rosarians come out by train to dine and enjoy the fresh
       air. It was quite dark by the time we arrived, so that we
       could not see much of the flourishing little colony which
       has been formed here. We therefore paddled across the wet
       road to the inn, where, despite the somewhat rough
       surroundings, we enjoyed a capital dinner, cooked in the
       true French style. They are specially celebrated here for
       their asparagus, but the locusts had devoured all but a very
       few stalks, besides which they were held responsible, on the
       present occasion, for the absence of other vegetables and
       salad. Yesterday there was a grand wedding-party near here,
       the complete success of which was, we were told, somewhat
       marred by the fact, that for six hours, in the very middle
       of the day, it became absolutely necessary to light candles,
       owing to the dense clouds of locusts, about a league in
       extent, by which the air was darkened. Trains are even
       stopped by these insects occasionally; for they appear to
       like a hard road, and when they get on the line their bodies
       make the rails so greasy that the wheels of the engines will
       not bite. Moreover, they completely obscure the lights and
       signals, so that the men are afraid to proceed. The only
       remedy, therefore, is to go very slowly, preceded by a
       truck-load of sand, which is scattered freely over the rails
       in front of the engine. Horses will not always face a cloud
       of locusts, even to get to their stables, but turn round and
       stand doggedly still, until it has passed.</p>

    <p>After dinner we once more stepped into our special train, in
    which we arrived at Rosario at about half-past nine o'clock,
    thoroughly tired out.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, September 16th</i>.&mdash;Waking at half-past
    five, we busied ourselves until nine o'clock, when we again
    started in a special train for Carcara&ntilde;a. After a short
    stop at Roldan, it was reached two hours later, and breakfast
    was followed by a long ride through the Land Company's colony,
    and from thence to Candelaria, a purely Spanish settlement.</p>

    <p>I freely confess that I had hardly believed all the stories
    they told me last night about the terrible doings of the
    locusts, and thought they must have been slightly exaggerated.
    It all seemed too dreadful to be true&mdash;as if one of the
    plagues of Egypt had been revived by the wand of an evil
    magician. In this somewhat incredulous mood I rashly said that,
    although I was very sorry to hear of the visit of these
    destructive creatures, as they <i>were</i> unfortunately here,
    I should like to see them. My wish was shortly to be gratified;
    for, in the course of our ride, we saw in the distant sky what
    looked very much like a heavy purple thunder-cloud, but which
    the experienced pronounced to be a swarm of locusts. It seemed
    impossible; but as we proceeded they met us, first singly, and
    then in gradually increasing numbers, until each step became
    positively painful, owing to the smart blows we received from
    them on <span class="pagenum">Page 82<a name="Page_82"
       id="Page_82"></a></span>our heads, faces, and hands. We
       stopped for a time at Mr. Holt's large estancia, where,
       notwithstanding the general appearance of prosperity, the
       traces of the ravages of the locusts were only too visible.
       On remounting, to proceed on our journey, we found that the
       cloud had approached much nearer, the effect produced by its
       varying position being most extraordinary. As the locusts
       passed between us and the sun they completely obscured the
       light; a little later, with the sun's rays shining directly
       on their wings, they looked like a golden cloud, such as one
       sometimes sees in the transformation scene of a pantomime;
       and, at a greater distance, when viewed from the top of a
       slight eminence, they looked like a snow-storm, or a field
       of snow-white marguerites, which had suddenly taken to
       themselves wings. When on the ground, with their wings
       closed, they formed a close mass of little brown specks,
       completely hiding the ground and crops, both grass and
       grain. In riding over them, though not a quarter of their
       number could rise, for want of space in which to spread
       their wings, they formed such a dense cloud that we could
       see nothing else, and the horses strongly objected to face
       them. They got into one's hair and clothes, and gave one the
       creeps all over. I am sure I shall often dream of them for
       some time to come, and I have quite made up my mind that I
       never wish to see another locust as long as I live. I have,
       however, secured some fine specimens for any one who is
       curious about them.</p>

    <p>The land we passed through appeared to be well farmed. We
    spoke to several of the colonists, especially to one Italian
    family, living in a little mud rancho with a tile roof. They
    were all gathered together to witness the dying agonies of one
    of their best cows, perishing from the effects of the drought.
    The rest of the animals in the corral looked, I am sorry to
    say, thin and miserable, and as if they intended soon to follow
    their companion's example. The poor people, nevertheless,
    seemed very cheery and contented, <span class="pagenum">Page
    83<a name="Page_83"
       id="Page_83"></a></span>and hospitably gave us each a drink
       of some remarkably muddy water.</p>

    <p>After a thirty-mile ride under a hot sun, fortunately on the
    easiest of horses, we were none of us sorry to stop for a short
    time at Carcara&ntilde;a, and obtain some refreshment, before
    proceeding&mdash;horses, carriage, and all&mdash;by train to
    Rosario, another colony on the line. Arrived at the latter
    place, I thought I had had enough riding for the first day, and
    therefore visited the various farms and houses in the carriage,
    the rest of the party going, as before, on horseback. After a
    round of about fifteen miles, we returned to the station, where
    we were kindly received by the sister of the station-master. An
    excellent dinner was provided for us in the refreshment-room,
    before we entered our special train, and Rosario was reached at
    about ten o'clock.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, September 17th</i>.&mdash;A kind friend sent his
    carriage to take us to the English church, a brick building,
    built to replace the small iron church that existed here
    previously, and only opened last month. The service was well
    performed, and the singing of the choir excellent. We paid a
    visit to the Sunday schools after luncheon, and then drove to
    the quinta of Baron Alvear. The road lies through the town,
    past the race-course, crowded with Gauchos, getting up scratch
    races amongst themselves, and on, over undulating plains and
    water-courses, into the open country. Sometimes there was a
    track, sometimes none. In some places the pastures were
    luxuriantly green; in others the ground was carpeted with
    white, lilac, and scarlet verbena, just coming into
    bloom&mdash;for it is still early spring here. Here and there
    came a bare patch, completely cleared by the locusts, who had
    also stripped many of the fine timber trees in the garden of
    the quinta. On the gate-posts, at the entrance, were the nests
    of two oven-birds, like those we had already seen on the
    telegraph-posts, so exactly spherical as to look like
    ornaments. In one of the shrubberies a fine jaguar was shut up
    in a cage, who <span class="pagenum">Page 84<a name="Page_84"
       id="Page_84"></a></span>looked very like a tiger. Though he
       had evidently just had his dinner, he was watching with
       greedy interest the proceedings of some natives in charge of
       a horse&mdash;an animal which he esteems a great delicacy,
       when procurable.</p>

    <p>On our way across the camp we saw a great quantity of the
    seeds of the Martynia proboscidea, mouse-burrs as they call
    them,&mdash;devil's claws or toe-nails: they are
    curious-looking things, as the annexed woodcut will show.</p>

    <p>Frank Buckland has a theory&mdash;and very likely a correct
    one&mdash;that they are created in this peculiar form for the
    express purpose of attaching themselves to the long tails of
    the wild horses that roam about the country in troops of
    hundreds. They carry them thousands of miles, and disseminate
    the seed wherever they go at large in search of food and
    water.</p>

    <p>When we returned to Rosario we noticed a great crowd still
    on the race-course, and were just in time to see the finish of
    one race, ridden barebacked, and for a very short distance. All
    the races are short; and as the natives are always engaging in
    these little contests of speed, the horses get into the habit
    of extending themselves directly you put them out of a walk.
    But the least touch is sufficient to stop them immediately, and
    I never saw horses better broken than they are here. The most
    fearful bits are used for the purpose; but when once this is
    accomplished, the mere inclination of the body, or the
    slightest pressure of the finger upon the bridle, is sufficient
    to guide them. They will maintain, for almost any length of
    time, a quick canter&mdash;what they call here 'a little
    gallop'&mdash;at the rate of three <span class="pagenum">Page
    85<a name="Page_85"
       id="Page_85"></a></span>leagues (ten miles) an hour, without
       showing the slightest sign of fatigue. They don't like being
       mounted, and always fidget a little then, but are quite
       quiet directly you are in the saddle. I rode several horses
       which had never carried a lady before; but after the first
       few minutes they did not seem to mind the riding-habit in
       the least. They evidently dislike standing still, unless you
       dismount and throw the rein on the ground, when they will
       remain stationary for hours.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, September 18th</i>.&mdash;The early part of this
    morning was spent in much the same way as on Saturday, Tom
    going as before to the Land Company's Office, whilst I remained
    at home to write.</p>

    <p>At nine o'clock we proceeded to the station, and started in
    our comfortable railway carriage for Tortugas. We formed quite
    a large party altogether, and the journey over the now familiar
    line, past Roldan, Carcara&ntilde;a, and Ca&ntilde;ada de
    Gomez, was a very pleasant one. At Tortugas we left the train,
    and paid a visit to one of the overseers of the colony and his
    cheery little French wife, who, we found, had been expecting us
    all day on Saturday. A few weeks ago this lady's sister was
    carried off by Indians, with some other women and children.
    After riding many leagues, she seized her opportunity, pushed
    the Indian who was carrying her off his horse, turned the
    animal's head round, and galloped back across the plain, hotly
    pursued, until within a mile or two of the colony, by the rest
    of the band. It was a plucky thing for a little bit of a woman
    to attempt with a great powerful savage, and she is deservedly
    looked upon in the village as quite a heroine.</p>

    <p>The journey between Rosario and Cordova occupies twelve
    hours by the ordinary train; and as Frayle Muerto is exactly
    half-way between the two places, the trains going in either
    direction commence their journey at the same hours (6 a.m. and
    6 p.m.), by which means the passengers meet each other here in
    time to breakfast and dine <span class="pagenum">Page
    86<a name="Page_86"
       id="Page_86"></a></span>together. There is a fine bridge
       over the river near Frayle Muerto, but the place is
       principally celebrated as having been the site of the
       Henleyite colony, which caused disappointment to so many
       young men of family, who were induced to come out here from
       England and to go up country, with no other result than the
       loss of all their money. The scheme was supposed to be
       perfect in all its details, but proved upon a closer
       acquaintance to be utterly worthless. The iron church at
       Rosario is still standing, which the members of the
       expedition took up there, and we have also met some of the
       young men themselves at various times.</p>

    <p>The train did not reach Cordova until 7.30 p.m., and it was
    therefore too late for us to see much of the approach to the
    city, but to-morrow we intend to do a good deal in that way. In
    the middle of the night we were aroused by a violent
    thunderstorm. The lightning was most vivid, and illuminated our
    room with many colours. The rain fell heavily, flooding
    everything, and making the streets look like rivers, and the
    courtyard of the hotel like a lake. It is one of the oldest,
    and, at the same time, one of the most unhealthy, of the cities
    of South America, for it is built in the hollow of the
    surrounding hills, where no refreshing breezes can
    penetrate.</p>

    <p>Travelling in Brazil is like passing through a vast
    hothouse, filled with gorgeous tropical vegetation and forms of
    insect life. In the neighbourhood of Monte Video you might
    imagine yourself in a perpetual greenhouse. Here it is like
    being in a vast garden, in which the greenest of turf, the
    brightest of bedding-out plants, and the most fragrant
    flowering shrubs abound. Each country, therefore, possesses its
    own particular beauty, equally attractive in its way.</p>

    <p>Shortly after leaving Cordova we passed through an Indian
    village; but, except at this point, we did not meet many
    natives during our ride. One poor woman, however,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 87<a name="Page_87"
       id="Page_87"></a></span>whom we did unfortunately encounter,
       had a fall from her horse, owing to the animal being
       frightened at the umbrella I carried, yet my own horse had,
       after a very brief objection, quietly submitted to the
       introduction of this novelty into the equipment of his
       rider.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <a name="Illus_102"
             id="Illus_102"></a> <img src="images/t_102.jpg"

        <b>La Calera</b><br />
        <a href="images/102.gif">View full size illustration.</a>
    </div>

    <p>We found that the hotel on the Caldera for which we were
    bound was shut up; but one of the party had the keys, and an
    excellent lunch quickly made its appearance. The view from the
    verandah, over the river, to the Sierras beyond, was very fine.
    It had become quite hot by this time, and I was much interested
    in seeing all our horses taken down to the water to bathe. They
    appeared to be perfectly familiar with the process; and, the
    river being shallow, they picked out all the nice holes between
    the boulders, where they could lie down and be completely
    covered by the water. Just as we were starting to return, black
    clouds gathered from all around; the lightning flashed, the
    thunder muttered, and big drops began to fall.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 88<a name="Page_88"
       id="Page_88"></a></span>But the storm was not of long
       duration, and we escaped the worst part of it, though we had
       ample evidence of its severity during our homeward ride, in
       the slippery ground, the washed-away paths, and the swollen
       ditches. We stopped half-way to see the drowning out of some
       poor little bizcachas from their holes. The water had been
       turned into their dwellings by means of trenches, and as the
       occupants endeavoured to make their escape at the other end
       they were pounced upon by men and dogs; the prairie-owls
       meanwhile hovering disconsolately overhead. Two of the
       gentlemen of our party each managed to purchase a living
       bizcacha, which was then wrapped up in a handkerchief and
       conveyed home. When young they are pretty little creatures,
       and are easily tamed.</p>

    <p>It was late when we reached Cordova; but I was anxious to
    visit the Observatory before our departure, as it is one of the
    best, though not by any means the largest, in the world.
    Professor Gould, the astronomer, is away just at present, but
    we were kindly received by Mrs. Gould, who conducted us over
    the building. They have a fine collection of various
    instruments and some wonderful photographs of the principal
    stars&mdash;Saturn, with his ring and eight moons, Jupiter,
    with his four moons, Venus, Mercury, &amp;c. If we could have
    stayed longer we might have seen much more; but it was now
    quite dark, and we had only just time for a short visit to the
    observing room itself. Our ride down to the city in the dark
    would have been exceedingly risky if our horses had been less
    sure-footed, for the roads had been washed away in many places,
    but we reached the bottom of the Observatory hill in safety,
    and shortly afterwards arrived at the hotel just in time for
    dinner.</p>

    <p>After dinner we drove to the station, where we found all our
    own party assembled, and many more people, who had come to see
    us off. I was given the Chilian bit used for the horse I rode
    to-day, as a remembrance of my visit. It
    <span class="pagenum">Page 89<a name="Page_89"
       id="Page_89"></a></span>is a most formidable-looking
       instrument of torture, and one which I am sure my dear
       little steed did not in the least require; but I suppose the
       fact of having once felt it, when being broken in, is
       sufficient for a lifetime, for the horses here have
       certainly the very lightest mouths I ever met with. A gift
       of a young puma, or small lion, was also waiting for me. It
       is about four months old, and very tame; but, considering
       the children, I think it will be more prudent to pass it on
       to the Zoo, in London.</p>

    <p>The train started at 8.30 p.m. and took an hour to reach Rio
    Segundo, where we found tea and coffee prepared. After that we
    proceeded to make our arrangements for the night; some of the
    gentlemen sleeping in the saloon-carriages, and some on beds
    made up in the luggage-van. Tom and I turned into our two cozy
    little berths, and knew nothing more until we were called at
    4.30 a.m. at Ca&ntilde;ada de Gomez. The lamp had gone out, and
    we found it rather difficult work dressing and packing in the
    cold and dark; but it was soon done, and a cup of hot coffee in
    the refreshment-room afterwards made us feel quite
    comfortable.</p>

    <p>Then we all separated: Captain Dunlop to join his ship; Tom
    to complete his report on the colonies of the Central Argentine
    Land Company, which he is preparing in compliance with the
    request of the Directors in London; while the rest of the party
    awaited the arrival of the waggonette which was to take us to
    the estancia of Las Rosas.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, September 20th</i>.&mdash;At 6.30 a.m. the
    waggonette arrived, a light but strong, unpainted vehicle,
    drawn by a pair of active little well-bred horses, both of whom
    had been raced in their day. There were but a few leagues of
    cultivated ground to be passed before we reached the broad,
    undulating, solitary Pampas, where for some time the only
    visible signs of life were to be found in the Teru-tero birds
    (a sort of plover), who shrieked <span class="pagenum">Page
    90<a name="Page_90"
       id="Page_90"></a></span>discordantly as we disturbed their
       repose; the partridges, large and small, put up by the
       retriever who accompanied us; some prairie fowls; a great
       many hawks, of all sizes; and the pretty little wydah-birds,
       with their two immense tail feathers, four times the length
       of their bodies. The first glimpse of the far-spreading
       prairie was most striking in all its variations of colour.
       The true shade of the Pampas grass, when long, is a light
       dusty green; when short it is a bright fresh green. But it
       frequently happens that, owing to the numerous
       prairie-fires, either accidental or intentional, nothing is
       to be seen but a vast expanse of black charred ground, here
       and there relieved by a few patches of vivid green, where
       the grass is once more springing up under the influence of
       the rain.</p>

    <p>The road, or rather track, was in a bad condition, owing to
    the recent wet weather, and on each side of the five
    <i>ca&ntilde;adas</i>, or small rivers, which we had to ford,
    there were deep morasses, through which we had to struggle as
    best we could, with the mud up to our axletrees. Just before
    arriving at the point where the stream had to be crossed, the
    horses were well flogged and urged on at a gallop, which they
    gallantly maintained until the other side was reached. Then we
    stopped to breathe the horses and to repair damages, generally
    finding that a trace had given way, or that some other part of
    the harness had shown signs of weakness. On one occasion we
    were delayed for a considerable time by the breaking of the
    splinter-bar, to repair which was a troublesome matter; indeed,
    I don't know how we should have managed it if we had not met a
    native lad, who sold us his long lasso to bind the pieces
    together again. It was a lucky <i>rencontre</i> for us, as he
    was the only human being we saw during the whole of our drive
    of thirty miles, except the peon who brought us a change of
    horses, half-way.</p>

    <p>In the course of the journey we passed a large estancia, the
    road to which was marked by the dead bodies and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 91<a name="Page_91"
       id="Page_91"></a></span>skeletons of the poor beasts who had
       perished in the late droughts. Hundreds of them were lying
       about in every stage of decay, those more recently dead
       being surrounded by vultures and other carrion-birds. The
       next <i>ca&ntilde;ada</i> that we crossed was choked up with
       the carcases of the unfortunate creatures who had struggled
       thus far for a last drink, and had then not had sufficient
       strength left to extricate themselves from the water. Herds
       of miserable-looking, half-starved cattle were also to be
       seen, the cows very little larger than their calves, and all
       apparently covered with the same rough shaggy coats. The
       pasture is not fine enough in this part of the country to
       carry sheep, but deer are frequently met with.</p>

    <p>A little later we again began to approach cultivated land,
    and a mile or two further brought us to a broad road, with high
    palings on either side, down which we drove, and through the
    yard, to the door of the estancia. The house is a one-story
    building, one room wide, with a verandah in front and at the
    back, one side of which faces the yard, the other a well-kept
    garden, full of violets and other spring flowers, and roses
    just coming into bloom. There are several smaller detached
    buildings, in which the sleeping apartments are situated, and
    which are also provided with verandahs and barred windows.
    Having visited the various rooms, in company with our hosts, we
    sat down to a rough but substantial breakfast, to which full
    justice was done. Travelling all night, and a ride of thirty
    miles in the fresh morning air, have a tendency to produce a
    keen appetite; and the present occasion proved no exception to
    that rule.</p>

    <p>After breakfast I rested and wrote some letters, while the
    gentlemen inspected the farm and stud. The proprietor of this
    estancia has the best horses in this part of the country, and
    has taken great pains to improve their breed, as well as that
    of the cattle and sheep, by importing thorough-breds from
    England. Unlike the Arabs, neither <span class="pagenum">Page
    92<a name="Page_92"
       id="Page_92"></a></span>natives nor settlers here think of
       riding mares, and it is considered quite a disgrace to do
       so. They are therefore either allowed to run wild in troops,
       or are used to trample out corn or to make mud for bricks.
       They are also frequently killed and boiled down, for the
       sake of their hides and tallow, the value of which does not
       amount to more than about 10<i>s</i>. per head. Large herds
       of them are met with at this time of the year on the Pampas,
       attended by a few horses, and accompanied by their
       foals.</p>

    <p>The natives of these parts pass their lives in the saddle.
    Horses are used for almost every conceivable employment, from
    hunting and fishing to brick-making and butter-churning. Even
    the very beggars ride about on horseback. I have seen a
    photograph of one, with a police certificate of mendicancy
    hanging round his neck, taken from life for Sir Woodbine
    Parish. Every domestic servant has his or her own horse, as a
    matter of course; and the maids are all provided with habits,
    in which they ride about on Sundays, from one estancia to
    another, to pay visits. In fishing, the horse is ridden into
    the water as far as he can go, and the net or rod is then made
    use of by his rider. At Buenos Ayres I have seen the poor
    animals all but swimming to the shore, with heavy carts and
    loads, from the ships anchored in the inner roads; for the
    water is so shallow that only very small boats can go alongside
    the vessels, and the cargo is therefore transferred directly to
    the carts to save the trouble and expense of transshipment. In
    out-of-the-way places, on the Pampas, where no churns exist,
    butter is made by putting milk into a goat-skin bag, attached
    by a long lasso to the saddle of a peon, who is then set to
    gallop a certain number of miles, with the bag bumping and
    jumping along the ground after him.</p>

    <p>About four o'clock the horses&mdash;much larger and better
    bred animals than those we have been riding lately&mdash;were
    brought round from the corral. Mine was a beauty; easy,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 93<a name="Page_93"
       id="Page_93"></a></span>gentle, and fast. We first took a
       canter round the cultivated ground, about 300 acres in
       extent, and in capital condition. Lucerne grows here
       splendidly, and can be cut seven times a year. As we left
       the yard, Mr. Nield's man asked if he would take the dogs.
       He replied in the negative; but I suppose he must have
       referred to the greyhounds only, for we were certainly
       accompanied on the present occasion by <i>eleven</i> dogs of
       various sorts and sizes, those left behind being shut up and
       kept without food, in anticipation of the stag-hunt
       to-morrow. We rode over the race-course, where the horses
       are trained, and on to the partridge ground. The larger kind
       of these birds are extremely stupid, and are easily ridden
       down by a horseman, or caught in a noose. They rise three
       times, and after the third flight they are so exhausted and
       terrified that it is easy to dismount and catch them with
       the hand, as they lie panting on the long grass.
       Partridge-hunting is considered good sport. It is necessary
       to keep your eye constantly fixed upon the bird, and to
       watch where he settles, and then to gallop to the spot as
       hard as possible, leaving your horse to look after himself
       amid the long grass; and this manoeuvre has to be repeated
       until at last the unfortunate bird is overtaken and
       caught.</p>

    <p>As we were riding along, the dogs found and killed a
    bizcacha, in a bank. Just as Mr. Elliott had pulled it out, and
    had laid it, dead, in the field, its little companion owl
    arrived, and appeared to be in the most dreadful state of mind.
    It shrieked and cried, as it hovered over us, and finally
    selected a small white fox terrier, who, I think, really had
    been principally concerned in the death, as the object of its
    vengeance, pouncing down upon his head, and giving him two or
    three good pecks, at the same time flapping its wings
    violently. The other dogs drove it off; but more than half an
    hour afterwards, while we were looking at some horses, nearly a
    mile from the spot, the plucky little owl returned to the
    charge, and again swooped down upon the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 94<a name="Page_94"
       id="Page_94"></a></span>same dog, with a dismal cry, and
       administered a vigorous peck to him. Altogether it was a
       striking and interesting proof of the attachment existing
       between these curious birds and beasts; the object of the
       owl in the present instance clearly being to revenge if
       possible the death of its friend.</p>

    <p>On our return to the farm, we went all round the place, and
    found that everything was being made secure for the night;
    after which we watched all the servants come in one by one for
    their daily ration of grog, and then retired to dress for
    dinner, shortly after which, being thoroughly tired out, I
    retired to my bed-room, attended by a very kind old Irishwoman,
    who had been deputed to look after me. My mind was at first
    somewhat disturbed by the discovery of one or two enormous
    toads and long-armed spiders in my apartment; but they
    fortunately did not interfere with my repose, for I slept like
    a top. All the rooms being on the ground-floor, it is almost
    impossible entirely to exclude intruders of this description. I
    admired very much what I took to be two fine ponchos, of a
    delicate fawn-colour, used as tablecloths, but upon a closer
    examination I found that they were made of the finest silk, and
    learned afterwards that they were imported from England. I
    don't know why the same material should not be employed for a
    similar purpose at home; but I believe that those manufactured
    hitherto have been designed expressly for the South American
    market, to which they are exported in considerable
    quantities.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, September 21st</i>.&mdash;At five o'clock, when
    I awoke, it was so misty that I could only see about half-way
    across the yard. By six, the hour at which we were to have
    started on our hunting expedition, matters had improved a
    little; but it was still considered unsafe to venture out, for
    fear of being lost on the vast plains which surrounded us. An
    hour later, however, it was reported that the fog was clearing
    off, and a little before eight o'clock
    <span class="pagenum">Page 95<a name="Page_95"
       id="Page_95"></a></span>we started. Horses, riders, and
       dogs, all appeared to be in the highest spirits, the former
       jumping and frisking about, hardly deigning to touch the
       ground, the latter tearing after one another and barking at
       every stray bird they met. The pack numbered seventeen, and
       could hardly be called a level lot of hounds, comprising, as
       it did, two deerhounds, five well-bred greyhounds, two
       retrievers, one setter, one spaniel, one French poodle, two
       fox terriers, one black and tan terrier, and two animals of
       an utterly indescribable breed; but they all did their work
       well, as the event proved. Even the shaggy fat old French
       poodle arrived in each case before the deer was cut up.</p>

    <p>Two deer were soon descried in the distance, and we cantered
    steadily towards them at the rate of about ten miles an hour,
    until the dogs winded and sighted them. Then, directly the
    first short yelp was heard, every horse extended himself in an
    instant, galloping away as hard as he could go, almost
    literally <i>ventre &agrave; terre</i>. They were nearly all
    thoroughbreds, and had been raced, so that the speed was
    something delightful. But it only lasted ten minutes, at the
    end of which time the dogs ran into one of the deer, and thus
    put a temporary stop to our enjoyment. He proved to be a fine
    buck, and was soon killed. His legs were cut off for trophies,
    but, his horns being like velvet, the head was not worth
    having. Some of the dogs pursued the doe, but failed to pull
    her down, and returned half an hour later fatigued and
    panting.</p>

    <p>It had become hot by this time, so we rode to the nearest
    water, to enable the animals to drink and bathe, and then
    started afresh at a sharp canter. There were plenty of bizcacha
    holes and boggy places to be avoided; but we allowed the horses
    to take care of themselves and us in this respect, and occupied
    ourselves almost exclusively in looking for fresh deer. For
    some time we found nothing; then two sprang out of the long
    grass close to the <i>ca&ntilde;ada</i>, which they crossed,
    and, on reaching the other side, started
    <span class="pagenum">Page 96<a name="Page_96"
       id="Page_96"></a></span>off in different directions. The
       pack pursued and divided, some going after each animal. I,
       and two others of the party, followed the doe, and after
       another short burst of ten minutes, at a tremendous pace, we
       ran into and killed her. As soon as she had been despatched,
       we wanted to follow the buck, in pursuit of which the rest
       of the riders had gone, but there was now nothing to be seen
       of him or them. Flat as the country looked, the slight
       undulations of the ground quite hid them from our view.
       After riding about for two hours in various directions,
       looking and listening most patiently, we abandoned the
       search in despair, and returned to the house, where we found
       that our friends had already arrived. They had enjoyed the
       best run they have had for many months&mdash;seven miles,
       from point to point&mdash;but the dogs had lain down, dead
       beat, at the end of the first six miles. The horsemen had
       galloped on, their animals tailing off one by one, until
       only two remained in it at all. Having mutually agreed to
       let the stag live till another day to afford perhaps as good
       a run and as much pleasure to some one else, they thereupon
       also abandoned the chase, and turned their horses' heads
       homewards.</p>

    <p>After a change of dress, we proceeded to pack up,
    preparatory to our departure, and then had breakfast, after
    which we bade adieu to our kind hosts, and started in the
    waggonette to retrace our steps to the station. It was very
    bright and hot, and the sun and wind had already begun to have
    a visible effect upon the vegetation of the Pampas. The streams
    were much more passable, and we reached Ca&ntilde;ada de Gomez
    at about half-past five, in a shorter time, than it had taken
    us to perform the outward journey yesterday. On reaching
    Rosario at about ten o'clock, we found several friends waiting
    to receive us, with invitations to tea; but we felt too tired
    in body and too disreputable in appearance to accept them, and
    preferred going straight to our hotel and to bed.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, September 22nd</i>.&mdash;Mr. Fisher called for
    me at 8 a.m., to drive me in his little carriage to the railway
    yard and workshops, and then to pay some farewell visits. We
    also went to see the market, and to get some photographs of
    Rosario; after which, breakfast, packing-up, and paying the
    bill occupied our time until one o'clock, when we started for
    the steamer, to return to Buenos Ayres. On our arrival
    alongside the 'Proveedor,' I found that nearly all our Rosario
    friends had come down to the landing-place to see us off, and
    had brought all manner of remembrances for me and the children.
    Flowers in profusion; a tame cardinal bird for Muriel; a pair
    of dear little long-tailed green paroquets; the skin of a seal,
    shot at the Alexandria colony; a beautiful poncho; an Argentine
    bit, whip, and stirrups; a carpincha skin; two pretty little
    muletas&mdash;a sort of armadillo, very tame, and often kept in
    the houses here as a pet; and several other presents, all of
    which, when I look at them at home, will serve to remind me of
    the kind donors, and of the happy days spent in the Argentine
    Republic.</p>

    <p>It was not long before we were off, and steaming slowly
    astern of the 'Uruguay.' This boat is not so large nor so fast
    as the 'Uruguay,' though the difference in speed does not
    probably amount to more than fifteen minutes in the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 98<a name="Page_98"
       id="Page_98"></a></span>twenty-four hours. Her saloon and
       deck are not so good, but her sleeping-cabins are much
       larger and more comfortable. The Italian captains are
       equally agreeable on both steamers, the civility is the
       same, and the fares and food are precisely similar, so that
       there is not much left to influence one in the choice of
       vessels. We had a pleasant party at an excellent dinner in
       the evening, the captain only regretting that we had not
       been on board two days ago, when Mlle. P. and the opera
       company went down from Rosario to Buenos Ayres. They had a
       very cheery evening, and some good music, which Tom told us
       afterwards he thoroughly enjoyed. There were no musicians on
       board to-night, and not any temptation to sit up late, which
       was perhaps as well; one of the reasons for our going back
       this way being that we wished to have an opportunity of
       seeing the River Tigr&eacute;, which we should reach in the
       early morning. On the upward journey we had, to save time,
       embarked at Campa&ntilde;a, which is situated above that
       river.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, September 23rd</i>.&mdash;At 4.30 a.m. the
    captain called me, being anxious that I should not miss any of
    the beauties of the Tigr&eacute;. On my arrival on deck he
    kindly had a chair placed for me right in the bows, provided me
    with rugs and wraps, and sent for some hot coffee, which was
    particularly acceptable, as the morning air was fresh and
    chilly. The sky was flushed with rosy clouds, the forerunners
    of one of the most beautiful sunrises imaginable. The river
    itself is narrow and monotonous, the branches of the
    willow-tree on either bank almost sweeping the sides of the
    steamer. The centre channel is fairly deep; but we managed to
    run aground once, though we only drew nine feet, and in turning
    a sharp corner it was necessary to send a boat ashore with a
    rope, to pull the vessel's head round.</p>

    <p>At half-past six we reached the port of Tigr&eacute;, where
    we found many fine ships waiting for the tide, to go up the
    river. Some delay occurred while the passengers' luggage
    <span class="pagenum">Page 99<a name="Page_99"
       id="Page_99"></a></span>was being examined; but in about
       half an hour we were able to land and walk to the
       railway-station, through an avenue of shady trees, round the
       trunks of which the wistaria, now in full bloom, was
       climbing, and past several houses, whose pretty gardens were
       ablaze with all sorts of flowers. At the station I found a
       letter from Tom, telling me we were expected to breakfast at
       a quinta, not far from Buenos Ayres.</p>

    <p>For about an hour and a half the line ran through a rich and
    fertile country, quite the garden of Buenos Ayres, until we
    arrived at the station where we were to alight. Here Mr.
    Coghlan met us and drove us to his house, which is charmingly
    situated in the midst of a grove of olive-trees, formerly
    surrounding the palace of the viceroys. After breakfast the
    gardener cut us a fine bouquet of roses and violets, and we
    walked to the tramway, and were conveyed by one of the cars,
    smoothly and quickly, to the city. The contrast between this
    mode of travelling and riding in an ordinary carriage through
    the ill-paved streets is very striking. It is really less
    fatiguing to walk than to adopt the latter mode of conveyance,
    and I believe that, but for the look of the thing, most people
    would prefer to do so. How the vehicles themselves stand the
    jolting I cannot imagine, for they are all large and handsome,
    and must suffer tremendous strains.</p>

    <p>At noon we went with Mr. Coghlan to see the market and the
    museum, and to do some shopping. The market is a large open
    building, well supplied with everything at moderate prices;
    meat, game, fruit, vegetables, and flowers being especially
    cheap and good. House-rent and fine clothes&mdash;what Muriel
    would call 'dandy things'&mdash;are very dear in Buenos Ayres,
    but all the necessaries of life are certainly cheap. People of
    the middle and lower classes live much better here than they do
    at home, and the development of bone and muscle in large
    families of small children, owing to the constant use of so
    much meat and <span class="pagenum">Page 100<a name="Page_100"
       id="Page_100"></a></span> strong soup, is very remarkable.
       When once they have attained the age at which they can run
       about, children get on very well; but the climate, and the
       difficulty of obtaining a proper supply of milk in hot
       weather, often prove fatal to infants. It is very difficult
       to get good servants here, as they can easily obtain much
       higher pay in other capacities, and are very soon enabled to
       set up in business for themselves. Returning to the hotel,
       we collected our parcels and had some luncheon, and then
       proceeded to the pier, where we found the children waiting
       for us to embark in the gig, and we soon arrived safely on
       board the 'Sunbeam.'</p>

    <p>At about half-past six, Tom and Mabelle returned from their
    expedition to the largest and most comfortable estancia in the
    country, where they were received most hospitably, and enjoyed
    themselves very much.</p>

    <p>After dinner, some of our party left in the whale-boat,
    being anxious to be present at Madame Almazilia's benefit
    performance at the opera, for which I fear they arrived too
    late after all. Whilst we were waiting at the railway-station
    to-day, some of the bouquets, which were to be presented at the
    theatre to-night, arrived by train. The flowers were arranged
    in all manner of strange shapes and devices&mdash;full-sized
    tables and chairs, music-stands, and musical instruments, and
    many other quaint conceits, composed entirely of grey
    Neapolitan violets, marked out with camellias and other
    coloured flowers.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, September 24th</i>.&mdash;Most of us went ashore
    in the whale-boat at ten o'clock, to attend the English church,
    reopened to-day for the first time for some months. After our
    own service we met many friends, and walked to the Roman
    Catholic cathedral. The streets were full of well-appointed
    carriages, and in the interior of the building we found a great
    many well-dressed ladies, and a few men. Mass had not
    commenced, and a constant stream of worshippers was still
    entering; but we remained only for a short time, and then
    <span class="pagenum">Page 101<a name="Page_101"
       id="Page_101"></a></span>returned to the Mole. By this time
       the wind had freshened considerably, and several of our
       friends tried to persuade us to remain on shore; but as we
       knew Tom was expecting us, and we wanted to get the things
       we required for our next journey, we thought it better to go
       off.</p>

    <p>It took us two hours and a half, beating against the wind,
    to reach the yacht, sea-sick, and drenched to the skin.
    Directly we got outside the bar the sea was very bad, and each
    wave broke more or less over the little half-deck, under which
    the children had been packed away for shelter. Seeing how rough
    it was out at the anchorage&mdash;far worse than near the
    shore&mdash;Tom had quite given us up, for it was now half-past
    three, and was preparing to come ashore, bringing our things
    with him. On board the yacht we found an unfortunate French
    maid, and another servant, who had come off early in the
    morning to spend the day and have dinner with our people, but
    who were now lying prostrate and ill in the cabin.</p>

    <p>Champagne and luncheon revived us a little, and Tom hurried
    us off to get ashore again by daylight, before the weather
    became worse. It was a very pleasant twenty minutes' sail to
    the shore, racing along before the wind, with two reefs in the
    mainsail&mdash;quite a different thing from beating out. The
    tide was high, and the captain therefore steered for the pier,
    where he hoped to land us. Unfortunately, however, he missed
    it; and as it was impossible to make another tack out, all that
    could be done was to let go the anchor to save running ashore,
    and wait until they sent out a small boat to fetch us. This
    took some little time during which we pitched and tossed about
    in a very disagreeable fashion. When the boat did at last
    arrive she turned out to be a wretched little skiff, rowed by
    two men, with very indifferent oars, and only capable of taking
    three passengers at a time. Tom went first, taking with him the
    two children, and the two poor sea-sick maids, and the boat at
    once put off for the land, Tom steering.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 102<a name="Page_102"
       id="Page_102"></a></span>It was terrible to watch them from
       the whale-boat, and when one tremendous sea came, and the
       skiff broached to, I thought for a moment that all was over,
       as did every one who was watching our proceedings from the
       pier. I could not look any more, till I heard shouts that
       they were safe ashore. Then came our turn. The boat returned
       for us, this time provided with better oars, and we were
       soon landed in safety, if not in comfort; and a third and
       last trip brought ashore the rest of the party and the
       luggage, Tom remaining at the tiller.</p>

    <p>Mr. Coghlan had come down to meet us, but, seeing the peril
    of the first boat, had gone away until he heard we were all
    landed, and now returned to congratulate us on our narrow
    escape and present safety. After we had rested for a short time
    in the waiting-room, to recover from our fright and shake our
    dripping garments, we went to the H&ocirc;tel de la Paix, where
    we dined, and at ten o'clock we walked down to the
    railway-station, where a large number of people had already
    assembled, some of whom were to accompany us to Azul, while
    others had only come to see us off.</p>

    <p>Everything had been most comfortably arranged for us in the
    special train. The interior fittings of two second-class
    American carriages had been completely taken out, and a canvas
    lining, divided into compartments, each containing a cozy
    little bed, had been substituted. Wash-stands, looking-glasses,
    &amp;c., had been provided, and a profusion of beautiful
    flowers filled in every available spot. In a third car two
    tables, occupying its entire length, with seats on one side of
    each table, had been placed; and here it was intended that we
    should breakfast, lunch, and dine.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, September 25th</i>.&mdash;We slept
    soundly&mdash;speaking for the children and myself&mdash;until
    we were aroused at six o'clock this morning by the agreeable
    intelligence that we had reached our destination. Azul is about
    300 miles south of Buenos Ayres, on the Southern Railway. It is
    a <span class="pagenum">Page 103<a name="Page_103"
       id="Page_103"></a></span>small and primitive place in
       itself, but is situated in the midst of splendid pastures,
       both for rearing sheep and cattle, of which there are large
       flocks and herds.</p>

    <p>Whilst we were waiting for breakfast, we walked a little
    distance to see a troop of mares treading mud for bricks. It
    was a curious, but rather sad sight. Inside a circular
    enclosure, some fifty yards in diameter, about fifty
    half-starved animals, up to their houghs in very sloppy mud,
    were being driven round about, and up and down, as fast as they
    could go, by a mounted peon, assisted by five or six men on
    foot, outside the enclosure, armed with long heavy whips, which
    they used constantly. Some of the poor creatures had foals,
    which were tied up a little distance off, and which kept up a
    piteous whinnying, as an accompaniment to the lashings and
    crackings of the whips. On our way back to the station we saw a
    horse, attached to a light gig, bolt across the Pampas at full
    gallop, vainly pursued by a man on horseback. First one wheel
    came off and then the other; then the body of the gig was left
    behind, and then the shafts and most of the harness followed
    suit; until at last&mdash;as we afterwards heard&mdash;the
    runaway reached his home, about five miles off, with only his
    bridle remaining.</p>

    <p>At nine o'clock the breakfast-bell rang, and we found an
    excellent repast spread out for us on two long tables. An hour
    later we started in seven large carriages, and proceeded first
    to make the tour of the town, afterwards visiting the bank, and
    a fine new house in the course of construction by a native,
    built entirely of white marble from Italy. Then we paid a visit
    to some Indians&mdash;an old chief and his four wives, who have
    settled quietly down in a toldo near the town. They were not
    bad-looking, and appeared fairly comfortable, as they squatted
    in the open air round the fire, above which was suspended a
    large iron pot, containing, to judge by the look and smell, a
    most savoury preparation. We next went to a store, where we
    picked up a few curiosities, and then drove to the mill of
    Azul, a new <span class="pagenum">Page 104<a name="Page_104"
       id="Page_104"></a></span>establishment, of which the
       inhabitants of the town are evidently very proud. There is a
       pretty walk by the mill-stream, overhung with willows, and
       close by is another toldo, inhabited by more Indians.</p>

    <p>Leaving the town, we now proceeded about two leagues across
    the Pampas to Mr. Frer's estancia. He is a farmer, on a very
    extensive scale, and possesses about 24,000 sheep and 500
    horses, besides goodly herds of cattle. The locusts have not
    visited this part of the country, and the pastures are
    consequently in fine condition after the late rains, while the
    sheep look proportionately well. We passed a large
    <i>grasseria</i>, or place where sheep are killed at the rate
    of seven in a minute, and are skinned, cut up, and boiled down
    for tallow in an incredibly short space of time, the residue of
    the meat being used in the furnace as fuel. Running about
    loose, outside, were four or five curly-horned rams, between
    two of which a grand combat took place, apparently conducted in
    strict accordance with the rules of fighting etiquette. The two
    animals began by walking round and round, eyeing each other
    carefully, and <span class="pagenum">Page 105<a name="Page_105"
       id="Page_105"></a></span>then retiring backwards a certain
       distance, which might have been measured out for them, they
       stopped so exactly simultaneously. Then, gazing steadfastly
       at one another for a few moments, as if to take aim, they
       rushed forward with tremendous force, dashing their
       foreheads together with a crash that might have been heard a
       mile away. It seemed marvellous that they did not fracture
       their skulls, for they repeated the operation three or four
       times before Mr. Frer could get a man to help to stop the
       fight, when the two combatants were led off, in a very sulky
       state, to be locked up apart.</p>

    <p>Arrangements had been made for us to see as much of
    station-life as possible during our short visit. The peons'
    dinner had been put back, in order that we might witness their
    peculiar method of roasting, or rather baking, their food, and
    eating it; but we were rather later than was expected, and the
    men were so hungry that we were only able to see the end of the
    performance. Mr. Frer had also sent a long way across the
    Pampas for some wild horses, belonging to him, in order that we
    might see them lassoed; and Colonel Donovan had brought with
    him one of his best domidors, or horse-breakers, that we might
    have an opportunity of seeing an unbroken colt caught and
    backed for the first time.</p>

    <p>About a hundred horses were driven into a large corral, and
    several gauchos and peons, some on horseback and some on foot,
    exhibited their skill with the lasso, by catching certain of
    the animals, either by the fore leg, the hind leg, or the neck,
    as they galloped round and round at full speed. The captured
    animal got a tremendous fall in each case, and if the mounted
    horse was not very clever and active, he and his rider were
    very likely to be thrown down also. There was the risk too of
    the man receiving an injury from the lasso itself, if it should
    happen to get round his body, in which case he would probably
    be almost cut in half by the sudden jerk.</p>

       id="Page_106"></a></span></p>

    <p>The next proceeding was to cast a lasso at a <i>potro</i>,
    or unbroken colt, who was galloping about in the very centre of
    the troop, at full speed. His fore legs were caught dexterously
    in the noose, which brought him up, or rather down, instantly,
    head over heels. Another lasso was then thrown over his head,
    and drawn quite tight round his neck, and a bridle, composed of
    two or three thongs of raw hide, was forced into his mouth by
    means of a slip-knot rein. A sheepskin saddle was placed on his
    back, the man who was to ride him standing over him, with one
    foot already in the stirrup. All this time the poor horse was
    lying on the ground, with his legs tied close together,
    frightened almost out of his life, trembling in every limb, and
    perspiring from every pore. When the man was ready, the horse's
    legs were loosened sufficiently to allow him to rise, and he
    was then led outside the corral. The lassoes were suddenly
    withdrawn, and he dashed forwards, springing and plunging
    upwards, sideways, downwards, in every direction, in the vain
    effort to rid himself of his unaccustomed load. The man
    remained planted, like a rock, in the saddle,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 107<a name="Page_107"
       id="Page_107"></a></span>pulling hard at the bridle, while a
       second domidor, mounted on a tame horse, pursued the
       terrified animal, striking him with a cruel whip to make him
       go in the required direction. After about ten minutes of
       this severe exercise, the captive returned to the corral,
       exhausted, and perfectly cowed, and showing no desire to
       rejoin his late companions. In order to complete the process
       of breaking him in, we were told that it would be necessary
       to keep him tied up for two or three days, rather short of
       food, and to repeat daily the operation of saddling,
       bridling, and mounting, the difficulty being less on each
       occasion, until at last he would become as quiet as a
       lamb.</p>

    <p>We now saw our train approaching, orders having been given
    for it to come as far as it could from the station to meet us.
    We wished good-bye to Mr. Frer and his party, and, with many
    thanks to all, got into our carriages and drove across the
    plains to the railway. On our way we passed some large lagunes,
    full of wild fowl, and surrounded by scarlet flamingoes and
    pelicans. The ground we had to traverse was very boggy; so much
    so, that two of the carriages got stuck, and their occupants
    had to turn out and walk. At last we reached the train, and
    climbed into the cars, where we found an excellent luncheon
    prepared, which we ate whilst the train dashed along at the
    rate of forty miles an hour. About seven o'clock we stopped for
    tea and coffee, and the children were put to bed. By nine we
    had reached the junction for Buenos Ayres, where an engine met
    us, and took most of our party into the city, in one of the
    cars, while we went on to Punta Lara, the station for
    Ensenada.</p>

    <p>On arriving we were met by several of our men, who had been
    allowed to go ashore at Buenos Ayres on Sunday morning, and had
    not been able to rejoin the yacht since. On Sunday night, when
    they were to have returned, it was impossible for them to get
    off. Even the whale-boat was nearly dashed to pieces, at
    anchor, near the pier. They <span class="pagenum">Page
    108<a name="Page_108"
       id="Page_108"></a></span>spent the early part of Monday
       morning in hunting everywhere with the pilot for the lost
       steward, and at last left the shore just in time to see the
       yacht steaming down the river, with only half her crew on
       board, and without a pilot. It seems they had been waited
       for from eight o'clock until eleven; it then became
       necessary to get under way, for fear of losing the tide. As
       it was, the yacht had not been able to get near the pier at
       Ensenada, and was now lying in the river, two miles out. The
       station-master, having been informed of the state of
       affairs, very kindly had steam got up in the railway tug to
       take us off. The children, with their nurses, remained in
       bed in the car, which was shunted into a siding until the
       morning, the doctor staying on shore in charge. The rest of
       us then set out for the yacht, which we reached at 1 a.m.,
       only to be greeted with the pleasing intelligence that no
       fresh provisions had arrived on board for the party of
       friends we were expecting. The captain of the tug was good
       enough to promise to do what he could for us on shore; but
       everything is brought here from Buenos Ayres, and it is too
       late to telegraph for a supply. We cannot help fearing that
       something must have happened to our steward, for he has
       always been most steady and respectable hitherto, and I
       fancy Buenos Ayres is rather a wild place. Every inquiry is
       to be made, and I can only trust the morning may bring us
       some news.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, September 26th</i>.&mdash;The morning was fine,
    with a nice breeze, but the tide was so low that we should have
    been unable to get alongside the pier until ten o'clock, when
    Tom thought we should just miss our guests. It was therefore
    decided that it would be better to send the steam-tug to meet
    the special train, especially as, if we took the yacht in, it
    would be impossible to get out again in the middle of the
    night, when we had arranged to sail.</p>

    <p>The steam-tug came off early, bringing two sheep, half a
    bullock, and some wild ducks, much to the relief of the cook's
    mind; but there were no vegetables to be had on
    <span class="pagenum">Page 109<a name="Page_109"
       id="Page_109"></a></span>shore, and of course it was too
       late to send to Buenos Ayres for any. We had to do the best
       we could without them, therefore, and I really do not think
       any one knew of the dilemma we had been in, until they were
       told, at the end of the day. The servants all turned to and
       worked with a will; but it was rather a different matter
       from having a large luncheon party on board in the Thames,
       with our London servants and supplies to fall back upon.</p>

    <p>For our own part, I think we all felt that the comparative
    scarcity of meat this morning was an agreeable change, after
    our recent experiences. Animal food is so cheap and so good in
    this country that at every meal four or five dishes of beef or
    mutton, dressed in various ways, are provided. In the
    camp&mdash;as all the country round Buenos Ayres is
    called&mdash;people eat nothing but meat, either fresh or
    dried, and hardly any flour with it. Especially in the more
    distant estancias, beef and mutton, poultry and eggs, form the
    staple food of the inhabitants. Very little bread is eaten, and
    no vegetables, and an attempt is rarely made to cultivate a
    garden of any sort. This year, too, the ravages of the locusts
    have made vegetable food scarcer than ever, and it must now be
    looked upon quite as a luxury by very many people; for there
    can be little doubt that to live entirely on meat, even of the
    best quality, though probably strengthening, must be
    exceedingly monotonous.</p>

    <p>About one o'clock we saw the tug coming off again, this time
    with her decks crowded. We found she had brought us fifteen
    ladies and thirty gentlemen&mdash;more than we had expected, on
    account of the shortness of the notice we had been able to
    give. The luncheon was managed by dividing our guests into
    three parties, the coffee and dessert being served on deck; but
    I am afraid the last division got very hungry before their time
    arrived. It could not, however, be helped, and it is to be
    hoped that the examination of the various parts of the yacht
    and her contents <span class="pagenum">Page
    110<a name="Page_110"
       id="Page_110"></a></span>served to while away the time.
       Every one seemed to be pleased with the appearance of the
       vessel, never having seen one like her before. Indeed, the
       only yacht that has ever been here previously is the
       'Eothen,' which formerly belonged to us.</p>

    <p>Mr. St. John's servant brought me a most magnificent
    bouquet, composed entirely of violets, arranged in the shape of
    a basket, three feet in width, full of camellias, and marked
    with my initials in alyssum. Altogether it was quite a work of
    art, but almost overpoweringly sweet.</p>

    <p>It was late before our friends began the task of saying
    good-bye&mdash;no light matter where, as in the present case,
    it is doubtful whether, or at any rate when, we shall meet
    again. At last they left us, steaming round the yacht in the
    tug, and giving us some hearty cheers as they passed. The
    Minister's flag was run up, salutes were exchanged, and the
    little steamer rapidly started off in the direction of the
    shore, followed by a dense cloud of her own smoke. Through a
    telescope we watched our friends disembark at the pier, and saw
    the train steam away; and then we turned our thoughts to the
    arrangements for our own departure.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, September 27th</i>.&mdash;A fine breeze was
    blowing this morning, in a favourable direction for our start,
    but as ten and eleven o'clock arrived, and there were still no
    signs of the expected stores, Tom was in despair, and wanted to
    sail without them. I therefore volunteered to go ashore in the
    gig and see what had happened to them, and telegraph, if
    necessary, to Mr. Crabtree. Fortunately, we met the tug on our
    way, and returned in tow of her to the yacht. Then, after
    settling a few bills, and obtaining our bill of health, we got
    the anchor up, and proceeded down the river under sail. Between
    one and two o'clock we commenced steaming, and in the course of
    the evening were clear of the River Plate and fairly on our way
    to the Straits of Magellan.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, September 28th</i>,&mdash;A fine bright
    morning, with a strong, fair wind. The order to stop firing was
    given at noon, and we ceased steaming shortly after. There had
    evidently been a gale from the southward during the last few
    days, for the swell was tremendous, and not only made us all
    feel very uncomfortable after our long stay in harbour, but
    considerably diminished our speed. Still, we managed to go
    twenty-seven knots in two hours and a half.</p>

    <p>I was lying down, below, after breakfast, feeling very
    stupid, when Mabelle rushed into the cabin, saying, 'Papa says
    you are to come up on deck at once, to see the ship on fire.' I
    rushed up quickly, hardly knowing whether she referred to our
    own or some other vessel, and on reaching the deck I found
    everybody looking at a large barque, under full sail, flying
    the red union-jack upside down, and with signals in her
    rigging, which our signal-man read as 'Ship on fire.' These
    were lowered shortly afterwards, and the signals, 'Come on
    board at once,' hoisted in their place. Still we could see no
    appearance of smoke or flames, but we nevertheless hauled to
    the wind, tacked, hove to, and sent off a boat's crew, well
    armed, thinking it not impossible that a mutiny had taken place
    on board and that the <span class="pagenum">Page
    112<a name="Page_112"
       id="Page_112"></a></span>captain or officers, mistaking the
       yacht for a gunboat, had appealed to us for assistance. We
       were now near enough to the barque to make out her name
       through a glass&mdash;the 'Monkshaven,' of Whitby&mdash;and
       we observed a puff of smoke issue from her deck
       simultaneously with the arrival of our boat alongside. In
       the course of a few minutes, the boat returned, bringing the
       mate of the 'Monkshaven,' a fine-looking Norwegian, who
       spoke English perfectly, and who reported his ship to be
       sixty-eight days out from Swansea, bound for Valparaiso,
       with a cargo of smelting coal. The fire had first been
       discovered on the previous Sunday, and by 6 a.m. on Monday
       the crew had got up their clothes and provisions on deck,
       thrown overboard all articles of a combustible character,
       such as tar, oil, paint, spare spars and sails, planks, and
       rope, and battened down the hatches. Ever since then they
       had all been living on deck, with no protection from the
       wind and sea but a canvas screen. Tom and Captain Brown
       proceeded on board at once. They found the deck more than a
       foot deep in water, and all a-wash; when the hatches were
       opened for a moment dense <span class="pagenum">Page
       113<a name="Page_113"
       id="Page_113"></a></span>clouds of hot suffocating yellow
       smoke immediately poured forth, driving back all who stood
       near. From the captain's cabin came volumes of poisonous
       gas, which had found its way in through the crevices, and
       one man, who tried to enter, was rendered insensible.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

    <p>It was perfectly evident that it would be impossible to save
    the ship, and the captain therefore determined, after
    consultation with Tom and Captain Brown, to abandon her. Some
    of the crew were accordingly at once brought on board the
    'Sunbeam,' in our boat, which was then sent back to assist in
    removing the remainder, a portion of whom came in their own
    boat. The poor fellows were almost wild with joy at getting
    alongside another ship, after all the hardships they had gone
    through, and in their excitement they threw overboard many
    things which they might as well have kept, as they had taken
    the trouble to bring them. Our boat made three trips
    altogether, and by half-past six we had them all safe on board,
    with most of their effects, and the ship's chronometers,
    charts, and papers.</p>

    <p>The poor little dingy, belonging to the 'Monkshaven,' had
    been cast away as soon as the men had disembarked from her, and
    there was something melancholy in seeing her slowly drift away
    to leeward, followed by her oars and various small articles, as
    if to rejoin the noble ship she had so lately quitted. The
    latter was now hove-to, under full sail, an occasional puff of
    smoke alone betraying the presence of the demon of destruction
    within. The sky was dark and lowering, the sunset red and lurid
    in its grandeur, the clouds numerous and threatening, the sea
    high and dark, with occasional streaks of white foam. Not a
    breath of wind was stirring. Everything portended a gale. As we
    lay slowly rolling from side to side, both ship and boat were
    sometimes plainly visible, and then again both would disappear,
    for what seemed an age, in the deep trough of the South
    Atlantic rollers.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 114<a name="Page_114"
       id="Page_114"></a></span>For two hours we could see the
       smoke pouring from various portions of the ill-fated barque.
       Our men, who had brought off the last of her crew, reported
       that, as they left her, flames were just beginning to burst
       from the fore-hatchway; and it was therefore certain that
       the rescue had not taken place an hour too soon. Whilst we
       were at dinner, Powell called us up on deck to look at her
       again, when we found that she was blazing like a tar-barrel.
       The captain was anxious to stay by and see the last of her,
       but Tom was unwilling to incur the delay which this would
       have involved. We accordingly got up steam, and at nine p.m.
       steamed round the 'Monkshaven,' as close as it was deemed
       prudent to go. No flames were visible then; only dense
       volumes of smoke and sparks, issuing from the hatches. The
       heat, however, was intense, and could be plainly felt, even
       in the cold night air, as we passed some distance to
       leeward. All hands were clustered in our rigging, on the
       deck-house or on the bridge, to see the last of the poor
       'Monkshaven,' as she was slowly being burnt down to the
       water's edge.</p>

    <p>She was a large and nearly new (three years old) composite
    ship, built and found by her owners, Messrs. Smales, of Whitby,
    of 657 tons burden, and classed A 1 for ten years at Lloyd's.
    Her cargo, which consisted of coal for smelting purposes, was a
    very dangerous one; so much so that Messrs. Nicholas, of
    Sunderland, from whose mines the coal is procured, have great
    difficulty in chartering vessels to carry it, and are therefore
    in the habit of building and using their own ships for the
    purpose. At Buenos Ayres we were told that, of every three
    ships carrying this cargo round to Valparaiso or Callao, one
    catches fire, though the danger is frequently discovered in
    time to prevent much damage to the vessel or loss of life.</p>

    <p>The crew of the 'Monkshaven'&mdash;Danes, Norwegians,
    Swedes, Scotch, and Welsh&mdash;appear to be quiet, respectable
    men. This is fortunate, as an incursion of fifteen rough
    lawless spirits on board our little vessel would have
    <span class="pagenum">Page 115<a name="Page_115"
       id="Page_115"></a></span>been rather a serious matter. In
       their hurry and fright, however, they left all their
       provisions behind them, and it is no joke to have to provide
       food for fifteen extra hungry mouths for a week or ten days,
       with no shops at hand from which to replenish our stores.
       The sufficiency of the water supply, too, is a matter for
       serious consideration. We have all been put on
       half-allowance, and sea-water only is to be used for washing
       purposes.</p>

    <p>Some account of the disaster, as gathered from the lips of
    various members of the crew at different times, may perhaps be
    interesting. It seems that, early on Monday morning, the day
    following that on which the fire was discovered, another
    barque, the 'Robert Hinds,' of Liverpool, was spoken. The
    captain of that vessel offered to stand by them or do anything
    in his power to help them; but at that time they had a fair
    wind for Monte Video, only 120 miles distant, and they
    therefore determined to run for that port,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 116<a name="Page_116"
       id="Page_116"></a></span>and do their best to save the ship,
       and possibly some of the cargo. In the course of the night,
       however, a terrible gale sprang up, the same, no doubt, as
       the one of which we had felt the effects on first leaving
       the River Plate. They were driven hither and thither, the
       sea constantly breaking over them and sweeping the decks,
       though fortunately without washing any of them overboard.
       After forty-eight hours of this rough usage the men were all
       exhausted, while the fire was gradually increasing in
       strength beneath their feet, and they knew not at what
       moment it might burst through the decks and envelope the
       whole ship in flames. They were beginning to abandon all
       hope of a rescue, when a sail was suddenly discovered; and
       as soon as the necessary flags could be found, the same
       signal which attracted us was displayed. The vessel, now
       quite close to them, proved to be a large American steamer,
       but she merely hoisted her own ensign and code-pennant, and
       then coolly steamed away to the southward. 'I think that
       captain deserved tarring and feathering, anyway,' one of the
       men said to me. Another observed, 'I wonder what will become
       of that man; for we had put all our lives in his hand by
       signalling as we did; and every seaman knows that right
       well.' Another said, 'When we saw that ship go away, we all
       gave in and lay down in despair to die. But our captain, who
       is very good to his crew, and a religious man too, said,
       "There is One above who looks after us all." That was true
       enough, for, about ten minutes afterwards, as I was talking
       to the cook, and telling him it was all over with us, I saw
       a sail to leeward, and informed the captain. We bore down a
       little, but did not like to go out of our course too much,
       fearing you might be a "Portuguese," and play us the same
       trick as the American.' (They could not understand our white
       ensign; for, our funnel being stowed, we looked like a
       sailing vessel, while all gunboats of our size are
       steamers.) 'When we saw it was an English vessel, and that
       you answered our signals and sent a boat off, we were indeed
       <span class="pagenum">Page 117<a name="Page_117"
       id="Page_117"></a></span>thankful; though that was nothing
       to what we feel now at once more having a really dry ship
       under our feet. Not that we have really suffered anything
       very terrible, for we had a bit of shelter, and plenty to
       eat, and the worst part was seeing our things washed
       overboard, and thinking perhaps we might go next. We have
       not had a dry deck since we left Swansea, and the pumps have
       been kept going most of the time. Why, with this sea, ma'am,
       our decks would be under water.' (This surprised me; as,
       though low in the water, the 'Monkshaven' did not appear to
       be overladen, and the Plimsoll mark was plainly visible.)
       'Our boats were all ready for launching, but we had no
       sails, and only one rudder for the three; so we should have
       had hard work to fetch anywhere if we had taken to them. We
       lashed the two boys&mdash;apprentices, fourteen and sixteen
       years old&mdash;in one of the boats, for fear they should be
       washed overboard. The youngest of them is the only son of
       his mother, a widow; and you could see how she loved him by
       the way she had made his clothes, and fitted him out all
       through. He was altogether too well found for a ship like
       ours, but now most of his things are lost. His chest could
       not be got up from below, and though I borrowed an old
       bread-bag from the steward, it was not half big enough, and
       his sea-boots and things his mother had given him to keep
       him dry and cover his bed&mdash;not oilskins, like
       ours.'&mdash;'Mackintoshes,' I suggested.&mdash;'Yes, that's
       the name&mdash;they were all lost. It did seem a pity. The
       boy never thought there was much danger till this morning,
       when I told him all hope was gone, as the American ship had
       sailed away from us. He said, "Will the ship go to the
       bottom?" and I replied, "I fear so; but we have good boats,
       so keep up your heart, little man." He made no further
       remark, but laid down gently again, and cried a little.'</p>

    <p>This poor child was dreadfully frightened in the small boat
    coming alongside, and his look of joy and relief, when
    <span class="pagenum">Page 118<a name="Page_118"
       id="Page_118"></a></span>once he got safely on board, was a
       treat to me. Every one on board, including the captain,
       seems to have been very kind to him. One of the men had his
       foot broken by the sea, and the captain himself had his leg
       severely injured; so the Doctor has some cases at last.</p>

    <p>It was almost impossible to sleep during the night, owing to
    the heavy rolling, by far the most violent that we have yet
    experienced.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, September 29th</i>.&mdash;Again a fine morning. A
    fair breeze sprang up, and, the dreaded storm having apparently
    passed over, we ceased steaming at 6 a.m.</p>

    <p>All on board are now settling down into something like
    order. The stewards are arranging matters below, and measuring
    out the stores, to allowance the men for twelve days. The men
    belonging respectively to the port and starboard watches of the
    'Monkshaven' have been placed in the corresponding watches on
    board the 'Sunbeam.' The cook and steward are assisting ours
    below, and the two boys are very happy, helping in the kitchen,
    and making themselves generally useful. The deck does not look
    quite as neat as usual. Such of the men's sea-chests as have
    been saved are lashed round the steam-chest, so that they can
    be got at easily, while their bags and other odd things have
    been stowed on deck, wherever they can be kept dry; for every
    inch of available space below is occupied. Captain Runciman is
    writing, with tears in his eyes, the account of the loss of his
    fine ship. He tells me that he tried in vain to save sixty
    pounds' worth of his own private charts from his cabin, but it
    was impossible, on account of the stifling atmosphere, which
    nearly overpowered him. Fortunately, all his things are
    insured. He drowned his favourite dog, a splendid Newfoundland,
    just before leaving the ship; for, although a capital
    watch-dog, and very faithful, he was rather large and fierce;
    and when it was known that the 'Sunbeam' was a yacht, with
    ladies and children on board, he feared to introduce him. Poor
    <span class="pagenum">Page 119<a name="Page_119"
       id="Page_119"></a></span>fellow! I wish I had known about it
       in time to save his life!</p>

    <p>The great danger of smelting coal, as a ship's cargo,
    besides its special liability to spontaneous combustion,
    appears to be that the fire may smoulder in the very centre of
    the mass for so long that, when the smoke is at last
    discovered, it is impossible to know how far the mischief has
    advanced. It may go on smouldering quietly for days, or at any
    moment the gas that has been generated may burst up the
    vessel's decks from end to end, without the slightest warning.
    Or it may burn downwards, and penetrate some portion of the
    side of the ship below water; so that, before any suspicion has
    been aroused, the water rushes in, and the unfortunate ship and
    her crew go to the bottom. On board the 'Monkshaven' the men
    dug down into the cargo in many places on Sunday night, only to
    find that the heat became more intense the deeper they went;
    and several of them had their hands or fingers burnt in the
    operation.</p>

    <p>This has been about the best day for sailing that we have
    had since we left the tropics. The sea has been smooth, and a
    fair breeze has taken us steadily along at the rate of nine
    knots an hour. The sun shone brightly beneath a blue sky, and
    the temperature is delightful. The sunset was grand, though the
    sky looked threatening; but the moon rose brilliantly, and
    until we went to bed, at ten o'clock, the evening was as
    perfect as the day had been. At midnight, however, Tom and I
    were awakened by a knock at our cabin door, and the gruff voice
    of Powell, saying: 'The barometer's going down very fast,
    please, sir, and it's lightning awful in the sou'-west. There's
    a heavy storm coming up.' We were soon on deck, where we found
    all hands busily engaged in preparing for the tempest. Around
    us a splendid sight presented itself. On one side a heavy bank
    of black clouds could be seen rapidly approaching, while the
    rest of the heavens were brilliantly illuminated by forked and
    sheet lightning, the thunder <span class="pagenum">Page
    120<a name="Page_120"
       id="Page_120"></a></span> meanwhile rolling and rattling
       without intermission. An ominous calm followed, during which
       the men had barely time to lower all the sails on deck,
       without waiting to stow them, the foresail and jib only
       being left standing, when the squall struck us, not very
       severely, but with a blast as hot as that from a furnace. We
       thought worse was coming, and continued our preparations;
       but the storm passed rapidly away to windward, and was
       succeeded by torrents of rain, so that it was evident we
       could only have had quite the tail of it.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, September 30th</i>.&mdash;The morning broke
    bright and clear, and was followed by a calm, bright, sunny
    day, of which I availed myself to take some photographs of the
    captain and crew of the 'Monkshaven.' The wind failed us
    entirely in the afternoon, and it became necessary to get up
    steam. In the ordinary course of things, we should probably
    have had sufficient patience to wait for the return of the
    breeze; but the recent large addition to our party made it
    desirable for us to lose as little time as possible in reaching
    Sandy Point. Another grand but wild-looking sunset seemed like
    the precursor of a storm; but we experienced nothing worse than
    a sharp squall of hot wind, accompanied by thunder and
    lightning.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, October 1st</i>.&mdash;A fine morning, with a
    fair wind. At eleven we had a short service, at four a longer
    one, with an excellent sermon from Tom, specially adapted to
    the rescue of the crew of the burning ship. As usual, the
    sunset, which was magnificent, was succeeded by a slight storm,
    which passed over without doing us any harm.</p>

    <p>I have said that it was found impossible to save any
    provisions from the 'Monkshaven.' As far as the men are
    concerned, I think this is hardly to be regretted, for I am
    told that the salt beef with which they were supplied had lain
    in pickle for so many years that the saltpetre had eaten all
    the nourishment out of it, and had made it so hard that the
    men, instead of eating it, used to amuse themselves by carving
    it into snuff-boxes, little models of ships, &amp;c. I
    <span class="pagenum">Page 121<a name="Page_121"
       id="Page_121"></a></span> should not, however, omit to
       mention that Captain Runciman managed to bring away with him
       four excellent York hams, which he presented to us, and one
       of which we had to-day at dinner.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, October 4th</i>.&mdash;At 6 a.m., on going on
    deck I found we were hove-to under steam and closely-reefed
    sails, a heavy gale blowing from the south-west, right ahead.
    The screw was racing round in the air every time we encountered
    an unusually big wave; the spray was dashing over the vessel,
    and the water was rushing along the deck&mdash;altogether an
    uncomfortable morning. As the sun rose, the gale abated, and in
    the course of the day the reefs were shaken out of the sails,
    one by one, until, by sunset, we were once more under whole
    canvas, beating to windward. There were several cries of 'land
    ahead' during the day, but in each case a closer examination,
    through a glass, proved that the fancied coast-line or
    mountain-top existed only in cloud-land.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, October 5th</i>.&mdash;We made the land early,
    and most uninteresting it looked, consisting, as it did, of a
    low sandy shore, with a background of light clay-coloured
    cliffs. Not a vestige of vegetation was anywhere to be seen,
    and I am quite at a loss to imagine what the guanacos and
    ostriches, with which the chart tells us the country hereabouts
    abounds, find to live upon. About twelve o'clock we made Cape
    Virgins, looking very like Berry Head to the north of Torbay,
    and a long spit of low sandy land, stretching out to the
    southward, appropriately called Dungeness.</p>

    <p>Some of the charts brought on board by Captain Runciman were
    published by Messrs. Imray, of London, and in one of them it is
    represented that a fine fixed light has been established on
    Cape Virgins<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
       id="FNanchor_2_2">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_2_2"
       class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This we knew to be an
       <span class="pagenum">Page 122<a name="Page_122"
       id="Page_122"></a></span>impossibility, not only on account
       of the general character of the country, but because no
       indication is given of the light in our newest Admiralty
       charts. Captain Runciman, however, had more confidence in
       the correctness of his own chart, and could hardly believe
       his eyes when he saw that the light really had no existence
       on the bare bleak headland. His faith was terribly shaken,
       and I hope he will not omit to call Messrs. Imray's
       attention to the matter on his return home; for the mistake
       is most serious, and one which might lead to the destruction
       of many a good ship.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_2_2"
           id="Footnote_2_2"></a>
           <a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
           I have since received a letter from Messrs. Imray
           requesting me to state that the light was inserted on
           erroneous information from the hydrographic office at
           Washington, and has since been erased from their
           charts.</p>
    </div>

    <p>About two o'clock we saw in the far distance what looked at
    first like an island, and then like smoke, but gradually shaped
    itself into the masts, funnel, and hull of a large steamer.
    From her rig we at once guessed her to be the Pacific Company's
    mail boat, homeward bound. When near enough, we accordingly
    hoisted our number, and signalled 'We wish to communicate,'
    whereupon she bore down upon us and ceased steaming. We then
    rounded up under her lee and lowered a boat, and Tom, Mabelle,
    and I, with Captain Runciman and four or five of the
    shipwrecked crew, went on board. Our advent caused great
    excitement, and seamen and passengers all crowded into the bows
    to watch us. As we approached the ladder the passengers ran
    aft, and directly we reached the deck the captain took
    possession of Tom, the first and second officers of Mabelle and
    myself, while Captain Runciman and each of his crew were
    surrounded by a little audience eager to know what had
    happened, and all about it. At first it was thought that we all
    wanted a passage, but when we explained matters Captain Thomas,
    the commander of the 'Illimani,' very kindly undertook to
    receive all our refugees and convey them to England. We
    therefore sent the gig back for the rest of the men and the
    chests of the whole party, and then availed ourselves of the
    opportunity afforded by the delay to walk round the ship. It
    was most amusing to see the interest with which we were
    <span class="pagenum">Page 123<a name="Page_123"
       id="Page_123"></a></span>regarded by all on board.
       Passengers who had never been seen out of their berths since
       leaving Valparaiso, and others who were indulging, at the
       time of our visit, in the luxury of a 'day sleep,' between
       the twelve o'clock luncheon and four o'clock dinner,
       suddenly made their appearance, in dressing-gowns and wraps,
       with dishevelled hair and wide-opened eyes, gazing in mute
       astonishment at us, quite unable to account for our
       mysterious arrival on board in this out-of-the-way spot. A
       mail steamer does not stop for a light cause, and it was
       therefore evident to them that the present was no ordinary
       occurrence. The captain told us that the last time he passed
       through the Straits he picked up two boats' crews, who had
       escaped from a burning ship, and who had suffered
       indescribable hardships before they were rescued.</p>

    <p>Captain Runciman is convinced, after comparing notes with
    the chief officer of the 'Illimani,' that the vessel which
    refused to notice his signal of distress was the 'Wilmington,'
    sent down from New York, with a party of forty wreckers, to try
    and get the steamer 'Georgia' off the rocks near Port Famine,
    in the Straits of Magellan. If this be so, it is the more
    surprising that no attempt was made to render assistance to the
    'Monkshaven,' provided her signals were understood, as the
    'Wilmington' had plenty of spare hands, and could not have been
    in a particular hurry. Moreover, one would think that, with her
    powerful engines, she might have made an attempt to tow the
    distressed vessel into Monte Video, and so secure three or four
    thousand pounds of salvage money.</p>

    <p>The captain of the 'Illimani' kindly gave us half a bullock,
    killed this morning, a dozen live ducks and chickens, and the
    latest newspapers. Thus supplied with food for body and mind,
    we said farewell, and returned to the 'Sunbeam;' our ensigns
    were duly dipped, we steamed away on our respective courses,
    and in less than an hour we were out of sight of each other. It
    is a sudden change <span class="pagenum">Page
    124<a name="Page_124"
       id="Page_124"></a></span>for the 'Monkshaven' men, who were
       all very reluctant to leave the yacht. Many of them broke
       down at the last moment, particularly when it came to saying
       good-bye to Tom and me, at the gangway of the steamer. They
       had seemed thoroughly to appreciate any kindnesses they
       received while with us, and were anxious to show their
       gratitude in every possible way. The two boys, especially,
       were in great grief at their departure, and were very loth
       to part with their boatswain, who remains with us to make up
       our complement<a name="FNanchor_3_3"

           After our return to England the following letter reached
           us from Messrs. Smales:&mdash;</p>

        <p class="author">'Whitby, June 30th, 1877.</p>

        <p>'THOMAS BRASSEY, Esq.</p>

        <p>'DEAR SIR,&mdash;Observing by the newspapers that you
        have returned home after your cruise, we take this
        opportunity of thanking you most heartily for the valuable
        assistance you rendered to the crew of our late barque
        "Monkshaven," in lat. 43 28 S., lon. 62 21 W., after she
        proved to be on fire and beyond saving. Your kind favour of
        October 1 last duly reached us, and it was very
        satisfactory to know from an authority like your own, that
        all was done under the trying circumstances that was
        possible, to save the ship and cargo. The inconvenience of
        having so many extra hands for the time on board your
        vessel, must have tried your resources; but you will be
        probably aware that the Board of Trade willingly compensate
        for loss sustained in rescuing a crew, when a claim is
        made. You will be glad to learn that the master and crew
        arrived all well, in due course, at Liverpool, by the
        "Illimani," and were very grateful for your kindness to
        them. Our ill-fated vessel must have sunk very soon after
        you took off the crew, as nothing more has been heard of
        her, and it was a most fortunate circumstance that you were
        so near at hand, more especially as the captain reported to
        us, that a vessel carrying the American colours took no
        notice of his signal of distress. As shipowners, we
        generally find that our own countrymen are more heroic, and
        always ready to lend a helping hand to brother mariners in
        distress, so that, as you say, we do not doubt you
        experienced some satisfaction in rendering this
        service.&mdash;Trusting that you have enjoyed your trip, we
        beg to remain yours, truly obliged,</p>

        <p class="author">'SMALES Brothers.'</p>
    </div>

    <p>About 8 p.m. we anchored for the night in Possession Bay. It
    was thick at sunset, but afterwards clear and cold, with a
    splendid moon.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, October 6th</i>.&mdash;We got under way at 5.30
    a.m., and steamed past the low sandy coast of Patagonia and the
    rugged mountains of Tierra del Fuego, and through the First and
    Second Narrows, to Cape Negro, where the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 125<a name="Page_125"
       id="Page_125"></a></span>character of the scenery began to
       improve a little, the vegetation gradually changing from low
       scrubby brushwood to respectable-sized trees. When passing
       between Elizabeth Island, so named by Sir Francis Drake, and
       the island of Santa Madalena, we looked in vain for the
       myriads of seals, otters, and sea-lions with which this
       portion of the Straits is said to abound; but we saw only
       seven or eight little black spots on the shore, in the
       distance, which disappeared into the sea as we
       approached.</p>

    <p>At 3 p.m. we reached Sandy Point, the only civilised place
    in the Straits. It is a Chilian settlement, and a large convict
    establishment has been formed here by the Government. Almost
    before we had dropped our anchor, the harbour-master came on
    board, closely followed by the officers of the two Chilian
    men-of-war lying in the harbour. The rain, which had been
    threatening all day, now descended in torrents, and we landed
    in a perfect downpour. We thought the pier at Buenos Ayres
    unsafe and rickety, but here matters were still worse, for the
    head of the structure had been completely washed away by a
    gale, and no little care was necessary in order to step across
    the broken timbers in safety. The town, which contains between
    1,200 and 1,300 inhabitants, is composed entirely of
    one-storied log huts, with slate or tile roofs, and with or
    without verandahs. They are all arranged in squares, separated
    from each other by wide roads; and the whole settlement is
    surrounded by stockades. At the further end of the town stands
    the convict prison, distinguished by its tower, and the
    Governor's house, which, though built of wood, is the most
    pretentious-looking edifice in the place. There is a nice
    little church close by, and some tidy-looking barracks.</p>

    <p>We went straight to the house of the British Vice-Consul,
    who received us very kindly, and promised to do what he could
    to assist us in obtaining supplies; but the resources of the
    place are limited, and eggs, ship's beef
    <span class="pagenum">Page 126<a name="Page_126"
       id="Page_126"></a></span>and biscuits, and water, will, I
       expect, be the sum total of what we shall be able to
       procure. In fact, it is rather doubtful whether we shall
       even be able to renew our stock of coal. In the meantime we
       started off to potter about the town, finding, however, very
       little to amuse us. There were some new-laid ostrich eggs to
       be bought, and some queer-looking worked Patagonian
       saddle-bags.</p>

    <p>I fear we shall not see any of the Patagonians themselves,
    for they come to the colony only three or four times a year, to
    purchase supplies, and to sell skins and ostrich eggs. They are
    a mounted tribe of Indians, living on the northern plains, and
    are now on their way down here, to pay one of their periodical
    visits; but, being encumbered with their families, they move
    very slowly, and are not expected to arrive for another ten
    days. They will no doubt bring a splendid supply of skins, just
    too late for us, which is rather disappointing, particularly as
    we are not likely to have another opportunity of meeting with
    them at any of the places we touch at. They live so far in the
    interior of the country that they very seldom visit the
    coast.</p>

    <p>We went to see three Fuegian females, who are living in a
    house belonging to the medical officer of the colony. They were
    picked up a short time since by a passing steamer from a canoe,
    in which they had evidently sought refuge from some kind of
    cruelty or oppression. The biggest of them, a stout
    fine-looking woman, had a terrible gash in her leg, quite
    recently inflicted, and the youngest was not more than eight
    years old. They appeared cheerful and happy, but we were told
    that they are not likely to live long. After the free life and
    the exposure to which they have been accustomed,
    civilisation&mdash;in the shape of clothing and hot
    houses&mdash;almost always kills them. Their lungs become
    diseased, and they die miserably. Their skin is slightly
    copper-coloured, their complexions high-coloured, their hair
    thick and black; and, though certainly not handsome,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 127<a name="Page_127"
       id="Page_127"></a></span>they are by no means so repulsive
       as I had expected from the descriptions of Cook, Dampier,
       Darwin, and other more recent travellers.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, October 7th</i>.&mdash;My birthday. Tom gave me
    a beautiful guanaco-skin robe, and the children presented me
    with two ostrich rugs. The guanaco is a kind of large deer, and
    it is said that the robes made from its skin are the warmest in
    the world. People here assure me that, with the hair turned
    inside, these robes have afforded them sufficient protection to
    enable them to sleep in comfort in the open air, exposed to
    snow, frost, and rain. They are made from the skin of the young
    fawns, killed before they are thirteen days old, or, better
    still, from the skins of those which have never had an
    independent existence. In colour, the animals are a yellowish
    brown on the back, and white underneath, and they are so small
    that when each skin is split up it produces only two triangular
    patches, about the size of one's hand. A number of these are
    then, with infinite trouble, sewed neatly together by the
    Indian women, who use the fine leg-sinews of the ostrich as
    thread. Those worn by the caciques, or chiefs, have generally a
    pattern in the centre, a brown edging, and spots
    <span class="pagenum">Page 128<a name="Page_128"
       id="Page_128"></a></span> of red and blue paint on the part
       which is worn outwards. Such robes are particularly
       difficult to obtain, on account of the labour and time
       necessary to produce them. Each cacique keeps several wives
       constantly employed in making them, of the best as well as
       of the ordinary description. The ostrich rugs, which are
       made here, are more ornamental, though not so warm and light
       as the guanaco robes. They are made of the entire skin of
       the ostrich, from which the long wing-feathers have been
       pulled out. Mabelle has been given a beautiful little rug
       composed of the skins of thirty little ostriches, all from
       one nest, killed when they were a fortnight old, each skin
       resembling a prettily marked ball of fluff.</p>

    <p>At eleven o'clock we went ashore. The Governor had kindly
    provided horses for all the party, and while they were being
    saddled I took some photographs. There are plenty of horses
    here, but the only saddles and bridles to be had are those used
    by the natives. The saddles are very cumbrous and clumsy to
    look at, though rather picturesque. They are formed of two bits
    of wood, covered with about a dozen sheepskins and ponchos; not
    at all uncomfortable to ride in, and very suitable for a
    night's bivouac in the open. 'Plenty of nice soft rugs to lie
    upon and cover yourself with, instead of a hard English saddle
    for your bed and stirrups for blankets,' as a native once said,
    when asked which he preferred. About one o'clock we started,
    accompanied by the officers commanding the garrison and two
    attendant cavaliers, equipped in Chilian style, with enormous
    carved modern stirrups, heavy bits and spurs much bigger than
    those whose size struck us so much in the Argentine Republic.
    We had a pleasant ride, first across a sandy plain and through
    one or two small rivers, to a saw-mill, situated on the edge of
    an extensive forest, through which we proceeded for some miles.
    The road was a difficult one, and our progress was but slow,
    being often impeded by a morass or by the trunk of a tree which
    had <span class="pagenum">Page 129<a name="Page_129"
       id="Page_129"></a></span>fallen right across the path, and
       was now rapidly rotting into touchwood under the influence
       of the damp atmosphere and incessant rain. Lichens of every
       colour and shape abounded, and clothed the trunks
       gracefully, contrasting with the tender spring tints of the
       leaves, while the long hairy tillandsia, like an old man's
       beard, three or four feet long, hung down from the topmost
       branches. The ground was carpeted with moss, interspersed
       with a few early spring flowers, and the whole scene, though
       utterly unlike that presented by any English forest, had a
       strange weird beauty of its own. Not a sound could be heard;
       not a bird, beast, or insect was to be seen. The larger
       trees were principally a peculiar sort of beech and red
       cedar, but all kinds of evergreens, known to us at home as
       shrubs, such as laurestine, and various firs, here attain
       the proportions of forest-trees. There is also a tree called
       Winter's Bark (<i>Drimys Winteri</i>), the leaves and bark
       of which are hot and bitter, and form an excellent
       substitute for quinine. But the most striking objects were
       the evergreen berberis and mahonia, and the Darwinia, the
       larger sort of which was covered with brilliant orange,
       almost scarlet, flowers, which hung down in bunches, of the
       shape and size of small outdoor grapes.</p>

    <p>On our way back we took a sharp turn leading to the
    sea-shore, to which the forest extends in places, and rode
    along the beach towards the town. It was low water, or this
    would not have been possible, and as it was, we often had
    considerable difficulty in making our way between wood and
    water. The day was bright and clear, with a bitterly cold wind
    and occasional heavy showers of rain; a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 130<a name="Page_130"
       id="Page_130"></a></span>fair average day for Sandy Point.
       It is further west, they say, that the weather is so
       hopeless. Lieutenant Byron, in his terribly interesting
       account of the wreck of the 'Wager,' says that one fine day
       in three months is the most that can be expected. I wonder,
       not without misgivings, if we really shall encounter all the
       bad weather we not only read of but hear of from every one
       we meet. Though very anxious to see the celebrated Straits,
       I shall not be sorry when we are safely through, and I trust
       that the passage may not occupy the whole of the three weeks
       which Tom has been advised to allow for it.</p>

    <p>We saw a few sea-birds, specially some 'steamer-ducks,' so
    called from their peculiar mode of progression through the
    water. They neither swim nor fly, but use their wings like the
    paddles of a steamer, with a great noise and splutter, and go
    along very fast. On reaching the plains we had an opportunity
    of testing the speed of our horses, which warmed us up a little
    after our slow progress by the water's edge in the bitter wind.
    We rode all round the stockades, outside the town, before
    dismounting; but I saw nothing of special interest. Before the
    party broke up, arrangements were made for us to go to morrow
    to one of the Government corrals, to see the cattle lassoed and
    branded&mdash;an operation which is always performed twice a
    year.</p>

    <p>We reached the yacht again at half-past five. Dr. Fenton
    came on board to dinner, and from him we heard a great deal
    about the colony, the Patagonians or Horse Indians, and the
    Fuegians or Canoe Indians. The former inhabit, or rather roam
    over, a vast tract of country. They are almost constantly on
    horseback, and their only shelter consists of toldos, or tents,
    made of the skins of the old guanacos, stretched across a few
    poles. They are tall and strong, averaging six feet in height,
    and are bulky in proportion; but their size is nothing like so
    great as old travellers have represented. Both men and women
    wear a long flowing mantle of skins, <span class="pagenum">Page
    131<a name="Page_131"
       id="Page_131"></a></span>reaching from the waist to the
       ankle, with a large loose piece hanging down on one side,
       ready to be thrown over their heads whenever necessary,
       which is fastened by a large flat pin hammered out either
       from the rough silver or from a dollar. This, their sole
       garment, has the effect of adding greatly in appearance to
       their height. They never wash, but daub their bodies with
       paint and grease, especially the women. Their only weapons
       are knives and bolas, the latter of which they throw with
       unerring precision. During their visits to the Sandy Point
       settlement their arms are always taken from them, for they
       are extremely quarrelsome, particularly when drunk. Nobody
       has been able to ascertain that they possess any form of
       sacred belief, or that they perform any religious
       ceremonies. Their food consists principally of the flesh of
       mares, troops of which animals always accompany them on
       their excursions. They also eat ostrich-flesh, which is
       considered a great delicacy, as well as the fish the women
       catch, and the birds' eggs they find. Vegetable food is
       almost unknown to them, and bread is never used, though they
       do sometimes purchase a little flour, rice, and a few
       biscuits, on the occasion of their visits to the colony.</p>

    <p>The Fuegians, or Canoe Indians, as they are generally
    called, from their living so much on the water, and having no
    settled habitations on shore, are a much smaller race of
    savages, inhabiting Tierra del Fuego&mdash;literally Land of
    Fire&mdash;so called from the custom the inhabitants have of
    lighting fires on prominent points as signals of assembly.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 132<a name="Page_132"
       id="Page_132"></a></span>The English residents here
       invariably call it Fireland&mdash;a name I had never heard
       before, and which rather puzzled me at first. Whenever it is
       observed that a ship is in distress, or that shipwrecked
       mariners have been cast ashore, the signal-fires appear as
       if by magic, and the natives flock together like vultures
       round a carcase. On the other hand, if all goes well,
       vessels often pass through the Straits without seeing a
       single human being, the savages and their canoes lying
       concealed beneath the overhanging branches of trees on the
       shore. They are cannibals, and are placed by Darwin in the
       lowest scale of humanity. An old author describes them as
       'magpies in chatter, baboons in countenance, and imps in
       treachery.' Those frequenting the eastern end of the Straits
       wear&mdash;if they wear anything at all&mdash;a deerskin
       mantle, descending to the waist: those at the western end
       wear cloaks made from the skin of the sea-otter. But most of
       them are quite naked. Their food is of the most meagre
       description, and consists mainly of shell-fish, sea-eggs,
       for which the women dive with much dexterity, and fish,
       which they train their dogs to assist them in catching.
       These dogs are sent into the water at the entrance to a
       narrow creek or small bay, and they then bark and flounder
       about and drive the fish before them into shallow water,
       where they are caught.</p>

    <p>Bishop Stirling, of the Falkland Islands, has been cruising
    about these parts in a small schooner, and visiting the
    natives, for the last twelve years, and the Governor here tells
    us that he has done much good in promoting
    <span class="pagenum">Page 133<a name="Page_133"
       id="Page_133"></a></span>their civilisation; while the
       hardships he has endured, and the difficulties and dangers
       he has surmounted, have required almost superhuman energy
       and fortitude on his part. The Fuegians, as far as is known,
       have no religion of their own.</p>

    <p>The 'Wilmington' came in this morning. Her captain declares
    that as the 'Monkshaven' was not hove-to, he never thought that
    there could be anything seriously amiss with her. His glass was
    not good enough to enable him to make out the union-jack
    reversed, or the signal of distress, which he therefore
    supposed to be merely the ship's number. It was satisfactory to
    hear this explanation; and as not only the interests of
    humanity, but his own, were involved, there is every reason to
    believe that his account of the transaction is perfectly
    true.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, October 8th</i>.&mdash;At 6 a.m. we weighed
    anchor, and proceeded on our voyage. At first there was not
    much to admire in the way of scenery, the shores being low and
    sandy, with occasional patches of scrubby brushwood, and a
    background of granite rocks and mountains.</p>

    <p>Soon after passing Port Famine we saw the bold outline of
    Cape Froward, the southernmost point of South America,
    stretching into the Straits. It is a fine headland, and Tom
    ordered the engines to be stopped in order to enable Mr.
    Bingham to sketch, and me to photograph, both it and the
    splendid view back through the channel we had just traversed to
    the snowy range of mountains in the distance, crowned by Mount
    Sarmiento, not unlike the Matterhorn in appearance.</p>

    <p>At this point the weather generally changes, and I suppose
    we must look forward to living in mackintoshes for some little
    time to come.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, when in English Reach, where many vessels
    have been lost, great excitement was caused on board by the
    appearance of a canoe on our port bow. She was stealing out
    from the Barbara Channel, and as she appeared to be making
    direct for us, Tom ordered the <span class="pagenum">Page
    135<a name="Page_135"
       id="Page_135"></a></span>engines to be slowed. Her occupants
       thereupon redoubled their efforts, and came paddling towards
       us, shouting and making the most frantic gesticulations, one
       man waving a skin round his head with an amount of energy
       that threatened to upset the canoe. This frail craft, upon a
       nearer inspection, proved to be made only of rough planks,
       rudely tied together with the sinews of animals; in fact,
       one of the party had to bale constantly, in order to keep
       her afloat. We flung them a rope, and they came alongside,
       shouting 'Tab&aacute;co, gall&eacute;ta' (biscuit), a supply
       of which we threw down to them, in exchange for the skins
       they had been waving; whereupon the two men stripped
       themselves of the skin mantles they were wearing, made of
       eight or ten sea-otter skins sewed together with finer
       sinews than those used for the boat, and handed them up,
       clamouring <span class="pagenum">Page 136<a name="Page_136"
       id="Page_136"></a></span>for more tobacco, which we gave
       them, together with some beads and
       knives<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
       id="FNanchor_4_4">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_4_4"
       class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Finally, the woman, influenced by
       this example, parted with her sole garment, in return for a
       little more tobacco, some beads, and some looking-glasses I
       had thrown into the canoe.</p>

           These skins proved to be the very finest quality ever
           plucked, and each separate skin was valued in England at
           from 4<i>l</i>. to 5<i>l</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The party consisted of a man, a woman, and a lad; and I
    think I never saw delight more strongly depicted than it was on
    the faces of the two latter, when they handled, for the first
    time in their lives probably, some strings of blue, red, and
    green glass beads. They had two rough pots, made of bark, in
    the boat, which they also sold, after which they reluctantly
    departed, quite naked but very happy, shouting and jabbering
    away in the most inarticulate language imaginable. It was with
    great difficulty we could make them let go the rope, when we
    went ahead, and I was quite afraid they would be upset. They
    were all fat and healthy-looking, and, though not handsome,
    their appearance was by no means repulsive; the countenance of
    the woman, especially, wore quite a pleasing expression, when
    lighted up with smiles at the sight of the beads and
    looking-glasses. The bottom of their canoe was covered with
    branches, amongst which the ashes of a recent fire were
    distinguishable. Their paddles were of the very roughest
    description, consisting simply of split branches of trees, with
    wider pieces tied on at one end with the sinews of birds or
    beasts.</p>

    <p>Steaming ahead, past Port Gallant, we had a glorious view
    over Carlos III. Island and Thornton Peaks, until, at about
    seven o clock, we anchored in the little harbour of Borja Bay.
    This place is encircled by luxuriant vegetation, overhanging
    the water, and is set like a gem amid the granite rocks close
    at hand, and the far-distant snowy mountains.</p>

    <p>Our carpenter had prepared a board, on which the name of the
    yacht and the date had been painted, to be fixed on shore, as a
    record of our visit; and as soon as the anchor was down we all
    landed, the gentlemen with their guns, and the crew fully armed
    with pistols and rifles, in case of accident. The water was
    quite deep close to the shore, and we had no difficulty in
    landing, near a small waterfall. To penetrate far inland,
    however, was not so easy, owing to the denseness of the
    vegetation. Large trees had fallen, and, rotting where they
    lay, under the influence of the humid atmosphere, had become
    the birthplace of thousands of other trees, shrubs, plants,
    ferns, mosses, and lichens. In fact, in some places we might
    almost be said to be walking on the tops of the trees, and
    first one and then another of the party found his feet suddenly
    slipping through into unknown depths below. Under these
    circumstances we <span class="pagenum">Page
    138<a name="Page_138"
       id="Page_138"></a></span>were contented with a very short
       ramble, and having filled our baskets with a varied
       collection of mosses and ferns, we returned to the shore,
       where we found many curious shells and some excellent
       mussels. While we had been thus engaged, the carpenter and
       some of the crew were employed in nailing up our board on a
       tree we had selected for the purpose. It was in company with
       the names of many good ships, a portion of which only were
       still legible, many of the boards having fallen to the
       ground and become quite rotten.</p>

    <p>Near the beach we found the remains of a recent fire, and in
    the course of the night the watch on deck, which was doubled
    and well-armed, heard shouts and hoots proceeding from the
    neighbourhood of the shore. Towards morning, too, the fire was
    relighted, from which it was evident that the natives were not
    far off, though they did not actually put in an appearance. I
    suppose they think there is a probability of making something
    out of us by fair means, and that, unlike a sealing schooner,
    with only four or five hands on board, and no motive power but
    her sails, we are rather too formidable to attack.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, October 9th</i>.&mdash;We are indeed most
    fortunate in having another fine day. At 6 a.m. the anchor was
    weighed, and we resumed our journey. It was very cold; but that
    was not to be wondered at, surrounded as we are on every side
    by magnificent snow-clad mountains and superb glaciers. First
    we passed Snowy Sound, in Tierra del Fuego, at the head of
    which is an immense blue glacier. Then came Cape Notch, so
    called from its looking as if it had had a piece chopped out of
    it. Within a few yards of the surrounding glaciers, and close
    to the sea, the vegetation is abundant, and in many places
    semi-tropical, a fact which is due to the comparatively mild
    winters, the temperate summers, the moist climate, and the rich
    soil of these parts. Passing up English Reach, we now caught
    our first glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, between Cape Pillar on
    one <span class="pagenum">Page 139<a name="Page_139"
       id="Page_139"></a></span>side, and Westminster Hall, Shell
       Bay, and Lecky Point, on the other. Steering to the north,
       and leaving these on our left hand, we issued from the
       Straits of Magellan, and entered Smyth's Channel, first
       passing Glacier Bay and Ice Sound, names which speak for
       themselves. Mount Joy, Mount Burney, with its round
       snow-covered summit, rising six thousand feet from the
       water, and several unnamed peaks, were gradually left
       behind; until, at last, after threading a labyrinth of small
       islands, we anchored for the night in Otter Bay, a snug
       little cove, at the entrance to the intricacies of the Mayne
       Channel.</p>

    <p>It was almost dark when we arrived, but the children,
    Captain Brown, and I, went on shore for a short time, and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 140<a name="Page_140"
       id="Page_140"></a></span>gathered a few ferns and mosses. We
       also found the embers of a fire, which showed that the
       natives were not far off, and we therefore thought it
       prudent to hurry on board again before nightfall. No names
       of ships were to be seen; but, in our search for ferns, we
       may possibly have overlooked them. We have not come across
       any Fuegians to-day, though in two of the places we have
       passed&mdash;Shell Bay and Deep Harbour, where a few wigwams
       are left standing as a sort of head-quarters&mdash;they are
       generally to be met with. During the night the watch again
       heard the natives shouting; but no attempt was made to
       re-light the fire we had noticed, until we were steaming out
       of the bay the next morning.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, October 10th</i>.&mdash;In the early morning,
    when we resumed our voyage, the weather was still fine; but a
    few light clouds were here and there visible, and an icy wind,
    sweeping down from the mountains, made it appear very cold,
    though the thermometer&mdash;which averages, I think, 40&deg;
    to 50&deg; all the year round&mdash;was not really low. The
    line of perpetual snow commences here at an elevation of from
    2,500 to 3,500 feet only, which adds greatly to the beauty of
    the scene; and as it is now early spring the snow is still
    unmelted, 500 feet, and even less, from the shore. The
    stupendous glaciers run right down into the sea, and immense
    masses of ice, sometimes larger than a ship, are continually
    breaking off, with a noise like thunder, and falling into the
    water, sending huge waves across to the opposite shore, and
    sometimes completely blocking up the channels. Some of these
    glaciers, composed entirely of blue and green ice and the
    purest snow, are fifteen and twenty miles in length. They are
    by far the finest we have, any of us, ever seen; and even those
    of Norway and Switzerland sink into comparative insignificance
    beside them. The mountains here are not so high as those of
    Europe, but they really appear more lofty, as their entire
    surface, from the water's edge to the extreme summit, is
    clearly visible. At this end of the Straits they
    <span class="pagenum">Page 141<a name="Page_141"
       id="Page_141"></a></span>terminate in peaks, resembling
       Gothic spires, carved in the purest snow; truly 'virgin
       peaks,' on which the eye of man has but seldom rested, and
       which his foot has never touched. They are generally veiled
       in clouds of snow, mist, and driving rain, and it is quite
       the exception to see them as distinctly as we now do.</p>

    <p>After leaving Mayne's Channel, and passing through Union and
    Collingwood Sounds, we found ourselves beneath the shadow of
    the splendid Cordilleras of Sarmiento&mdash;quite distinct from
    Mount Sarmiento, already referred to&mdash;along the foot of
    which extended the largest glacier we have yet
    seen<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
       id="FNanchor_5_5">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_5_5"
       class="fnanchor">[5]</a> With Tarleton Pass on our right
       hand, and Childer's Pass on the left, we came in sight of
       Owen's Island, one extremity of which is called Mayne Head,
       and the other Cape Brassey, these places having all been so
       named by Captain Mayne, during his survey in the 'Nassau,'
       in 1869. Near the island of Esperanza, the clouds having by
       that time completely cleared away, and the sun shining
       brightly, we had a splendid view of another range of snowy
       mountains, with Stoke's Monument towering high in their
       midst. The numerous floating icebergs added greatly to the
       exquisite beauty of the scene. Some loomed high as
       mountains, while others had melted into the most fanciful
       and fairy-like shapes&mdash;huge swans, full-rigged ships,
       schooners under full sail, and a hundred other fantastic
       forms and devices. The children were in ecstasies at the
       sight of them.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_5_5"

           <a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
           I should explain that the names of places in these
           Straits frequently occur in duplicate, and even
           triplicate, which is rather confusing.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As we gradually opened out our anchorage&mdash;Puerto
    Bueno&mdash;we found a steamer already lying there, which
    proved to be the 'Dacia,' telegraph ship, just in from the
    Pacific coast. Having dropped our anchor at about 5 p.m., we
    all went on shore, armed as before, some of the gentlemen
    hoping to find a stray duck or two, at a fresh-water
    <span class="pagenum">Page 142<a name="Page_142"
       id="Page_142"></a></span> lake, a little way inland. We met
       several of the officers of the 'Dacia,' who, being the first
       comers, did the honours of the place, and told us all they
       knew about it. The vegetation was as luxuriant and beautiful
       as usual&mdash;in fact, rather more so; for we are now
       advancing northwards at the rate of about a hundred miles a
       day. There were no ducks in the lake, but we enjoyed the
       scramble alongside it, to the point where it falls over some
       rocks into the sea. The gig was drawn under this waterfall,
       and having been loaded to her thwarts, with about three tons
       and a half of excellent water, she was then towed off to the
       yacht, where the water was emptied into our tanks, which
       were thus filled to the brim. A small iceberg, also towed
       alongside, afforded us a supply of ice; and we were thus
       cheaply provided with a portion of the requisite supplies
       for our voyage. The 'Dacia' had an iceberg half as big as
       herself lying alongside her, and all hands were at work
       until late at night, aided by the light of lanterns and
       torches, chopping the ice up and stowing it away.</p>

    <p>Our boat being thus engaged, we were obliged to wait on
    shore until long past dark; but as we were a large and strong
    party, it did not much matter. Our men amused themselves by
    collecting a number of large and excellent mussels, some of
    which, distinguishable by the peculiar appearance of their
    shells, arising from a diseased condition of the fish,
    contained from ten to thirty very small seed pearls. The
    captain of the 'Dacia' came to dinner, and the officers in the
    evening; and they gave us much valuable information about the
    anchorages further up the Straits, and many other things. The
    captain kindly gave Tom all his Chilian charts of the Darien
    Channel, which has not yet been fully surveyed by the English
    Government, though the 'Nassau' passed through in 1869.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, October 11th</i>.&mdash;I never in my life saw
    anything so beautiful as the view when I came on deck this
    <span class="pagenum">Page 143<a name="Page_143"
       id="Page_143"></a></span>morning, at a quarter to five. The
       moon was shining, large and golden, high in the heavens; the
       rosy streaks of dawn were just tinging the virgin snow on
       the highest peaks with faint but ever-deepening colour;
       whilst all around, the foliage, rocks, and icebergs were
       still wrapped in the deepest shade. As the sun rose, the
       pink summits of the mountains changed to gold and yellow,
       and then to dazzling white, as the light crept down into the
       valleys, illuminating all the dark places, and bringing out
       the shades of olive-greens, greys, and purples, in the most
       wonderful contrasts and combinations of colour. The grandeur
       of the scene increased with every revolution of the screw,
       and when fairly in the Guia narrows we were able to stop and
       admire it a little more at our leisure, Mr. Bingham making
       some sketches, while I took some photographs. To describe
       the prospect in detail is quite impossible. Imagine the
       grandest Alpine scene you ever saw, with tall snowy peaks
       and pinnacles rising from huge domed tops, and vast fields
       of unbroken snow; glaciers, running down <i>into</i> the
       sea, at the heads of the various bays; each bank and
       promontory richly clothed with vegetation of every shade of
       green; bold rocks and noble cliffs, covered with many-hued
       lichens; the floating icebergs; the narrow channel itself,
       blue as the sky above, dotted with small islands, each a
       mass of verdure, and reflecting on its glassy surface every
       object with such distinctness that it was difficult to say
       where the reality ended and the image began. I have seen a
       photograph of the Mirror Lake, in California, which, as far
       as I know, is the only thing that could possibly give one an
       idea of the marvellous effect of these reflections. Unfit
       Bay, on Chatham Island, looking towards the mountains near
       Pill Channel, and Ladder Hill, which looks as if a flight of
       steps had been cut upon its face, were perhaps two of the
       most striking points amid all this loveliness.</p>

    <p>All too soon came the inevitable order to steam ahead; and
    once more resuming our course, we passed through
    <span class="pagenum">Page 144<a name="Page_144"
       id="Page_144"></a></span>Innocents and Conception Channels,
       and entered Wide Channel, which is frequently blocked up
       with ice at this time of year, though to-day we only met
       with a few icebergs on their way down from Eyre Sound.</p>

    <p>I have already referred to the extraordinary shapes assumed
    by some of the mountain peaks. That appropriately called
    Singular Peak&mdash;on Chatham Island&mdash;and Two-peak
    Mountain and Cathedral Mountain&mdash;both on Wellington
    Island&mdash;specially attracted our attention to-day. The
    first-named presents a wonderful appearance, from whichever
    side you view it; the second reminds one of the beautiful
    double spires at Tours; while the last resembles the tapering
    spire of a cathedral, rising from a long roof, covered with
    delicate towers, fret-work, and angles. In
    <span class="pagenum">Page 145<a name="Page_145"
       id="Page_145"></a></span>Wide Channel we felt really
       compelled to stop again to admire some of the unnamed
       mountains. One we christened Spire Mountain, to distinguish
       it from the rest; it consisted of a single needle-like
       point, piercing deep into the blue vault of heaven, and
       surrounded by a cluster of less lofty but equally sharp
       pinnacles. This group rose from a vast chain of exquisitely
       tinted snow-peaks, that looked almost as if they rested on
       the vast glacier beneath, seamed with dark blue and green
       crevasses and fissures.</p>

    <p>All this time the weather continued perfect. Not a cloud was
    to be seen, the sun was hot and bright, and the sky was blue
    enough to rival that of classic Italy. If we could but be sure
    that this delightful state of things would continue, how
    pleasant it would be, to stop and explore some of these places.
    We have, however, been so frequently warned of the possibility
    of detention for days and even <span class="pagenum">Page
    146<a name="Page_146"
       id="Page_146"></a></span>weeks at anchor, owing to bad
       weather, that we are hurrying on as fast as we can,
       expecting that every day will bring the much-dreaded deluge,
       gale, or fog. In thick weather it is simply impossible to
       proceed; and if it comes on suddenly, as it generally does,
       and finds you far from an anchorage, there is nothing to be
       done but to heave-to and wait till it clears, sending a
       party ashore if possible to light a fire, to serve as a
       landmark, and so enable you to maintain your position. How
       thankful I am that we have been hitherto able to make the
       passage under such favourable circumstances! It has been a
       vision of beauty and variety, the recollection of which can
       never be effaced.</p>

    <p>Europe Inlet, on our right, going up Wide Channel, was full
    of ice. Husband's Inlet looked as if it was frozen over at the
    farther end, and Penguin Inlet seemed quite choked up with huge
    hummocks and blocks of ice. Tom therefore decided not to
    attempt the passage of Icy Reach, for fear of being stopped,
    but to go round Saumarez Island to Port Grappler by way of
    Chasm Reach, rather a longer route. It was a happy decision;
    for nothing could exceed the weird impressive splendour of this
    portion of the Straits. We were passing through a deep gloomy
    mountain gorge, with high perpendicular cliffs on either side.
    Below, all was wrapped in the deepest shade. Far above, the sun
    gilded the snowy peaks and many-tinted foliage with his
    departing light, that slowly turned to rose-colour ere the
    shades of evening crept over all, and the stars began to peep
    out, one by one. We could trace from the summit to the base of
    a lofty mountain the course of a stupendous avalanche, which
    had recently rushed down into the sea, crushing and destroying
    everything in its way, and leaving a broad track of desolation
    behind it. It must for a time have completely filled up the
    narrow channel; and woe to any unfortunate vessel that might
    happen to be there at such a moment!</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 147<a name="Page_147"
       id="Page_147"></a></span>Port Grappler is rather a difficult
       place to make in the dark; but Tom managed it with much
       dexterity, and by eight o'clock we were safely anchored for
       the night. We all wanted Tom to stay here to-morrow to get
       some rest, which he much needs, but he has determined to
       start at five o'clock in the morning as usual, for fear of
       being caught by bad weather. Even I, who have of course had
       no anxiety as to the navigation, felt so fatigued from
       having been on the bridge the whole day since very early
       this morning, that I went straight to bed before dinner, in
       order to be ready for to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, October 12th</i>.&mdash;A day as perfect as
    yesterday succeeded a clear cold night. We weighed anchor at
    5.15 a.m., and, retracing our course for a few miles, passed
    round the end of Saumarez Island, and entered the narrow
    channel leading to Indian Reach. The greatest care is here
    necessary, to avoid several sunken rocks, which have already
    proved fatal to many ships, a large German steamer having been
    wrecked as recently as last year. The smooth but treacherous
    surface of the channel reflected sharply the cliffs and
    foliage, and its mirror-like stillness was only
    <span class="pagenum">Page 148<a name="Page_148"
       id="Page_148"></a></span>broken at rare intervals, by the
       sudden appearance of a seal in search of a fresh supply of
       air, or by the efforts, delayed until the very last moment,
       of a few steamer-ducks, gannets, or cormorants, to get out
       of our way.</p>

    <p>Having accomplished the passage of Indian Reach in safety,
    we were just passing Eden Harbour, when the cry of 'Canoe
    ahead!' was raised. A boat was seen paddling out towards us
    from behind Moreton Island, containing about half-a-dozen
    people, apparently armed with bows and arrows and spears, and
    provided with fishing-rods, which projected on either side. One
    man was standing up and waving, in a very excited manner,
    something which turned out ultimately to be a piece of
    cotton-waste. Our engines having been stopped, the canoe came
    alongside, and we beheld six wild-looking half-naked
    creatures&mdash;two men, three women, and a very small boy, who
    was crouching over a fire at the bottom of the boat. There were
    also four sharp, cheery-looking little dogs, rather like
    Esquimaux dogs, only smaller, with prick ears and curly tails,
    who were looking over the side and barking vigorously in
    response to the salutations of our pugs. One man had on a
    square robe of sea-otter skins, thrown over his shoulders, and
    laced together in front, two of the women wore sheepskins, and
    the rest of the party were absolutely naked. Their black hair
    was long and shaggy, and they all clamoured loudly in harsh
    guttural tones, accompanied by violent gesticulations, for
    'tab&aacute;co' and 'gall&eacute;ta.' We got some ready for
    them, and also some beads, knives, and looking-glasses, but
    through some mistake they did not manage to get hold of our
    rope in time, and as our way carried us ahead they were left
    behind. The passage was narrow, and the current strong, and Tom
    was anxious to save the tide in the dangerous English Narrows.
    We could not, therefore, give them another chance of
    communicating with us, and accordingly we went on our way,
    followed by what were, I have no doubt, the curses&mdash;not
    only deep, but <span class="pagenum">Page 149<a name="Page_149"
       id="Page_149"></a></span>loud&mdash;of the whole party, who
       indulged at the same time in the most furious and
       threatening gestures. I was quite sorry for their
       disappointment at losing their hoped-for luxuries, to say
       nothing of our own at missing the opportunity of bargaining
       for some more furs and curiosities.</p>

    <p>Shortly afterwards there were seen from the masthead crowds
    of natives among the trees armed with long spears, bows, and
    arrows, busily engaged pushing off their canoes from their
    hiding-places in creeks and hollows; so perhaps it was just as
    well we did not stop, or we might have been surrounded. Not far
    from here are the English Narrows, a passage which is a
    ticklish but interesting piece of navigation. A strong current
    prevails, and, to avoid a shoal, it is necessary at one point
    to steer so close to the western shore that the bowsprit almost
    projects over the land, the branches of the trees almost sweep
    the rigging, and the rocks almost scrape the side of the
    vessel. Two men were placed at the wheel, as a matter of
    precaution, and we appeared to be steering straight for the
    shore, at full speed, till Tom suddenly gave the order 'Hard
    a-port!' and the 'Sunbeam' instantly flew round and rushed
    swiftly past the dangerous spot into wider waters. It is just
    here that Captain Trivett was knocked off the bridge of his
    vessel by the boughs&mdash;a mishap he warned Tom against
    before we left England.</p>

    <p>Whilst in the Narrows we looked back, to see everything
    bright and cheerful, but ahead all was black and dismal: the
    sky and sun were obscured, the tops of the mountains hidden,
    and the valleys filled up with thick fog and clouds&mdash;all
    which seemed to indicate the approach of a storm of rain,
    although the glass was still very high. We went up South Reach
    and North Reach, in the Messier Channel, till, just as we were
    off Liberta Bay, in lat. 48&deg; 50' S., long. 74&deg; 25' W.,
    the blackest of the black clouds came suddenly down upon us,
    and descended upon the deck in a tremendous shower&mdash;not of
    rain, but of <i>dust</i> and <i>ashes</i>. Windows, hatches,
    and doors were shut as soon as we discovered
    <span class="pagenum">Page 150<a name="Page_150"
       id="Page_150"></a></span>the nature of this strange
       visitation, and in about half an hour we were through the
       worst of it: whereupon dustpans, brooms, and dusters came
       into great requisition. It took us completely by surprise,
       for we had no reason to expect anything of the sort.
       Assuming the dust to be of volcanic origin, it must have
       travelled an immense distance; the nearest volcano, as far
       as we know, being that of Corcovado, in the island of
       Chiloe, nearly 300 miles off. We had heard from Sir Woodbine
       Parish, and others at Buenos Ayres, of the terrible blinding
       dust-storms which occur <i>there</i>, causing utter darkness
       for a space of ten or fifteen minutes; but Buenos Ayres is
       on the edge of a river, with hundreds and thousands of
       leagues of sandy plains behind it, the soil of which is only
       kept together by the roots of the wiry pampas grass. For
       this dust to reach the Messier Channel, where we now are, it
       would have to surmount two chains of snowy mountains, six or
       seven thousand feet in height, and in many places hundreds
       of miles in width, and traverse a vast extent of country
       besides.</p>

    <p>The weather was still so fine, and the barometer so
    high&mdash;30.52 inches&mdash;that Tom determined to go to sea
    to-day, instead of stopping at Hale Cove for the night, as we
    had originally intended. Directly we got through the English
    Narrows, therefore, all hands were busily engaged in once more
    sending up the square-yards, top-masts, &amp;c., and in making
    ready for sea. Just before sunset, as we were quitting the
    narrow channels, the sun pierced through the clouds and
    lightened up the lonely landscape as well as the broad waters
    of the Pacific Ocean. Its surface was scarcely rippled by the
    gentle breeze that wafted us on our course; the light of the
    setting sun rested, in soft and varied tints, on the
    fast-fading mountains and peaks; and thus, under the most
    favourable and encouraging circumstances, we have fairly
    entered upon a new and important section of our long voyage.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 151<a name="Page_151"
       id="Page_151"></a></span></p>

    <p>Although perhaps I ought not to say so, I cannot help
    admiring the manner in which Tom has piloted his yacht through
    the Straits, for it would do credit, not only to any amateur,
    but to a professional seaman. He has never hesitated or been at
    a loss for a moment, however intricate the part or complicated
    the directions; but having thoroughly studied and mastered the
    subject beforehand, he has been able to go steadily on at full
    speed the whole way. It has, however, been very fatiguing work
    for him, as he hardly ever left the bridge whilst we were under
    way.</p>

    <p>We steamed the whole distance from Cape Virgins to the Gulf
    of Pe&ntilde;as, 659 knots, in 76 hours, anchoring six times.
    This gives seven days' steaming, of an average length of eleven
    hours each; and as we stopped two or three hours, at different
    times, for Fuegians, photographs, and sketches, our average
    speed was nine and a half knots, though sometimes, when going
    with strong currents, it was twelve or fourteen, and, when
    going against them, barely six knots.</p>

    <p>Just at dark, we passed between Wager Island and Cheape
    Channel, where H.M.S. 'Wager,' commanded by Captain Cheape, was
    wrecked, and we spent the night in the Gulf of Pe&ntilde;as,
    almost becalmed.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, October 13th</i>.&mdash;We ceased steaming at
    7.30 a.m., and made every effort throughout the rest of the
    day, by endless changes of sail, to catch each fleeting breath
    of wind. We did not, however, make much progress, owing to the
    extreme lightness of the breeze.</p>

    <p>Sorry as we are to lose the scenery of the Straits, it is
    pleasant to find the weather getting gradually warmer, day by
    day, and to be able to regard the morning bath once more as a
    luxury instead of a terror. The change is also thoroughly
    appreciated by the various animals we have on board, especially
    the monkeys and parrots, who may now be seen sunning themselves
    in every warm <span class="pagenum">Page 152<a name="Page_152"
       id="Page_152"></a></span>corner of the deck. In the Straits,
       though the sun was hot, there was always an icy feeling in
       the wind, owing to the presence of enormous masses of snow
       and ice on every side.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, October 14th</i>.&mdash;Light winds and calms
    prevailed the whole day. About 2 p.m. we were off the island of
    Socorro. In the afternoon a large shoal of whales came round
    the yacht. I was below when they first made their appearance,
    and when I came on deck they were spouting up great jets of
    water in all directions, suggestive of the fountains at the
    Crystal Palace. We were lying so still that they did not seem
    to be in the least afraid of us, and came quite close, swimming
    alongside, round us, across our bows, and even diving down
    under our keel. There was a shoal of small fish about, and the
    whales, most of which were about fifty or sixty feet in length,
    constantly opened their huge pink whalebone-fringed mouths so
    wide that we could see right down their capacious throats. The
    children were especially delighted with this performance, and
    baby has learned quite a new trick. When asked, 'What do the
    whales do?' she opens her mouth as wide as she can, stretches
    out her arms to their fullest extent, then blows, and finishes
    up with a look round for applause.</p>

    <p>Soon after 8 p.m. the wind completely died away, and,
    fearing further detention, we once more got up steam.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, October 15th</i>.&mdash;Still calm. We had the
    litany and hymns at 11 a.m.; prayers and hymns and a sermon at
    5 p.m. In the course of the afternoon we were again surrounded
    by a shoal of whales. We passed the island of Chiloe to-day,
    where it always rains, and where the vegetation is
    proportionately dense and luxuriant. It is inhabited by a tribe
    of peculiarly gentle Indians, who till the ground, and who are
    said to be kind to strangers thrown amongst them. Darwin and
    Byron speak well of the island and its inhabitants, who are
    probably more civilised since their <span class="pagenum">Page
    153<a name="Page_153"
       id="Page_153"></a></span>time, for a steamer now runs
       regularly once a week from Valparaiso to San Carlos and back
       for garden produce. The potato is indigenous to the
       island.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, October 17th</i>.&mdash;At 6 a.m., there being
    still no wind, Tom, in despair of ever reaching our destination
    under sail alone, again ordered steam to be raised. Two hours
    later a nice sailing breeze sprang up; but we had been so often
    disappointed that we determined to continue steaming. Just
    before sunset we saw the island of Mocha in the distance. It is
    said to have been inhabited at one time by herds of wild horses
    and hogs, but I think they have now become extinct.</p>

    <p>One of our principal amusements during the calm weather has
    been to fish for cape-pigeons, cape-hens, gulls, and
    albatrosses, with a hook and line. We have caught a good many
    in this way, and several entangled themselves in the threads
    left floating for the purpose over the stern. The cape-pigeons
    were so tame that they came almost on board, and numbers of
    them were caught in butterfly-nets. Their plumage is not unlike
    grebe, and I mean to have <span class="pagenum">Page
    154<a name="Page_154"
       id="Page_154"></a></span>some muffs and trimmings for the
       children made out of it. Allen, the coxswain of the gig,
       skins them very well, having had some lessons from Ward
       before we left England. I want very much to catch an
       albatross, in order to have it skinned, and to make
       tobacco-pouches of its feet and pipe-stems of the
       wing-bones, for presents.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, October 18th</i>.&mdash;At 3.30 a.m. we were
    close to the land lying south of the Bay of Lota; at 4 a.m. the
    engines were stopped on account of the mist; and at 6 a.m. we
    began to go slowly ahead again, though it was still not very
    easy to make out the distance and bearing of the coast. The
    passage into the bay, between the island of Santa Maria and
    Lavapi&eacute; Point, is narrow and difficult, and abounds with
    sunken rocks and other hidden dangers, not yet fully surveyed.
    Tom said it was the most arduous piece of navigation he ever
    undertook on a misty morning; but happily he accomplished it
    successfully. Just as he entered the sun broke through the
    mist, displaying a beautiful bay, surrounded on three sides by
    well-wooded hills, and sheltered from all winds except the
    north. One corner is completely occupied by the huge
    establishment belonging to Madame Cousi&ntilde;o, consisting of
    coal-mines, enormous smelting-works, and extensive potteries.
    The hill just at the back is completely bare of vegetation,
    which has all been poisoned by the sulphurous vapours from the
    furnaces. This spot, from its contiguity to the works, has been
    selected as the site of a village for the accommodation of the
    numerous labourers and their families. It is therefore to be
    hoped that sulphur fumes are not as injurious to animal as they
    evidently are to vegetable life. As we drew nearer
    <span class="pagenum">Page 156<a name="Page_156"
       id="Page_156"></a></span>to the shore we could distinguish
       Madame Cousi&ntilde;o's house, in the midst of a park on the
       summit of a hill, and surrounded on all sides by beautiful
       gardens. Every prominent point had a little summer-house
       perched upon it, and some of the trees had circular seats
       built round their trunks half-way up, approached by spiral
       staircases, and thatched like wigwams. The general aspect of
       the coast, which is a combination of rich red earth, granite
       cliffs, and trees to the water's edge, is very like that of
       Cornwall and Devonshire.</p>

    <p>We had scarcely dropped our anchor before the captain of the
    port came on board, and told us we were too far from the shore
    to coal, which was our special object in coming here; so up
    went the anchor again, and we steamed a few hundred yards
    further in, and then let go close to the shore, in deep water.
    Captain M&ouml;ller waited to go ashore with us, introduced our
    steward to the butcher and postmaster of the place, and then
    accompanied us to Madame Cousi&ntilde;o's gardens.</p>

    <p>It was a steep climb up the hill, but we were well rewarded
    for our labour. Tended by over a hundred men, whose efforts are
    directed by highly paid and thoroughly experienced Scotch
    gardeners, these grounds contain a collection of plants from
    all the four quarters of the globe, and from New Zealand,
    Polynesia, and Australia. Amid them were scattered all kinds of
    fantastic grottoes, fountains, statues, and ferneries; flights
    of steps, leading downwards to the beach, and upwards to sylvan
    nooks; arcades, arched over with bamboos, and containing
    trellis-work from Derbyshire, and Minton tiles from
    Staffordshire; seats of all sorts and shapes, <i>under</i>
    trees, <i>in</i> trees, and <i>over</i> trees; besides
    summer-houses and pagodas, at every corner where there was a
    pretty view over land or sea.</p>

    <p>One of the heads of the establishment, a great friend of
    Madame Cousi&ntilde;o's, was unfortunately very ill, and as she
    was nursing him, she could not come out to see us; but she
    <span class="pagenum">Page 157<a name="Page_157"
       id="Page_157"></a></span>kindly gave orders to her gardener
       to send some cut flowers and some ferns on board the yacht,
       to decorate the saloon; and as she was unable to invite us
       to luncheon at the big house, she sent some champagne and
       refreshments down to the Casa de la Administracion, where we
       were most hospitably entertained. She has had the latter
       place comfortably fitted up for the use of the principal
       employ&eacute;s on the works, and has provided it with a
       billiard-table, a very fair library, and several spare
       bed-rooms for the accommodation of visitors.</p>

    <p>After luncheon we went to see the copper-smelting works,
    which were very interesting. The manager walked through with
    us, and explained the processes very clearly. He could tell at
    once, on taking up a piece of rough ore, fresh from the mine,
    what percentage of copper or iron it contained, the amount
    varying from ten to seventy-five per cent, of the gross weight.
    The furnaces are kept burning night and day, and are worked by
    three gangs of men; and the quantity of copper produced
    annually is enormous. In fact, three parts of the copper used
    in Europe comes from here. The ore is brought from various
    parts of Chili and Peru, generally in Madame Cousi&ntilde;o's
    ships; and coal is found in such abundance, and so near the
    surface, that the operation of smelting is a profitable one.
    Our afternoon, spent amid smoke, and heat, and dirt, and
    half-naked workmen, manipulating with dexterous skill the
    glowing streams of molten ore, was a great contrast to our
    morning ramble.</p>

    <p>Having seen the works, and received a curious and
    interesting collection of copper ore, as a remembrance of our
    visit, we started in a little car, lined with crimson cloth,
    and drawn by a locomotive, to visit the various coal-mines.
    First we went through the park, and then along a valley near
    the sea, full of wild flowers and ferns, and trees festooned
    with 'copigue,' the Chilian name for a creeper which is a
    speciality of this country, and which imparts a character of
    its own to the landscape during the month of
    <span class="pagenum">Page 158<a name="Page_158"
       id="Page_158"></a></span>May, when its wreaths of scarlet,
       cherry, or pink flowers are in full bloom. We went to the
       mouths of three coal-pits, and looked down into their grimy
       depths, but did not descend, as it would have occupied too
       much time. They are mostly about 1,000 yards in depth, and
       extend for some distance under the sea.</p>

    <p>We next visited a point of land whence we could see an
    island which closely resembles St. Michael's Mount. It is quite
    uninhabited, except by a few wild goats and rabbits. The
    sea-shore is lined with trees to the water's edge, and there
    are many bold rocks and fine white sandy caves in different
    parts of it. Some boats were drawn up high and dry on the
    beach, along which several picturesque-looking groups of
    shell-fish collectors were scattered. The mussels that are
    found here are enormous&mdash;from five to eight inches in
    length&mdash;and they, together with cockles and limpets, form
    a staple article of food.</p>

    <p>A steam-launch had been sent to meet us, but it could not
    get near enough to the shore for us to embark. A rickety, leaky
    small boat, half full of water, was therefore, after some
    delay, procured, and in this we were sculled out, two by two,
    till the whole party were safely on board. Outside there was
    quite a swell, and a north wind and rain are prophesied for
    to-morrow. Mr. Mackay returned with us to the yacht, and stayed
    to dinner. Before he left, the prognostications of bad weather
    were to some extent justified; for the wind changed, and rain,
    the first we have felt for some time, began to fall.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, October 19th</i>.&mdash;We have been persuaded
    by our friends here to try and see a little more of the
    interior of Chili than we should do if we were to carry out our
    original intention of going on to Valparaiso in the yacht, and
    then merely making an excursion to Santiago from that place. We
    have therefore arranged to proceed at once overland to
    Santiago, by a route which will enable us to see something of
    the Cordillera of the Andes, to have a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 159<a name="Page_159"
       id="Page_159"></a></span> peep at the Araucanian Indians on
       the frontier, and to visit the baths of Cauquenes. Tom,
       however, does not like to leave the yacht, and has decided
       to take her up to Valparaiso, and then come on to Santiago
       and meet us, in about five or six days' time. The anchor was
       accordingly hove short, and the mizen hoisted, when we
       landed this morning, in a drenching rain.</p>

    <p>A coach runs daily from Lota to Concepcion, the first stage
    of our journey, but a special vehicle was engaged for our
    accommodation, and a curious affair it was to look at. It
    seemed to be simply a huge wooden box, suspended, by means of
    thick leather straps, from C springs, without windows or doors,
    but provided with two long, narrow openings, through which you
    squeezed yourself in or out, and which could be closed at
    pleasure by roll-up leather blinds. Inside, it was roomy,
    well-padded, and comfortable.</p>

    <p>The rain had made the road terribly greasy, and several
    times the carriage slewed half-way round and slid four or five
    feet sideways down the hill, causing us to hold on, in
    expectation of a spill. At last we reached the bottom in
    safety, and, crossing a small river, emerged upon the sea-shore
    at Playa Negra, or Black Beach, along which we drove for some
    distance through the deep, loose sand, the horses being up to
    their fetlocks in water most of the time. Then we forded
    another little river, and, leaving the beach, proceeded up a
    steep road, not more than three yards wide, with a ditch on one
    side and a steep precipice on the other, to the little village
    of Coronel, overlooking the bay of the same name. While the
    horses were being changed, we walked down to the little wooden
    pier, on the sea-shore, and saw the 'Sunbeam' just coming out
    of Lota Bay.</p>

    <p>Drawn up by the side of the pier was a picturesque-looking
    market-boat, full of many sorts of vegetables, and little piles
    of sea-eggs, with their spines removed, and neatly tied up with
    rushes in parcels of three. The people seemed to enjoy them
    raw, in which state they are considered
    <span class="pagenum">Page 160<a name="Page_160"
       id="Page_160"></a></span>to be most nutritious; and when
       roasted in their shells, or made into omelettes, they are a
       favourite article of food with all classes. Coronel is a
       great coaling station, and the bay, which is surrounded by
       tall chimneys, shafts, and piers, connected with the mines,
       was full of steamers and colliers.</p>

    <p>Our road now ran for some time through undulating
    pasture-land, in which were many large trees, the scene
    resembling a vast park. Masses of scarlet verbena, yellow
    calceolaria, and white heath, grew on all sides, while the
    numerous myrtle, mimosa, and other bushes, were entwined with
    orange-coloured nasturtiums, and a little scarlet
    trop&aelig;olum, with a blue edge, whose name I forget. Beneath
    the trees the ground was thickly carpeted with adiantum fern.
    The road over which we travelled was of the worst description,
    and our luncheon was eaten with no small difficulty, but with a
    considerable amount of merriment. Once, when we jolted into an
    unusually big hole, the whole of our provisions, basket and
    all, made a sudden plunge towards one side of the coach, and
    very nearly escaped us altogether.</p>

    <p>Half-way between Coronel and Concepcion, we met the return
    stage-coach, crowded with passengers, and looking as if it had
    just come out of the South Kensington Museum or Madame
    Tussaud's, or like the pictures of a coach of Queen Elizabeth's
    time. It was a long low vehicle, with unglazed windows all
    round it, painted bright scarlet decorated with brilliant
    devices on every panel, and suspended, like our own, by means
    of innumerable leather straps, from huge C springs. The seats
    on either side held three passengers, and there was a stool in
    the middle, like the one in the Lord Mayor's coach, on which
    four people sat, back to bask.</p>

    <p>Soon after we drew up to rest the horses at a little posada,
    kept by two Germans, called 'Half-way House,' and seven miles
    more brought us to a rich and well-cultivated
    <span class="pagenum">Page 161<a name="Page_161"
       id="Page_161"></a></span>farm belonging to Mr. Hermann,
       where we stopped to change horses.</p>

    <p>It was six o'clock in the evening when we reached the
    Bio-Bio, a wide shallow river, at the entrance of the town of
    Concepcion; it had to be crossed in a ferry-boat, carriage and
    all, and as it was after hours, we had some difficulty in
    finding any one to take us over. At last, in consideration of a
    little extra pay, six men consented to undertake the job, and
    having set a square-sail, to keep us from being carried down
    the river by the current, they punted us over with long poles.
    Sometimes there was nine feet of water beneath us, but oftener
    not more than four or five. The boat could not get close to the
    opposite shore, and it was a great business to get the carriage
    out and the horses harnessed, in some eighteen inches of water.
    First the carriage stuck in the sand, and then the horses
    refused to move, but after a great deal of splashing, and an
    immense display of energy in the way of pulling, jerking,
    shrieking, shouting&mdash;and, I am afraid, swearing&mdash;we
    reached the bank, emerged from the water, struggled through
    some boggy ground, and were taken at full gallop through the
    streets of the town, until we reached the Hotel Comercio, where
    we found comfortable rooms and a nice little dinner awaiting
    us.</p>

    <p>This was all very well, as far as it went, but when we came
    to inquire about our onward route we were disappointed to learn
    that the line to Angol was closed, owing to the breaking down
    of a bridge, and would remain so until next month, and that,
    with the exception of a contractor's train, which runs only
    once a week, there was nothing by which we could travel.
    'To-morrow is Friday,' added Monsieur Letellier, 'and that is
    so near Monday, what can Madame do better than wait here till
    then?' By way of consolation, he informed us that there were no
    Indians now at Angol, as the Araucanian <a name="FNanchor_6_6"
       id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"

       id="Page_162"></a></span> had recently all been driven
       further back from the frontier by the Chilenos, but that, if
       we were still bent on trying to get there, we could go by
       boat as far as Nacimiento, where we might, with some
       difficulty, procure a carriage. The river just now, however,
       is so low, that the boat frequently gets aground, and
       remains for two or three days; therefore, taking everything
       into consideration, we have decided to abandon this part of
       our programme, for otherwise we shall not reach Santiago in
       time. In any case, the journey will be a much longer one
       than we expected.</p>

           I have lately received a letter from a friend in Paris,
           who says: 'Strange to tell, it is only a few days ago
           that poor Or&eacute;lie Antoine I., ex-King of
           Araucania, died at Bordeaux, in a hospital. He reigned
           for some years, and then made war upon Chili, which gave
           him a warm reception; even captured his Majesty and sent
           him back to his native land. I met him here a few years
           ago, surrounded by a small court, which treated him with
           great deference. I found him a dignified, intelligent
           sovereign. He attempted to return to his kingdom, but
           was captured on the high seas by a Brazilian cruiser,
           and sent back to France to die a miserable death.</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Friday, October 20th</i>.&mdash;We went out for a short
    stroll round the Plaza before breakfast, which meal was
    scarcely over when Mr. Mackay arrived in a carriage, and took
    us off to see what there was to see in the town. The Plaza was
    full of bright-looking flower-beds, in which were superb roses,
    and many English flowers, shaded by oranges, pomegranates, and
    deutzias. Each plot belongs to one of the principal families in
    the town, and great emulation is displayed as to whose little
    garden shall be in the best order and contain the finest
    collection of plants and flowers.</p>

    <p>Concepcion has suffered, and still suffers, much from
    earthquakes. The existing town is only thirty-five years old.
    The houses are all one story high only, and the streets, or
    rather roads, between them are wide, in order to afford the
    inhabitants a chance of escape, should their dwellings be
    thrown down by a sudden shock. In summer everybody rushes out
    into the street, no matter what hour of the day or night it may
    be, as soon as the first symptoms of an earthquake are felt;
    but during the winter, when <span class="pagenum">Page
    163<a name="Page_163"
       id="Page_163"></a></span>the shocks are never so severe, the
       alarm caused is not so great. The old town was about two
       miles distant from the present site, near a place now called
       Penco, but after being demolished in the ordinary way, an
       immense wave rolled up and completely destroyed all traces
       of its existence.</p>

    <p>We drove out to Puchacai, Mr. Mackay's hacienda, a pretty
    little thatched cottage, surrounded by a verandah, in the midst
    of a garden, where laburnums and lilacs bloom side by side with
    orange-trees and pomegranates. Round the garden are groves of
    shady English oaks (the first we have seen since leaving home)
    and Norfolk Island pines, the effect of the whole scene being
    strangely suggestive of the idea that a charming little bit of
    English rural scenery has in some mysterious manner been
    transported to this out-of-the-way spot in Chili. The interior
    of the house, which is simply but tastefully furnished, and at
    the time of our visit was full of fresh flowers, arranged with
    an artistic eye to colour, bears the same indescribable
    <i>homelike</i> air. We were kindly received and regaled with
    luncheon, including, amongst other good things, fried
    <i>pejerey</i> (king of fish), deservedly so called.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon we strolled about the garden, and looked at
    the farm and stable, and were shown the probable winner of one
    of the prizes at the forthcoming race-meeting. In the cottages
    on the estate some specimens of <i>mi&ntilde;aque</i> lace were
    offered to us&mdash;a lace made by most of the peasants in this
    part of the country. It varies considerably in quality, from
    the coarse kind, used for covering furniture, to the finest
    description, used for personal adornment It is very cheap,
    wears for ever, and strongly resembles the <i>torchon</i> lace,
    now so fashionable in Paris and London for trimming petticoats
    and children's frocks. The women also spin, dye, and weave the
    wool from the fleece of their own sheep into the
    bright-coloured ponchos universally worn, winter and summer, by
    the men in this country. These ponchos are not made of nearly
    such good <span class="pagenum">Page 164<a name="Page_164"
       id="Page_164"></a></span>material as those used in the
       Argentine Republic, but they are considerably gayer and more
       picturesque in appearance.</p>

    <p>After dinner, there was nothing to do except to stroll about
    the town and buy photographs. They are extremely good in
    Chili&mdash;both views and portraits&mdash;but proportionately
    dear, the price being double what would be charged in London or
    Paris for the same thing.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, October 21st</i>.&mdash;Having wished good-bye
    to Mr. Mackay, and taken our seats in the train for Linares, we
    were now fairly launched on our own resources in a strange
    country, I being the only one of the party who could speak even
    a little Spanish. At San Romde we stopped half an hour to allow
    the train from Chilian to pass. Most of the passengers took the
    opportunity of breakfasting, but as we were not hungry we
    occupied the time in having a chat with the engine-driver, a
    very intelligent Canadian. He told us that, as it happened, we
    might have gone to Angol to-day after all, as a special car and
    engine were going there to take a doctor to see a patient,
    returning early to-morrow morning.</p>

    <p>The railroad runs alongside the Bio-Bio all the way to San
    Romde. On either bank are low wooded hills, on
    <span class="pagenum">Page 165<a name="Page_165"
       id="Page_165"></a></span>whose sides vines are cultivated in
       considerable quantities. The wild flowers grow luxuriantly
       everywhere: calceolarias, especially, in huge bushes of
       golden bloom, two or three feet high. At San Romde we left
       the river, and travelled through a pretty and
       well-cultivated country to Chilian, which derives its name
       from an Indian word, signifying 'saddle of the sun,' and is
       so called from the fact that the sun shines upon it through
       a saddle-shaped pass in the chain of the Andes.</p>

    <p>Like Concepcion, the existing town has been recently built
    at a distance of about a mile from the remains of the old place
    of the same name, which was overthrown by an earthquake about
    thirty years ago. The destruction was, however, not so complete
    as in the case of Concepcion, and some few of the
    better-conditioned houses are still inhabited by very poor
    people, though the walls have great cracks in them from top to
    bottom, and they are otherwise in a deplorable state. A large
    cattle and horse market is held at Chilian every Saturday, and
    it is said that, on these occasions, 100,000 dollars frequently
    change hands in the course of the morning, in the open
    market-place. All the business of the day was over by the time
    we got there, and there was nothing to be seen but a few stray
    beasts and quaint bullock-carts, and some peasants selling
    refreshments, <i>mi&ntilde;aque</i> lace, and other trifles. In
    several of the old-fashioned shops on the Plaza there were
    curious-looking stirrups, bits, spurs, and other horse-gear,
    all made of solid silver, roughly worked by the Indians
    themselves.</p>

    <p>Having had our baths, we returned to the hotel, where we
    found dinner laid out in my bed-room, which happened to be the
    largest, for our host did not approve of our dining at the
    table-d'h&ocirc;te, as we should have preferred to do. He gave
    us an excellent dinner, with good wine, and attended to us most
    assiduously himself.</p>

    <p>While the gentlemen were smoking, I went to see a poor
    engine-driver who had met with a bad accident,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 166<a name="Page_166"
       id="Page_166"></a></span>and who was lying at this hotel. He
       is a fine healthy-looking Englishman, and he told me that,
       until this misfortune, he had never known a day's illness in
       his life. It seems that, at four o'clock in the afternoon of
       this day week, he was sent off with a special engine to
       convey an important message. Something going wrong during
       the journey, he slackened speed, and, in stepping off the
       engine to see what was the matter, his foot slipped, and the
       wheel of the tender went over it. He had no one with him who
       could manage the engine alone, so he was obliged to get up
       again, and endeavour to struggle on to Talca; but after
       going a few miles further, the engine suddenly ran off the
       track, at a part of the unfinished line that had not yet
       been sufficiently ballasted. They could not get it on again
       unaided, and one of the men had to start off and walk many
       miles before he could procure assistance. Altogether, poor
       Clarke underwent forty-two hours of intense agony from the
       time of the accident until he received any medical
       attention. In spite of this he is now doing well; and though
       the foot, which is in a bath of carbolic acid and water,
       looks very bad, he is in great spirits, because the three
       local doctors, in consultation, have decided that amputation
       will not be necessary. He spoke in the highest terms of the
       kindness of our French host and his Spanish wife, the latter
       of whom, he says, has nursed him like a mother. He certainly
       has the one large room in the house, and when I saw him his
       bed was comfortably made and arranged, flowers and fruit
       were on a table by his side, and everything looked as neat
       and snug as possible. It was a treat to him to see some one
       fresh from the old country, and to hear all the news, and
       our voyage appeared to interest him greatly. While I was
       with him one of his friends came in, who remembered me quite
       well, and who knew one or two people with whom we are
       acquainted, including the manager of Messrs. Bowdler and
       Chaffers' yard, where the 'Sunbeam' was built.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, October 22nd</i>.&mdash;Though it was Sunday, we
    had no choice but to travel on, or we should not have been able
    to start until Tuesday. We were therefore up at five o'clock,
    and at the station before seven. From San Carlos, where we
    arrived at 8.15 a.m., we started for Linares, which was reached
    a couple of hours later. It is a much smaller town than
    Chilian, but is built on exactly the same plan&mdash;Plaza,
    cathedral, and all. To-day the streets were crowded with men on
    horseback, who had brought their wives in, seated
    pillion-fashion on the crupper behind them, to attend mass.</p>

    <p>Our road lay through a rich country, intersected by small
    rivers; with the distant snowy chain of the Andes as a
    background, and through thickly planted groves of poplars,
    growing in long shady avenues, fragrant with perfume from the
    magnificent roses which blossomed beneath their shade. In the
    course of our four hours' drive, we crossed a great many
    streams, in some of which the water was deep enough to come in
    at the bottom of the carriage, and cause us to tuck ourselves
    up on the seats; there was always a little pleasing excitement
    and doubt, as we approached one of these rivulets, as to
    whether we were to be inundated or not. We met a good many
    people riding and walking about in their holiday clothes, and
    at all the cabarets groups of talkers, drinkers, and players
    were assembled.</p>

    <p>The cottages we have seen by the roadside have been
    picturesque but wretched-looking edifices, generally composed
    of the branches of trees stuck in the ground, plastered with
    mud and thatched with reeds. Two outhouses, or arbours,
    consisting of a few posts and sticks, fastened together and
    overgrown with roses and other flowers, serve respectively as a
    cool sitting-room and a kitchen, the oven being invariably
    built on the ground <span class="pagenum">Page
    168<a name="Page_168"
       id="Page_168"></a></span>outside the latter, for the sake of
       coolness. The women, when young, are singularly
       good-looking, with dark complexions, bright eyes, and
       luxuriant tresses, which they wear in two plaits, hanging
       down their backs far below the waist. The men are also, as a
       rule, fine-looking. In fact, the land is good, and everybody
       and everything looks prosperous. The beasts are up to their
       knees in rich pasture, are fat and sleek, and lie down to
       chew the cud of contentment, instead of searching anxiously
       for a scanty sustenance. The horses are well fed, and their
       coats are fine and glossy, and the sheep, pigs, and other
       animals are in equally good condition. It is therefore a
       cheery country to travel through, and at this spring-time of
       the year one sees it in its highest perfection.</p>

    <p>Before reaching Talca we had to cross the Maule, a wide,
    deep river, with a swift current. The carriage was first put on
    board a large flat-bottomed boat, into which the horses then
    jumped, one by one, the last to embark tumbling down and
    rolling among the legs of the others. With a large oar the boat
    was steered across the stream, down which it drifted about 200
    yards into shallow water, where the boatmen jumped out and
    towed us to a convenient landing-place. Here we found several
    people waiting to be ferried over. A troop of mules having been
    driven into the water, which they seemed rather to enjoy, swam
    across safely, though they were carried some distance down the
    river.</p>

    <p>About five o'clock we arrived at Talca, and went straight to
    the Hotel Colon, kept by Gassaroni. Every Italian who starts an
    hotel in this part of the world calls it, as a matter of
    course, 'The Columbus Hotel;' for they are very anxious to
    claim the great navigator as a countryman, though the Spaniards
    dispute their right to do so, on the ground that Genoa, where
    he was really born, was at that time an independent State.
    While we were waiting for dinner we walked about the town,
    which so exactly <span class="pagenum">Page
    169<a name="Page_169"
       id="Page_169"></a></span>resembles Concepcion and Chilian in
       the arrangement of its streets, buildings, and trees, that I
       doubt whether any one familiar with the three places could
       tell immediately which town he was in, if transported
       suddenly to the middle of the Plaza, though I believe Talca
       is rather the largest. It still retains its old Indian name,
       meaning 'thunder,' doubtless on account of the frequency and
       violence of the thunder-storms by which it is visited.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, October 23rd</i>.&mdash;Soon after midnight I was
    aroused by a great noise. At first I thought I was dreaming,
    but a very brief reflection convinced me of the existence of an
    energetically played big-drum, somewhere in the immediate
    neighbourhood of my bed-room. I at once got up and, peeping
    through the window in the door, saw a military band of
    twenty-five performers, standing on the other side of the
    courtyard, blowing and hitting their hardest. It must be
    confessed that they played well, and that their selection of
    music was good, but it was, nevertheless, rather annoying,
    after a long and fatiguing day, and with the prospect of an
    early start, to be kept awake until half-past three in the
    morning, while they serenaded and toasted the <i>prima
    donna</i>, and each of the other members of the theatrical
    company who are staying here. The noise was, of course,
    increased by the reverberation from the walls of the courtyard,
    and, finding it impossible to sleep, I abandoned the attempt,
    and took to writing instead. At last the welcome notes of the
    Chilian national air gave me hope that the entertainment was
    over for the night&mdash;or rather morning&mdash;and soon
    afterwards all was once more quiet.</p>

    <p>We left Talca by the 7.30 train, Mr. Budge, who had business
    at Curico, accompanying us. All the engines and rolling stock
    this side of Santiago are of American make and pattern. Mr.
    Budge had secured one of the long cars, with a passage down the
    centre, and a saloon at each end, for us, so we were very
    comfortable, and he told us a great deal about the country as
    we went along. Like all <span class="pagenum">Page
    170<a name="Page_170"
       id="Page_170"></a></span>Chilenos, he is very patriotic, and
       is especially proud of the financial stability of his
       country. He often said,' If English people would only invest
       their money here, instead of in Peru or the Argentine
       Republic, they would get eight per cent, on good security.'
       We heard the same thing from many other sources; and it
       certainly does seem that this country is the most settled,
       and the least liable to be disturbed by revolutions, of any
       in South America. At Curico<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
       id="FNanchor_7_7"></a> <a href="#Footnote_7_7"
       class="fnanchor">[7]</a> we breakfasted at a little
       restaurant on Chilian dishes and the wine of the country.
       The latter is excellent and of various kinds, but it is so
       cheap that none of the innkeepers can be persuaded to supply
       it to travellers, whose only chance of tasting it,
       therefore, is at some small inn.</p>

        having reference to the mineral springs in the neighbouring
        mountains.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Mr. Budge left us at Pelequen, the next station to San
    Fernando, having put us in charge of the conductor, who
    promised to see after us at Cauquenes, but who wofully betrayed
    his trust. There was no regular station at the latter place,
    but as the train stopped, and we saw 'Bains de Cauquenes' on an
    hotel close by, we jumped out just in time to see it go on
    again. Luckily the other passengers were kind enough to
    interest themselves on our behalf, and shrieked and hallooed to
    such good purpose that the engine was once more brought to a
    standstill, and our luggage was put out. Half-a-dozen little
    boys carried it to the inn, where I had to explain to the
    <i>patron</i>, in my best Spanish, that we wanted a carriage to
    go to the baths, seven leagues off. In a wonderfully short
    space of time, four good horses were harnessed to a queer sort
    of vehicle, which held four inside and one out, besides the
    driver, and which had to be entered by means of a ladder.
    Having all packed in, and paid our fare beforehand, we were
    rattled off at a merry pace towards the Andes. The road went up
    and down and round about, and crossed
    <span class="pagenum">Page 171<a name="Page_171"
       id="Page_171"></a></span>many rivers, but was fairly good
       throughout. We changed once at a large hacienda, where a man
       went into a large yard, containing about sixty horses, and
       dexterously lassoed the particular four required for our
       use. Several horsemen were waiting about, and I looked at
       their saddles, which were made of a dozen or more
       sheepskins, laid one on the top of the other, forming a soft
       seat to ride in by day and a comfortable bed to sleep on at
       night.</p>

    <p>Early in the afternoon we saw some buildings in the
    distance, which we rightly guessed to be the baths, and soon
    afterwards we passed in at the entrance gate of the
    establishment, by the side of which was a rock with the word
    'Welcome' painted upon its face. The whole distance from the
    station was twenty-three miles, which we had accomplished in a
    little over two hours. Driving between hedgerows of roses in
    full bloom, we were not long in <span class="pagenum">Page
    172<a name="Page_172"
       id="Page_172"></a></span>reaching the door of the hotel,
       where we were received by the proprietor. He told us he was
       very full, but he managed to find us some small rooms, and
       then conducted us to the luxuriously fitted bathing
       establishment. After this came the table-d'h&ocirc;te, to
       which about seventy sat down, though many of the visitors
       were dining in their own rooms. In the evening we walked
       about the garden and chatted with several people, who all
       seemed to have heard of us and our voyage, and to be anxious
       to know what we thought of the Straits. We saw some English
       papers too, which was a great treat, though there did not
       seem to be much news in them.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, October 24th</i>.&mdash;This is a wonderful
    place, built entirely of wood. The centre part is a square,
    seventy yards in extent, surrounded by a single row of
    one-storied rooms, with doors opening into the courtyard, and
    windows looking over the river or up into the mountains. In the
    middle of the square are a pavilion containing two
    billiard-tables, a boot-blacking arbour, covered with white and
    yellow jessamine and scarlet and cream-coloured honeysuckle,
    plenty of flower-beds, full of roses and orange-trees, and a
    monkey on a pole, who must, poor creature, have a sorry life of
    it, as it is his business to afford amusement to all the
    visitors to the baths. He is very good-tempered, does several
    tricks, and is tormented 'from early dawn to dewy eve.' I
    remonstrated with our host on his behalf; but he merely
    shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Mais il faut que le monde se
    divertisse, Madame.' From the centre square, marble steps lead
    to a large hall, with marble baths on either side, for ladies
    and gentlemen respectively. A few steps further bring one to a
    delightful swimming-bath, about forty feet square, filled with
    tepid water. The water, as it springs from the rock, is boiling
    hot, and contains, I believe, a good deal of magnesia and other
    salts, beneficial in cases of rheumatism and gout; but the high
    temperature of the water makes the air very
    <span class="pagenum">Page 173<a name="Page_173"
       id="Page_173"></a></span>muggy, and we all found the place
       relaxing, though perhaps it was because we indulged too
       freely in the baths, which are a great temptation.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon we went for a ride, to see a celebrated
    view of the Andes. Unfortunately it was rather misty, but we
    could see enough to enable us to imagine the rest. Some condors
    were soaring round the rocky peaks, and the landscape, though
    well clothed with vegetation, had a weird, dreary character of
    its own, partly due to the quantity of large cacti that grew in
    every nook and corner, singly, or in groups of ten or twelve,
    to the height of twenty or thirty feet. Though they say it
    hardly ever rains in Chili, a heavy shower fell this afternoon,
    and our <span class="pagenum">Page 174<a name="Page_174"
       id="Page_174"></a></span>landlord thoughtfully sent a boy on
       horseback after us with umbrellas.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, October 25th</i>.&mdash;The bath was so
    delightful this morning, that we felt quite sorry it was to be
    our last. One could very well spend a week or two here, and
    find plenty to do in the way of excursions into the valleys of
    the Andes, which look most inviting in the distance.</p>

    <p>At half-past ten, we set out on our return journey to the
    railway, changing horses at the same place where we had stopped
    at coming up, and which we reached half an hour before the
    train was due; when it arrived we were allowed to get in with
    our belongings in rather a less hurried fashion than we had
    alighted. Luncheon was procured at Rancagua, and we finally
    reached Santiago at about 4.50 p.m. No sooner had we got fairly
    into the station than the car was invaded by a crowd of Porters
    touting for employment. They are all dressed in white, and wear
    red caps, on which is a brass number, by means of which they
    are easily recognised. The landlord from the Hotel Ingles, M.
    Tellier, met us, and we at once drove off, leaving our luggage
    to follow, in charge of one of the red-capped gentlemen. The
    drive from the station was along the Alameda, on either side of
    which were many fine houses; but the road was ill-paved and
    shaky as usual.</p>

    <p>The Grand Hotel, which used to be considered the best in
    South America, is now shut up, the company who owned it having
    recently failed; so all the smaller hotels, none
    <span class="pagenum">Page 175<a name="Page_175"
       id="Page_175"></a></span>of which are very good, are crowded
       to overflowing. The Hotel Ingles is considered the best,
       though I cannot say much in its favour. The rooms are good,
       but the situation is noisy, being at the corner of two
       streets; the servants are attentive, but the cuisine and
       arrangements are bad. Independently of all this, we have
       great reason to complain of the conduct of the landlord, for
       my first question, as soon as he had introduced himself,
       was, of course, 'Have Mr. and Miss Brassey arrived?' 'Yes,
       Madame, and went away this morning.' 'What! and left no
       letter?' 'No; but Monsieur returns to-morrow.' Imagine my
       surprise and disappointment! But there was nothing to be
       done but to go to the hotel and wait patiently. We
       afterwards found that <i>Tom had left a long letter, and
       that he had never said a word about returning</i>. The
       wretched man would not give me the letter, because he
       thought he could detain us, and he never sent the telegram I
       handed to him to forward to Tom at once, asking for an
       answer.</p>

    <p>Our luggage arrived just in time to enable us to dress for
    the second table-d'h&ocirc;te at six o'clock, after which we
    went for a walk through some arcades, paved with marble, and
    full of fine shops, past the Grand Hotel, which was situated at
    the end of the Alameda, and is built over an
    <span class="pagenum">Page 176<a name="Page_176"
       id="Page_176"></a></span>arcade of shops. It is a handsome
       building, and must command a fine view. The cathedral and
       the archbishop's palace, large but rather dull-looking brick
       buildings, are close by. The surrounding gardens looked
       pretty by gaslight, and the scent of roses pervaded the
       evening air.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, October 26th</i>.&mdash;Our kind hostess at
    Lota had given us a letter of introduction to her manager at
    Santiago, who called this morning to inquire what arrangements
    he could make which would be most agreeable to us during our
    stay. She had also given orders that her carriages and horses
    should be placed at our disposal, and at about ten o'clock we
    all started in an open break, drawn by a pair of good-looking
    half-bred brown horses, bigger than any we had seen before in
    this country.</p>

    <p>We went first to the Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a, a large open
    square, planted with flowers, the site of the old Jesuit
    Church, which was burnt down on December 8th, 1863. Well known
    as the story is, I may here recall the tragic details, standing
    on the very spot where they took place. It was the Feast of the
    Virgin, and the church was densely crowded with a congregation
    composed almost <span class="pagenum">Page
    178<a name="Page_178"
       id="Page_178"></a></span>entirely of women, principally
       young, many of whom were servant-girls. Some of the
       draperies used in the decoration of the building caught
       fire, the flames spread rapidly, destroying in their course
       the cords by which the numerous paraffin and oil lamps were
       suspended across the nave and aisles, and precipitating
       their burning contents upon the people beneath. The great
       doors opened inwards; the crowd, trying to press out, closed
       them, and kept them hermetically sealed. The priests,
       anxious to save the church properties and sacred relics,
       shut the large iron gates across the chancel and kept them
       fastened, notwithstanding the agonising shrieks of the
       unhappy victims, many of whom might otherwise have escaped.
       Their conduct on this terrible occasion created at the time
       a feeling of bitter and universal indignation, and caused a
       shock to the popularity and authority of the priesthood in
       this country, from which it will take them a long time to
       recover.</p>

    <p>Mr. Long told us that, between seven and eight o'clock on
    the evening of the catastrophe, he was walking with some
    friends on the Alameda, when he saw smoke rising in dense
    volumes from the quarter of the city where the house in which
    he resided was situated. He and his friends ran quickly in the
    direction of the fire, giving the alarm as they went, and on
    reaching the church they found the doors closely shut, while
    fearful screams were issuing from the interior, and smoke and
    flames pouring from the windows. They got a party of men
    together accustomed to the use of the lasso&mdash;no difficult
    task here&mdash;and with them climbed from the neighbouring
    houses to the top of the church. Making a hole in the roof,
    they then dropped their lassoes over some of the women beneath,
    and so dragged them out of the building; but the number thus
    saved was necessarily very small, and it happened too often
    that many of the poor creatures below, in their eagerness to
    escape, hung on to the legs or body of the one they saw
    lassoed, and by their weight literally dragged
    <span class="pagenum">Page 179<a name="Page_179"
       id="Page_179"></a></span>her to pieces. Sometimes even a
       lasso broke, and those clinging to it, when almost within
       reach of safety, were again precipitated into the burning
       mass below. Any one who has seen a raw hide lasso, capable
       of withstanding the sudden rush of the fiercest bull ever
       captured, will be able to realise the immense strain which
       would be required to cause one to give way. The next morning
       at daybreak, the interior of the church presented a terrible
       spectacle. Mr. Long described it as being full of women,
       standing up, tightly wedged together, their hands stretched
       out as if in an attitude of supplication, their faces and
       the upper part of their bodies charred beyond recognition,
       the lower part, from the waist downwards, completely
       untouched.</p>

    <p>Their remains were buried in one large grave, in the
    cemetery of the Recoleta, and the spot is now marked by a
    square piece of ground, full of bright flowers, enclosed by
    iron railings, almost hidden by the creepers that entwine them,
    and shaded by willows, orange-trees, cypresses, and
    pomegranates. In the centre is a large cross, and on either
    side of the iron railings there is a marble tablet with the
    simple but touching inscription, in Spanish&mdash;</p>

    <p>Almost every household in Santiago had lost one of its
    members. One lovely girl of seventeen was pulled out through
    the roof and taken to Madame Cousi&ntilde;o's residence, where
    she lay for nearly a fortnight. She suffered the greatest
    agonies, but was sensible to the last, and gave a graphic
    account of the whole harrowing scene. The site of the church,
    hallowed by such sad memories, has never been built upon, but
    is preserved as an open space, <span class="pagenum">Page
    180<a name="Page_180"
       id="Page_180"></a></span>surrounded by a strip of garden,
       and having in its centre a finely carved monument.</p>

    <p>The Houses of Congress were the next thing we went to see,
    after which we drove through a great part of the city and over
    a handsome bridge with statues and small niches on either side.
    Beneath it, however, there is little more than a dry torrent
    bed; and it is said that an American, when visiting this spot
    with a Santiago friend, who was showing him round, remarked, 'I
    guess you ought either to buy a river or sell this here
    bridge.' We also went to the Church of La Recoleta. From the
    church we went to the cemetery of the same name, which is
    prettily laid out, and well stocked with flowers and trees.</p>

    <p>It being now past eleven o'clock, we began to think about
    breakfast, and accordingly returned to the hotel, where I was
    disappointed to find no news from Tom and no answer to the
    telegram I sent last night.</p>

    <p>At one o'clock we started again, and had a pleasant but
    rather dusty drive of eight miles to Macul, the stud-farm
    established by the late Don Luis Cousi&ntilde;o.</p>

    <p>We had some luncheon at Mr. Canning's house, in a room that
    had recently been split from top to bottom by an earthquake,
    and afterwards sat in the verandah to see the horses and some
    of the cattle, which were brought round for our inspection.
    Amongst them were Fanfaron, Fandango, and other beautiful
    thoroughbreds, three fine Cleveland coach-horses, Suffolk
    cart-horses and percherons, and some of the young stock. We saw
    only a few of the beasts, as at this time they are away feeding
    on the hills, but I believe they are as good as the horses. Mr.
    Long had arranged for us all to ride round the farm, and I was
    mounted on a lovely chestnut mare, sixteen hands high, daughter
    of Fanfaron, and niece to Kettledrum. I should have liked to
    have bought her and sent her home, but she was not for sale,
    though her value was 400<i>l</i>. English horses here are as
    dear, in proportion, as native horses are
    <span class="pagenum">Page 181<a name="Page_181"
       id="Page_181"></a></span>cheap. The latter may be bought for
       from twenty to sixty dollars apiece; and some of them make
       capital little hacks.</p>

    <p>We rode all over the farm, attended by half-a-dozen peones,
    who drove the young thoroughbred stock together, in the
    enormous fields, for us to see, and afterwards did the same
    thing with some of the cattle. We also went through the farm
    buildings, in one part of which we saw the operation of making
    lassoes. The best are composed of neatly plaited strips of
    cured hide, about a quarter of an inch wide, the commoner sort
    being made from an undressed cow's hide, with the hair on, cut
    from the centre in an ever-increasing circle, so that they are
    in one piece, many yards in length. In another part of the farm
    there were a few acres more of flower-gardens, orange-trees,
    and kitchen-gardens.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

             title="Illustration: What makes Horses go in Chili" />
    </div>

    <p>Beautiful as the whole place is, it loses much in interest
    from its vastness. You never seem to know where you are, or
    when you have come to an end. I hear that Madame Cousi&ntilde;o
    talks of extending the park still further, right up into the
    mountains, which seems almost a pity, as it is already too big
    to be kept in really perfect order, even with a hundred and
    twenty men employed upon it. Everything is completely
    surrounded and overgrown with flowers. Even the fields are
    separated by hedges of sweet-smelling double pink roses, and
    these hedges are larger than many a 'bull-finch' in the old
    country.</p>

    <p>After a delightful gallop of about two hours, we returned to
    the farmhouse, where we found a fresh pair of horses waiting
    for us in the break, and drove back to Santiago by
    moonlight.</p>

    <p>It was eight o'clock when we reached the hotel, and as the
    table-d'h&ocirc;te dinner only lasts from five till half-past
    <span class="pagenum">Page 182<a name="Page_182"
       id="Page_182"></a></span> seven, I asked for a private
       dinner in our own room or in the general dining-room, for
       our own party and two guests in addition. But the landlord
       said he was not at all sure about giving us dinner; he must
       see what there was in the kitchen first. We then declared we
       would go and dine at a cafe, and in less than half an hour
       managed to get an excellent little dinner at the Cafe
       Santiago, though even Mr. Long, who ordered it for us, could
       not induce them to give us native wine. I am bound to
       confess, however, that we punished ourselves at least as
       much as the landlord, for as we paid so much a day for board
       and lodging, he was of course bound to provide us with
       dinner, and we had thus to pay for our food twice over.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, October 27th</i>.&mdash;Still no news from Tom.
    Mr. Long called at half-past eight, to take me to the market,
    and my first step was to send another telegram, this time
    taking care to see that it really was despatched.</p>

    <p>We then walked through the streets to the market-hall, a
    handsome iron building, commodiously arranged, which was sent
    out from England in pieces, and put together here. All round it
    are stalls, where you can get a capital breakfast, generally
    consisting of coffee, tender beef-steak, buttered toast, and
    boiled beans, for a small sum. One of our party, who had been
    at the market since half-past five, tried one, and fully
    confirmed the report we had heard as to their excellence and
    cleanliness. At the time of our visit all these refreshment
    stalls were crowded, and I felt rather tempted to join one of
    the hungry merry-looking groups myself. The market was well
    supplied with meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, and flowers of all
    kinds, green peas, French beans, and strawberries being
    specially abundant. There were quantities of queer-looking
    baskets to be seen, and some curious pottery, made by the nuns
    from a kind of cement. Outside the building there were men and
    women hanging about with ponchos, of their own manufacture,
    which they had brought in from the country, for
    <span class="pagenum">Page 183<a name="Page_183"
       id="Page_183"></a></span> sale. We bought some bright
       specimens as presents for the children, but it took some
       time to collect them, as each individual had only one to
       offer. They are the work of the women, in the intervals of
       household labour, and as soon as one is completed it is
       sold, in order that materials for a fresh one may be
       purchased. We also bought some of the carved wooden
       stirrups, made in the country, and used by all the natives.
       They are rather like a small coalscuttle in shape, and must
       be heavy and cumbersome.</p>

    <p>From the market we went to hear high mass at the cathedral.
    This is a fine building, though the interior seemed very dark.
    The high altar was illuminated by hundreds of candles, whose
    light shone on a crowd of kneeling women, all dressed in black,
    and with black veils over their heads, the contrast between
    their sombre appearance and the gilding and paintings on the
    walls&mdash;handsome at a distance, but tawdry on a closer
    examination&mdash;being very striking. The organ is of splendid
    tone and quality and reverberated grandly through the aisles,
    and the whole scene was not without a certain impressiveness. I
    had not thought of paying a visit to the cathedral when I went
    out this morning, and it was not until I saw every one staring
    at me that I remembered I had committed the terrible mistake of
    going to church in a hat, and without any veil; but we remained
    in a dark corner most of the time, and emerged into open
    daylight again before any of the authorities of the place had
    time to observe or remonstrate with me. My wearing a hat was,
    however, quite as much against all church rules as a similar
    proceeding on the part of a man would have been. The women of
    this city are almost always good-looking when young, and they
    glide gracefully about the streets in their long black clinging
    gowns and <i>mantos</i>, by which they are completely enveloped
    from head to foot.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon we went for a drive in the park, and to see
    Santa Lucia, of which, as the only hill in Santiago, the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 184<a name="Page_184"
       id="Page_184"></a></span> inhabitants of the city are very
       proud, and from thence drove to the Cousi&ntilde;o Park, an
       extensive piece of ground near the Alameda, laid out and
       arranged under the direction of the late Don Luis
       Cousi&ntilde;o, and presented by him to the city of
       Santiago.</p>

    <p>After a stroll round the park, Mr. Long took us to an
    emporium for Panama hats, which are made in Lima, Guayaquil,
    and other states of Chili, as well as in Panama, from a special
    kind of grass, split very fine, and worn by almost everybody on
    this coast. The best made cost 340 dollars, or about sixty
    guineas, and fifty pounds is not at all an uncommon price to
    pay, though the inferior kind may be had for two pounds. Those
    ordinarily worn by the gentlemen here cost from twenty to
    thirty pounds each, but they are so light, pliable, and elastic
    that they will wear for ever, wash like a pocket-handkerchief,
    do not get burnt by the sun, and can be rolled up and sat
    upon&mdash;in fact, ill-treated in any way you
    like&mdash;without fear of their breaking, tearing, or getting
    out of shape. For the yacht, however, where so many hats are
    lost overboard, they would, I fear, prove a rather unprofitable
    investment.</p>

    <p>We now drove back to the hotel, past the Mint, a handsome
    building, guarded by soldiers, and with windows protected by
    iron gratings. On our return I found that one of the valuable
    ponchos, given to me in the Argentine Republic, had been taken
    from our room. The landlord declined to trouble himself about
    its recovery, as he said it was 'most unlikely that any one
    would take a thing of no value to him here;' the real truth
    being that the guanaco ponchos are worth nearly double as much
    in Chili as they are on the other side of the Andes.</p>

    <p>After dinner we walked to the theatre, where we saw <i>La
    Sonnambula</i> well put on the stage, and well sung and acted
    by an Italian opera company. The <i>prima donna</i>, contralto,
    baritone, and bass were all good, but the scenery was
    occasionally somewhat deficient. The house, which
    <span class="pagenum">Page 185<a name="Page_185"
       id="Page_185"></a></span>is highly decorated&mdash;perhaps
       too much so for the ladies' dresses&mdash;looked well by
       night, though if it had been full the effect would have been
       still better. The box-tiers are not divided into
       pigeon-holes, as they are with us, and everybody can
       therefore see equally well. The Presidential box seemed
       commodious and handsome, and had the Chilian coat of arms in
       front of it, making it look very much like a Royal box.</p>

    <p>The walk back by moonlight was delightful. Some of our party
    afterwards went to the Union Club, where they met several
    English gentlemen, who were most kind and pressing in their
    invitations to them to stay a few days longer, and go up the
    mountains to see the views and to have some guanaco shooting.
    About twenty-four hours from here they say you can have your
    first shot, and a little further on you meet them in herds
    which may be counted by thousands. There are also wild horses
    and wild donkeys. Quaggas and huemuls used to be found, but are
    now extinct. The last named is a rare animal, exactly
    resembling a horse in every particular, except that its hoofs
    are cloven. It used only to be found in the mountains of Chili,
    and it is one of the supporters of the national coat of
    arms.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, October 28th</i>.&mdash;At 5 a.m. we were
    called, and soon afterwards parting gifts of flowers began to
    arrive, and even I was obliged to confess that four large
    clothes-baskets full of rosebuds were more than I quite knew
    what to do with. At seven Mr. Long came to know if he could
    help us in any way, and a little later Madame Cousi&ntilde;o's
    coachman appeared with the carriage, to take us to the
    station.</p>

    <p>We had a pleasant drive down the Alameda, the sun shining
    brilliantly in a bright blue sky, and the distant mountains for
    the first time being clearly visible. The station was crowded
    with vendors of pottery, curious things in buffalo horn,
    sweetmeats, &amp;c. The rolling stock on this line is of
    English manufacture, and we were therefore put into the too
    familiar, close, stuffy, first-class carriage, and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 186<a name="Page_186"
       id="Page_186"></a></span>duly locked up for the journey down
       to Valparaiso. The line, running as it does through mountain
       gorges for a great portion of the way, must have been a
       difficult one to make.</p>

    <p>Just now the whole country wears a golden tint from the
    bloom of the espinosa, which seems to grow everywhere, and
    which is now in perfection. The branches of this shrub are so
    completely covered with little yellow balls of flowers, which
    come before the leaves, and which have no separate stalk, but
    grow along the shiny, horny branches, that they look as if they
    were made of gold. It is called the 'burning bush' here, and
    its wood is said to be the hardest in the country. The flowers
    are often plucked off and dried, in which state they are most
    fragrant and are used for scenting linen and for keeping away
    moths. The thorns, however, are a terrible nuisance to the
    shepherds and owners of cattle, catching their clothes and
    tearing them as they gallop swiftly across over the plains. If
    I bore you by saying too much about the flowers, forgive me. I
    want to make you all realise, if possible, what a lovely
    flowery land Chili is. The whole air is quite perfumed with
    roses, principally large double pink roses, something like the
    old-fashioned cabbage rose, though there are a good many of the
    monthly kind and a few white and deep scarlet ones. They formed
    hedgerows on either side of the road, and in many places
    climbed thirty or forty feet up the trees, and then threw down
    long brambles laden with bloom, almost producing the effect of
    a wall of pink. There were also plenty of wild flowers of other
    sorts, such as scarlet and white lilies, larkspurs,
    eschscholtzias, evening primroses, and many others whose names
    I do not know.</p>

    <p>At Llaillai we stopped for breakfast, procured at a small
    restaurant at the station. While waiting for the train for
    Santiago to come in, we had plenty of time to observe the
    half-Indian girls selling fruit, flowers, cakes, &amp;c., and
    jabbering away in a sort of <i>patois</i> Spanish, in
    recommendation <span class="pagenum">Page 187<a name="Page_187"
       id="Page_187"></a></span>of their wares. Some of them were
       really pretty, and all were picturesquely dressed in
       bright-coloured stuffs, their hair neatly done up and
       decorated with flowers, their faces clean and smiling. At
       11.15 a.m. we reached Quillota, where the train was
       literally besieged by men, women, and children, offering
       bouquets for sale&mdash;two or three of which were thrust in
       at every carriage window&mdash;and baskets of strawberries,
       cherimoyas, nisperos, melons, oranges, sugar-cane, plantain,
       bananas, asparagus, green peas, French beans, eggs,
       chickens, and even fish&mdash;nice little pejereyes, fresh
       from the stream close by. It must evidently be the custom of
       the Chilenos to visit by rail these fertile districts, for
       the purpose of doing their marketing; for the occupants of
       the train soon absorbed the entire stock of the vendors, who
       were left with empty baskets.</p>

    <p>I never saw such a country as this is for eggs and chickens.
    A hen seems never to have a smaller brood than ten, and I have
    often counted from seventeen to twenty-one chickens with the
    mother, and, more than once, as many as twenty-four. However
    well you may have breakfasted or dined, the waiters always come
    at the end of the meal to ask, not <i>whether</i> you will have
    any eggs, but <i>how</i> you will have them&mdash;fried,
    boiled, poached, or in some sort of omelette. If you refuse
    altogether, the chances are that two very lightly boiled eggs
    will be placed by your side, with the suggestion that you
    should beat them up and drink them. The inhabitants of the
    country always seem to finish their meals with eggs in some
    form or another.</p>

    <p>The celebrated 'Bell of Quillota,' a mountain which derives
    its name from its peculiar shape, and which serves as a good
    landmark in entering the harbour of Valparaiso, is well seen
    from the railway, a little below Quillota Station. We stopped
    again at Limache, a little village, situated in the midst of a
    fertile country, about twenty-five miles from Valparaiso, where
    fruit, flowers, &amp;c., were as freely offered for sale as
    before, and again at Vi&ntilde;a del Mar, the next
    <span class="pagenum">Page 188<a name="Page_188"
       id="Page_188"></a></span>station to Valparaiso. There is a
       good hotel here, in the midst of a pretty garden, where you
       can get an excellent breakfast or dinner.</p>

    <p>From this spot the line runs close along the edge of the
    sea, and we strained our eyes in vain, trying to discover the
    yacht. At the station we were assailed by porters and touts of
    every description, but, seeing no one to meet us, and not
    knowing where to go, we contented ourselves with collecting our
    luggage in a little heap, while a fight went on close by
    between a policeman and a coachman, who had been too persistent
    in his endeavours to obtain a fare. They knocked one another
    about a good deal, and broke one or two windows, after which
    they appeared quite satisfied, shook hands, and were good
    friends again. Tom, Mabelle, and Muriel arrived before it was
    over, and we were very glad to meet again after our short
    absence.</p>

    <p>A long, dusty drive brought us to the mole, and while the
    luggage was being packed into the boat, Tom and I went to call
    on the British Consul, where we found some letters. We were on
    board in time for two o'clock luncheon, after which, amid many
    interruptions from visitors, we devoured our news from home and
    other parts&mdash;for amongst our letters were some from Natal,
    India, Japan, Canada, Teneriffe, South American ports, St.
    Petersburg, Constantinople, and several other places, besides
    those from dear old England.</p>

    <p>About four o'clock Tom and I went ashore. We had intended
    going alone in the 'Flash' (our lightest boat), but a strong
    southerly wind had sprung up, which at once made the sea so
    rough that we went in the 'Gleam' (the gig) instead, with six
    oars. It took the men all their time to get us ashore, though
    we had not far to go, for wind, tide, and waves were all
    against us.</p>

    <p>Valparaiso consists mainly of two interminable streets,
    running along the edge of the sea, at the foot of the hills,
    which rise immediately behind them, and on which
    <span class="pagenum">Page 189<a name="Page_189"
       id="Page_189"></a></span>are built all the residences and
       villas of the gentlemen of the place. Very few live in the
       town itself, which is composed almost entirely of large
       warehouses and fine shops, where you can get almost anything
       you want by paying between three and four times as much for
       it as you would do in England. For instance, the charge for
       hair-cutting is a dollar and a half (4s.), a
       three-and-sixpenny Letts's Diary costs two dollars and a
       half (10s.), a tall hat costs fifty-eight shillings, you
       must pay sixpence each for parchment luggage-labels,
       threepence apiece for quill pens, four shillings for a quire
       of common notepaper, and so on in proportion.</p>

    <p>We had, as I have said, seen the yacht leave Lota Bay, with
    a strong head-wind blowing, on Thursday, the 19th instant. In a
    few hours the wind fell to a calm, which then changed to a
    light favourable breeze, and the 'Sunbeam' reached Valparaiso
    on the following Saturday afternoon, anchoring out in the bay,
    not far from H.M.S. 'Opal.' Here they rolled and tumbled about
    even more than if they had been at sea, the swinging capacities
    of the saloon tables and lamps being tried to the utmost. On
    Sunday half the men went ashore for a few hours' leave, but
    neither they nor the boat returned until the next morning, as
    they had not been allowed to leave the shore after nine
    o'clock. In the meantime Tom had been told that small-pox was
    raging in the town, and he was much annoyed at their having to
    pass the night on shore, owing to proper inquiries as to the
    regulations of the port not having been made by them on
    landing. The next day the doctor went to see some medical
    <i>confr&egrave;res</i> at the hospital, and found that the
    reports were much exaggerated, the reality being that small-pox
    is always more or less prevalent both here and at Santiago.
    Three months ago it was very bad, but at the present time it is
    not worse than usual. Tom and Mabelle started for Santiago on
    Monday, but unfortunately left their letters of introduction
    behind; and as they did <span class="pagenum">Page
    190<a name="Page_190"
       id="Page_190"></a></span> not like the hotel, they found it
       rather dull. We could not telegraph to them from Cauquenes,
       or anywhere <i>en route</i>, for there were no wires; so on
       Wednesday morning, not hearing or seeing anything of us,
       they returned to Valparaiso. Tom left a long letter for me,
       with enclosures (which I never received), in the innkeeper's
       hands, asking for a telegraphic reply as to our plans and
       intentions, and, as I have already mentioned, never said a
       word about coming back. Thursday was spent in seeing what
       little there is to see in Valparaiso, and in visiting the
       'Opal.' On Friday Tom went for a sail, moved the yacht close
       inshore, had a dinner-party on board, and went to a pleasant
       ball afterwards, given by the Philharmonic Society, an
       association of the same sort as the one at Rio. It was not,
       however, called a regular ball, but a <i>teriulia</i>, so
       the ladies were in <i>demi-toilette</i>. Tom described the
       room as good, the floor first-rate, the music excellent, the
       ladies good-looking, and the men agreeable. To-day he met us
       at the station with the children; and now, therefore, one
       account will describe the movements of the whole reunited
       party.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, October 29th</i>.&mdash;We all went ashore to
    church, having been told it was only five minutes' walk from
    the landing-place, instead of which it took us at least a
    quarter of an hour, in an intensely hot sun, to climb up a
    steep hill. The building itself was large, airy, and cool, and
    there is a good organ and choir, but most of the choristers had
    gone away to-day to a picnic in the country. During the Litany
    our attention was suddenly drawn to the fact that earthquakes
    are matters of frequent occurrence in this country, by a
    special prayer being offered up for preservation from them and
    their destructive effects.</p>

    <p>At four o'clock we went ashore for a ride, and having
    climbed the hills at the back of the town, which command
    extensive views over land and sea, we galloped across the downs
    and through some villages on to the old high road from
    Valparaiso to Santiago, along which we rode only
    <span class="pagenum">Page 191<a name="Page_191"
       id="Page_191"></a></span>for a few yards, turning off into a
       romantic valley, where the path was so narrow that we could
       barely squeeze through between the thickly growing shrubs
       and trees. At last we went up a steep hill on to another
       high road, and re-entered the town quite at the opposite end
       to that at which we had left it, after which a ride of two
       miles along the stony, ill-paved streets brought us to the
       landing-place.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, October 30th</i>.&mdash;We were to be off
    directly the sea-breeze sprang up, at about eleven o'clock, and
    as I had many letters to write, I was called at 4 a.m., and
    finished them all before breakfast at eight. But first one
    visitor and then another arrived, and it was nearly eleven
    o'clock when we landed to make the final preparations for
    starting on our long voyage of eleven thousand miles across the
    Pacific.</p>

    <p>Our route, as at present, arranged, will be vi&acirc; the
    Society, Friendly, and Sandwich Islands. Juan Fernandez
    (Robinson Crusoe's Island), which we at first thought of
    visiting, we have been obliged, I am sorry to say, to give up,
    not on account of its distance from Valparaiso, as it is only
    270 miles off, but because it lies too far to the southward,
    and is consequently quite out of the track of the trade wind,
    which we ought to pick up, according to the charts and sailing
    directions, about 500 miles to the northward and westward of
    this place. I have been trying to persuade Tom to steam out
    five or six hundred miles, so that we may make a quick passage
    and economise our time as much as possible, but he is anxious
    to do <i>the whole</i> voyage under sail, and we are therefore
    taking very little coal on board, in order to be in the best
    trim. If we do not pick up a wind, however, there is no knowing
    how long we may lollop about. I suppose till we are short of
    water and fresh provisions, when the fires will be lighted and
    we shall steam away to the nearest island&mdash;uninhabited, we
    will hope, or at any rate peopled by friendly
    <span class="pagenum">Page 192<a name="Page_192"
       id="Page_192"></a></span>natives, which is rather the
       exception than the rule in the south-east corner of the Low
       Archipelago. There we shall fill up with fresh water,
       bananas, bread-fruit, and perhaps a wild hog or two, and
       resume our voyage to Tahiti. But this is the least
       favourable view of the matter, and we must hope to fall in
       with the trades soon, and that they will blow strong and
       true.</p>

    <p>The island of Juan Fernandez now belongs to the Chilian
    government, but is let on a long lease to a man who, they say
    here, is somewhat of a robber. He was very desirous that we
    should give him a passage in the yacht, and another man wanted
    to come too, with some pointers, to show us the best spots for
    game, goats, turtle, crayfish, and sea-fish, with all of which
    the place abounds. Some cattle have also been introduced, and
    the island is much frequented by whalers, who go there for
    fresh provisions and water. There is nothing particular to be
    seen, however, and the scenery of the island is not remarkable;
    at least, so people who have been there tell us, and the
    photographs I have bought quite confirm their report. Admiral
    Simpson, who stayed there once for a fortnight, told us a good
    deal about the place, and strongly recommended us not to go
    there unless we had plenty of time to spare, as we should not
    be repaid for our trouble, which would probably only result in
    the dissipation of all our childish illusions.</p>

    <p>Our first step on landing this morning was to go to the
    Consul's to post our letters. By the bye, I hope people in
    England will appreciate them, for they cost between nine and
    ten pounds to send home. For our outward letters, although
    prepaid in England, we had to pay over eight pounds before we
    were allowed to have them from the office. Twenty-nine cases of
    stores, provisions, wine, &amp;c., which had also been sent
    out, all arrived safely, and cost comparatively little. There
    are very good French hair-dressers here, a tempting hat-shop,
    and a well-stocked <span class="pagenum">Page
    193<a name="Page_193"
       id="Page_193"></a></span>book-shop; but everything, as I
       have said, is frightfully dear.</p>

    <p>It was half-past three when the harbour-tug arrived to tow
    us out of the harbour and so save our getting up steam. There
    was not a breath of air stirring, but Tom hoped we should find
    more outside when the tug cast us off. As we dropped slowly
    out, we had a good view of the harbour and town; and we soon
    found ourselves once more fairly embarked on the bosom of the
    wide ocean.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, October 31st</i>.&mdash;Throughout the night a
    flat calm prevailed. The morning was wet and foggy, or we might
    still have seen Valparaiso, and perhaps have had a peep at
    Aconcagua. There was a light contrary wind from the N.W.
    throughout the day. In the afternoon we saw two whales blowing
    in the distance.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, November 1st</i>.&mdash;An almost calm day,
    with a few light showers, and fitful but unfavourable breezes.
    Some thirty or forty little birds, which the sailors called
    Mother Carey's chickens, but which were smaller and more
    graceful than any I have seen of that name, followed closely in
    our wake. I was never tired of watching the dainty way in which
    they just touched the tips of the waves with their feet, and
    then started off afresh, like a little maiden skipping and
    hopping along, from sheer exuberance of spirit.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, November 2nd</i>.&mdash;A bright sunny morning,
    with a heavy swell and light contrary wind, but the sea became
    more tranquil towards the evening. The sunset was superb, and
    the afterglow, as is often the case in these latitudes, lighted
    up sky and sea with an indescribable beauty, which attained its
    greatest magnificence about five minutes after the sun had
    disappeared, reminding one of the <span class="pagenum">Page
    195<a name="Page_195"
       id="Page_195"></a></span> glorious sunsets of the African
       deserts, so often described by travellers.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, November 3rd</i>.&mdash;Still a blue sky, bright
    sunshine, smooth sea, and light head-wind. The crew have all
    turned tailors, and are making themselves new suits from some
    dungaree we bought at Valparaiso, the clothes we expected for
    them not having met us there.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, November 4th</i>.&mdash;As fine as ever. This
    is certainly sailing luxuriously, if not swiftly. We have now
    settled down into our regular sea-ways, and have plenty to do
    on board; so the delay does not much signify. Still, our time
    is limited, and we all hope to fall in with the trades shortly
    to carry us to Tahiti or some of the South Sea islands. We
    caught half-a-dozen of the little petrels, for stuffing, by
    floating lines of black cotton astern, in which they became
    entangled.</p>

    <p>To-night's sunset was more superb than ever. Each moment
    produced a new and ever increasingly grand effect. I mean to
    try and take an instantaneous photograph of
    <span class="pagenum">Page 196<a name="Page_196"
       id="Page_196"></a></span>one. It would not, of course,
       reproduce all the marvellous shades of colouring, but it
       would perhaps give some idea of the forms of the masses of
       cloud, which are finer than any I ever saw before. This
       ocean seems to give one, in a strange way, a sense of solemn
       vastness, which was not produced to the same extent by the
       Atlantic. Whether this results from our knowledge of its
       size, or whether it is only fancy, I cannot say, but it is
       an impression which we all share.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, November 5th</i>.&mdash;Fine, and considerably
    hotter, though not unpleasantly so. We had the Litany at
    eleven, and evening prayers and a sermon at four o'clock. Not a
    single ship has passed within sight since we left Valparaiso,
    and the only living creatures we have seen are some
    albatrosses, a few white boobies, a cape-hen, the little
    petrels already mentioned, a shoal of porpoises, and two
    whales.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, November 6th</i>.&mdash;Passed, at 3 a.m. to-day,
    a large barque, steering south, and at 8 a.m. a full-rigged
    ship, steering the same course. We held&mdash;as we do with
    every ship we pass&mdash;a short conversation with her through
    the means of the mercantile code of signals. (This habit of
    exchanging signals afterwards proved to have been a most useful
    practice, for when the report that the 'Sunbeam' had gone down
    with all hands was widely circulated through England, I might
    almost say the world,&mdash;for we found the report had
    preceded us by telegram to almost all the later ports we
    touched at,&mdash;the anxiety of our friends was relieved many
    days sooner than it would otherwise have been by the fact of
    our having spoken the German steamer 'Sakhara,' in the Magellan
    Straits, Oct. 13, four days after we were supposed to have gone
    to the bottom.) The weather continues fine, and we have the
    same light baffling winds. We hoped, when we started, to
    average at least 200 miles a day, but now we have been a week
    at sea, and have only made good a little more than 700 miles
    altogether, though we have sailed over 800 miles through
    <span class="pagenum">Page 197<a name="Page_197"
       id="Page_197"></a></span>the water. It is, however,
       wonderful, in the opinion of the navigators, that we have
       made even as much progress as this, considering the very
       adverse circumstances under which the voyage has so far been
       performed, and we must endeavour to console ourselves with
       the reflection that the sailing qualities of the yacht have
       undergone another severe test in a satisfactory manner. How
       the provisions and water will last out, and what time we
       shall leave ourselves to see anything of Japan, are
       questions which, nevertheless, occasionally present
       themselves to our minds. Independently of such
       considerations, nothing could be more luxurious and
       delightful than our present mode of
       <span class="pagenum">Page 198<a name="Page_198"
       id="Page_198"></a></span>existence. With perfect weather,
       plenty of books to read and writing to do, no possibility of
       interruptions, one can map out one's day and dispose of
       one's time exactly as one pleases, until the half-past six
       o'clock dressing-bell&mdash;which always seems to come long
       before it is wanted&mdash;recalls one to the duties and
       necessities of life.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, November 8th</i>.&mdash;A grey cloudy morning
    and a flat calm. At twelve o'clock, to the great joy of
    everybody on board, Tom decided to get up steam, as we have now
    been becalmed quite twenty-four hours, and have made but little
    progress in the right direction for some days. The alacrity
    with which the order to stow sails and raise the funnel was
    obeyed&mdash;every one lending a hand&mdash;and the delight
    expressed on every countenance, must have assured him of at
    least the popularity of his decision.</p>

    <p>Whilst we were waiting for steam to be got up, Tom took
    Muriel and me for a row in the 'Flash,' his own particular
    little boat, with about four inches of freeboard. The
    possibility of doing this will give you a better idea of the
    tranquillity of this vast ocean than any description I can
    write. At the same time, when we wanted to get into the boat,
    we found there was a considerable roll on, and that it was no
    easy matter without the aid of a gangway or ladder. We rowed a
    little way from the yacht, and, considering how quiet it had
    seemed to us when on board, it was wonderful to observe how she
    rolled in the trough of the sea, without sails to steady her or
    motive power to guide her. The Lota coals, though black and
    dirty beyond description, burn up very quickly, and in about an
    hour we were steaming merrily along, the Arabian horseshoe on
    our bowsprit's end being now pointed direct for the island of
    Tahiti, instead of for wherever the wind chose to blow us.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, November 9th</i>.&mdash;A flat calm at 6 a.m.;
    a very light fair wind at 9 a.m. In spite of my remonstrances,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 199<a name="Page_199"
       id="Page_199"></a></span> Tom determined, at half-past nine,
       to cease steaming and try sailing again. About twelve
       o'clock a puff came that sent us along at the rate of 10-1/2
       knots for a short time; but it soon dropped, and during the
       rest of the afternoon and evening, our average speed was
       only three or four knots an hour. This is very poor work for
       the trades, but I don't believe we are really in them yet,
       in spite of the wind charts. It is possible that they may
       vary in different years; besides which it is now the height
       of summer, with the sun south of the line, which would
       naturally make them lighter.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, November 11th</i>.&mdash;At last we seem to be
    feeling the influence of the trades, as the wind continues to
    blow from the same direction, though it varies much in force.
    Sometimes we are going along at the rate of 11-3/4 knots,
    sometimes barely five. In the afternoon we had the usual
    Saturday singing practice.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, November 12th</i>.&mdash;Another lovely day. We
    had the Litany and hymns at eleven, evening service and sermon
    at four.</p>

    <p>Just before morning church some one turned on the water in
    the nursery bath, and forgot to turn it off again, so that when
    we came aft from the saloon we had the pleasure of finding
    everything in the children's cabins afloat, and that a good
    deal of water had got down into the hold. It was rather
    annoying at the time, but, I dare say, like many other present
    troubles, it was a good thing in the end. It obliged us, at any
    rate, to have all the stores brought up on deck, and led to our
    taking an inventory of our resources sooner than we should
    otherwise have done. I am sorry to say we found that, owing to
    the departure of our head steward and the illness of his
    successor, they have not been husbanded as carefully as they
    should have been, especially those provided for use forward.
    Sailors are more like children than grown-up men, and require
    as much looking after. While there is water in the tanks, for
    <span class="pagenum">Page 200<a name="Page_200"
       id="Page_200"></a></span>instance, they will use it in the
       most extravagant manner, without thought for the morrow; and
       they are quite as reckless with their other stores.</p>

    <p>I find, however, that one of the drawbacks to taking a very
    close personal interest in the housekeeping arrangements on
    board is the too intimate acquaintance one makes with the
    various individuals composing the live stock, the result being
    that the private particular history of every chicken, duck,
    turkey, and joint of mutton is apt to be remembered with a
    damaging effect to appetite.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon two boobies, the first birds we have seen
    for some days, paid us a visit. I suppose we are too far out to
    see anything more of our pretty little friends, the
    petrels.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, November 13th</i>.&mdash;We had a regular
    turn-out and re-arrangement of our stores to-day, and
    discovered that the waste and mismanagement have been greater
    even than we at first supposed. Fortunately, we found some
    spare tins of provisions stowed away under the nursery floor
    and forgotten, and which will now come in very opportunely. But
    I fear that, even as it is, we may be seriously inconvenienced
    before getting to the end of our voyage. Of the six sheep,
    sixty chickens, thirty ducks, and four dozen pigeons, brought
    on board alive at Valparaiso, we have comparatively few left,
    and not a great deal to give those few to eat; so we must
    depend mainly on our potted meats and vegetables, which happen
    to be excellent. We often wonder how the earlier navigators got
    on, when there were no such things as tinned provisions, and
    when the facilities for carrying water were of the poorest
    description, while they were often months and months at sea,
    without an opportunity of replenishing their stores, and with
    no steam-power to fall back upon in case they were becalmed.
    Still more wonderful, in my opinion, is the successful manner
    in which the Spaniards managed to convey their hordes in tiny
    vessels, together with a <span class="pagenum">Page
    201<a name="Page_201"
       id="Page_201"></a></span>sufficient quantity of forage for
       them, to the New World, where, according to all accounts,
       they generally arrived in good condition, fit to go to work
       or to war immediately.</p>

    <p>The wind increased in the evening and blew dead aft. In the
    middle of the night the mizen-halyards broke, and blocks and
    all came down with a tremendous crash, which caused both Tom
    and me to rush up on deck. About an hour and a half's work put
    everything straight again, however, though it looked a sad mess
    at first. We had been remarking at dinner how lucky we had
    been, with all this rolling about in calms and running before
    the wind, not to have had anything carried away or any of the
    ropes chafed. Personally, I think the accident is not to be
    regretted, for now all the fore and aft canvas is stowed, and
    we are running under square canvas alone, which is much
    steadier work, though we still roll considerably.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, November 14th</i>.&mdash;Fine, with a strong
    fair wind. I have been laid up for a few days with a touch of
    my old enemy, Syrian fever, but am gradually recovering, and
    enjoy very much lying on deck and reading.</p>

    <p>Our victualling arrangements have now been satisfactorily
    settled, and everybody has been put on an allowance of water,
    our supply of which will last the whole ship's company of forty
    persons for five weeks, leaving one tank still in reserve in
    case of accidents. As we expect to reach our destination in
    about three weeks from the present time, we have therefore, I
    hope, an ample supply for all our requirements.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, November 15th</i>.&mdash;Pleasant as we have
    found life at sea in the South Pacific hitherto, it is, I fear,
    monotonous to read about, and I dare say you will find it
    difficult to realise how quickly the days fly past, and how
    sorry we are when each one comes to an end. I am afraid they
    are among those things which do not repeat themselves. At any
    rate, they afford a golden opportunity for reading, such as we
    are not likely to have again often, if ever, in
    <span class="pagenum">Page 202<a name="Page_202"
       id="Page_202"></a></span>our busy lives; and Tom and I are
       endeavouring to make the best use of it by getting through
       as many of the seven hundred volumes we brought with us as
       possible. The weather favours us in our endeavours to be
       industrious; for, while it is sufficiently warm to indispose
       one for a very severe course of study, it has never been so
       hot as to compel us to lie down and do nothing but gasp for
       breath&mdash;which is what we were warned to expect. There
       is indeed one slight drawback to the perfect enjoyment of
       our present state of existence, and that is the incessant
       motion of the vessel. When she rolls as quickly as she has
       done to-day, it is difficult to settle down steadily to any
       occupation, and at last one cannot help feeling aggravated
       at the persistent manner in which everything, including
       one's self, refuses to be still for a single instant.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, November 16th</i>.&mdash;To-day it is really
    warm&mdash;not to say hot&mdash;with a bright cloudless sky,
    which renders an awning acceptable. We saw some 'bo's'n' birds
    for the first time, and more shoals of flying-fish. I wish a
    few of the latter would come on board; they would be an
    agreeable addition to our breakfast-table.</p>

    <p>The rolling still continues, the wind being dead aft, and
    nothing but our square canvas being set. The effect is rather
    wearisome, and one longs to be able to say 'Catch hold of her
    head and keep her still, if only for five minutes' peace and
    quietness!' Cooking is difficult, and even eating is a
    hazardous occupation; and at our evening game of cards we have
    to pocket our counters and markers and hold on as best we
    can.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, November 17th</i>.&mdash;At 8 a.m. the course was
    altered, our fore-and-aft canvas was set again, and we were
    once more gliding along swiftly and smoothly through the water,
    to the great relief of every one on board. The day was lovely,
    and though it was warm, a pleasant breeze throughout the ship
    prevented our feeling uncomfortably hot.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 203<a name="Page_203"
       id="Page_203"></a></span><i>Saturday, November
       18th</i>.&mdash;The days are so much alike that it is
       difficult to find anything special to say about them. They
       fly so quickly that I was surprised to be reminded by the
       usual singing-practice this afternoon that another week had
       gone by.</p>

    <p>The two green paroquets, 'Coco' and 'Meta,' given to me by
    Mr. Fisher at Rosario, have turned out dear little pets, with
    the most amusing ways. They are terrible thieves, especially of
    sugar, pencils, pens, and paper, and being nearly always at
    liberty, they follow me about just like dogs, and coax and
    caress me with great affection. They do not care much for any
    one else, though they are civil to all and good-tempered even
    to the children, who, I am afraid, rather bore them with their
    attempts at petting. The other foreign birds, of which I have a
    large collection, are doing well, and I begin to hope I shall
    get them home safely after all. We had at one time about twenty
    parrots, belonging to the men, on board, all running about on
    deck forward, with their wings clipped, but about half of them
    have been lost overboard. The dogs keep their health and
    spirits wonderfully. F&eacute;lise is quite young again, and
    she and Lulu have great games, tearing up and down and around
    the decks as hard as they can go.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, November 19th</i>.&mdash;I am convalescent at
    last, and appeared at breakfast this morning for the first time
    for ten days.</p>

    <p>The wind was very variable throughout the day. Between 6 and
    7 a.m. we were going twelve knots; between 7 and 8 only three;
    but as we never stop, we manage to make up a fair average on
    the whole.</p>

    <p>At eleven o'clock we had the Communion Service and two
    hymns. At midday the week's work was made up, with the
    following result. Our position was in lat. 15&deg; 38' S.,
    long. 117&deg; 52' W.; we were 3,057 miles from
    Valparaiso,&mdash;1,335 of which had been accomplished since
    last Sunday,&mdash;and 1,818 miles from Tahiti.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 204<a name="Page_204"
       id="Page_204"></a></span>To-day we were not far from Easter
       Island, the southernmost island of Polynesia. Here as in the
       Ladrones, far away in the north-west quarter of the Pacific,
       most curious inscriptions are sometimes found carved in
       stone. Annexed is a photograph taken from one I saw at a
       later stage of the voyage.</p>

    <p>The sails had been flapping, more or less, all day, and at
    the change of the dog-watches, at six o'clock, Tom ordered the
    men aft to stow the mizen. This they had scarcely begun to do
    when a light breeze sprang up, and in a few minutes increased
    to a strong one, before which we bowled along at the rate of
    nine knots. These sudden changes are of constant occurrence,
    and, coming as they do without the slightest warning, are quite
    inexplicable. If only we had our old square sails, and our
    bigger yards and topmast, we should have saved a good deal of
    time already; for one or two knots an hour extra amount to from
    25 to 50 miles a day, and in a month's run the difference would
    not be far short of 1,500 miles. But we heard so much from
    people in England, who had visited these parts, of squalls and
    hurricanes, that Tom did not like to run the risk of being
    over-sparred, especially with a wife and children as
    passengers.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, November 20th</i>.&mdash;The fore-and-aft sails
    were taken in, as they were doing no good and the square
    <span class="pagenum">Page 205<a name="Page_205"
       id="Page_205"></a></span>canvas was drawing. This allowed
       the mizen-awning to be spread, making a pleasant place to
       sit in and a capital playground for the children, who
       scamper about all day long, and do not appear to feel the
       heat a bit.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, November 21st</i>.&mdash;Certainly a <i>very</i>
    hot day. We made steady progress under the same canvas as
    yesterday.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, November 22nd</i>.&mdash;Between 2 and 3 a.m.
    a nice breeze sprang up, and between 3 and 4.30 a.m. all the
    fore-and-aft sails were again set. It was deliciously cool on
    deck at that time; but the sun rose fierce and hot, and more or
    less killed the breeze as the day wore on.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, November 23rd</i>.&mdash;Twenty-four days out.
    We had hoped to reach Tahiti to-day, and Tom begins to regret
    that he did not steam some distance out from Valparaiso, so as
    to pick up the trades sooner. Still it is satisfactory to know
    how well the 'Sunbeam' can and does sail against light contrary
    winds, and to have an opportunity of developing some of her
    good points, of which we were previously hardly aware. How she
    manages to slip along as she does, four or five knots an hour,
    with not sufficient wind to blow a candle out, is a marvel to
    every one on board. More than once, when the hand-log has shown
    that we were going five knots, I have carried a naked light
    from one end of the deck to the other without its being
    extinguished.</p>

    <p>The sunrise was magnificent, and a splendid albatross, the
    largest we have yet seen, was at the same time visible in
    mid-air, floating against the rose-coloured clouds. He looked
    so grand, and calm, and majestic, that one could almost fancy
    him the bird of Jove himself, descending direct from the sun.
    Where do these birds rest? How far and how fast do they really
    fly? are questions for the naturalist. We have seen them many
    times at a distance of at least two thousand miles from the
    nearest land.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 206<a name="Page_206"
       id="Page_206"></a></span>About nine o'clock there was a
       slight breeze, but it fell as the sun rose, and the day was
       intensely hot.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, November 24th</i>.&mdash;A fine breeze in the
    early morning, which, however, gradually died away. Having now
    quitted the regular track of the trade winds and got into the
    variables, we lighted fires at two o'clock. Then another light
    breeze sprang up for a few minutes, only to fall away again
    immediately, and at six o'clock we commenced to steam.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, November 25th</i>.&mdash;A very wet morning,
    the sky clearing at about ten, but the weather remaining dull,
    heavy, hot, and oppressive, throughout the day. But we were
    making good progress under steam, which rendered the state of
    things more endurable than it would otherwise have been.</p>

    <p>Whilst I was standing on deck at night a flying-fish flew
    against my throat and hung there, caught in the lace of my
    dress. He is a pretty specimen, but only his wings are to be
    preserved, for Muriel will have his body for breakfast
    to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, November 26th</i>.&mdash;Our fourth consecutive
    Sunday at sea, and out of sight of land. At 4 a.m. the sails
    were spread to a good breeze. At 7 we stopped steaming, but at
    10 the wind again fell light. The Litany was read on deck this
    morning on account of the heat. The observations at noon showed
    that we were in lat. 15&deg; 47' S., long. 135&deg; 20' W., the
    distance accomplished during the last twenty-four hours being
    181 miles. We have now made good 4,067 miles from Valparaiso,
    and are 815 miles distant from Tahiti. At 5 p.m. we had prayers
    and a sermon, also on deck. It was then almost calm, and at
    eight o'clock we again began steaming, in order to insure our
    making the island of Tatakotoroa, 200 miles off, before dark
    to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, November 27th</i>.&mdash;I was on deck at 3.30
    a.m. Everybody on board was more or less excited at the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 207<a name="Page_207"
       id="Page_207"></a></span>prospect of making land, after
       twenty-eight days at sea. It was a delicious morning, with a
       favourable breeze, and under steam and sail we progressed at
       the rate of from 10 to 11-1/2 knots an hour. Several birds
       flew on board, amongst whom were two boobies, who hovered
       round us and appeared to examine everything with great
       curiosity, especially the little wind-vanes at the extremity
       of the masts. At last they settled on the foretopmast,
       whereupon one of the sailors went up to try and catch them.
       They observed his movements closely, and appeared to be
       specially interested in his cap; but as he approached, first
       one and then the other flew away for a few yards, and then
       returned to his former position. At last the man, watching
       his opportunity, managed to seize one of them by his legs
       and bring him down in triumph, despite flapping wings and
       pecks from a sharp beak. He was shut up in the
       fowl-pen&mdash;now, alas, empty of its proper
       denizens&mdash;where we had an opportunity of examining him
       before he was killed. He was a fine, handsome, grey bird,
       with large blue eyes, and a wild hawk-like look.</p>

    <p>At one o'clock we were almost sailing over the spot marked
    by Findlay as the situation of Tatakotopoto, or Anonymous
    Island; but there was nothing whatever visible in the shape of
    land, even from the masthead, where a man was stationed, and
    from which it was possible to see a distance of ten or fifteen
    miles. Tom went up himself several times and scanned the
    horizon carefully, but in vain. It is therefore evident either
    that the position of the island is incorrectly stated, or that
    it has become submerged. I believe that in these seas there are
    many islands marked that have no existence, and that several
    that do exist are not marked, which renders it necessary to
    keep a constant good look-out. What a charming task it would be
    thoroughly to survey these parts, and to correct the present
    charts where necessary, and how much I should like to be one of
    the officers appointed for the service!</p>

    <p>At 1.30 p.m. land was sighted from the mast-head, and at two
    o'clock I saw from the deck what looked like plumes of dark
    ostrich feathers rising from the sea. This was the island of
    Tatakotoroa&mdash;also known as Narcissus, or Clarke
    Island&mdash;to the eastward of the Paumotu or Low Archipelago
    of the South Seas. The sailing directions describe the
    inhabitants as 'hostile,' and Sir Edward Belcher mentions that
    some of them tried to cut off the boats sent from a man-of-war
    for water. We were therefore afraid to attempt a landing, but
    sailed as near as we could to the shore, which, surrounded by a
    rampart of snow-white coral, and clothed almost to the water's
    edge with feathery palms, cocoa-nut trees, and luxuriant
    vegetation of various kinds, looked very tempting. A few canoes
    were drawn up on the beach near a large hut, out of which three
    or four natives came, and, having looked at us for some time,
    ran off into the woods. Blue smoke could be seen curling up
    from several points of the forest, no doubt indicating the
    presence of more natives, whose dwellings were concealed by the
    trees.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 209<a name="Page_209"
       id="Page_209"></a></span></p>

    <p>After lunch, Tom had me hoisted up to the foretopmast-head
    in a 'boatswain's chair,' which is simply a small plank,
    suspended by ropes at the four corners, and used by the men to
    sit on when they scrape the masts. I was very carefully secured
    with a rope tied round my petticoats, and, knocking against the
    various ropes on my way, was then gently hoisted up to what
    seemed at first a giddy height; but when once I got accustomed
    to the smallness of the seat, the airiness of my perch, and the
    increased roll of the vessel, I found my position by no means
    an unpleasant one. Tom climbed up the rigging and joined me
    shortly afterwards. From our elevated post we could see plainly
    the formation of the island, and the lagoon in the centre,
    encircled by a band of coral, in some places white, bare, and
    narrow, in others wide and covered with palm-trees and rich
    vegetation; it was moreover <span class="pagenum">Page
    210<a name="Page_210"
       id="Page_210"></a></span>possible to understand better the
       theory of the formation of these coral islands. I was so
       happy up aloft that I did not care to descend; and it was
       almost as interesting to observe what a strange and
       disproportioned appearance everything and everybody on board
       the yacht presented from my novel position, as it was to
       examine the island we were passing. The two younger children
       and the dogs took the greatest interest in my a&euml;rial
       expedition, and never ceased calling to me and barking,
       until I was once more let down safely into their midst. As
       soon as we had seen all we could of the island, fires were
       banked, and we proceeded under sail alone throughout the
       evening and night.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, November 28th</i>.&mdash;We passed Anaa, or
    Chain Island, in the morning watch, before daybreak. I came on
    deck to try and get a glimpse of it, and was rewarded by a
    glorious sunrise. We had a nice eight-knot breeze and a strong
    current in our favour, and just before breakfast Tom descried
    from the masthead Amanu, or M&ouml;ller Island, which we had
    hardly expected to make before ten or eleven o'clock. Some one
    remarked that it seemed almost as if it had come out to meet
    us. The reef encircling this island varies much in height and
    vegetation. In some places it supports a noble grove of trees,
    in others the sea breaks over the half-submerged coral-bed, the
    first obstacle it has met for 4,000 miles, with a roar like
    thunder.</p>

    <p>Before we had lost sight of Amanu, the island of Hao Harpe,
    or Bow Island, was visible on our port bow. I wished very much
    to land, and at last persuaded Tom, who was rather anxious on
    the score of the natives, to allow some of us to make the
    attempt, us cautioning to turn away from the shore directly, in
    case the islanders looked at all doubtful in their attitude and
    intentions. After lunch, therefore, we hove to, and the gig's
    crew were <span class="pagenum">Page 212<a name="Page_212"
       id="Page_212"></a></span>ordered to arm themselves with
       revolvers and rifles, which they were not to show unless
       required to do so. All the gentlemen had revolvers, and
       Mabelle and I were also provided with two small ones,
       Phillips and Muriel being the only unarmed members of the
       party. I took a bag full of beads, knives, looking-glasses,
       and pictures, for barter and presents, and with these
       preparations we set off to make our first personal
       acquaintance with the islanders of the South Pacific. Tom
       gave us a tow to windward, and we then rowed direct to a
       point on one side of the entrance to the lagoon, where we
       saw some natives waving something white. As we approached we
       could distinguish several figures standing on the point,
       under the shade of some cocoa-nut trees, and on the opposite
       side of the entrance some canoes were drawn up on the beach,
       by the side of a hut, close to a large clump of low trees.
       We were by this time surrounded by breakers, and it required
       no little skill to steer the boat safely through the broken
       water, between the race of the tide on one side, and the
       overfall from the coral reef on the other. It was
       successfully done, however, and, having rounded the point,
       we found ourselves at once in the waters of the tranquil
       lagoon. We should have preferred to land at the point, had
       it been possible, as it was doubtful whether it would be
       safe to go round the corner, and so lose sight of the yacht;
       but the intentions of the natives seemed peaceable, several
       of them running into the water up to their waists to meet
       us, while others could be seen hurrying along the beach, the
       women carrying what looked like bunches of fruit.</p>

    <p>It is really impossible to describe the beauty of the scene
    before us. Submarine coral forests, of every colour, studded
    with sea-flowers, anemones, and echinid&aelig;, of a brilliancy
    only to be seen in dreamland, shoals of the brightest and
    swiftest fish darting and flashing in and out; shells, everyone
    of which was fit to hold the place of honour in a
    conchologist's collection, moving slowly along
    <span class="pagenum">Page 213<a name="Page_213"
       id="Page_213"></a></span> with their living inmates: this is
       what we saw when we looked down, from the side of the boat,
       into the depths below. The surface of the water glittered
       with every imaginable tint, from the palest aquamarine to
       the brightest emerald, from the pure light blue of the
       turquoise to the deep dark blue of the sapphire, and was
       dotted here and there with patches of red, brown, and green
       coral, rising from the mass below. Before us, on the shore,
       there spread the rich growth of tropical vegetation, shaded
       by palms and cocoa-nuts, and enlivened by the presence of
       native women in red, blue, and green garments, and men in
       motley costumes, bringing fish, fowls, and bunches of
       cocoa-nuts, borne, like the grapes brought back from the
       land of Canaan by the spies, on poles.</p>

    <p>As soon as we touched the shore the men rushed forward to
    meet us, and to shake hands, and, having left the muskets and
    revolvers judiciously out of sight in the boat, we were
    conducted to a cluster of huts, made of branches, or rather
    leaves, of the palm-tree, tied by their foot-stalks across two
    poles, and hanging down to the ground. Here we were met by the
    women and children, who, likewise, all went through the
    ceremony of shaking hands with us, after which the head-woman,
    who was very good-looking, and was dressed in a cherry-coloured
    calico gown, with two long plaits of black hair hanging down
    her back, spread a mat for me to sit upon just outside the hut.
    By this time there was quite a little crowd of people assembled
    round, amongst whom I noticed one woman with a baby, who had
    her hair sticking straight out all round her head, and another
    who held a portion of her dress constantly before her face.
    After the gentlemen had walked away she removed the cloth, and
    I then saw that her nose had been cut off. Most of the women
    were good-looking, with dark complexions and quantities of
    well-greased, neatly-plaited black hair, but we did not see a
    single young girl, though there were plenty of children and
    babies, and lots of boys, <span class="pagenum">Page
    214<a name="Page_214"
       id="Page_214"></a></span>the latter of whom, like some of
       the older women, had only a piece of palm matting round
       their loins. We therefore came to the conclusion that the
       girls must have been sent away intentionally when the
       approach of the yacht was observed.</p>

    <p>As soon as I was seated, the head-woman told one of the men
    to knock down some cocoa-nuts from the trees close by, and
    after cutting off the ends she offered us a drink of the fresh
    cool milk, which was all the sweeter and better for the fact
    that the nuts were not nearly ripe. While this was going on,
    the natives brought piles of cocoa-nuts, fish, and fowls, and
    laid them at our feet as a present. Some of the fish were of a
    dark brown colour, like bream, others were long and thin, with
    a pipe-like nose and four fins, somewhat resembling the wings
    of a flying-fish. <span class="pagenum">Page
    215<a name="Page_215"
       id="Page_215"></a></span></p>

    <p>Seeing smoke in the distance, rising from under some high
    palm-trees, we thought we should like to go and see whence it
    proceeded, and accordingly set off to walk through a sort of
    bush, over sharp coral that cut one's boots terribly, the sun
    blazing down upon us fiercely all the time, until we reached a
    little settlement, consisting of several huts, the inhabitants
    of which were absent. Fine plaited mats for beds, cocoa-nut
    shells for cups, mother-of-pearl shells for plates, and coral,
    of various kinds and shapes, for dishes and cooking utensils,
    formed their only furniture. We saw three women, one very old,
    with nothing but a palm-leaf mat as a covering, the others
    dressed in the apparently universal costume, consisting of a
    long bright-coloured gown, put into a yoke at the shoulders,
    and flowing thence loosely to the ground, which completely
    conceals the wearer's form, even to the tips of her toes. I
    think these dresses must come from England or America, for they
    are evidently machine-made, and the cotton-stuft of which they
    are composed has the most extraordinary patterns printed on it
    I ever saw. Cherry and white, dark blue and yellow or white
    stripes, red with yellow spots, and blue with yellow crosses,
    appear to be the favourite designs. The women seemed gentle and
    kind, and were delighted with some beads, looking-glasses, and
    knives I gave them, in return for which they brought us
    quantities of beautiful shells.</p>

    <p>We saw the large iron knee of a vessel in one spot during
    our walk, and wondered how it came there. In another place we
    saw a canoe in process of construction, ingeniously made of
    boards, sewed together with plaited palm-leaves. The canoes in
    use here are very high, long, and narrow, and are only kept
    from upsetting by means of a tremendous outrigger, consisting
    of a log fastened to the extremity of two bent pieces of wood,
    projecting sideways from each end of the boat. The only animals
    we met with in our ramble were four pigs and a few chickens,
    and no other <span class="pagenum">Page 216<a name="Page_216"
       id="Page_216"></a></span>live stock of any kind was visible.
       No attempt seemed to be made at the cultivation of the
       ground; and I think, if there had been, we must have
       observed it, for our party separated and walked a good
       distance in various directions.</p>

    <p>The natives made us understand that on the other side of the
    entrance to the lagoon, in the better sort of house we had
    noticed, there resided a white man. He did not, however, make
    his appearance during our visit, and I imagine he must have
    been one of those individuals called 'beach-combers,' referred
    to in so many of the books that treat of the South Sea
    Islands,&mdash;a sort of ne'er-do-well Englishman or American,
    rather afraid of meeting any of his own countrymen, but very
    clever at making a bargain between a ship's crew and the
    natives, with considerable profit to himself.</p>

    <p>Among the bushes we found numbers of large hermit-crabs,
    crawling, or rather running, about in whelk shells, half a
    dozen of them occasionally having a grand fight amongst
    themselves. We picked up at least twenty different sorts of
    gracefully shaped pieces of coral, and quantities of shells of
    an infinite variety of form and colour; cowries, helmet-shells,
    the shells from which cameos are sometimes cut; mother-of-pearl
    shells, and a large spiral univalve, nearly a foot long, with
    dark brown spots and stripes on a delicate cream-coloured
    ground, like the skin of a tiger or leopard. On our way back to
    the huts we peeped into several of the canoes drawn up on the
    beach, in which were some fish-spears and a fish-hook, nearly
    three inches long, made of solid mother-of-pearl, the natural
    curve of the shell from which it was cut being preserved. A
    piece of bone was securely fastened to it by means of some
    pig's hair, but there was no bait, and it seems that the
    glitter of the mother-of-pearl alone serves as a sufficient
    allurement to the fish.</p>

    <p>In nearly all accounts of voyages in the South Seas much
    space is devoted to the description of the purchase,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 217<a name="Page_217"
       id="Page_217"></a></span> or rather barter, of hogs. We
       thought we could not do better than follow as far as
       possible the example of our predecessors, and accordingly
       bought two little pigs for two shillings each. They were
       evidently quite pets, lying on the mats outside the huts,
       and coming when called, just like dogs. The one I first
       bought appeared to be quite happy and content to be carried
       under my arm. The natives seemed quite to understand the
       value of money, and did not hesitate to ask for it in return
       for the cocoa-nuts full of shells which they brought us. I
       fancy some of the Tahiti schooners trade here for pearl,
       shells, and b&ecirc;che-de-mer.</p>

    <p>The cocoa-nuts, fowls, fish, coral, &amp;c., having been put
    into our boat, we shook hands with the friendly islanders and
    embarked, and having rounded the point we soon found ourselves
    again in the broken water outside the lagoon, where the race of
    the tide and the overfall were now much more violent than they
    had been when we landed. If we had once been drawn into the
    current, we should have stood a good chance of being knocked to
    pieces on the coral reefs, strong as our boat was; but the
    danger was happily avoided, and we reached the yacht safely,
    much to Tom's relief.</p>

    <p>The natives did not exhibit the slightest curiosity about us
    during our visit to the island, and though they received us
    with courtesy, and assisted us as far as they could on our
    arrival and departure, they did not follow us about while on
    shore, nor, with the exception of one or two of them, did they
    take the trouble to walk across the point to see us get into
    the open sea and join the yacht. In this respect they might
    have given a lesson to many civilised people, so gentle,
    genial, and graceful, yet dignified, were their manners.</p>

    <p>The screw having been feathered and the sails set, our
    voyage was at once resumed. A few miles from where we had
    landed, we saw, high and dry on the coral reef skirting the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 218<a name="Page_218"
       id="Page_218"></a></span>island, a large square-built
       schooner, of about 500 tons, her masts gone, her hull
       bleached white by the sun, and a great hole in her side. She
       was on the inside of the reef, and must therefore either
       have drifted there from the lagoon, or else have been lifted
       bodily across by one of the big Pacific rollers, in some
       terrible storm. No doubt the iron knee we had seen on the
       island originally formed part of this vessel.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, November 29th</i>.&mdash;We seem to have got
    into the real south-east trades, just as the chart tells us we
    ought to expect to lose them; for there was a strong fair
    breeze all day, which made it very pleasant on deck in the
    shade of the sails. But it was exceedingly hot in the saloon,
    where some of the woodwork has been pulled down, in order to
    secure better ventilation for the galley and the berths of some
    of the men, who, I hope, appreciate the alteration, for it is a
    source of considerable discomfort to us.</p>

    <p>We had the bigger of our two little pigs for dinner to-day,
    and a welcome change it was from the salt and potted meats. He
    was most excellent, and fully corroborated Captain Cook's
    statement as to the superiority of South Sea Island pork to any
    other&mdash;a fact which is doubtless due to the pigs being fed
    entirely on cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit. Still it seemed a pity
    to eat such a tame creature, and I mean to try and preserve the
    other one's life, unless we are much longer than we expect in
    reaching Tahiti. He is only about ten inches long, but looks at
    least a hundred years old, and is altogether the most quaint,
    old-fashioned little object you ever saw. He has taken a great
    fancy to the dogs, and trots about after me with them
    everywhere, on the tips of his little toes, even up and down
    the steep cabin stairs. I call him Agag, because he walks so
    delicately, whilst others accost him as Beau, not only on
    account of his elegant manners, but as being the name of his
    former home.</p>

    <p>The moon was more brilliant this evening than we have yet
    seen her during our voyage, and we could enjoy sitting
    <span class="pagenum">Page 219<a name="Page_219"
       id="Page_219"></a></span> on deck reading, and even doing
       some coarse needlework, without any other light. One
       splendid meteor flashed across the sky. It was of a light
       orange colour, with a fiery tail about two degrees in
       extent, and described in its course an arc of about sixty
       degrees, from S.S.E. to N.N.W., before it disappeared into
       space, far above the horizon. If the night had been darker,
       the spectacle would have been finer; but even as it was, the
       moon seemed quite paled for a few minutes afterwards. We
       have seen many meteors, falling-stars, and shooting-stars
       since we left Valparaiso, but none so fine as the one this
       evening.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, December 1st</i>.&mdash;The sun rose grandly, but
    the heavy black and red clouds, looking like flames and smoke
    from a furnace, gave promise of more rain. The heat was greater
    to-day than any we have yet felt; and it is now nearly
    mid-winter at home.</p>

    <p>At 5 a.m. we made the island of Maitea, and expected to
    reach it in about an hour and a half; but the wind fell light,
    and it was a quarter to ten before we got into the gig and set
    out for the shore. There are not many instructions about
    landing, either in Captain Cook or Findlay, but the latter
    mentions that houses are to be found on the south side of the
    island. We thought, however, we could distinguish from the
    yacht a little cove, close to some huts, at another part of the
    shore, where the surf did not break so heavily. We accordingly
    rowed straight for it, and as we approached we could see the
    natives coming down from all parts to meet us, the women
    dressed in the same sort of long, bright, flowing garments we
    had seen at Hao Harpe, with the addition of garlands round
    their necks and heads, the men wearing gay-coloured
    loin-cloths, shirts of Manchester cotton stuff, flying loose in
    the wind, and sailors' hats with garlands round them, or
    coloured silk handkerchiefs&mdash;red and orange evidently
    having the preference&mdash;tied over their heads and jauntily
    knotted on one side. <span class="pagenum">Page
    220<a name="Page_220"
       id="Page_220"></a></span>Several of the men waded out into
       the surf to meet us, sometimes standing on a rock two feet
       above the water, sometimes buried up to their necks by a
       sudden wave. But the rocks were sharp, the only available
       passage was narrow, and the rollers long and high; and
       altogether it looked, upon a closer inspection, too
       unpromising a place to attempt a landing. Much to the
       disappointment of the natives, therefore, we decided to go
       round and try the other side of the island. Seeing us
       prepare to depart, the people on shore immediately launched
       a tiny canoe, with an enormous outrigger, and a man dressed
       in a pale green shirt, dark blue and yellow under garment,
       and with a silk handkerchief and garland on his head, came
       alongside and made signs that he would take us ashore one by
       one in his frail-looking craft. But the heavy Pacific
       rollers and the sharp rocks daunted us, and we declined his
       offer with thanks, and rowed off to the southward. Anything
       more enticing than the cove we were quitting can hardly be
       imagined. A fringe of cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit trees,
       overhanging an undergrowth of bright glossy foliage and
       flowers, a few half-hidden palm-leaf covered huts, from one
       of which&mdash;I <span class="pagenum">Page
       221<a name="Page_221"
       id="Page_221"></a></span>suppose the chief's&mdash;a
       tattered Tahitian flag floated in the breeze, a small
       schooner drawn up among the trees and carefully covered with
       mats, the steep sugar-loaf point, at the entrance to the
       cove, clothed to its summit with grass and vegetation: these
       were the objects which attracted our attention in our
       hurried survey of the scene.</p>

    <p>We had to give the island a wide berth in rowing round it,
    on account of the heavy rollers, which seemed to come from
    every side, breaking in surf against the dark brown cliffs, and
    throwing columns of white spray, from which the brilliant
    sunshine was reflected in rainbow hues, high into the air. As
    we proceeded matters looked worse and worse, and the motion of
    the boat became so disagreeable that both Muriel and I were
    very ill. At last we came to a spot where we could see some
    people sitting on the shore, and several others, who had
    probably come over from the other side to meet us, running
    swiftly down the sides of the cliffs to the beach. The island
    was of a different character from the one we had already
    visited, and was evidently of volcanic origin. No coral was
    anywhere to be seen, but there <span class="pagenum">Page
    222<a name="Page_222"
       id="Page_222"></a></span>were big rocks jutting out at
       intervals into the sea all round it, one of which seemed
       large enough to afford us a sort of shelter in landing. The
       natives waved and pointed towards the channel beyond this
       rock, and one or two swam out to meet us; but we soon found
       that the channel would not be wide enough to admit our big
       boat, though it was no doubt sufficient for a light canoe,
       drawing some two inches of water. We therefore reluctantly
       turned away and resumed our uneasy coasting voyage, in the
       course of which we passed some nearly leafless trees, full
       of white patches, too large for flowers, which afterwards
       turned out to be booby-birds, who here find a resting-place.
       They are so numerous that it is hardly possible to walk
       beneath the trees without treading on their eggs.</p>

    <p>Having completed the circuit of the island, we found
    ourselves once more opposite the spot where we had first
    thought of landing, and the tide being by this time a little
    higher, we decided to make another attempt. Some of the
    natives, seeing us approach, plunged into the water as before,
    and seized the gunwale of the boat, while others, on shore,
    brought down rollers to put beneath our keel. We went in on the
    top of a big wave, and thus at last found ourselves&mdash;boat
    and all&mdash;high and dry on the beach of Maitea.</p>

    <p>The people came down to meet us, and conducted us to the
    house of the chief, who, with his pretty wife, received us
    kindly, but with much gravity and dignity. Mats were placed for
    me to sit upon, wreaths were offered me for my head and neck,
    and cocoa-nut milk to drink. We wished for some bananas, and
    they immediately cut down a tree in order to obtain a bunch.
    Cocoa-nuts were at the same time thrown down from the trees,
    and a collection of fruit, poultry, and meat&mdash;the latter
    consisting of the immemorial hog&mdash;was laid at our feet, as
    a present from the chief. The rest of the natives brought us
    pearls, shells, mother-of-pearl, small canoes, fish-hooks,
    young boobies, and all sorts <span class="pagenum">Page
    223<a name="Page_223"
       id="Page_223"></a></span>of things, for barter; but the
       chief himself refused any return for his gift. Perhaps the
       greatest curiosity they offered us was about six fathoms of
       fine twine, made from human hair. Before these islands were
       visited by Europeans, this was the material from which
       fishing-lines were made; but it is now rarely used, and is
       consequently very difficult to procure. The young boobies
       they brought us looked just like a white powder-puff, and
       were covered with down far thicker and softer than any
       swan's down I ever saw.</p>

    <p>The natives seemed quite <i>au fait</i> in the matter of
    monetary transactions and exchanges. For an English sovereign
    they would give you change at the rate of five dollars. Chilian
    or United States' dollars they accepted readily, but Brazilian
    currency they would not look at. They were pleased with knives,
    beads, looking-glasses, and picture papers I had brought on
    shore, and we did a brisk trade. We experienced great
    difficulty in explaining to them that we wanted some fresh
    eggs, Muriel's especial fancy, and a luxury which we have been
    without for some time. At last, by pointing to the fowls and
    picking up some small egg-shaped stones, we managed to procure
    a few, though, from the time it took to collect them, I should
    think the island must have been scoured in the search for
    them.</p>

    <p>Most of the natives seemed puzzled to comprehend why we had
    visited the island at all. 'No sell brandy?'&mdash;'No.' 'No
    stealy men?'&mdash;'No.' 'No do what then?' Their knowledge of
    English was too limited to enable us to make them understand
    that we were only making a voyage of circumnavigation in a
    yacht.</p>

    <p>It was now time to bid farewell to our amiable hosts and
    their beautiful island. As we reached the landing-place, a
    small schooner, which we had previously noticed in the
    distance, came close to the shore, and a canoe put off from the
    island to meet it. We found that the vessel was bringing back
    from Tahiti and other places some of the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 224<a name="Page_224"
       id="Page_224"></a></span>inhabitants of the island, who had
       been away on a visit or in search of work. The meeting of
       the reunited friends and relatives was in some cases quite
       touching. Two women, in particular, sat and embraced each
       other for nearly a quarter of an hour, without moving, but
       with tears running down their faces.</p>

    <p>All our gifts and purchases having been placed in the boat,
    and one or two of us having embarked, she was shoved out over
    the wooden rollers into the narrow channel, where she lay-to
    while the rest of the party were brought alongside, one by one,
    in a frail canoe&mdash;an operation which occupied some time,
    during which we had leisure once more to admire the little bay
    I have already attempted to describe. We asked the captain of
    the schooner, who spoke French, to give us a tow off to the
    yacht, which he willingly consented to do, chatting cheerfully
    all the time, but evidently fearful of approaching too close to
    the yacht, and positively refusing our invitation to him to
    come on board. There can be little doubt that he mistrusted our
    intentions, and feared we might attempt to kidnap him and his
    crew; for the whites have, in too many cases, behaved in a most
    villanous manner to the inhabitants of these islands, who are,
    as a rule&mdash;to which there are of course exceptions&mdash;a
    kind and gentle people. I think if the many instances of the
    murder of ships' and boats' crews could be thoroughly sifted to
    the bottom, it would be found that most of them were acts of
    reprisal and revenge for brutal atrocities committed on the
    defenceless natives, who have been kidnapped, plundered, and
    murdered by unscrupulous traders and adventurers.
    Unfortunately, the good suffer for the bad, and such lives as
    those of Captain Goodenough and Bishop Patteson are sacrificed
    through the unpardonable misconduct of others&mdash;perhaps
    their own countrymen. It is still quite a chance how you may be
    received in some of the islands; for if the visit of the last
    ship was the occasion of the murder, plunder, and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 225<a name="Page_225"
       id="Page_225"></a></span> ill-treatment of the inhabitants,
       it is not to be wondered at that the next comers should be
       received with distrust, if not with treachery and
       violence.</p>

    <p>We reached the yacht at four o'clock, rather exhausted by so
    many hours' exposure to the broiling sun, having had nothing to
    eat since breakfast, at 7 a.m., except cocoa-nuts and bananas.
    The ship was put about, the sails filled, and, continuing
    steadily on our course throughout the evening, we made the
    smaller of the two peninsulas that form the island of Tahiti at
    10.30 p.m.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, December 2nd</i>. We were dodging on and off
    all night, and at daybreak the weather was thick and rainy. At
    4.30 a.m. we made the land again, and crept slowly along it,
    past Point Venus and the lighthouse in Matavai Bay (Captain
    Cook's first anchorage), until we were off the harbour of
    Papeete<a name="FNanchor_8_8"
       id="FNanchor_8_8">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_8_8"
       class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The rain was now descending in
       torrents, and we lay-to outside the reef for a short time,
       until a French pilot came on board and took us in through
       the narrow entrance. It was curious, while we were tumbling
       about in the rough sea outside, to see the natives placidly
       fishing in the tiniest of canoes on the lagoon inside the
       reef, the waves beating all the time furiously on the outer
       surface of the coral breakwater, as if anxious to seize and
       engulf them.</p>

    </div>

    <p>At nine o'clock we were safely anchored in the chief port of
    the island of Tahiti.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I cannot better bring this account of our long
    voyage from Valparaiso to a conclusion than by a quotation from
    a charming book, given to me at Rio, which I have lately been
    reading Baron de Hubner's 'Promenade autour du
    Monde:'&mdash;'Les jours se suivent et se ressemblent. Sauf le
    court &eacute;pisode du mauvais temps, ces trois semaines me
    font l'effet d'un charmant r&ecirc;ve, d'un conte de

    <p>We have been five weeks at sea, and have enjoyed them quite
    as much as the Baron did his three. We saw but two ships
    between Valparaiso and Tatakotoroa: he saw only one between San
    Francisco and Yokohama. It is indeed a vast and lonely ocean
    that we have traversed.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, December 2nd</i>.&mdash;The anchor was dropped
    in the harbour of Papeete at nine o'clock, and a couple of
    hours later, by which time the weather had cleared, we went
    ashore, and at once found ourselves in the midst of a
    fairy-like scene, to describe which is almost impossible, so
    bewildering is it in the brightness and variety of its
    colouring. The magnolias and yellow and scarlet hibiscus,
    overshadowing the water, the velvety turf, on to which one
    steps from the boat, the white road running between rows of
    wooden houses, whose little gardens are a mass of flowers,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 228<a name="Page_228"
       id="Page_228"></a></span>the men and women clad in the
       gayest robes and decked with flowers, the piles of
       unfamiliar fruit lying on the grass, waiting to be
       transported to the coasting vessels in the harbour, the
       wide-spreading background of hills clad in verdure to their
       summits&mdash;these are but a few of the objects which greet
       the new-comer in his first contact with the shore.</p>

    <p>We strolled about, and left our letters of introduction; but
    the people to whom they were addressed were at breakfast, and
    we were deliberating how best to dispose of our time, when a
    gentleman accosted us, and, seeing how new it all was to us
    strangers, offered to show us round the town.</p>

    <p>The streets of Papeete, running back at right angles with
    the beach, seem to have wonderfully grand names, such as the
    Rue de Rivoli, Rue de Paris, &amp;c. Every street is shaded by
    an avenue of high trees, whose branches meet and interlace
    overhead, forming a sort of leafy tunnel, through which the
    sea-breeze passes refreshingly. There is also what is called
    the Chinamen's quarter, through which we walked, and which
    consists of a collection of regular Chinese-built bamboo
    houses, whose occupants all wore their national costume,
    pigtail included. The French commandant lives in a charming
    residence, surrounded by gardens, just opposite the palace of
    Queen Pomare, who is at present at the island of Bola-Bola,
    taking care of her little grandchild, aged five, the queen of
    the island. She went down in a French man-of-war, the 'Limier,'
    ten days ago, and has been obliged to remain, owing to some
    disturbances amongst the natives. I am rather disappointed that
    she is absent, as I should like to see a person of whom I have
    heard so much.</p>

    <p>Having completed our tour, we next went to call on the
    British Consul, who received us kindly, and entertained us with
    an interesting account of the island and its inhabitants, its
    pearl-fisheries and trade, the French
    <span class="pagenum">Page 229<a name="Page_229"
       id="Page_229"></a></span>policy, the missionaries, &amp;c.,
       on all of which subjects he is well informed. He has just
       completed an exhaustive consular report on the condition of
       the island, which will, no doubt, appear in due course in
       the form of a blue-book.</p>

    <p>On our return to Messrs. Brander's office, where we had left
    one of our letters of introduction, we found the manager, with
    whom we had a long chat before returning on board.</p>

    <p>At 5 p.m. we went for a row in the 'Glance' and the 'Flash'
    to the coral reef, now illumined by the rays of the setting
    sun. Who can describe these wonderful gardens of the deep, on
    which we now gazed through ten and twenty fathoms of crystal
    water? Who can enumerate or describe the strange creatures
    moving about and darting hither and thither, amid the masses of
    coral forming their submarine home? There were shells of rare
    shape, brighter than if they had been polished by the hand of
    the most skilful artist; crabs of all sizes, scuttling and
    sidling along; sea-anemones, spreading their delicate feelers
    in search of prey; and many other kinds of zoophytes, crawling
    slowly over the reef; and scarlet, blue, yellow, gold, violet,
    spotted, <span class="pagenum">Page 230<a name="Page_230"
       id="Page_230"></a></span>striped, and winged fish, short,
       long, pointed, and blunt, of the most varied shapes, were
       darting about like birds among the coral trees.</p>

    <p>At last, after frequent stoppages, to allow time for
    admiration, we reached the outer reef, hauled the boat up and
    made her fast, and, in bathing shoes, started on a paddling
    expedition. Such a paddle it was, too, over the coral, the surf
    breaking far above our heads, and the underflow, though only a
    few inches deep, nearly carrying me and the children off our
    legs! There were one or two native fishermen walking along the
    reef, whipping the water; but they appeared to have caught only
    a few small rock-fish, pretty enough to look at, but not
    apparently good to eat.</p>

    <p>The shades of night compelled us to return to the yacht,
    laden with corals of many different species. After dinner the
    bay was illuminated by the torches of the native fishermen, in
    canoes, on the reef. Tom and I went to look at them, but did
    not see them catch anything. Each canoe contained at least
    three people, one of whom propelled the boat, another stood up
    waving about a torch dipped in some resinous substance, which
    threw a strong light on the water, while the third stood in the
    bows, armed with a spear, made of a bundle of wires, tied to a
    long pole, not at all unlike a gigantic egg-whip, with all its
    loops cut into points. This is aimed with great dexterity at
    the fish, who are either transfixed or jammed between the
    prongs. The fine figures of the natives, lighted up by the
    flickering torches, and standing out in bold relief against the
    dark blue starlit sky, would have served as models for the
    sculptors of ancient Greece.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, December 3rd</i>.&mdash;At a quarter to five this
    morning some of us landed to see the market, this being the
    great day when the natives come in from the country and
    surrounding villages, by sea and by land, in boats, or on
    horseback, to sell their produce, and buy necessaries for the
    coming week. We walked through the shady streets
    <span class="pagenum">Page 231<a name="Page_231"
       id="Page_231"></a></span> to the two covered market
       buildings, partitioned across with great bunches of oranges,
       plantains, and many-coloured vegetables, hung on strings.
       The mats, beds, and pillows still lying about suggested the
       idea that the salesmen and women had passed the night
       amongst their wares. The gaily attired, good-looking,
       flower-decorated crowd, of some seven or eight hundred
       people, all chatting and laughing, and some staring at
       us&mdash;but not rudely&mdash;looked much more like a chorus
       of opera-singers, dressed for their parts in some grand
       spectacle, than ordinary market-going peasants. Whichever
       way one turned, the prospect was an animated and attractive
       one. Here, beneath the shade of large, smooth, light-green
       banana leaves, was a group of earnest bargainers for
       mysterious-looking fish, luscious fruit, and vegetables;
       there, sheltered by a drooping mango, whose rich clusters of
       purple and orange fruit hung in tempting proximity to lips
       and hands, another little crowd was similarly engaged.
       Orange-trees were evidently favourite <i>rendezvous</i>; and
       a row of flower-sellers had established themselves in front
       of a hedge of scarlet hibiscus and double Cape jasmine.
       Every vendor carried his stock-in-trade, however small the
       articles composing it might be, on a bamboo pole, across his
       shoulder, occasionally with rather ludicrous effect, as, for
       instance, when the thick but light pole supported only a
       tiny fish six inches long at one end, and two mangoes at the
       other. Everybody seemed to have brought to market just what
       he or she happened to have on hand, however small the
       quantity. The women would have one, two, or three new-laid
       eggs in a leaf basket, one crab or lobster, three or four
       prawns, or one little trout. Under these circumstances,
       marketing for so large a party as ours was a somewhat
       lengthy operation, and I was much amused in watching our
       <i>proveedor</i>, as he went about collecting things by ones
       and twos, until he had piled a little cart quite full, and
       had had it pushed off to the shady quay.</p>

    <p>We strolled about until six o'clock, at which hour the
    purchasers began to disperse, and were just preparing to depart
    likewise, when an old man, carrying half-a-dozen little fish,
    and followed by a small boy laden with vegetables and fruit,
    introduced himself to us as the brother-in-law of Queen Pomare
    IV. and chief of Papeete, and, after a short talk, invited us
    to visit him at his house. We consented, and, following him,
    presently reached a break in the hedge and ditch that ran along
    the side of the road, beyond which was a track, bordered by
    pineapples and drac&aelig;nas, leading to a superior sort of
    house, built in the native style, and surrounded, as usual, by
    bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, banana, mango, and guava trees. We were
    conducted into the one large room, which contained two
    four-post bedsteads and four mattresses, laid on the floor, two
    or three trunks, and a table in the corner, on which were
    writing materials and a few books. The chief himself spoke a
    very little English, his son an equally small amount of French;
    so the conversation languished, and after a decent interval we
    rose to depart. Our host asked if he might 'come and see my
    ship,' and procured pen, ink, and paper&mdash;not of the best
    quality&mdash;for me to write an order for him do so, 'in case
    lady not at home.' He also presented me with some pictures of
    soldiers, drawn by his son&mdash;a boy about eleven years old,
    of whom he seemed very proud, and expressed his regret that we
    could not prolong our stay, at the same time placing at our
    disposal the whole house and garden, including a fat sow and
    eleven little pigs.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 233<a name="Page_233"
       id="Page_233"></a></span>Several other visitors had arrived
       by this time, one of whom was on horseback, and, as I was
       rather tired, he was asked if he would kindly allow me to
       ride down to the landing place. He replied that he would
       lend the horse to a gentleman, but not to me, as the saddle
       was not suitable. I explained that this made no difference
       to me, and mounted, though I did not attempt to follow the
       fashion of the native ladies here, who ride like men. Our
       new friend was quite delighted at this, and volunteered
       himself to show us something of the neighbourhood.
       Accordingly, leading my&mdash;or rather his&mdash;horse, and
       guiding him carefully over all the rough places, he took us
       through groves and gardens to the grounds belonging to the
       royal family, in which were plantations of various kinds of
       trees, and a thick undergrowth of guava. After an enjoyable
       little expedition we returned to the yacht at about
       half-past seven, accompanied by the small boy who had been
       carrying our special purchases from the market all this
       time, and by a little tail of followers.</p>

    <p>At half-past eight we breakfasted, so as to be ready for the
    service at the native church at ten o'clock; but several
    visitors arrived in the interval, and we had rather a bustle to
    get off in time, after all. We landed close to the church,
    under the shade of an hibiscus, whose yellow and orange flowers
    dropped off into the sea and floated away amongst the coral
    rocks, peeping out of the water here and there. The building
    appeared to be full to overflowing. The windows and doors were
    all wide open, and many members of the congregation were seated
    on the steps, on the lawn, and on the grassy slope beyond,
    listening to a discourse in the native language. Most of the
    people wore the native costume, which, especially when made of
    black stuff and surmounted by a little sailor's hat, decorated
    with a bandana handkerchief or a wreath of flowers, was very
    becoming. Sailors' hats are universally worn, and are generally
    made by the natives themselves from plantain
    <span class="pagenum">Page 234<a name="Page_234"
       id="Page_234"></a></span>or palm leaves, or from the inside
       fibre of the arrowroot. Some rather elderly men and women in
       the front rows were taking notes of the sermon. I found
       afterwards that they belonged to the Bible class, and that
       their great pride was to meet after the service and repeat
       by heart nearly all they had heard. This seems to show at
       least a desire to profit by the minister's efforts.</p>

    <p>After the usual service there were two christenings. The
    babies were held at the font by the men, who looked extremely
    sheepish. One baby was grandly attired in a book-muslin dress,
    with flounces, a tail at least six feet long dragging on the
    ground, and a lace cap with cherry-coloured bows; the other was
    nearly as smart, in a white-worked long frock and cap, trimmed
    with blue bows. The christenings over, there was a hymn,
    somewhat monotonous as to time and tune, but sung with much
    fervour, followed by the administration of the sacrament, in
    which cocoa-nut milk took the place of wine, and bread-fruit
    that of bread. The proper elements were originally used, but
    experience proved that, although the bread went round pretty
    well, the cup was almost invariably emptied by the first two or
    three communicants, sometimes with unfortunate results.</p>

    <p>After service we drove through the shady avenues of the town
    into the open country, past trim little villas and sugar-cane
    plantations, until we turned off the main road, and entered an
    avenue of mangoes, whence a rough road, cut through a guava
    thicket, leads to the main gate of
    Faataua<a name="FNanchor_9_9"
       id="FNanchor_9_9"></a> <a href="#Footnote_9_9"
       class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;a regular square Indian
       bungalow, with thatched roofs, verandahs covered with
       creepers, windows opening to the ground, and steps leading
       to the gardens on every side, ample accommodation for
       stables, kitchens, servants, being provided in numerous
       outbuildings.</p>

    <div class="footnote">

           'Fuatawah' or 'Faataua,' <i>to make friends</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Soon after breakfast, Mrs. Brander dressed me in one of her
    own native costumes, and we drove to the outskirts of a dense
    forest, through which a footpath leads to the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 235<a name="Page_235"
       id="Page_235"></a></span>waterfall and fort of Faataua. Here
       we found horses waiting for us, on which we rode,
       accompanied by the gentlemen on foot, through a thick growth
       of palms, orange-trees, guavas, and other tropical trees,
       some of which were overhung and almost choked by luxuriant
       creepers. Specially noticeable among the latter was a
       gorgeous purple passion-flower, with orange-coloured fruit
       as big as pumpkins, that covered everything with its
       vigorous growth. The path was always narrow and sometimes
       steep, and we had frequently almost to creep under the
       overhanging boughs, or to turn aside to avoid a more than
       usually dense mass of creepers. We crossed several small
       rivers, and at last reached a spot that commanded a view of
       the waterfall, on <span class="pagenum">Page
       236<a name="Page_236"
       id="Page_236"></a></span>the other side of a deep ravine.
       Just below the fort that crowns the height, a river issues
       from a narrow cleft in the rock, and falls at a single bound
       from the edge of an almost perpendicular cliff, 600 feet
       high, into the valley beneath. First one sees the rush of
       blue water, gradually changing in its descent to a cloud of
       white spray, which in its turn is lost in a rainbow of mist.
       Imagine that from beneath the shade of feathery palms and
       broad-leaved bananas through a network of ferns and creepers
       you are looking upon the Staubbach, in Switzerland,
       magnified in height, and with a background of verdure-clad
       mountains, and you will have some idea of the fall of
       Faataua as we beheld it.</p>

    <p>After resting a little while and taking some sketches, we
    climbed up to the fort itself, a place of considerable
    interest, where the natives held out to the very last against
    the French. On the bank opposite the fort, the last islander
    killed during the struggle for independence was shot while
    trying to escape. Situated in the centre of a group of
    mountains, with valleys branching off in all directions, the
    fort could hold communication with every part of the coast, and
    there can be little doubt that it would have held out much
    longer than it did, but for the treachery of one of the
    garrison, who led the invaders, under cover of the night, and
    by devious paths, to the top of a hill commanding the position.
    Now the ramparts and earthworks are overrun and almost hidden
    by roses. Originally planted, I suppose, by the new-comers,
    they have spread rapidly in all directions, till the hill-sides
    and summits are quite a-blush with the fragrant bloom.</p>

    <p>Having enjoyed some strawberries and some icy cold water
    from a spring, and heard a long account of the war from the
    <i>gardiens</i>, we found it was time to commence our return
    journey, as it was now getting late. We descended much more
    quickly than we had come up, but daylight had faded into the
    brief tropical twilight, and that again into the shades of
    night, ere we reached the carriage. <span class="pagenum">Page

       id="Page_237"></a></span></p>

    <p>Dinner and evening service brought the day to a conclusion,
    and I retired, not unwillingly, to bed, to dream of the charms
    of Tahiti.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I think that all I have seen must be only a long
    vision, and that too soon I shall awaken to the cold reality;
    the flowers, the fruit, the colours worn by every one, the
    whole scene and its surroundings, seem almost too fairylike to
    have an actual existence. I am in despair when I attempt to
    describe all these things. I feel that I cannot do anything
    like justice to their merits, and yet I fear all the time that
    what I say may be looked upon as an exaggeration.</p>

    <p>At daybreak next morning, when I went on deck, it was a dead
    calm. The sea-breeze had not yet come in, and there was not a
    ripple on the surface of the harbour. Outside, two little white
    trading schooners lay becalmed; inside, the harbour-tug was
    getting up steam. On shore, a few gaily dressed natives were
    hurrying home with their early market produce, and others were
    stretched lazily on the grass at the water's edge or on the
    benches under the trees. Our stores for the day, a
    picturesque-looking heap of fish, fruit, vegetables, and
    flowers, were on the steps, waiting to be brought off, and
    guarded in the meantime by natives in costumes of pink, blue,
    orange, and a delicate pale green they specially affect. The
    light mists rolled gradually away from the mountain tops, and
    there was every prospect of a fine day for a projected
    excursion.</p>

    <p>I went ashore to fetch some of the fresh gathered fruit, and
    soon we had a feast of luscious pineapples, juicy mangoes,
    bananas, and oranges, with the dew still upon them. The mango
    is certainly the king of fruit. Its flavour is a combination of
    apricot and pineapple, with the slightest
    <span class="pagenum">Page 238<a name="Page_238"
       id="Page_238"></a></span>possible suspicion of turpentine
       thrown in, to give a piquancy to the whole. I dare say it
       sounds a strange mixture, but I can only say that the result
       is delicious. To enjoy mangoes thoroughly you ought not to
       eat them in company, but leaning over the side of the ship,
       in the early morning, with your sleeves tucked up to your
       elbows, using no knife and fork, but tearing off the skin
       with your teeth, and sucking the abundant juice.</p>

    <p>We breakfasted at half-past six, and, at a little before
    eight, went ashore, where we were met by a sort of
    <i>char-&agrave;-bancs</i>, or American wagon, with three
    seats, one behind the other, all facing the horses, and roomy
    and comfortable enough for two persons. Our Transatlantic
    cousins certainly understand thoroughly, and do their best to
    improve everything connected with, the locomotion they love so
    well. A Chinese coachman and a thin but active pair of little
    horses completed the turn-out. Mabelle sat beside the coachman,
    and we four packed into, the other two seats, with all our
    belongings.</p>

    <p>The sun was certainly <i>very</i> powerful when we emerged
    from the shady groves of Papeete, but there was a nice breeze,
    and sometimes we got under the shade of cocoa-nut trees. We
    reached Punauia at about half-past nine, and changed horses
    there. While waiting, hot and thirsty, under the shelter of
    some trees, we asked for a cocoa-nut, whereupon a man standing
    by immediately tied a withy of banana leaves round his feet and
    proceeded to climb, or rather hop, up the nearest tree, raising
    himself with his two hands and his feet alternately, with an
    exactly similar action to that of our old friend the monkey on
    the stick. People who have tasted the cocoa-nut only in England
    can have no idea what a delicious fruit it really is when
    nearly ripe and freshly plucked. The natives remove the outer
    husk, just leaving a little piece to serve as a foot for the
    pale brown cup to rest on. They then smooth off the top, and
    you have an elegant vase, something like a mounted ostrich
    <span class="pagenum">Page 239<a name="Page_239"
       id="Page_239"></a></span>egg in appearance, lined with the
       snowiest ivory, and containing about three pints of cool
       sweet water. Why it is called milk I cannot understand, for
       it is as clear as crystal, and is always cool and
       refreshing, though the nut in which it is contained has
       generally been exposed to the fiercest sun. In many of the
       coral islands, where the water is brackish, the natives
       drink scarcely anything but cocoa-nut milk; and even here,
       if you are thirsty and ask for a glass of water, you are
       almost always presented with a cocoa-nut instead.</p>

    <p>From Punauia onwards the scenery increased in beauty, and
    the foliage was, if possible, more luxuriant than ever. The
    road ran through extensive coffee, sugar-cane, Indian corn,
    orange, cocoa-nut, and cotton plantations, and vanilla,
    carefully trained on bamboos, growing in the thick shade. Near
    Atimaono we passed the house of a great cotton planter, and,
    shortly afterwards, the curious huts, raised on platforms,
    built by some islanders he has imported from the Kingsmill
    group to work his plantations. They are a wild, savage-looking
    set, very inferior to the Tahitians in appearance. The
    cotton-mills, which formerly belonged to a company, are now all
    falling to ruin; and in many other parts of the island we
    passed cotton plantations uncleaned and neglected, and fast
    running to seed and waste. So long as the American war lasted,
    a slight profit could be made upon Tahitian cotton, but now it
    is hopeless to attempt to cultivate it with any prospect of
    adequate return.</p>

    <p>The sun was now at its height, and we longed to stop and
    bathe in one of the many fresh-water streams we crossed, and
    afterwards to eat our lunch by the wayside; but our Chinese
    coachman always pointed onwards, and said, 'Eatee much
    presently; horses eatee too.' At last we arrived at a little
    house, shaded by cocoa-nut trees, and built in an enclosure
    near the sea-shore, with 'Restaurant' written up over the door.
    We drove in, and were met by the proprietor, with what must
    have been rather an embarrassing multiplicity of women and
    children about his heels. <span class="pagenum">Page
    240<a name="Page_240"
       id="Page_240"></a></span>The cloth was not laid, but the
       rooms looked clean, and there was a heap of tempting-looking
       fish and fruit in a corner. We assured him we were starving,
       and begged for luncheon as soon as possible; and, in the
       meantime, went for a dip in the sea. But the water was
       shallow, and the sun made the temperature at least 90&deg;,
       so that our bath was not very refreshing. On our return we
       found the table most enticingly laid out, with little
       scarlet crayfish, embedded in cool green lettuce leaves,
       fruit of various kinds, good wine and fair bread, all
       arranged on a clean though coarse tablecloth. There was also
       a savoury omelette, so good that Tom asked for a second;
       when, to our astonishment, there appeared a plump roast
       fowl, with most artistic gravy and fried potatoes. Then came
       a <i>biftek aux champignons</i>, and some excellent coffee
       to wind up with. On making the host our compliments, he
       said, 'Je fais la cuisine moi-m&ecirc;me, Madame.' In the
       course of our repast we again tasted the bread-fruit, but
       did not much appreciate it, though it was this time cooked
       in the native fashion&mdash;roasted underground by means of
       hot stones.</p>

    <p>Our coachman was becoming impatient, so we bade farewell to
    our host, and resumed our journey. We crossed innumerable
    streams on our way, generally full not only of water, but also
    of bathers; for the Tahitians are very fond of water, and
    always bathe once or twice a day in the fresh streams, even
    after having been in the sea.</p>

    <p>In many places along the road people were making hay from
    short grass, and in others they were weighing it preparatory to
    sending it into town. But they say the grass grown here is not
    at all nourishing for horses, and some people import it from
    Valparaiso.</p>

    <p>The road round the island is called the Broom Road. Convicts
    were employed in its original formation, and now it is the
    punishment for any one getting drunk in any part of the island
    to be set to work to sweep, repair, and keep in order a piece
    of the road in the neighbourhood of his
    <span class="pagenum">Page 241<a name="Page_241"
       id="Page_241"></a></span>dwelling. It is the one good road
       of Tahiti, encircling the larger of the two peninsulas close
       to the sea-shore, and surmounting the low mountain range in
       the centre of the isthmus.</p>

    <p>Before long we found ourselves close to Taravao, the narrow
    strip of land connecting the two peninsulas into which Tahiti
    is divided, and commenced to ascend the hills that form the
    backbone of the island. We climbed up and up, reaching the
    summit at last, to behold a magnificent prospect on all sides.
    Then a short sharp descent, a long drive over grass roads
    through a rich forest, and again a brief ascent, brought us to
    our sleeping-quarters for the night, the Hotel de l'Isthme,
    situated in a valley in the midst of a dense grove of
    cocoa-nuts and bananas, kept by two retired French sailors, who
    came out to meet us, and conducted us up a flight of steps on
    the side of a mud bank to the four rooms forming the hotel.
    These were two sleeping apartments, a <i>salon</i>, and a
    <i>salle &agrave; manger</i>, the walls of which consisted of
    flat pieces of wood, their own width apart, something like
    Venetian shutters, with unglazed windows and doors opening into
    the garden.</p>

    <p>We walked about four hundred yards along a grassy road to
    the sea, where Mabelle and I paddled about in shallow water and
    amused ourselves by picking up coral, shells, and
    <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, and watching the blue and yellow
    fish darting in and out among the rocks, until at last we found
    a place in the coral which made a capital deep-water bath.
    Dressing again was not such a pleasant affair, owing to the
    mosquitoes biting us in the most provoking manner. Afterwards
    we strolled along the shore, which was covered with cocoa-nuts
    and driftwood, washed thither, I suppose, from some of the
    adjacent islands, and on our way back to the hotel we gathered
    a handful of choice exotics and graceful ferns, with which to
    decorate the table.</p>

    <p>The dinner itself really deserves a detailed description, if
    only to show that one may make the tour of Tahiti
    <span class="pagenum">Page 242<a name="Page_242"
       id="Page_242"></a></span>without necessarily having to rough
       it in the matter of food. We had crayfish and salad as a
       preliminary, and next, an excellent soup followed by
       delicious little oysters, that cling to the boughs and roots
       of the guava and mangrove trees overhanging the sea. Then
       came a large fish, name unknown, the inevitable
       <i>bouilli</i> and cabbage, <i>c&ocirc;telettes aux pommes,
       biftek aux champignons</i>, succeeded by crabs and other
       shellfish, including <i>wurrali</i>, a delicate-flavoured
       kind of lobster, an <i>omelette aux abricots</i>, and
       dessert of tropical fruits. We were also supplied with good
       wine, both red and white, and bottled beer.</p>

    <p>I ought, in truth, to add that the cockroaches were rather
    lively and plentiful, but they did not form a serious drawback
    to our enjoyment. After dinner, however, when I went to see
    Mabelle to bed, hundreds of these creatures, about three inches
    long, and broad in proportion, scuttled away as I lighted the
    candle; and while we were sitting outside we could see troops
    of them marching up and down in rows between the crevices of
    the walls. Then there were the mosquitoes, who hummed and
    buzzed about us, and with whom, alas! we were doomed to make a
    closer acquaintance. Our bed was fitted with the very thickest
    calico mosquito curtains, impervious to the air, but not to the
    venomous little insects, who found their way in through every
    tiny opening in spite of all our efforts to exclude them.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, December 5th</i>.&mdash;The heat in the night
    was suffocating, and soon after twelve o'clock we both woke up,
    feeling half-stifled. There was a dim light shining into the
    room, and Tom said, 'Thank goodness, it's getting daylight;'
    but on striking my repeater we found to our regret that this
    was a mistake. In the moonlight I could see columns of nasty
    brown cockroaches ascending the bedposts, crawling along the
    top of the curtains, dropping with a thud on to the bed, and
    then descending over the side to the ground. At last I could
    stand it no longer, and <span class="pagenum">Page
    243<a name="Page_243"
       id="Page_243"></a></span>opening the curtains cautiously, I
       seized my slippers, knocked half-a-dozen brown beasts out of
       each, wrapped myself in a poncho&mdash;previously well
       shaken&mdash;gathered my garments around me, surmounted a
       barricade I had constructed overnight to keep the pigs and
       chickens out of our doorless room, and fled to the garden.
       All was still, the only sign of life being a light in a
       neighbouring hut, and I sat out in the open air in
       comparative comfort, until driven indoors again by torrents
       of rain, at about half-past two o'clock.</p>

    <p>I plunged into bed again, taking several mosquitoes with me,
    which hummed and buzzed and devoured us to their hearts'
    content till dawn. Then I got up and walked down to the beach
    to bathe, and returned to breakfast at six o'clock, refreshed
    but still disfigured.</p>

    <p>It is now the depth of winter and the middle of the rainy
    season in Tahiti; but, luckily for us, it is nearly always fine
    in the daytime. At night, however, there is often a perfect
    deluge, which floods the houses and gardens, turns the streams
    into torrents, but washes and refreshes the vegetation, and
    leaves the landscape brighter and greener than before.</p>

    <p>At half-past seven the horses were put to, and we were just
    ready for a start, when down came the rain again, more heavily
    than before. It was some little time before it ceased enough to
    allow us to start, driving along grassy roads and through
    forests, but progressing rather slowly, owing to the soaked
    condition of the ground. If you can imagine the Kew hot-houses
    magnified and multiplied to an indefinite extent, and laid out
    as a gentleman's park, traversed by numerous grassy roads
    fringed with cocoa-nut palms, and commanding occasional
    glimpses of sea, and beach, and coral reefs, you will have some
    faint idea of the scene through which our road lay.</p>

    <p>Many rivers we crossed, and many we stuck in, the gentlemen
    having more than once to take off their shoes
    <span class="pagenum">Page 244<a name="Page_244"
       id="Page_244"></a></span>and stockings, tuck up their
       trousers, jump into the water, and literally put their
       shoulders to the wheel. Sometimes we drove out into the
       shallow sea, till it seemed doubtful when and where we
       should make the land again. Sometimes we climbed up a solid
       road, blasted out of the face of the black cliffs, or crept
       along the shore of the tranquil lagoon, frightening the
       land-crabs into their holes as they felt the shake of the
       approaching carriage. Palms and passiflora abounded, the
       latter being specially magnificent. It seems wonderful how
       their thin steins can support, at a height of thirty or
       forty feet from the ground, the masses of huge
       orange-coloured fruit which depend in strings from their
       summits.</p>

    <p>At the third river, not far from where it fell into the sea,
    we thought it was time to lunch; so we stopped the carriage,
    gave the horses their provender, and sat down to enjoy
    ourselves after our long drive. It was early in the afternoon
    before we started again, and soon after this we were met by
    fresh horses, sent out from Papenoo<a name="FNanchor_10_10"
       id="FNanchor_10_10">;</a> <a href="#Footnote_10_10"
       class="fnanchor">[10]</a> so it was not long before we found
       ourselves near Point Venus, where we once more came upon a
       good piece of road, down which we rattled to the plains
       outside Papeete.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_10_10"

           From 'pape,' <i>water</i>, and 'noo,'
           <i>abundance</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We reached the quay at about seven o'clock, and, our arrival
    having been observed, several friends came to see us and to
    inquire how we had fared. Before we started on our excursion,
    instructions had been given that the 'Sunbeam' should be
    painted <i>white</i>, for the sake of coolness, and we were all
    very curious to see how she would look in her new dress; but
    unfortunately the wet weather has delayed the work, and there
    is still a good deal to do.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, December 6th</i>.&mdash;It was raining fast at
    half-past four this morning, which was rather provoking, as I
    wanted to take some photographs from the yacht's deck before
    the sea-breeze sprang up. But the weather cleared while I was
    choosing my position and fixing my camera,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 245<a name="Page_245"
       id="Page_245"></a></span>and I was enabled to take what I
       hope may prove to be some successful photographs.</p>

    <p>Messrs. Brander's mail-ship, a sailing vessel of about 600
    tons, was to leave for San Francisco at eight o'clock, and at
    seven Tom started in the 'Flash' to take our letters on board.
    The passage to San Francisco occupies twenty-five days on an
    average, and is performed with great regularity once a month
    each way. The vessels employed on this line, three in number,
    are well built, and have good accommodation for passengers, and
    they generally carry a full cargo. In the present instance it
    consists of fungus and tripang (<i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>) for
    China, oranges for San Francisco, a good many packages of
    sundries, and a large consignment of pearls, entrusted to the
    captain at the last moment.</p>

    <p>So brisk is the trade carried on between Tahiti and the
    United States, that the cost of this vessel was more than
    covered by the freights the first year after she was built. In
    addition to these ships, there are those which run backwards
    and forwards to Valparaiso, and the little island trading
    schooners; so that the Tahitians can boast of quite a
    respectable fleet of vessels, not imposing perhaps in point of
    tonnage, but as smart and serviceable-looking as could be
    desired. The trading schooners are really beautiful little
    craft, and I am sure that, if well kept and properly manned,
    they would show to no discredit among our smart yachts at
    Cowes. Not a day passes without one or more entering or leaving
    the harbour, returning from or bound to the lonely isles with
    which the south-west portion of the Pacific is studded. They
    are provided with a patent log, but their captains, who are
    intelligent men, do not care much about a chronometer, as the
    distances to be run are comparatively short and are easily
    judged.</p>

    <p>Mr. Godeffroy gave us rather an amusing account of the
    manner in which their negotiations with the natives are
    conducted. The more civilised islanders have got beyond barter,
    and prefer hard cash in American dollars for their
    <span class="pagenum">Page 246<a name="Page_246"
       id="Page_246"></a></span>pearls, shells, cocoa-nuts,
       sandal-wood, &amp;c. When they have received the money, they
       remain on deck for some time discussing their bargains among
       themselves. Then they peep down through the open skylights
       into the cabin below, where the most attractive prints and
       the gaudiest articles of apparel are temptingly displayed,
       alongside a few bottles of rum and brandy and a supply of
       tobacco. It is not long before the bait is swallowed; down
       go the natives, the goods are sold, and the dollars have
       once more found their way back into the captain's hands.</p>

    <p>I had a long talk with one of the natives, who arrived
    to-day from Flint Island&mdash;a most picturesque-looking
    individual, dressed in scarlet and orange-coloured flannel, and
    a mass of black, shiny, curly hair. Flint Island is a place
    whose existence has been disputed, it having been more than
    once searched for by ships in vain. It was, therefore,
    particularly interesting to meet some one who had actually
    visited, and had just returned from, the spot in question. That
    islands do occasionally disappear entirely in these parts there
    can be little doubt. The Tahitian schooners were formerly in
    the habit of trading with a small island close to Rarotonga,
    whose name I forget; but about four years ago, when proceeding
    thither with the usual three-monthly cargo of provisions,
    prints, &amp;c., they failed to find the island, of which no
    trace has since been seen. Two missionaries from Rarotonga are
    believed to have been on it at the time of its disappearance,
    and to have shared its mysterious fate.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, December 7th</i>.&mdash;At eight o'clock I took
    Mabelle and Muriel for a drive in a pony-carriage which had
    been kindly lent me, but with a hint that the horse was rather
    <i>m&eacute;chant</i> sometimes. He behaved well on the present
    occasion, however, and we had a pleasant drive in the outskirts
    of the town for a couple of hours.</p>

    <p>Just as we returned, a gentleman came and asked me if I
    should like to see some remarkably fine pearls, and on
    <span class="pagenum">Page 247<a name="Page_247"
       id="Page_247"></a></span>my gladly consenting, he took me to
       his house, where I saw some pearls certainly worth going to
       look at, but too expensive for me, one pear-shaped gem alone
       having been valued at 1,000<i>l</i>. I was told they came
       from a neighbouring island, and I was given two shells
       containing pearls in various stages of formation.</p>

    <p>It was now time to go on board to receive some friends whom
    we had invited to breakfast, and who arrived at about half-past
    eleven.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

    </div>

    <p>After breakfast, and a chat, and an examination of the
    photograph books, &amp;c., we all landed, and went to see
    Messrs. Brander's stores, where all sorts of requisites for
    fitting out ships and their crews can be procured. It is
    surprising to find how plentiful are the supplies of the
    necessaries and even the luxuries of civilised life in this
    far-away corner of the globe. You can even get <i>ice</i> here,
    for the manufacture of which a retired English infantry officer
    has set up an establishment with great success. But what
    interested me most were the products of this and the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 248<a name="Page_248"
       id="Page_248"></a></span>neighbouring islands. There were
       tons of exquisitely tinted pearl shells, six or eight inches
       in diameter, formerly a valuable article of commerce, but
       now worth comparatively little. The pearls that came out of
       them had unfortunately been sent away to
       Liverpool&mdash;1,000<i>l</i>. worth by this morning's, and
       5,000<i>l</i> by the last mail-ship. Then there was vanilla,
       a most precarious crop, which needs to be carefully watered
       and shaded from the first moment it is planted, and which
       must be gathered before it is ripe, and dried and matured in
       a moist heat, between blankets and feather-beds, in order
       that the pods may not crack and allow the essence to escape.
       We saw also edible fungus, exported to San Francisco, and
       thence to Hong Kong, solely for the use of the Chinese;
       tripang, or <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>, a sort of sea-slug or
       holothuria, which, either living or dead, fresh or dried,
       looks equally untempting, but is highly esteemed by the
       Celestials; coprah, or dried cocoa-nut kernels, broken into
       small pieces in order that they may stow better, and
       exported to England and other parts, where the oil is
       expressed and oil-cake formed; and various other articles of
       commerce. The trade of the island is fast increasing, the
       average invoice value of the exports having risen from
       8,400<i>l</i> in 1845 to 98,000<i>l</i> in 1874. These
       totals are exclusive of the value of the pearls, which would
       increase it by at least another 3,000<i>l</i> or
       4,000<i>l</i>.</p>

    <p>I speak from personal experience when I say that every
    necessary of life on board ship, and many luxuries, can be
    procured at Tahiti. American tinned fruits and vegetables beat
    English ones hollow. Preserved milk is
    uncertain&mdash;sometimes better, sometimes worse, than what
    one buys at home. Tinned salmon is much better. Australian
    mutton, New Zealand beef, and South Sea pork, leave nothing to
    be desired in the way of preserved meat. Fresh beef, mutton,
    and butter are hardly procurable, and the latter, when
    preserved, is uneatable. I can never understand why they don't
    take to potting and salting down for export the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 249<a name="Page_249"
       id="Page_249"></a></span><i>best</i> butter, at some large
       Irish or Devonshire farm, instead of reserving that process
       for butter which is just on the turn and is already almost
       unfit to eat; the result being that, long before it has
       reached a hot climate, it is only fit to grease
       carriage-wheels with. It could be done, and I feel sure it
       would pay, as good butter would fetch almost any price in
       many places. Some Devonshire butter, which we brought with
       us from England, is as good now, after ten thousand miles in
       the tropics, as it was when first put on board; but a
       considerable proportion is very bad, and was evidently not
       in proper condition in the first instance.</p>

    <p>We had intended going afterwards to the coral reef with the
    children to have a picnic there, and had accordingly given the
    servants leave to go ashore for the evening; but it came on to
    rain heavily, and we were obliged to return to the yacht
    instead. The servants had, however, already availed themselves
    of the permission they had received, and there was therefore no
    one on board in their department; so we had to unpack our
    basket and have our picnic on deck, under the awning, instead
    of on the reef, which I think was almost as great a treat to
    the children.</p>

    <p>We have, I am sorry to say, had a good deal of trouble with
    some of our men here. One disappeared directly we arrived, and
    has never been seen since. Another came off suffering from
    delirium tremens and epileptic fits, brought on by drink. His
    cries and struggles were horrible to hear and witness. It took
    four strong men to hold him, and the doctor was up with him all
    last night. Nearly all the ships that come here have been at
    sea for a long time, and the men are simply wild when they get
    ashore. Some of the people know only too well how to take
    advantage of this state of things, and the consequence is that
    it is hardly safe for a sailor to drink a glass of grog, for
    fear that it should be drugged. No doubt there are respectable
    places to which the men could resort, but it is not easy for a
    stranger to find them out, and our men seem to have been
    <span class="pagenum">Page 250<a name="Page_250"
       id="Page_250"></a></span>particularly unfortunate in this
       respect. Tom talks of leaving two of them behind, and
       shipping four fresh hands, as our number is already rather
       short.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, December 8th</i>.&mdash;I persuaded Tom to make
    another excursion to the coral reef this morning, and at five
    o'clock he and Mabelle and I set off in the 'Flash,' just as
    the sun was rising. We had a delightful row, past the
    Quarantine Island<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
       id="FNanchor_11_11"></a> <a href="#Footnote_11_11"
       class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, to the portion of the reef on the
       other side of the harbour, where we had not yet been, and
       where I think the coral plants and flowers and bushes showed
       to greater advantage than ever, as they were less crowded,
       and the occasional patches of sandy bottom enabled one to
       see them better. We were so engrossed in our examination of
       these marvels of the deep, and of the fish with which the
       water abounded, that we found ourselves aground several
       times, and our return to the yacht was consequently
       delayed.</p>

    <div class="footnote">

           The native name is 'Motu-iti,' i.e. <i>little
           island</i>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>After breakfast I had another visit from a man with
    war-cloaks, shell-belts, <i>tapa</i>, and <i>reva reva</i>,
    which he brought on board for my inspection. It was a difficult
    task to make him understand what I meant, but at last I thought
    I had succeeded in impressing on his mind the fact that I
    wished to buy them, and that they would be paid for at the
    store. The sequel unfortunately proved that I was mistaken. At
    nine o'clock we set out for the shore, and after landing drove
    along the same road by which we had returned from our excursion
    round the island<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
       id="FNanchor_12_12">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_12_12"
       class="fnanchor">[12]</a> After seeing as much of the place
       as our limited time would allow, we drove over to Faataua,
       where we found the children and maids. The grand piano,
       every table, and the drawing-room floor,
       <span class="pagenum">Page 251<a name="Page_251"
       id="Page_251"></a></span>were spread with the presents we
       were expected to take away with us. There were bunches of
       scarlet feathers, two or three hundred in number, from the
       tail of the tropic bird, which are only allowed to be
       possessed and worn by chiefs, and which are of great value,
       as each bird produces only two feathers; pearl shells, with
       corals growing on them, red coral from the islands on the
       Equator, curious sponges and sea-weed, <i>tapa</i> cloth and
       <i>reva-reva</i> fringe, arrowroot and palm-leaf hats,
       cocoa-nut drinking vessels, fine mats plaited in many
       patterns, and other specimens of the products of the
       island.</p>

           We paid a brief visit to Point Venus, whence Captain
           Cook observed the transit of Venus on November 9th,
           1769, and we saw the lighthouse and tamarind tree, which
           now mark the spot. The latter, from which we brought
           away some seed, was undoubtedly planted by Captain Cook
           with his own hand.</p>

    <p>All the members of the royal family at present in Tahiti had
    been invited to meet us, and arrived in due course, including
    the heir-apparent and his brother and sister. All the guests
    were dressed in the native costume, with wreaths on their heads
    and necks, and even the servants&mdash;including our own, whom
    I hardly recognised&mdash;were similarly decorated. Wreaths had
    also been prepared for us, three of fragrant yellow flowers for
    Mabelle, Muriel, and myself, and others of a different kind for
    the gentlemen.</p>

    <p>When the feast was ready the Prince offered me his arm, and
    we all walked in a procession to a grove of bananas in the
    garden through two lines of native servants, who, at a given
    signal, saluted us with three hearty English cheers. We then
    continued our walk till we arrived at a house, built in the
    native style, by the side of a rocky stream, like a Scotch
    burn. The uprights of the house were banana trees, transplanted
    with their leaves on, so as to shade the roof, which was formed
    of plaited cocoa-nut palm-leaves, each about fifteen feet long,
    laid transversely across bamboo rafters. From these light-green
    <span class="pagenum">Page 252<a name="Page_252"
       id="Page_252"></a></span>supports and the dark green roof
       depended the yellow and brown leaves of the <i>theve</i>,
       woven into graceful garlands and elegant festoons. The floor
       was covered with the finest mats, with black and white
       borders, and the centre strewn with broad green plantain
       leaves, to form the tablecloth, on which were laid baskets
       and dishes, made of leaves sewed together, and containing
       all sorts of native delicacies. There were oysters,
       lobsters, wurrali, and crawfish, stewed chicken, boiled
       sucking-pig, plantains, bread-fruit, melons, bananas,
       oranges, and strawberries. Before each guest was placed a
       half cocoa-nut full of salt water, another full of chopped
       cocoa-nut, a third full of fresh water, and another full of
       milk, two pieces of bamboo, a basket of <i>poi</i>, half a
       bread-fruit, and a platter of green leaves, the latter being
       changed with each course. We took our seats on the ground
       round the green table. An address was first delivered in the
       native language, grace was then said, and we commenced. The
       first operation was to mix the salt water and the chopped
       cocoa-nut together, so as to make an appetising sauce, into
       which we were supposed to dip each morsel we ate, the empty
       salt-water bowl being filled up with fresh water with which
       to wash our fingers and lips. We were tolerably successful
       in the use of our fingers as substitutes for knives and
       forks. The only drawback was that the dinner had to be eaten
       amid such a scene of novelty and beauty, that our attention
       was continually distracted: there was so much to admire,
       both in the house itself and outside it. After we had
       finished, all the servants sat down to dinner, and from a
       da&iuml;s at one end of the room we surveyed the bright and
       animated scene, the gentlemen&mdash;and some of the ladies
       too&mdash;meanwhile enjoying their cigarettes.</p>

    <p>When we got down to Papeete, at about half-past four, so
    many things had to be done that it seemed impossible to
    accomplish a start this evening. First of all the two Princes
    came on board, and were shown round, after which
    <span class="pagenum">Page 253<a name="Page_253"
       id="Page_253"></a></span>there were accounts to be paid,
       linen to be got on board; and various other preparations to
       be made. Presently it was discovered that the cloaks I had
       purchased&mdash;or thought I had purchased&mdash;this
       morning had not turned up, and that our saddles had been
       left at Faataua on Sunday and had been forgotten. The latter
       were immediately sent for, but although some one went on
       shore to look after the cloaks nothing could be heard of
       them; so I suppose I failed after all in making the man
       understand that he was to take them to the store and be paid
       for them there.</p>

    <p>At six o'clock the pilot sent word that it was no longer
    safe to go out; but steam was already up, and Tom therefore
    decided to go outside the reef and there wait for the people
    and goods that were still on shore. At this moment the saddles
    appeared in one direction, and the rest of the party in
    another. They were soon on board, the anchor was raised, and we
    began to steam slowly ahead, taking a last regretful look at
    Papeete as we left the harbour. By the time we were outside it
    was dark, the pilot went ashore, and we steamed full speed
    ahead. After dinner, and indeed until we went to bed, at
    half-past eleven, the lights along the shore were clearly
    visible, and the form of the high mountains behind could be
    distinguished.</p>

    <p>Good-bye, lovely Tahiti! I wonder if I shall ever see you
    again; it makes me quite sad to think how small is the chance
    of my doing so.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, December 9th</i>.&mdash;After leaving the
    harbour of Papeete we passed close to the island of Eimeo, on
    which we have gazed so often and with so much pleasure during
    the past week. It is considered the most beautiful island of
    the Georgian group, and we all regretted that we were unable to
    spare the time to visit it. From afar it is rather like the
    dolomite mountains in the Tyrol, and it is said that the
    resemblance is even more striking on a near approach. The
    harbour is a long narrow gorge between high mountains, clothed
    with palms, oranges, and plantains, and is one of the most
    remarkable features of the place. Huahine is the island of
    which the Earl and the Doctor speak, in 'South Sea Bubbles,' in
    terms of such enthusiasm, and Rarotonga is the head and centre
    of all the missionary efforts of the present time in these
    parts.</p>

    <p>The weather to-day was fine, though we had occasional
    squalls of wind and rain. We were close-hauled, and the motion
    of the vessel was violent and disagreeable. I was very
    sea-sick, and was consoled to find that several of the men were
    so too. A head sea&mdash;or nearly so&mdash;is quite a novel
    experience for us of late, and we none of us like the
    change.<span class="pagenum">Page 255<a name="Page_255"
       id="Page_255"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Sunday, December 10th</i>.&mdash;Another squally day.
    Still close-hauled, and even then not on our course. We had a
    short service at eleven, but it was as much as I could do to
    remain on deck.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, December 11th</i>.&mdash;Very like yesterday. We
    passed close to Flint and Vostok Islands, at the former of
    which I should have much liked to land. But it was a good deal
    to leeward of us; there is no anchorage, and the landing, which
    is always difficult and sometimes impossible, has to be
    effected in native surf-boats. It would have been interesting
    to see a guano island, of which this is a perfect specimen.</p>

    <p>We had hoped to make the Caroline Islands before dark (not
    the Caroline Islands proper, but a group of low islets, whose
    position is very uncertainly indicated in the different charts
    and books); but the wind fell light, and as we could see
    nothing of them at sunset, although the view from the masthead
    extended at least fifteen miles in every direction, it was
    decided at eight o'clock to put the ship about, to insure not
    running on them or any of the surrounding reefs in the night.
    The currents run very swiftly between these islands, and it is
    impossible to tell your exact position, even a few hours after
    having taken an observation.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, December 12th</i>.&mdash;The wind freshened
    immediately after we had changed our course last night, and
    fell light directly we had put about again this morning, so
    that it was fully 9 a.m. before we had regained our position of
    yesterday evening.</p>

    <p>Our compass-cards were getting worn out, and Tom gave out
    new ones before leaving Tahiti. I was very much amused
    to-night, when, as usual, just before going to bed, I went to
    have a look at the compass and see how the yacht was lying, and
    asked the man at the wheel what course he was steering. 'North
    and by west, half-east, ma'am,' he replied. 'That's a funny
    course,' I said; 'tell <span class="pagenum">Page
    256<a name="Page_256"
       id="Page_256"></a></span>me again.' He repeated his
       statement; whereupon I remarked that the course was quite a
       new one to me. 'Oh, yes, ma'am,' he answered, 'but them's
       the new compass-cards.' This man is one of the best helmsmen
       in the ship, but certainly seems to be an indifferent
       scholar.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, December 15th</i>.&mdash;We crossed the line at
    half-past four this morning. Father Neptune was to have paid us
    another visit in the evening, but the crew were busy, and there
    were some difficulties about arranging the details of the
    ceremony. The children were obliged, therefore, to be content
    with their usual game of drilling every one that they were able
    to muster for soldiers, after the fashion of Captain Brown's
    'rifle practice,' or marching up and down the decks to the
    strains of Jem Butt's fiddle playing 'Tommy make room for your
    Uncle,' accompanied by the somewhat discordant noise of their
    own drums. These amusements after sunset, and scrubbing decks
    and working at the pumps before sunrise, give us all the
    much-needed exercise it is impossible to take in the heat of
    the daytime.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, December 16th</i>.&mdash;At 1.30 a.m. I was
    awoke by the strains of sweet music, and could not at first
    imagine where I could be, or whence the sounds came. It proved
    to be the performance of some 'waits' on board. I do not know
    who originated the idea, but it was a very good one, and was
    excellently carried out. Everybody assembled on deck by
    degrees, and the songsters enjoyed a glass of grog when their
    labours were finished, after which we all went to bed
    again.</p>

    <p>It had fallen calm yesterday evening, and the funnel was
    raised at midnight, but the breeze sprang up again to-day, and
    at noon the fires were banked and the sails were set. Of course
    it then fell calm again, and at six o'clock we were once more
    proceeding under steam. There was one squall in the night,
    accompanied by the most tremendous rain I ever saw or heard. We
    talk of tropical rain in England, but the real thing is very
    different. It seemed just as if the bottom of an enormous
    cistern overhead had suddenly been removed, allowing the
    contents to fall exactly on the spot where we were. The water
    came down in sheets, and was soon three or four inches deep on
    the deck, though it was pouring out of the scuppers all the
    time as fast as possible.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, December 17th</i>.&mdash;A showery morning. We
    had Communion Service and hymns at eleven. In the afternoon it
    was too rough for 'church,' and Tom was unable to deliver his
    intended address to the men.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, December 18th</i>.&mdash;We were close-hauled,
    with a strong north-east wind, and heavy squalls and showers at
    intervals. We saw several flying-fish and a good many birds,
    apparently hovering over a shoal of whales or grampuses. It is
    wonderful how little life we have seen on this portion of our
    voyage.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, December 19th</i>.&mdash;A fine day&mdash;wind
    rather more fair&mdash;sea still rough and disagreeable. I
    tried to work hard all day, but found it very
    difficult.<span class="pagenum">Page 258<a name="Page_258"
       id="Page_258"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Thursday, December 21st</i>.&mdash;Wind variable and
    baffling&mdash;sometimes calm, sometimes squally, sometimes a
    nice breeze. Sails were hoisted and lowered at least a dozen
    times, and fires were banked more than once.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, December 22nd</i>.&mdash;At 6.30 a.m. we made the
    island of Hawaii, rather too much to leeward, as we had been
    carried by the strong current at least eighteen miles out of
    our course. We were therefore obliged to beat up to windward,
    in the course of which operation we passed a large barque
    running before the wind&mdash;the first ship we had seen since
    leaving Tahiti&mdash;and also a fine whale, blowing, close to
    us. We could not see the high land in the centre of the island,
    owing to the mist in which it was enveloped, and there was
    great excitement and much speculation on board as to the
    principal points which were visible. At noon the observations
    taken proved that Tom was right in his opinion as to our exact
    position. The wind dropped as we approached the coast, where we
    could see the heavy surf dashing against the black lava cliffs,
    rushing up the little creeks, and throwing its spray in huge
    fountain-like jets high above the tall cocoa-nut trees far
    inland.</p>

    <p>We sailed along close to the shore, and by two o'clock were
    near the entrance to the Bay of Hilo. In answer to our signal
    for a pilot a boat came off with a man who said he knew the
    entrance to the harbour, but informed us that the proper pilot
    had gone to Honolulu on a pleasure trip.</p>

    <p>It was a clear afternoon. The mountains, Mauna Kea and Mauna
    Loa, could be plainly seen from top to bottom, their giant
    crests rising nearly 14,000 feet above our heads, their tree
    and fern clad slopes seamed with deep gulches or ravines, down
    each of which a fertilising river ran into the sea. Inside the
    reef, the white coral shore, on which the waves seemed too lazy
    to break, is fringed with a belt of cocoa-nut palms, amongst
    which, as well as on the hill-sides, the little white houses
    are prettily dotted. All are surrounded by gardens, so full of
    flowers that the bright <span class="pagenum">Page
    259<a name="Page_259"
       id="Page_259"></a></span>patches of colour were plainly
       visible even from the deck of the yacht. The harbour is
       large, and is exposed only to one bad wind, which is most
       prevalent during the winter months. Still, with good
       ground-tackle, there is not much to be feared, and there is
       one particular spot, sheltered by the Blonde reef, which is
       almost always safe. Here, accordingly, we have taken up our
       station, though it is rather far from the town. Sometimes it
       is impossible to land at Hilo itself for days together, but
       there is fortunately a little creek behind Cocoa-nut Island
       which is always accessible.</p>

    <p>This afternoon the weather was all that could be desired,
    and at three o'clock we landed and went straight to Mr.
    Conway's store to make arrangements for going to the volcano of
    Kilauea to-morrow. Mr. Conway sent a man off at once on
    horseback to warn the people at the 'Half-way House' and at
    'Volcano House' to make preparations to receive our
    party&mdash;a necessary precaution, as visitors to the island
    are not numerous, and can only arrive by the monthly steamer
    from Honolulu.</p>

    <p>Having arranged this matter, we went for a stroll, among
    neat houses and pretty gardens, to the suspension-bridge over
    the river, followed by a crowd of girls, all decorated with
    wreaths and garlands, and wearing almost the same dress that we
    had seen at Tahiti&mdash;a coloured long-sleeved loose gown
    reaching to the feet. The natives here appear to affect duller
    colours than those we have lately been accustomed to, lilac,
    drab, brown, and other dark prints being the favourite tints.
    Whenever I stopped to look at a view, one of the girls would
    come behind me and throw a <i>lei</i> of flowers over my head,
    fasten it round my neck, and then run away laughing, to a
    distance, to judge of effect. The consequence was that, before
    the end of our walk, I had about a dozen wreaths, of various
    colours and lengths, hanging round me, till I felt almost as if
    I had a fur tippet on, they made me so hot; and yet I did not
    like to take them off for fear of hurting the poor girls'
    feelings.<span class="pagenum">Page 260<a name="Page_260"
       id="Page_260"></a></span></p>

    <p>We walked along the river bank, and crossed to the other
    side just below the rapids, jumping over the narrow channels
    through which the water hurried and rushed. Some of our
    attendant girls carried Muriel and the dogs, and, springing
    barefooted from rock to rock, led us across the stream and up
    the precipitous banks on the other side. There is a sort of
    hotel here, kept by a Chinaman, where everything is
    scrupulously clean, and the food good though plain. It is
    rather more like a lodging-house than an hotel, however. You
    hire your rooms, and are expected to make special arrangements
    for board. Before we got back to the yacht it had become dark,
    the moon had risen, and we could see the reflection in the sky
    of the fires in the crater of Kilauea. I do hope the volcano
    will be active to-morrow. It is never two days in the same
    condition, and visitors have frequently remained in the
    neighbourhood of the crater for a week without seeing an
    eruption.</p>

    <p>The starlit sky, the bright young moon, and the red cloud
    from Kilauea, floating far above our heads, made up a most
    beautiful scene from the deck of the 'Sunbeam.'</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, December 23rd</i>.&mdash;The boatman who
    brought us off last night had told us that Saturday was
    market-day at Hilo, and that at five o'clock the natives would
    come in from the surrounding country in crowds to buy their
    Sunday and Christmas Day provisions, and to bring their own
    produce for sale. We accordingly gave orders that the boat
    should come for us at a quarter to five, shortly before which
    we got up and went on deck. We waited patiently in the dark
    until half-past five, when, no boat appearing from the shore,
    the dingy was manned and we landed. The lights in the town were
    all out, the day had hardly dawned, and there were no signs of
    life to be seen. At last we met two men, who told us we should
    find the market near the river, and offered to show us the way;
    but when we arrived at the spot they had indicated we found
    <span class="pagenum">Page 261<a name="Page_261"
       id="Page_261"></a></span>only a large butcher's shop, and
       were informed that the regular market for fish, fruit, and
       other things was held at five o'clock <i>in the
       afternoon</i> instead of in the morning. We had thus had all
       our trouble for nothing, and the non-appearance of the boat
       was fully explained.</p>

    <p>Presently we met a friend who took us to his home. It was a
    pretty walk, by the side of the river and through numerous
    gardens, fresh with the morning dew. He gave us the latest news
    from the United States, and presented us with oranges and
    flowers, with which we returned to the yacht. We were on board
    again by seven, and, having packed up our things and sent them
    ashore, had an early breakfast, and landed, in readiness for
    our excursion to Kilauea. The baggage animals ought already to
    have started, but we found they had been kept back, in case we
    should happen to forget anything. Quite a crowd assembled to
    see us off, and a good deal of gossip had to be got through, so
    that it was half-past nine before we were all mounted and
    fairly off.</p>

    <p>The first part of our way lay along the flat ground, gay
    with bright scarlet Guernsey lilies, and shaded by cocoa-nut
    trees, between the town and the sea. Then we struck off to the
    right, and soon left the town behind us, emerging into the open
    country. At a distance from the sea, Hilo looks as green as the
    Emerald Isle itself; but on a closer inspection the grass turns
    out to be coarse and dry, and many of the trees look scrubby
    and half dead. Except in the 'gulches' and the deep holes
    between the hills, the island is covered with lava, in many
    places of so recent a deposit that it has not yet had time to
    decompose, and there is consequently only a thin layer of soil
    on its surface. This soil being, however, very rich, vegetation
    flourishes luxuriantly for a time; but as soon as the roots
    have penetrated a certain depth, and have come into contact
    with the lava, the trees wither up and perish, like the seed
    that fell on stony ground. <span class="pagenum">Page
    262<a name="Page_262"
       id="Page_262"></a></span></p>

    <p>The <i>ohia</i> trees form a handsome feature in the
    landscape, with their thick tall stems, glossy foliage, and
    light crimson flowers. The fruit is a small pink waxy-looking
    apple, slightly acid, pleasant to the taste when you are
    thirsty. The candle-nut trees attain to a large size, and their
    light green foliage and white flowers have a very graceful
    appearance. Most of the foliage, however, is spoiled by a
    deposit of black dust, not unlike what one sees on the leaves
    in a London garden. I do not know whether this is caused by the
    fumes of the not far-distant volcano, or whether it is some
    kind of mould or fungus.</p>

    <p>After riding about ten miles in the blazing sun we reached a
    forest, where the vegetation was quite tropical, though not so
    varied in its beauties as that of Brazil, or of the still more
    lovely South Sea Islands. There were ferns of various
    descriptions in the forest, and many fine trees, entwined,
    supported, or suffocated by numerous climbing plants, amongst
    which were blue and lilac convolvulus, and magnificent
    passion-flowers. The protection from the sun afforded by this
    dense mass of foliage was extremely grateful; but the air of
    the forest was close and stifling, and at the end of five miles
    we were glad to emerge once more into the open. The rest of the
    way lay over the hard lava, through a sort of desert of scrubby
    vegetation, occasionally relieved by clumps of trees in
    hollows. More than once we had a fine view of the sea,
    stretching away into the far distance, though it was sometimes
    mistaken for the bright blue sky, until the surf could be seen
    breaking upon the black rocks, amid the encircling groves of
    cocoa-nut trees.</p>

    <p>The sun shone fiercely at intervals, and the rain came down
    several times in torrents. The pace was slow, the road was dull
    and dreary, and many were the inquiries made for the 'Half-way
    House,' long before we reached it. We had still two miles
    farther to go, in the course of which we were drenched by a
    heavy shower. At last <span class="pagenum">Page
    263<a name="Page_263"
       id="Page_263"></a></span>we came to a native house, crowded
       with people, where they were making <i>tappa</i> or
       <i>kapa</i>&mdash;the cloth made from the bark of the
       paper-mulberry. Here we stopped for a few minutes until our
       guide hurried us on, pointing out the church and the
       'Half-way House' just ahead.</p>

    <p>We were indeed glad to dismount after our weary ride, and
    rest in the comfortable rocking-chairs under the verandah. It
    is a small white wooden building, overhung with orange-trees,
    with a pond full of ducks and geese outside it, and a few
    scattered outbuildings, including a cooking hut, close by. A
    good-looking man was busy broiling beef-steaks, stewing
    chickens, and boiling <i>taro</i>, and we had soon a plentiful
    repast set before us, with the very weakest of weak tea as a
    beverage. The woman of the house, which contained some finely
    worked mats and clean-looking beds, showed us some <i>tappa
    cloth</i>, together with the mallets and other instruments used
    in its manufacture, and a beautiful orange-coloured <i>lei</i>,
    or feather necklace, which she had made herself. The cloth and
    mallets were for sale, but no inducement would persuade her to
    part with the necklace. It was the first she had ever made, and
    I was afterwards told that the natives are superstitiously
    careful to preserve the first specimen of their handiwork, of
    whatever kind it may be.</p>

    <p>A woman dressed in a pink <i>holoku</i> and a light green
    apron had followed us hither from the cottages we had first
    stopped at, and I noticed at the time that, though she was
    chatting and laughing with a female companion, she did not seem
    very well. Whilst we were at lunch a sudden increase to her
    family took place, and before we were ready to start I paid her
    and her infant a visit. She was then sitting up, apparently as
    well as ever, and seemed to look upon the recent event as a
    very light matter.</p>

    <p>Directly we had finished our meal&mdash;about three
    o'clock&mdash;the guide came and tried to persuade us that, as
    the baggage-mules had not yet arrived, it would be too late
    <span class="pagenum">Page 264<a name="Page_264"
       id="Page_264"></a></span>for us to go on to-day, and that we
       had better spend the night where we were, and start early in
       the morning. We did not, however, approve of this
       arrangement, so the horses were saddled, and, leaving word
       that the baggage-mules were to follow on as soon as
       possible, we mounted, and set off for the 'Volcano House.'
       We had not gone far before we were again overtaken by a
       shower, which once more drenched us to the skin.</p>

    <p>The scene was certainly one of extreme beauty. The moon was
    hidden by a cloud, and the prospect lighted only by the red
    glare of the volcano, which hovered before and above us like
    the Israelites' pillar of fire, giving us hopes of a splendid
    spectacle when we should at last reach the long-wished-for
    crater. Presently the moon shone forth again, and gleamed and
    glistened on the rain-drops and silver-grasses till they looked
    like fireflies and glowworms. At last, becoming impatient, we
    proceeded slowly on our way, until we met a man on horseback,
    who hailed us in a cheery voice with an unmistakable American
    accent. It was the landlord of the 'Volcano House,' Mr. Kane,
    who, fearing from the delay that we had met with some mishap,
    had started to look for us. He explained that he thought it was
    only his duty to look after and help ladies visiting the
    volcano, and added that he had intended going down as far as
    the 'Half-way House' in search of us. It was a great relief to
    know that we were in the right track, and I quite enjoyed the
    gallop through the dark forest, though there was barely
    sufficient light to enable me to discern the horse immediately
    in front of me. When we emerged from the wood, we found
    ourselves at the very edge of the old crater, the bed of which,
    three or four hundred feet beneath us, was surrounded by steep
    and in many places overhanging sides. It looked like an
    enormous cauldron, four or five miles in width, full of a mass
    of cooled pitch. In the centre was the still glowing stream of
    dark red lava, flowing slowly towards us, and in every
    direction were red-hot <span class="pagenum">Page
    265<a name="Page_265"
       id="Page_265"></a></span>patches, and flames and smoke
       issuing from the ground. A bit of the 'black country' at
       night, with all the coal-heaps on fire, would give you some
       idea of the scene. Yet the first sensation is rather one of
       disappointment, as one expects greater activity on the part
       of the volcano; but the new crater was still to be seen,
       containing the lake of fire, with steep walls rising up in
       the midst of the sea of lava.</p>

    <p>Twenty minutes' hard riding brought us to the door of the
    'Volcano House,' from which issued the comforting light of a
    large wood fire, reaching halfway up the chimney. Native
    garments replaced Mabelle's and my dripping habits, and we sat
    before the fire in luxury until the rest of the party arrived.
    After some delay supper was served, cooked by our host, and
    accompanied by excellent Bass's beer, no wine or spirits being
    procurable on the premises. Mr. Kane made many apologies for
    shortcomings, explaining that his cook had run away that
    morning, and that his wife was not able to do much to assist
    him, as her first baby was only a week old.</p>

    <p>Everything at this inn is most comfortable, though the style
    is rough and ready. The interior is just now decorated for
    Christmas, with wreaths, and evergreens, and ferns, and bunches
    of white plumes, not unlike <i>reva-reva</i>, made from the
    pith of the silver-grass. The beds and bedrooms are clean, but
    limited in number, there being only three of the latter
    altogether. The rooms are separated only by partitions of
    grass, seven feet high, so that there is plenty of ventilation,
    and the heat of the fire permeates the whole building. But you
    must not talk secrets in these dormitories or be too restless.
    I was amused to find, in the morning, that I had unconsciously
    poked my hand through the wall of our room during the
    night.</p>

    <p>The grandeur of the view in the direction of the volcano
    increased as the evening wore on. The fiery cloud above the
    present crater augmented in size and depth of colour; the
    extinct crater glowed red in thirty or forty different
    <span class="pagenum">Page 266<a name="Page_266"
       id="Page_266"></a></span>places; and clouds of white vapour
       issued from every crack and crevice in the ground, adding to
       the sulphurous smell with which the atmosphere was laden.
       Our room faced the volcano: there were no blinds, and I drew
       back the curtains and lay watching the splendid scene until
       I fell asleep.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, December 24th (Christmas Eve)</i>.&mdash;I was up
    at four o'clock, to gaze once more on the wondrous spectacle
    that lay before me. The molten lava still flowed in many
    places, the red cloud over the fiery lake was bright as ever,
    and steam was slowly ascending in every direction, over hill
    and valley, till, as the sun rose, it became difficult to
    distinguish clearly the sulphurous vapours from the morning
    mists. We walked down to the Sulphur Banks, about a quarter of
    a mile from the 'Volcano House,' and burnt our gloves and boots
    in our endeavours to procure crystals, the beauty of which
    generally disappeared after a very short exposure to the air.
    We succeeded, however, in finding a few good specimens, and, by
    wrapping them at once in paper and cotton-wool and putting them
    into a bottle, hope to bring them home uninjured.</p>

    <p>On our return we found a gentleman who had just arrived from
    Kau, and who proposed to join us in our expedition to the
    crater, and at three o'clock in the afternoon we set out, a
    party of eight, with two guides, and three porters to carry our
    wraps and provisions, and to bring back specimens. Before
    leaving the inn the landlord came to us and begged us in an
    earnest and confidential manner to be very careful, to do
    exactly what our guides told us, and especially to follow in
    their footsteps exactly when returning in the dark. He added,
    'There never has been an accident happen to anybody from my
    house, and I should feel real mean if one did: but there have
    been a power of narrow escapes.'</p>

    <p>First of all we descended the precipice, 300 feet in depth,
    forming the wall of the old crater, but now thickly
    <span class="pagenum">Page 267<a name="Page_267"
       id="Page_267"></a></span>covered with vegetation. It is so
       steep in many places that flights of zig-zag wooden steps
       have been inserted in the face of the cliff in some places,
       in order to render the descent practicable. At the bottom we
       stepped straight on to the surface of cold boiled lava,
       which we had seen from above last night. Even here, in every
       crevice where a few grains of soil had collected, delicate
       little ferns might be seen struggling for life, and
       thrusting out their green fronds towards the light. It was
       the most extraordinary walk imaginable over that vast plain
       of lava, twisted and distorted into every conceivable shape
       and form, according to the temperature it had originally
       attained, and the rapidity with which it had cooled, its
       surface, like half-molten glass, cracking and breaking
       beneath our feet. Sometimes we came to a patch that looked
       like the contents of a pot, suddenly petrified in the act of
       boiling; sometimes the black iridescent lava had assumed the
       form of waves, or more frequently of huge masses of rope,
       twisted and coiled together; sometimes it was piled up like
       a collection of organ-pipes, or had gathered into mounds and
       cones of various dimensions. As we proceeded the lava became
       hotter and hotter, and from every crack arose gaseous fumes,
       affecting our noses and throats in a painful manner; till at
       last, when we had to pass to leeward of the molten stream
       flowing from the lake, the vapours almost choked us, and it
       was with difficulty we continued to advance. The lava was
       more glassy and transparent-looking, as if it had been fused
       at a higher temperature than usual; and the crystals of
       sulphur, alum, and other minerals, with which it abounded,
       reflected the light in bright prismatic colours. In places
       it was quite transparent, and we could see beneath it the
       long streaks of a stringy kind of lava, like brown spun
       glass, called 'P&eacute;l&eacute;'s hair.'</p>

    <p>At last we reached the foot of the present crater, and
    commenced the ascent of the outer wall. Many times the thin
    crust gave way beneath our guide, and he had to retire
    <span class="pagenum">Page 268<a name="Page_268"
       id="Page_268"></a></span>quickly from the hot, blinding,
       choking fumes that immediately burst forth. But we succeeded
       in reaching the top; and then what a sight presented itself
       to our astonished eyes! I could neither speak nor move at
       first, but could only stand and gaze at the horrible
       grandeur of the scene.</p>

    <p>We were standing on the extreme edge of a precipice,
    overhanging a lake of molten fire, a hundred feet below us, and
    nearly a mile across. Dashing against the cliffs on the
    opposite side, with a noise like the roar of a stormy ocean,
    waves of blood-red, fiery, liquid lava hurled their billows
    upon an iron-bound headland, and then rushed up the face of the
    cliffs to toss their gory spray high in the air. The restless,
    heaving lake boiled and bubbled, never remaining the same for
    two minutes together. Its normal colour seemed to be a dull
    dark red, covered with a thin grey scum, which every moment and
    in every part swelled and cracked, and emitted fountains,
    cascades, and whirlpools of yellow and red fire, while
    sometimes one big golden river, sometimes four or five, flowed
    across it. There was an island on one side of the lake, which
    the fiery waves seemed to attack unceasingly with relentless
    fury, as if bent on hurling it from its base. On the other side
    was a large cavern, into which the burning mass rushed with a
    loud roar, breaking down in its impetuous headlong career the
    gigantic stalactites that overhung the mouth of the cave, and
    flinging up the liquid material for the formation of fresh
    ones.</p>

    <p>It was all terribly grand, magnificently sublime; but no
    words could adequately describe such a scene. The precipice on
    which we were standing overhung the crater so much that it was
    impossible to see what was going on immediately beneath; but
    from the columns of smoke and vapour that arose, the flames and
    sparks that constantly drove us back from the edge, it was easy
    to imagine that there must have been two or three grand fiery
    fountains below. As the sun set, and darkness enveloped the
    scene, <span class="pagenum">Page 269<a name="Page_269"
       id="Page_269"></a></span>it became more awful than ever. We
       retired a little way from the brink, to breathe some fresh
       air, and to try and eat the food we had brought with us; but
       this was an impossibility. Every instant a fresh explosion
       or glare made us jump up to survey the stupendous scene. The
       violent struggles of the lava to escape from its fiery bed,
       and the loud and awful noises by which they were at times
       accompanied, suggested the idea that some imprisoned
       monsters were trying to release themselves from their
       bondage, with shrieks and groans, and cries of agony and
       despair, at the futility of their efforts.</p>

    <p>Sometimes there were at least seven spots on the borders of
    the lake where the molten lava dashed up furiously against the
    rocks&mdash;seven fire-fountains playing simultaneously. With
    the increasing darkness the colours emitted by the glowing mass
    became more and more wonderful, varying from the deepest jet
    black to the palest grey, from darkest maroon, through cherry
    and scarlet, to the most delicate pink, violet, and blue; from
    the richest brown, through orange and yellow, to the lightest
    straw-colour. And there was yet another shade, only describable
    by the term 'molten-lava colour.' Even the smokes and vapours
    were rendered beautiful by their borrowed lights and tints, and
    the black peaks, pinnacles, and crags, which surrounded the
    amphitheatre, formed a splendid and appropriate background.
    Sometimes great pieces broke off and tumbled with a crash into
    the burning lake, only to be remelted and thrown up anew. I had
    for some time been feeling very hot and uncomfortable, and on
    looking round the cause was at once apparent. Not two inches
    beneath the surface, the grey lava on which we were standing
    and sitting was red-hot. A stick thrust through it caught fire,
    a piece of paper was immediately destroyed, and the gentlemen
    found the heat from the crevices so great that they could not
    approach near enough to light their pipes.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 270<a name="Page_270"
       id="Page_270"></a></span></p>

    <p>One more long last look, and then we turned our faces away
    from the scene that had enthralled us for so many hours. The
    whole of the lava we had crossed, in the extinct crater, was
    now aglow in many patches, and in all directions flames were
    bursting forth, fresh lava was flowing, and steam and smoke
    were issuing from the surface. It was a toilsome journey back
    again, walking as we did in single file, and obeying the strict
    injunctions of our head guide to follow him closely, and to
    tread exactly in his footsteps. On the whole it was easier by
    night than by day to distinguish the route to be taken, as we
    could now see the dangers that before we could only feel; and
    many were the fiery crevices we stepped over or jumped across.
    Once I slipped, and my foot sank through the thin crust. Sparks
    issued from the ground, and the stick on which I leant caught
    fire before I could fairly recover myself.</p>

    <p>Either from the effects of the unaccustomed exercise after
    our long voyage, or from the intense excitement of the novel
    scene, combined with the gaseous exhalations from the lava, my
    strength began to fail, and before reaching the side of the
    crater I felt quite exhausted. I struggled on at short
    intervals, however, collapsing several times and fainting away
    twice; but at last I had fairly to give in, and to allow myself
    to be ignominiously carried up the steep precipice to the
    'Volcano House' on a chair, which the guides went to fetch for
    me.</p>

    <p>It was half-past eleven when we once more found ourselves
    beneath Mr. Kane's hospitable roof; he had expected us to
    return at nine o'clock, and was beginning to feel anxious about
    us.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, December 25th (Christmas Day)</i>.&mdash;Turning
    in last night was the work of a very few minutes, and this
    morning I awoke perfectly refreshed and ready to appreciate
    anew the wonders of the prospect that met my eyes. The pillar
    of fire was still distinctly visible when I looked out from my
    window, though it was not so bright as when
    <span class="pagenum">Page 271<a name="Page_271"
       id="Page_271"></a></span> I had last seen it; but even as I
       looked it began to fade, and gradually disappeared. At the
       same moment a river of glowing lava issued from the side of
       the bank we had climbed with so much difficulty yesterday,
       and slowly but surely overflowed the ground we had walked
       over. I woke Tom, and you may imagine the feelings with
       which we gazed upon this startling phenomenon, which, had it
       occurred a few hours earlier, might have caused the
       destruction of the whole party. If our expedition had been
       made to-day instead of yesterday, we should certainly have
       had to proceed by a different route to the crater, and
       should have looked down on the lake of fire from a different
       spot.</p>

    <p>I cannot hope that in my attempt to give you some idea of
    Kilauea as we beheld it, I shall be successful in conveying
    more than a very faint impression of its glories. I feel that
    my description is so utterly inadequate, that, were it not for
    the space, I should be tempted to send you in full the
    experiences of previous visitors, as narrated in Miss Bird's
    'Six Months in the Sandwich Islands,' and Mr. Bodham Whetham's
    'Pearls of the Pacific.' The account contained in the former
    work I had read before arriving here; the latter I enjoyed at
    the 'Volcano House.' Both are well worth reading by any one who
    feels an interest in the subject.</p>

    <p>It would, I think, be difficult to imagine a more
    interesting and exciting mode of spending Christmas Eve than
    yesterday has taught us, or a stranger situation in which to
    exchange our Christmas greetings than beneath the grass roof of
    an inn on the edge of a volcano in the remote Sandwich Islands.
    They were certainly rendered none the less cordial and sincere
    by the novelty of our position, and I think we are all rather
    glad not to have in prospect the inevitable feastings and
    ceremonies, without which it seems to be impossible to
    commemorate this season in England. If we had seen nothing but
    Kilauea since we <span class="pagenum">Page
    272<a name="Page_272"
       id="Page_272"></a></span>left home, we should have been well
       rewarded for our long voyage.</p>

    <p>At six o'clock we were dressed and packed. Breakfast
    followed at half-past, and at seven we were prepared for a
    start. Our kind, active host, and his wife and baby, all came
    out to see us off. The canter over the dewy grass, in the fresh
    morning air, was most invigorating. It was evident that no one
    had passed along the road since Saturday night, for we picked
    up several waifs and strays dropped in the dark on our way
    up&mdash;a whip, a stirrup, mackintosh hood, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>By half-past ten we had reached the 'Half-way House,' where
    we were not expected so early, and where we had ample
    opportunity to observe the native ways of living, while waiting
    for our midday meal&mdash;an uninteresting mess of stewed fowl
    and <i>taro</i>, washed down with weak tea. After it was over I
    made an unsuccessful attempt to induce the woman of the house
    to part with her orange-coloured <i>lei</i>. I bought some
    <i>tappa</i> and mallets, however, with some of the markers
    used in colouring the cloth, and a few gourds and calabashes,
    forming part of the household furniture. While the horses were
    being saddled preparatory to our departure, Mabelle and I went
    to another cottage close by, to see the mother of the baby that
    had been born while we were here on Saturday. She was not at
    home; but we afterwards found her playing cards with some of
    her friends in a neighbouring hut. Quite a large party of many
    natives were gathered together, not the least cheerful of whom
    was the young mother whose case had interested me so much.</p>

    <p>The rest of the ride down to Hilo was as dull and monotonous
    as our upward journey had been, although, in order to enable us
    to get over it as quickly as possible, fresh horses had been
    sent to meet us. At last we reached the pier, where we found
    the usual little crowd waiting to see us off. The girls who had
    followed us when we first <span class="pagenum">Page
    273<a name="Page_273"
       id="Page_273"></a></span>landed came forward shyly when they
       thought they were unobserved, and again encircled me with
       <i>leis</i> of gay and fragrant flowers. The custom of
       decorating themselves with wreaths on every possible
       occasion is in my eyes a charming one, and I like the
       inhabitants of Polynesia for their love of flowers. They are
       as necessary to them as the air they breathe, and I think
       the missionaries make a mistake in endeavouring to repress
       so innocent and natural a taste.</p>

    <p>The whole town was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> to-day. Natives were
    riding about in pairs, in the cleanest of bright cotton dresses
    and the freshest of <i>leis</i> and garlands. Our own men from
    the yacht contributed not a little to the gaiety of the scene.
    They were all on shore, and the greater part of them were
    galloping about on horseback, tumbling off, scrambling on
    again, laughing, flirting, joking, and enjoying themselves
    generally after a fashion peculiar to English sailors. As far
    as we know the only evil result of all this merriment was that
    the doctor received a good many applications for diachylon
    plaster in the course of the evening, to repair various
    'abrasions of the cuticle,' as he expressed it.</p>

    <p>I think at least half the population of Hilo had been on
    board the yacht in the course of the day, as a Christmas treat.
    At last we took a boat and went off too, accompanied by Mr.
    Lyman. The appearance of the 'Sunbeam' from the shore was very
    gay, and as we approached it became more festive still. All her
    masts were tipped with sugar-canes in bloom. Her stern was
    adorned with flowers, and in the arms of the figure-head was a
    large bouquet. She was surrounded with boats, the occupants of
    which cheered us heartily as we rowed alongside. The gangway
    was decorated with flowers, and surmounted by a triumphal arch,
    on which were inscribed 'Welcome Home,' 'A Merry Christmas,' 'A
    Happy New Year,' and other good wishes. The whole deck was
    festooned with tropical plants and <span class="pagenum">Page
    274<a name="Page_274"
       id="Page_274"></a></span>flowers, and the decorations of the
       cabins were even more beautiful and elaborate. I believe all
       hands had been hard at work ever since we left to produce
       this wonderful effect, and every garden in Hilo had
       furnished a contribution to please and surprise us on our
       return.</p>

    <p>The choir from Hilo came out in boats in the evening, sang
    all sorts of songs, sacred and secular, and cheered everybody
    till they were hoarse. After this, having had a cold dinner, in
    order to save trouble, and having duly drunk the health of our
    friends at home, we all adjourned to the saloon, to assist in
    the distribution of some Christmas presents, a ceremony which
    afforded great delight to the children, and which was equally
    pleasing to the elder people and to the crew, if one may judge
    from their behaviour on the occasion.</p>

    <p>Then we sat on deck, gazing at the cloud of fire over
    Kilauea, and wondering if the appearance of the crater could
    ever be grander than it was last night, when we were standing
    on its brim.</p>

    <p>So ended Christmas Day, 1876, at Hilo, in Hawaii. God grant
    that there may be many more as pleasant for us in store in the
    future!</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, December 26th</i>.&mdash;We went ashore at eight
    o'clock, after an early cup of coffee, and found Mr. Lyman
    already waiting for us. Two baggage-mules were sent off with
    the photographic apparatus, and all the materials for
    breakfast, to the Rainbow Falls, where the children are looking
    forward with intense glee to boiling their own kettle, poaching
    eggs, and trying other cooking experiments.</p>

    <p>Before setting out for the Falls ourselves, we went to see
    the national sport of surf-swimming, for their skill in which
    the Hawaiians are so justly famed.</p>

    <p>The natives have many other games of which they are very
    fond, and which they play with great skill, including
    spear-throwing, transfixing an object with a dart, <i>kona</i>,
    an elaborate kind of draughts, and <i>talu</i>, which consists
    in hiding a small stone under one of five pieces of cloth,
    placed in front of the players. One hides the stone, and the
    others have to guess where it is; and it generally happens
    that, however dexterously the hider may put his arm beneath the
    cloth, and dodge about from one piece to another, a clever
    player will be able to tell, by the movement of the muscles of
    the upper part of his arm, when his fingers relax their hold of
    the stone. Another game, called <i>parua</i>, is very like the
    Canadian sport of 'tobogging,' only <span class="pagenum">Page
    276<a name="Page_276"
       id="Page_276"></a></span>that it is carried on on the grass
       instead of on the snow. The performers stand bolt upright on
       a narrow plank, turned up in front, and steered with a sort
       of long paddle. They go to the top of a hill or mountain,
       and rush down the steep, grassy, sunburnt slopes at a
       tremendous pace, keeping their balance in a wonderful
       manner. There is also a very popular amusement, called
       <i>pah&eacute;</i>, requiring a specially prepared smooth
       floor, along which the javelins of the players glide like
       snakes. On the same floor they also play at another game,
       called <i>maita</i>, or <i>uru maita</i>. Two sticks, only a
       few inches apart, are stuck into the ground, and at a
       distance of thirty or forty yards the players strive to
       throw a stone between them. The <i>uru</i> which they use
       for the purpose is a hard circular stone, three or four
       inches in diameter, and an inch in thickness at the edge,
       but thicker in the middle.</p>

    <p>Mr. Ellis, in his 'Polynesian Researches,' states that
    'these stones are finely polished, highly valued, and carefully
    preserved, being always oiled or wrapped up in native cloth
    after having been used. The people are, if possible, more fond
    of this game than of the <i>pah&eacute;</i>, and the
    inhabitants of a district not unfrequently challenge the people
    of the whole island, or the natives of one island those of all
    the others, to bring a man who shall try his skill with some
    favourite player of their own district or island. On such
    occasions seven or eight thousand people, men and women, with
    their chiefs and chiefesses, assemble to witness the sport,
    which, as well as the <i>pah&eacute;</i>, is often continued
    for hours together.'</p>

    <p>With bows and arrows they are as clever as all savages, and
    wonderfully good shots, attempting many wonderful feats. They
    are swift as deer, when they choose, though somewhat lazy and
    indolent. All the kings and chiefs have been special adepts in
    the invigorating pastime of surf-swimming, and the present
    king's sisters are considered first-rate hands at it. The
    performers begin by swimming out <span class="pagenum">Page
    277<a name="Page_277"
       id="Page_277"></a></span> into the bay, and diving under the
       huge Pacific rollers, pushing their surf-boards&mdash;flat
       pieces of wood, about four feet long by two wide, pointed at
       each end&mdash;edgewise before them. For the return journey
       they select a large wave; and then, either sitting,
       kneeling, or standing on their boards, rush in shorewards
       with the speed of a racehorse, on the curling crest of the
       monster, enveloped in foarn and spray, and holding on, as it
       were, by the milk-white manes of their furious coursers. It
       looked a most enjoyable amusement, and I should think that,
       to a powerful swimmer, with plenty of pluck, the feat is not
       difficult of accomplishment. The natives here are almost
       amphibious. They played all sorts of tricks in the water,
       some of the performers being quite tiny boys. Four strong
       rowers took a whale-boat out into the worst surf, and then,
       steering her by means of a large oar, brought her safely
       back to the shore on the top of a huge wave.</p>

    <p>After the conclusion of this novel entertainment, we all
    proceeded on horseback to the Falls, Baby going in front of
    Tom, and Muriel riding with Mr. Freer. After a couple of miles
    we dismounted, and had a short walk through grass and ferns to
    a pretty double waterfall, tumbling over a cliff, about 100
    feet high, into a glassy pool of the river beneath. It fell in
    front of a fern-filled black lava cavern, over which a rainbow
    generally hangs. As it was too wet to sit on the grass after
    the rain, we took possession of the verandah of a native house,
    commanding a fine view of the bay and town of Hilo. The hot
    coffee and eggs were a great success eventually, though the
    smoke from the wood fire nearly suffocated us in the process of
    cooking. Excellent also was some grey mullet, brought to us
    alive, and cooked native fashion,&mdash;wrapped up in <i>ti</i>
    leaves, and put into a hole in the ground.</p>

    <p>After taking a few photographs it was time to return; and we
    next went to a pretty garden, which we had seen
    <span class="pagenum">Page 278<a name="Page_278"
       id="Page_278"></a></span>on the night of our arrival, and,
       tying up our horses outside, walked across it to the banks
       of the river. Here we found a large party assembled,
       watching half the population of Hilo disporting themselves
       in, upon, and beneath the water. They climbed the almost
       perpendicular rocks on the opposite side of the stream, took
       headers, and footers, and siders from any height under
       five-and-twenty feet, dived, swam in every conceivable
       attitude, and without any apparent exertion, deep under the
       water, or upon its surface. But all this was only a
       preparation for the special sight we had come to see. Two
       natives were to jump from a precipice, 100 feet high, into
       the river below, clearing on their way a rock which
       projected some twenty feet from the face of the cliff, at
       about the same distance from the summit. The two men, tall,
       strong, and sinewy, suddenly appeared against the sky-line,
       far above our heads, their long hair bound back by a wreath
       of leaves and flowers, while another garland encircled their
       waists. Having measured their distance with an eagle's
       glance, they disappeared from our sight, in order to take a
       run and acquire the necessary impetus. Every breath was held
       for a moment, till one of the men reappeared, took a bound
       from the edge of the rock, turned over in mid-air, and
       disappeared feet foremost into the pool beneath, to emerge
       almost immediately, and to climb the sunny bank as quietly
       as if he had done nothing very wonderful. His companion
       followed, and then the two clambered up to the twenty-feet
       projection, to clear which they had had to take such a run
       the first time, and once more plunged into the pool below.
       The feat was of course an easier one than the first; but
       still a leap of eighty feet is no light matter. A third
       native, who joined them in this exploit, gave one quite a
       turn as he twisted in his downward jump; but he also
       alighted in the water feet foremost, and bobbed up again
       directly, like a cork. He was quite a young man, and we
       afterwards heard that he had broken several ribs
       <span class="pagenum">Page 279<a name="Page_279"
       id="Page_279"></a></span> not more than a year ago, and had
       been laid up for six months in the hospital.</p>

    <p>We now moved our position a little higher up the river, to
    the Falls, over which the men, gliding down the shallow rapids
    above, in a sitting posture, allowed themselves to be carried.
    It looked a pleasant and easy feat, and was afterwards
    performed by many of the natives in all sorts of ways. Two or
    three of them would hold each other's shoulders, forming a
    child's train, or some would get on the backs of their
    companions, while others descended singly in a variety of
    attitudes. At last a young girl was also persuaded to attempt
    the feat. She looked very pretty as she started, in her white
    chemise and bright garland, and prettier still when she emerged
    from the white foam beneath the fall, and swam along far below
    the surface of the clear water, with her long black hair
    streaming out behind her.</p>

    <p>No description can give you any idea what an animated and
    extraordinary scene it was altogether. While our accounts were
    being settled, preparatory to our departure, I occupied myself
    in looking at some <i>kahilis</i> and feather <i>leis.</i> The
    yellow ones, either of Oo or Mamo feathers, only found in this
    island, are always scarce, as the use of them is a prerogative
    of royalty and nobility. Just now it is almost impossible to
    obtain one, all the feathers being '<i>tabu</i>,' to make a
    royal cloak for Ruth, half-sister of Kamehameha V., and
    governess of Hawaii. Mamo feathers are generally worth a dollar
    a piece, and a good <i>lei</i> or loose necklace costs about
    five hundred dollars. <i>Kahilis</i> are also an emblem of
    rank, <span class="pagenum">Page 280<a name="Page_280"
       id="Page_280"></a></span>though many people use them as
       ornaments in their houses. They are rather like
       feather-brooms, two or three feet long, and three or four
       inches across, made of all sorts of feathers, tastefully
       interwoven. I bought one, and a couple of ordinary
       <i>leis</i>, which were all I could procure. But, alas! too
       soon all was over, and time for us to go on board.</p>

    <p>On our way off to the yacht we met one of the large double
    canoes coming in under sail from a neighbouring island. It
    consisted of two canoes lashed together, with a sort of basket
    dropped into the water between them, to enable them to carry
    their fish alive. They are not very common now, and we were
    therefore fortunate in meeting with one. Mr. Lyman made the men
    in charge turn her round, so as to afford us an opportunity of
    thoroughly examining her. In the time of Kamehameha there was a
    fleet of 10,000 of these canoes, and the king used to send them
    out in the roughest weather, and make them perform all sorts of
    manoeuvres.</p>

    <p>We found the yacht in the usual state of confusion
    incidental to a fresh departure, but everything was soon
    reduced to order, and off we started to steam and sail round
    the north end of the island, but we could not afford time to
    visit the place of Captain Cook's death and burial in
    Keelakeakua Bay. I believe there is not a great deal to see,
    however, and the spot is chiefly interesting from its
    associations. For many years a copper plate, fixed to a
    cocoa-nut tree, marked the spot where Cook fell, but this has
    now been replaced by a monument, the cost of which was defrayed
    by subscriptions at Honolulu. Maui is, I believe, a charming
    place, containing many fine plantations, and several
    gentlemen's estates, laid out in the English style.
    Unfortunately, time forbids our accepting some invitations we
    have received to visit the island, where a great many
    interesting excursions may be made.</p>

    <p>At Kahoolaue there does not seem much to be seen. It was
    purchased some years ago, and pays well as a sheep-run.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 281<a name="Page_281"
       id="Page_281"></a></span>Lauai, the next island, is scarcely
       inhabited, and its scenery is not remarkable.</p>

    <p>A sad interest attaches to the island of Molokai, which is
    situated midway between Maui and Oahu. It is the leper
    settlement, and to it all the victims of this terrible,
    loathsome, and incurable disease, unhappily so prevalent in the
    Hawaiian archipelago, are sent, in order to prevent the spread
    of the contagion. They are well cared for and looked after in
    every way; but their life, separated as they inevitably are
    from all they hold most dear, and with no prospect before them
    but that of a slow and cruel death, must indeed be a miserable
    one. In Molokai there are many tiny children, fatherless and
    motherless, parents without children, husbands without wives,
    wives without husbands, 'all condemned.' as Miss Bird says, 'to
    watch the repulsive steps by which each of their doomed fellows
    goes down to a loathsome death, knowing that by the same they
    too must pass.' A French priest has nobly devoted himself to
    the religious and secular instruction of the lepers, and up to
    the present time has enjoyed complete immunity from the
    disease; but even if he escapes this danger, he can
    <i>never</i> return to his country and friends. When one thinks
    what that implies, and to what a death in life he has condemned
    himself for the sake of others, it seems impossible to doubt
    that he will indeed reap a rich reward hereafter.</p>

    <p>At two o'clock we saw Diamond Head, the easternmost headland
    of Oahu, rising from the sea. By four o'clock we were abreast
    of it, and steaming along the coast. The cape itself rises
    grandly from the midst of a grove of cocoa-nuts, and the shore
    all along, with the sharp high mountains of the Pali as a
    background, is fine and picturesque. A coral reef stretches far
    into the sea, and outside this we lay waiting for a pilot to
    take us into Honolulu Harbour.</p>

    <p>It was a long business mooring us by hawsers, from our stem
    and stern, but we were at last safely secured in a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 282<a name="Page_282"
       id="Page_282"></a></span>convenient place, a short distance
       from the shore, and where we should be refreshed by the sea
       breeze and the land breeze alternately. It was six o'clock,
       and nearly dark, when we reached the shore; the town seemed
       entirely deserted; all the little wooden houses were shut
       up, and there were no lights visible. The post-office was
       closed, but it was a terrible blow to hear there were no
       letters for us, though we still hoped that there might be
       some at the British Consulate.</p>

    <p>After a short time we returned on board the yacht in time
    for a late dinner. The first lieutenant of H.M.S.
    'Fant&ocirc;me' came on board to pay us a visit during the
    evening, and told us all the latest English and American news,
    lending us some files of English papers&mdash;a great treat,
    but no compensation for our disappointment about the
    letters.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, December 28th</i>.&mdash;Tom and I went ashore
    at seven o'clock to make arrangements for repairing our
    mizen-sail. We soon found a sailmaker, who promised to set all
    hands to work and complete the job as quickly as possible.
    Being detained by a heavy shower of rain, we occupied the time
    in a gossip about Honolulu and its sayings and doings. When the
    shower was over, we walked through the town, which is clean and
    tidy, being laid out in squares, after the American style. The
    houses are all of wood, and generally have verandahs
    overhanging the street. They are seldom more than one story
    high, and nearly all have a little greenery about them.</p>

    <p>We returned to the yacht for breakfast, and, having heard
    that no sharks ever came into the long, narrow bay, were able
    to enjoy, in perfect peace of mind, the luxury of a bath
    overboard. It is a great pity that in the tropics, where
    bathing is such a delightful occupation, and where one might
    swim and paddle about for hours without fear of getting cold,
    it is often impossible even to enter the water for fear of the
    sharks. The natives are such expert <span class="pagenum">Page
    283<a name="Page_283"
       id="Page_283"></a></span> swimmers that they do not seem to
       think much of this danger. As the shark turns on his back to
       take a bite at them, they dive underneath him, and he snaps
       his jaws on emptiness. In fact, sometimes the swimmer will
       take advantage of the opportunity to stab his enemy as he
       passes beneath him.</p>

    <p>Scarcely was breakfast over when we were inundated with
    visitors, who kindly came to see what they could do for us to
    make our stay agreeable. We lunched on shore, and afterwards
    went to the new Government buildings and museum. From thence we
    strolled to the various shops where 'curios' and photographs
    are to be bought, and collected a goodly store, returning on
    board the yacht to find more visitors.</p>

    <p>We lunched on shore, and afterwards went with Mr.
    Chambr&eacute;, navigating-lieutenant of the 'Fant&ocirc;me,'
    to the new Government buildings. There we found an excellent
    English library, and an interesting collection of books printed
    in English and Hawaiian, on alternate pages, including
    alphabets, grammars, the old familiar nursery tales, &amp;c.
    There is also a good, though small museum, containing specimens
    of beautiful corals, shells, seaweeds, and fossils; all the
    ancient native weapons, such as bows, arrows, swords, and
    spears&mdash;now, alas! no longer
    procurable&mdash;sling-stones, and stones used in games,
    back-scratchers, hair-ornaments made of sharks' teeth,
    tortoise-shell cups and spoons, calabashes and bowls. There
    were some most interesting though somewhat horrible necklaces
    made of hundreds of braids of <span class="pagenum">Page
    284<a name="Page_284"
       id="Page_284"></a></span>human hair cut from the heads of
       victims slain by the chiefs themselves; from these braids
       was suspended a monstrous hook carved from a large whale's
       tooth, called a Paloola, regarded by the natives as a sort
       of idol. There are models of ancient and modern
       canoes&mdash;the difference between which is not very
       great,&mdash;paddles, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, old
       war-masks, and dresses still in use in the less frequented
       islands, anklets of human teeth, and many other things far
       too numerous to mention. The most interesting of all were,
       perhaps, the old feather war cloaks, like the ancient
       <i>togas</i> of the Romans. They are made of thousands of
       yellow, red, and black feathers, of the <i>oo, niamo,</i>
       and <i>eine</i>, taken singly and fastened into a sort of
       network of string, so as to form a solid fabric, like the
       richest velvet or plush, that glitters like gold in the
       sunlight. The helmets, made of the same feathers, but worked
       on to a frame of perfect Grecian shape, similar to those
       seen in the oldest statuary or on the Elgin marbles, are
       even more artistic and elegant. Whence came the idea and
       design? Untutored savages could scarcely have evolved them
       out of their own heads. Some element of civilisation, and of
       highly artistic civilisation too, must
       <span class="pagenum">Page 285<a name="Page_285"
       id="Page_285"></a></span>surely have existed among them at
       some remote period of their history.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, December 29th</i>.&mdash;We had a bathe overboard
    early this morning. The children were ashore at half-past nine,
    to go and spend the day at a friend's, at the top of the Nuuanu
    Avenue, on the road to the Pali.</p>

    <p>The King's two sisters came to call on us in the morning
    with their respective husbands. We had a great many visitors
    all the morning, till it was time to go to lunch; after which
    we went to call on the Princess Likelike, who drove me to
    Waikiki, to see her sister, the Princess Kamakaeha, at her
    country residence, a very large native grass house, with an
    enormous verandah. Both ladies are married to Englishmen, and
    live partly in English style. Inside there is a spacious
    drawing-room, well furnished, with pictures and nick-nacks,
    where we spent a pleasant half-hour in the gloaming. The
    sunset, over Diamond Head, and the sea, which was just visible
    through the cocoa-nut trees, was splendid. Both the Princesses
    were as kind as they could be. The royal family have formed
    quite a little colony here. The King's house is next door, and
    that of the Prince Leleiohoku is not far off. They all come
    here in the most unpretending way possible, and amuse
    themselves by fishing and bathing.</p>

    <p>It had been quite dark for some time, when the Princess
    Likelike dropped me at the hotel at half-past seven, where I
    found Tom and Mr. Freer waiting for me. We had a quiet dinner,
    and then went for a stroll. It was a fine clear night, with an
    almost full moon. The streets were full of equestrians, riding
    about in pairs, for there was to be a great riding party up to
    the Pali to-night, the <i>rendezvous</i> for which was in Emma
    Square. Every lady had to select and bring with her an
    attendant cavalier<a name="FNanchor_14_14"
       id="FNanchor_14_14">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_14_14"
       class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_14_14"
           id="Footnote_14_14"></a>
           <a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
           The event was thus announced in the 'Hawaiian
           Gazette:'&mdash;'THE LAST CHANCE.&mdash;We are informed
           that a riding party will come off on Friday evening,
           when all the young ladies who desire to participate are
           expected to be on hand, each with the cavalier whom she
           may invite. As leap-year is drawing to a close it is
           expected that this opportunity will be extensively
           embraced. Place of rendezvous, Emma Square: time,
           seven-thirty; Luminary for the occasion, a full
           moon.'</p>
    </div>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 286<a name="Page_286"
       id="Page_286"></a></span>There are no side-saddles in any of
       these islands; all the ladies ride like men, and sit their
       horses very well. They wear long riding-dresses, cleverly
       and elegantly adapted to the exigencies of the situation,
       generally of some light material, and of <i>very</i> bright
       colours. The effect of a large party galloping along, with
       wreaths and garlands in their hats and necks, and with their
       long skirts floating in the wind, is therefore picturesque
       and strange in the extreme.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, December 30th</i>.&mdash;Mabelle, Muriel, and
    I, were up early, and went off to the coral-reef before seven
    in the 'Flash.' It is very beautiful, but not so fine as those
    we have already seen at Tahiti and other South Sea Islands. We
    collected four or the distinct varieties of coral, and saw many
    marvellous creatures swimming about or sticking to the rocks.
    There were several canoes full of natives fishing, who appeared
    highly amused when we ran aground on a coral tree, as happened
    more than once. It was a pleasant way of spending the early
    morning in the bright sunshine, peering into the dark blue and
    light green depths below.</p>

    <p>Breakfast was ready by the time we returned on board, and
    soon afterwards I went on shore to pay some visits and to do
    some shopping. We went first to the fish-market, which
    presented a most animated scene, owing not only to the
    abundance of the dead produce of air, earth, and sea, which it
    contained, but to the large number of gaily attired
    purchasers.</p>

    <p>Saturday is a half-holiday in Oahu, and all the plantation
    and mill hands came galloping into Honolulu on horseback,
    chattering and laughing, dressed in the brightest colours, and
    covered with flowers. The latter are not so
    <span class="pagenum">Page 287<a name="Page_287"
       id="Page_287"></a></span>plentiful nor so beautiful as in
       Tahiti, but still, to our English eyes, they appear very
       choice. For fruit, too, we have been spoilt in the South
       Seas. The fish-market here, however, is unrivalled.</p>

    <p>Fish&mdash;raw or cooked&mdash;is the staple food of the
    inhabitants, and almost everybody we saw had half-a-dozen or
    more brilliant members of the finny tribe, wrapped up in fresh
    green banana leaves, ready to carry home. Shrimps are abundant
    and good. They are caught both in salt and fresh water, and the
    natives generally eat them alive, putting them into their
    mouths, ana either letting them hop down their throats, or
    crushing them between their teeth while they are still
    wriggling about. It looks a very nasty thing to do, but, after
    all, it is not much worse than our eating oysters alive.</p>

    <p>From the fish-market we went to the prison, a large and
    apparently admirably managed establishment, built of stone, and
    overlooking the harbour. After a pleasant drive along shady
    fragrant roads, we returned to Emma Square, to hear the
    excellent performance of the Saturday afternoon
    <span class="pagenum">Page 288<a name="Page_288"
       id="Page_288"></a></span>band. There was a good assemblage
       of people, on horseback, in carriages, and on foot, and
       crowds of children, all more or less white, languid, and
       sickly-looking. Poor mites! I suppose the climate is too hot
       for European constitutions. Still, they abound among the
       foreigners, while the natives are gradually, but surely,
       dying out. Among the whole royal family there is only one
       child, a dear little girl of rather more than a year old.
       Princess Kauilani ('Sent from Heaven') she is always called,
       though she has a very long string of additional names. She
       is heiress-presumptive to the throne, and is thought a good
       deal of by everybody. Among twenty of the highest chiefs'
       families there is only one baby. On the other hand, all the
       foreign consuls, ministers, missionaries, and other white
       residents, appear to have an average of at least half a
       dozen in each family.</p>

    <p>After the performance was over, we walked to the Princess
    Likelike's house, where we were entertained at a <i>poi</i>
    supper. The garden was illuminated, the band played and a choir
    sang alternately, while everybody sat out in the verandah, or
    strolled about the garden, or did what they liked best. Prince
    Leleiohoku took me in to supper, which was served in the native
    fashion, in calabashes and on leaves, laid on mats on the
    floor, in the same manner as the feast at Tahiti. The walls of
    the dining-room were made of palm-leaves and bananas, and the
    roof was composed of the standards of the various members of
    the royal family, gracefully draped. At one end of the long
    table, where the Prince and I sat, there was his special royal
    standard, as heir-apparent, and just behind us were stationed a
    couple of women, with two large and handsome <i>kahilis</i>,
    which they waved incessantly backwards and forwards. The viands
    were much the same as at Tahiti&mdash;raw seaweed, which was
    eaten with each mouthful, being substituted for the chopped
    cocoa-nut and salt-water. The carved <i>koa</i> bowls, which
    were in constant requisition as finger-glasses,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 289<a name="Page_289"
       id="Page_289"></a></span> were specially elegant and
       useful-looking articles. <i>Poi</i> is generally eaten from
       a bowl placed between two people, by dipping three fingers
       into it, giving them a twirl round, and then sucking them.
       It sounds rather nasty; but, as a matter of fact, it is so
       glutinous a mixture that you really only touch the particles
       that stick to your fingers. The latter you wash after each
       mouthful, so that there is nothing so very dreadful about it
       after all. There was a quantity of raw fish, which I did not
       touch, but which some of our party thought most excellent,
       besides dried and cooked fish, which seemed very good, fried
       candle-nuts, baked pig, and many other delicacies. We could
       get however, nothing to drink. After supper, we returned to
       the house, where we found an abundance of champagne and
       other wines, cakes, and biscuits.</p>

    <p>About twelve o'clock we thought it was time to say good-bye,
    as it was Saturday night. Beneath a brilliant full moon the
    drive to the wharf and row off in the boat were delightful.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, December 31st</i>.&mdash;I was on deck at six
    o'clock, and saw what I had often heard about&mdash;a team of
    twenty oxen, driven by a man in a cart, drawing by means of a
    rope, about a quarter of a mile in length, a large ship through
    the opening in the reef, the man and cattle being upon the
    coral<a name="FNanchor_15_15"
       id="FNanchor_15_15">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_15_15"
       class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_15_15"
           id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">
        [15]</span></a> The following notice appeared in the
        <i>Hawaiian Gazette</i> recently: 'TO BE
        REPAIRED.&mdash;That staunch little craft the "Pele," which
        Capt. Brown has for so long a time successfully commanded,
        is now being hauled up for the purpose of repairs. She will
        probably be laid up for six or eight weeks, and in the
        meantime the antique plan of towing vessels in and out of
        the harbour with teams of oxen on the reef will be
        resumed.'</p>
    </div>

    <p>About half-past eight Mabelle and I were just going
    overboard for a swim, when I thought I saw the upper fin of an
    old familiar enemy, and directly afterwards the cry was echoed
    all over the ship, 'A shark, a shark!' It was a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 290<a name="Page_290"
       id="Page_290"></a></span>ground shark, and very nearly
       aground in the shallow water. They say this is the worst
       kind of all, and on making inquiry I was told that the
       safest way to enjoy a dip here is to bathe with a number of
       other people. The splashing and noise made by a whole ship's
       company frighten the sharks away. This discovery puts an end
       therefore to our hopes of enjoying an occasional peaceful
       bath.</p>

    <p>We went to eleven o'clock service at the cathedral. It is a
    pleasant small building, beautifully cool, and well adapted to
    this climate. The Bishop was unfortunately away, but the
    service was well performed.</p>

    <p>Later, Tom read the evening service to the men, and we
    afterwards landed and dined late at the hotel; so late, indeed,
    that we could hardly get anything to eat, and they began to
    shut up the room and put out the lights before we had half
    done. Luckily, we were a large party, and an indignant protest
    and threatened appeal to the landlord brought the Chinese
    waiters to their senses, and induced them to grant us half an
    hour's law. On our way back to the boat, the streets looked
    much more lively than they had hitherto done, being full of
    people returning from rides, drives, and excursions into the
    country. As a rule, directly after dark not a creature is to be
    seen about the streets, for every one disappears in the most
    mysterious manner.</p>

    <p>We went on board, and sat in the calm moonlight, thinking
    and talking over the events of the year, whose end was so
    swiftly approaching, and wondering what its successor may have
    in store for us. So ends, with all its joys and sorrows, its
    pleasures and pains, its hopes and fears, for us, the now old
    year, 1876.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, January 1st, 1877</i>.&mdash;At midnight we were
    awakened by our ship's bell, and that of the 'Fant&ocirc;me,'
    being struck violently sixteen times. For the moment I could
    not imagine what it meant, and thought it must be an alarm of
    fire; indeed, it was not until Tom and I reached the deck,
    where we found nearly all the ship's company assembled at the
    top of the companion, and were greeted with wishes for 'A happy
    New Year, and many of them,' that we quite realised that
    nothing serious was the matter. Soon the strains of sweet
    music, proceeding from the Honolulu choirs, which had come out
    in boats to serenade us, fell upon our ears The choristers
    remained alongside for more than an hour, singing English and
    American sacred and secular hymns and songs, and then went off
    to the 'Fant&ocirc;me,' where they repeated the performance.
    The moon shone brightly; not a ripple disturbed the surface of
    the water; the cocoa-trees at Waikiki, and the distant
    mountains near the Pali, were all clearly defined against the
    dark blue sky. It was altogether a romantic and delicious
    scene, and we found it difficult to tear ourselves away from
    the sweet sounds which came floating over the sea.</p>

    <p>When I again went on deck, at half-past six, there was a
    large double canoe close to the yacht, crowded with people. It
    was difficult to make out what they were doing, for
    <span class="pagenum">Page 292<a name="Page_292"
       id="Page_292"></a></span>they appeared to be sitting on a
       great heap of something, piled up between the two canoes.
       Our sailors suggested that it must be 'some sort of a New
       Year's set out.' I ordered the 'Flash' to be got ready, and
       went with the children to make a closer investigation; and,
       as we approached, we could see that the pile that had
       puzzled us was a huge fishing-net. The tide here is very
       uncertain; but as soon as the water is low enough, they
       stretch the long net right across the narrow mouth of the
       harbour, and so secure an enormous quantity of fish of
       various kinds. It was a really good New Year's haul, and
       provided a hearty meal for a great many people.</p>

    <p>Mabelle and I went at twelve o'clock to the Queen's New
    Year's reception, held in the other wing of the palace. Having
    driven through the pretty gardens, we were received at the
    entrance by the Governor, and ushered through two reception
    rooms into the royal presence. The Queen was dressed in a
    European court-dress, of blue and white material, with the
    Hawaiian Order of the Garter across her breast. Two maids of
    honour were also in court-dress. Of the other ladies, some were
    in evening, some in morning dress, some with bonnets and some
    without; but their costumes were all made according to the
    European fashion, except that of her Highness Ruth, the
    Governess of Hawaii, who looked wonderfully well in a rich
    white silk native dress, trimmed with white satin. She had a
    necklace of orange-coloured <i>oo</i> feathers round her neck,
    and dark yellow alamanda flowers in her hair. This native
    costume is a most becoming style of dress, especially to the
    chiefs and chiefesses, who are all remarkably tall and
    handsome, with a stately carriage and dignified manner. The
    Queen stood in front of the throne, on which were spread the
    royal robes, a long mantle of golden feathers, without speck or
    blemish. On each side stood two men, dressed in black, wearing
    frock-coats, and capes of red, black, and yellow feathers over
    their shoulders, and chimney-pot hats on their
    <span class="pagenum">Page 293<a name="Page_293"
       id="Page_293"></a></span>heads. In their hands they held two
       enormous <i>kahilis</i> of black <i>oo</i> feathers, with
       handsome tortoise-shell and ivory handles. They were at
       least eight feet high altogether, and the feathers were
       about six inches across.</p>

    <p>The Princess presented Mabelle and me to her Majesty, and we
    had a short conversation through a lady interpreter. It is
    always an embarrassing thing to carry on a conversation in this
    way, especially when you find yourself in the midst of a square
    formed by a large crowd of ladies, who you fancy are all gazing
    at you, the one stranger present, and I was glad when fresh
    people arrived, and her Majesty's attention was claimed
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Queen Kapiolani is a nice-looking woman, with a very
    pleasing expression of countenance. She is the granddaughter of
    the heroic Princess Kapiolani, who, when the worship and fear
    of the goddess P&eacute;l&eacute; were at their height, walked
    boldly up to the crater of Kilauea, in defiance of the warnings
    and threats of the high-priestess of the idolatrous rites,
    proclaiming her confidence in the power of her God, the God of
    the Christians, to preserve her. This act did much to assist in
    the establishment of Christianity in the Island of Hawaii, and
    to shake the belief of the native worshippers of
    P&eacute;l&eacute; in the power of the fearful goddess.</p>

    <p>The Princess showed me round the room which contains the
    portraits of the kings and queens of the Sandwich Islands for
    many generations, the early ones attired in their feather
    capes, the later ones dressed in European costumes. Most of
    them were the work of native artists, but the portraits of
    Kamehameha II. and his queen were painted, during their visit
    to England, by a good artist. Their Majesties are depicted in
    the height of the fashion of the day, the king wearing a blue
    coat and brass buttons, with many orders on his breast, the
    queen having on a very short-waisted, tight-fitting white satin
    dress, a turban surmounted by a tremendous plume of white
    feathers, and a pearl necklace and bracelets: rather a trying
    costume for <span class="pagenum">Page 294<a name="Page_294"
       id="Page_294"></a></span>a handsome woman with a dark
       complexion and portly figure. They both died in England, and
       their remains were brought back here for burial, in H.M.S.
       'Blonde,' commanded by Lord Byron. There was also a portrait
       of Admiral Thomas, whose memory is highly reverenced here
       for the happy way in which he succeeded in terminating the
       disputes arising out of our claim to the island in 1843, and
       in restoring King Kamehameha III. to his own again.</p>

    <p>The collection likewise included excellent portraits of
    Louis Philippe and Napoleon III. Curiously enough, each of
    these was sent off from France to the Sandwich Islands, by way
    of Cape Horn, while the original was in the zenith of his power
    and fame; and each reached its destination after the original
    had been deposed and had fled to England for refuge.</p>

    <p>But the most interesting object of all was still to
    come&mdash;the real feather cloak, cape, and girdle of the
    Kamehamehas, <span class="pagenum">Page 295<a name="Page_295"
       id="Page_295"></a></span>not generally to be seen, except at
       a coronation or christening, but which the Princess
       Kamakaeha, in her capacity of Mistress of the Robes, had
       kindly ordered to be put out for my inspection. The cloak,
       which is now the only one of the kind in existence, is about
       eleven feet long by five broad, and is composed of the
       purest yellow, or rather golden, feathers, which, in the
       sunlight, are perfectly gorgeous, as they have a peculiar
       kind of metallic lustre, quite independent of their
       brilliant colour.</p>

    <p>On leaving the palace I had intended to get some lunch at
    the hotel, but found that establishment was closed to the
    general public, and was in the possession of a native teetotal
    society; so I was obliged to return to the yacht. At half-past
    three, however, we all went ashore again, and set out on
    horseback, a large party, for an excursion to the Pali, the
    children, servants, and provisions preceding us in a light
    two-horse American wagon. We rode through the Nuuanu Avenue,
    and then up the hills, along a moderately good road, for about
    seven miles and a half. This, <span class="pagenum">Page
    296<a name="Page_296"
       id="Page_296"></a></span>brought us into a narrow gorge in
       the midst of the mountains, from which we emerged on the
       other side of the central range of hills, forming the
       backbone of the island. The view from this point was
       beautiful, though I think that the morning would be a better
       time to enjoy it, as, with a setting sun, the landscape was
       all in shadow. The change of temperature, too, after the
       heat of Honolulu, was quite astonishing, considering the
       short distance we had come&mdash;about eight miles only. The
       carriage could not go quite to the top of the mountain, and
       after descending a short distance to where it had been left,
       we dismounted and spread our dinner on the ground; but
       darkness overtook us before we had finished. Matches and
       lamps had of course been forgotten; so that the business of
       packing up was performed under circumstances of great
       difficulty. The ride down, in the light of the almost full
       moon, was delightful.</p>

    <p>We were on board by half-past seven, and went ashore to a
    ball at nine o'clock. The dance took place in the large room of
    the Hawaiian Hotel, and was a great success. The Royal band
    played for us, and there was neither stuffiness nor crowding,
    nor were there any regulations as to dress, gentlemen and
    ladies coming in evening or morning dress, as it suited them
    best. The Governor and most of the English present, including
    our own party, wore evening dress, and the officers of the
    'Fant&ocirc;me' were in uniform. Every door and window was
    open, there was a large verandah to sit in, a garden to stroll
    about in between the dances, and an abundance of delicious iced
    lemonade&mdash;very different from the composition thus named
    which is generally met with in London assemblies&mdash;to
    drink. At half-past twelve, when people were beginning to
    disperse, we took our departure, Captain Long taking us off to
    the yacht in his boat.</p>

    <p>There is to be another ball on Thursday night, for which
    everybody is most anxious that we should stay, as it
    <span class="pagenum">Page 297<a name="Page_297"
       id="Page_297"></a></span>is to be rather a large affair. In

    <p><i>Tuesday, January 2nd</i>.&mdash;At eleven o'clock, the
    King, who was rather better, went on board the 'Fant&ocirc;me,'
    saw the men at quarters, and witnessed the firing of a couple
    of shots at a target, and shortly before twelve paid us a
    visit, accompanied by the Prince Leleiohoku and others. His
    Majesty is a tall, fine-looking man, with pleasant manners, and
    speaks English perfectly and fluently. He and the Prince
    visited and examined every corner of the yacht, and looked, I
    think, at almost every object on board. The pictures,
    curiosities, engines, and our various little contrivances for
    economising space, seemed to interest them the most. The
    inspection occupied at least an hour and a half; and when it
    was over, we had a long chat on deck on various subjects. The
    Prince of Wales's visit to India, and the Duke of Edinburgh's
    voyage round the world, were much discussed, I think the King
    would like to use them as a precedent, and see a little more of
    the world himself. His voyage to, and stay in America, he
    thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

    <p>It was two o'clock before our visitors left; and a quarter
    of an hour <span class="pagenum">Page 298<a name="Page_298"
       id="Page_298"></a></span> later the Queen and her sister
       arrived. Her Majesty and her sister made quite as minute an
       inspection of the yacht as her royal consort and his brother
       had done before them. We had arranged to be 'at home' to all
       our kind friends in Honolulu at four o'clock, at which hour
       precisely the Governor sent the Royal band on board to
       enliven the proceedings. Soon our other visitors began to
       arrive; but the Queen appeared to be so well amused that she
       did not leave until five o'clock. By-half-past six, the last
       of our guests (over 150 in number) had said farewell, and
       there only remained the band to be shown round and feasted
       after their labours. Tom went on board the 'Fant&ocirc;me'
       to dine, and to meet the British, French, German, and
       American representatives. We went to the hotel; and I must
       say that I never in my life felt more thoroughly worn out
       than I did that night, after standing about and receiving
       and entertaining all the day.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, January 3rd</i>.&mdash;This was sure to be a
    disagreeable day, since it was to be the concluding one of our
    short stay in this pleasant place. The final preparations for a
    long voyage had also to be made; stores, water, and live stock
    to be got on board, bills to be paid, and adieux to be made to
    kind friends.</p>

    <p>I was on deck at six o'clock, in order to take some
    photographs and to stow away the coral, shells, curiosities,
    and presents of various kinds, that the King, Queen, Prince and
    Princess, as well as other kind friends, had sent us. Before
    seven the yacht was surrounded by boats, and the deck was quite
    impassable, so encumbered was it with all sorts of lumber,
    waiting to be stowed away, until the boats could be hoisted on
    board and secured for the voyage. The large mizen-sail, which
    had just been repaired and sent on board, looked enormous as it
    lay on the deck, surrounded by hen-coops, sheep, geese, sacks
    of coal, and baskets and parcels of every size and shape. One
    really began to <span class="pagenum">Page
    299<a name="Page_299"
       id="Page_299"></a></span> wonder whether space could
       possibly be found on board for such a miscellaneous
       collection. Several visitors, who had been unable to come
       yesterday, arrived in the midst of the confusion. They must
       have carried away in their minds a different impression of
       the yacht from what they would have done had they seen her
       looking as trim and smart as she did yesterday. It could
       not, however, be helped; for the departure of a small
       vessel, with forty people on board, on a voyage of a month's
       duration, is a matter requiring considerable
       preparation.</p>

    <p>At eleven o'clock we landed and went to see the interior of
    the Queen's Hospital. It is a fine and well-kept building,
    containing, at the time of our visit, about ninety patients,
    the men occupying the lower, the women the upper story. Each
    ward is tastefully decorated with bouquets, and the name is
    written up in bright mauve bougainvillea or scarlet hibiscus,
    tacked on to white calico. Many of the convalescents wore
    wreaths and garlands of flowers, and even those in bed had a
    few beside them, or in some cases a single spray laid on the
    coverlet. The effect was bright and cheerful; and it seemed a
    kind and sensible idea to endeavour to gratify, instead of to
    repress, the instinctive love of flowers universally felt by
    the natives of these and of the South Sea Islands.</p>

    <p>From the hospital we went to pay farewell visits, to lunch
    at the hotel, and to settle sundry bills. At three we were to
    go to the Royal Mausoleum. This was a special privilege, and, I
    believe, the greatest compliment that has been paid to us
    anywhere. No foreigners are allowed to enter, except admirals
    on the station; and very few inhabitants of Honolulu have ever
    seen the interior. The King has one key, the Dowager Queen Emma
    another, and the Minister of the Interior the third.</p>

    <p>On our way up the hill to the Mausoleum, there was a funeral
    going on, very much after the style of an Irish wake in one of
    the dwellings of the poorer class. The house was decorated with
    flags, and was crowded <span class="pagenum">Page
    300<a name="Page_300"
       id="Page_300"></a></span> with people, all dressed in black,
       and generally with bright yellow <i>leis</i> over their
       heads and necks. They had evidently come from some distance,
       judging by the number of carts and wagons drawn up outside
       the door. Several people were sitting in an upper verandah.
       The corpse was laid out in the lower room, facing the road,
       as we could see through the open windows and door. It was
       surrounded by mourners, and four women were waving large
       <i>kahilis</i> slowly backwards and forwards in front of
       it.</p>

    <p>The Princess herself met us at the Mausoleum, which is a
    small but handsome stone Gothic building, situated above the
    Nuuanu Avenue, on the road to the Pali. It commands a fine view
    over land and sea, and the gentle breezes waft through the open
    windows sweet scents from the many fragrant trees and flowers
    by which it is surrounded. There lay the coffins of all the
    kings of Hawaii, their consorts, and their children, for many
    generations past. The greater part were of polished <i>koa</i>
    wood, though some were covered with red velvet ornamented with
    gold. Many of them appeared to be of an enormous size; for, as
    I have already observed, the chiefs of these islands have
    almost invariably been men of large and powerful frames. The
    bones of Kamehameha I. were in a square oak chest. At the foot
    of the coffin of Kamehameha IV. there were two immense
    <i>kahilis</i> about twelve feet high, one of rose-coloured,
    the other of black feathers, with tortoise-shell handles. The
    remains of King Luna'ilo are not here, having been buried just
    outside the native church in the town. In the vestibule to the
    tombs of the kings rests the coffin of Mr. Wylie, described as
    'the greatest European benefactor of the Hawaiian people.' A
    ship now in the harbour bears his name, and one constantly
    meets with proofs of the respect and reverence in which his
    name is held.</p>

    <p>The Princess drove us down to the wharf, where we said
    good-bye to her with feelings of the greatest regret. I cannot
    express the sorrow <span class="pagenum">Page
    301<a name="Page_301"
       id="Page_301"></a></span> that we all feel at leaving the
       many kind friends we have met with in 'dear Honolulu,' as
       Muriel calls it. But the farewells were at last over, the
       anchor was weighed, and the yacht, which was by this time
       once more in apple-pie order, began slowly to move ahead.
       Suddenly we heard shouts from the shore, and saw a boat
       pursuing us in hot haste. We stopped, and received on board
       a basket of beautiful ferns and other parcels from different
       friends. A second boat was then seen coming off to us, which
       contained a fine dish of delicious honey and some flowers.
       The order to go ahead again was scarcely given, before a
       third boat, in, if possible, hotter haste than the two
       previous ones, put off after us, bringing some things the
       laundress had forgotten.</p>

    <p>Now we are fairly off; and now surely the last link that
    binds us to the shore is broken. But no! there are farewell
    signals and hearty cheers yet to come from the officers and men
    of the 'Fant&ocirc;me;' and, still further out, on the top of
    the tiny lighthouse at the mouth of the narrow passage through
    the reef, stand other friends, cheering and waving their
    handkerchiefs. They had rowed out thither, being
    <span class="pagenum">Page 302<a name="Page_302"
       id="Page_302"></a></span> determined to give us really
       <i>the</i> parting cheer, and till the shades of twilight
       fell we could see their white handkerchiefs fluttering, and
       hear their voices borne on the evening breeze, as we
       meandered slowly through the tortuous channels into deep
       water.</p>

    <p>Once outside we found there was plenty of wind and a heavy
    roll, which sent me quickly to bed.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, January 4th</i>.&mdash;It was very rough, but
    fortunately the wind came from a favourable quarter. Sorry as
    we all were to bid farewell to these charming islands, I could
    not help rejoicing that we had picked up a fresh fair wind so
    unexpectedly soon.</p>

    <p>While we were at Honolulu a regular epidemic of influenza
    prevailed in the place, affecting both man and beast. This is
    often the case during the prevalence of the south wind, which
    blew, more or less, during the whole of our stay. We none of us
    suffered from the malady at the time, but now nearly everybody
    on board is affected, and some very severely.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, January 5th</i>.&mdash;The fresh fair breeze
    still continues. At noon we had sailed 240 knots. The head-sea
    we could dispense with, as it makes us all very uncomfortable.
    Muriel, Baby, the three maids, and several of the crew, are ill
    to-day with influenza, and I have a slight touch of it, so I
    suppose it will go right through the ship. Towards the evening
    the breeze increased to a gale.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, January 6th</i>.&mdash;The gale increased
    during the night, and the head-sea became heavier. There was a
    good deal of rain in the course of the day. The wind dropped
    about sunset, and was succeeded by intervals of calm, with
    occasional sharp squalls. Baby was very
    <span class="pagenum">Page 304<a name="Page_304"
       id="Page_304"></a></span> poorly all day, but seemed better
       at night. We have now regularly settled down to our sea life
       again, and, if only the children recover, I hope to get
       through a good deal of reading and writing between this and
       Japan. At present they occupy all my time and attention, but
       I think, like the weather, they have now taken a turn for
       the better.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, January 7th</i>.&mdash;A very rough and
    disagreeable day, with much rain. All the morning we rolled
    about, becalmed, in a heavy swell. Steam was ordered at
    half-past twelve, but before it was up the fair wind had
    returned, so the fires were put out. We had the Litany at
    eleven, and a short service, without a sermon, at four.</p>

    <p>Baby was <i>very</i> ill all night. Everything was shut up
    on account of the torrents of rain, so that the heat was almost
    insufferable, and we tossed and tumbled about in the most
    miserable manner.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, January 8th</i>.&mdash;All the early part of the
    morning we were in the greatest anxiety about Baby; she could
    hardly draw her breath, and lay in her cot, or on her nurse's
    lap, almost insensible, and quite blue in the face, in spite of
    the application of mustard, hot water, and every remedy we
    could think of. The influenza with her has taken the form of
    bronchitis and pleurisy. The other children are still ailing.
    Heavy squalls of wind and rain, and continuous rolling,
    prevailed throughout the day.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, January 9th</i>.&mdash;The wind fell light, and
    the weather improved; but we tumbled about more than ever. The
    thermometer in the nursery stood at 90&deg;. The children are a
    shade better.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, January 10th</i>.&mdash;Very hot, and a flat
    calm. Steam was up at 7.30 a.m. Mabelle is convalescent; Muriel
    not so well; Baby certainly better. In the afternoon one of the
    boiler-tubes burst. It was repaired, and we went on steaming.
    In the evening it burst again, and was once more repaired,
    without causing a long stoppage. <span class="pagenum">Page
    305<a name="Page_305"
       id="Page_305"></a></span></p>

    <p>(<i>Thursday, January 11th</i>, had no existence for us, as,
    in the process of crossing the 180th meridian, we have lost a
    day.)</p>

    <p><i>Friday, January 12th</i>.&mdash;Wednesday morning with us
    was Tuesday evening with people in England, and we were thus
    twelve hours in advance of them. To-day the order of things is
    reversed, and we are now twelve hours behind our friends at
    home. Having quitted one side of the map of the world
    (according to Mercator's projection), and entered upon the
    other half, we begin to feel that we are at last really
    'homeward bound.'</p>

    <p>At four a.m. Powell woke us with the announcement that the
    boiler-tube had again burst, and that we had consequently
    ceased steaming. Letting off steam, and blowing out the boiler,
    made a tremendous noise, which aroused everybody in the ship.
    It was a lovely morning, but a flat calm, and the sun rose
    magnificently. The few light clouds near the surface of the
    water caught and reflected the rays of light most brilliantly
    before the sun itself appeared, and assumed all manner of
    fanciful shapes.</p>

    <p>About six o'clock a very light breeze sprang up, which
    increased during the day; but the sea remained perfectly calm.
    We think we must have got into the trade again. This weather is
    indeed a luxury after all the knocking about we have lately
    gone through; and I feel as if I could never rest enough. The
    constant effort to maintain one's balance, whether sitting,
    standing, or moving about, has been most fatiguing, and the
    illness of the children has made matters worse. Baby is, I
    hope, now quite out of danger.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, January 13th</i>.&mdash;The engineers made up
    their minds that we were in the trade winds again yesterday,
    and that we should not want the engines for some days. They
    therefore did not hurry on with the repairs as they should have
    done. This morning there was a calm, and when Tom ordered steam
    to be got up at once, the reply was, 'Please, sir, the engine
    won't be ready till night.' This was <span class="pagenum">Page
    306<a name="Page_306"
       id="Page_306"></a></span> annoying; but they worked extra
       hard all day, and by 4 p.m. steam was raised. At six a nice
       little breeze sprang up, which freshened during the evening,
       and at midnight orders were given to stop steaming.</p>

    <p>We had another bad night of it&mdash;a head wind, the sea
    washing over the decks, everything shut up, and the thermometer
    standing at 90&deg;.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, January 14th</i>.&mdash;I was on deck at 4 a.m.
    The Southern Cross, the Great Bear, and the North Star, were
    shining with a brilliancy that eclipsed all the other
    stars.</p>

    <p>During the day the wind freshened to a squally gale.
    Sometimes we were going ten, sometimes thirteen, and sometimes
    fifteen knots through the water, knocking about a good deal all
    the while. Service was an impossibility; cooking and eating,
    indeed, were matters of difficulty. It rained heavily, and the
    seas came over the deck continually.</p>

    <p>Many of the sailors and servants were ill. I was hopelessly
    so. Nothing annoys me more than to find that, after having
    sailed tens and tens of thousands of miles, I cannot cure
    myself of sea-sickness. I can stand a good deal more rolling
    than I once could; but still, many are the days when nothing
    but the firmest determination not to think about it, but to
    find something to do, and to do it with all my might, keeps me
    on my feet at all. Fewer, happily, are the days when struggling
    is of no avail, when I am utterly and hopelessly incapacitated,
    ignominiously and literally laid flat on my back, and when no
    effort of will can enable me to do what I most wish to
    accomplish. If only some physician could invent a sovereign
    remedy for sea-sickness, he would deserve well of his country,
    and of mankind in general.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, January 15th</i>.&mdash;I woke once or twice in
    the night, and felt exactly as if I were being pulled backwards
    through the water by my <span class="pagenum">Page
    307<a name="Page_307"
       id="Page_307"></a></span> hair. We were rushing and tearing
       along at such a pace, against a head sea, that it almost
       took one's breath away. But at noon we were rewarded for all
       discomfort by finding that we had run 298 sea, or 343 land
       miles, in 24 hours, and that between 8.14 yesterday and 8.15
       to-day we had made 302 knots, or 347 land miles&mdash;nearly
       350 miles in the 24 hours&mdash;under very snug canvas, and
       through a heavy sea. The wind still continued fair and
       fresh, but the sea was much quieter, and we all felt
       comparatively comfortable. More sails were set during the
       afternoon. Some albatrosses and long-tailed tropic birds
       were seen hovering about us. The moon begins to give a good
       light now, and we found it very pleasant on deck this
       evening.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, January 17th</i>.&mdash;It was a fine warm
    morning, and we got the children on deck for the first time for
    ten days.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, January 18th</i>.&mdash;Between breakfast and
    lunch we sailed over the spot where Tarquin Island is marked on
    the chart, and, between lunch and dinner, over a nameless reef,
    also marked on the chart. A good look-out had been kept at the
    masthead and in the bows, but not a trace could be seen of
    either of these objects in any direction. The weather kept
    clear and bright, and the sea was much calmer.</p>

    <p>During the last five days we have covered 1,221 sea
    miles.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, January 22nd</i>.&mdash;At daylight Asuncion
    Island was still visible. It is of volcanic origin, and is in
    the form of a perfect sugar-loaf, 2,600 feet high, rising out
    of the sea, exactly as I had expected the Peak of Teneriffe to
    appear. I should like to have landed on the islands Agrigan or
    Tinian, so as to see the interesting remains left by the
    ancient inhabitants. Some people say that they resemble Aztec
    remains; others, that they are like those of the more modern
    Peruvians. All authorities, however, seem to agree that they
    are like <span class="pagenum">Page 308<a name="Page_308"
       id="Page_308"></a></span> those on Easter Island, the
       south-east extremity of Polynesia, this being the
       north-west.</p>

    <p>We were close-hauled all day; the wind was strong, and the
    sea rough and disagreeable.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, January 23rd</i>.&mdash;Still close-hauled, and
    still a heavy swell. I felt very ill, and could scarcely move
    my head for neuralgia. The <span class="pagenum">Page
    309<a name="Page_309"
       id="Page_309"></a></span> galley boiler burst to-day, so we
       are now dependent on the one in the forecastle. During the
       night we passed the Euphrosyne rock. It looks like a ship in
       full sail, and abounds with turtle, fish, and
       sea-elephants.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, January 24th</i>.&mdash;Very much colder,
    though we are only just outside the tropics. The wind was
    rather freer, and we had a beautiful moonlight night.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, January 26th</i>.&mdash;During the night the
    breeze freshened, and in the morning increased to a gale. Steam
    was therefore let off. It has been a miserable day; so cold,
    wet, and rough, that it was impossible to do anything, or to
    sit anywhere, except on the floor.</p>

    <p>About 9 p.m. I was sitting in the deck-house, when I heard a
    tremendous crash, and, looking out, saw that the fore gig
    davits had been carried away, taking with them a piece of the
    rail, stanchion, and cavil. The gig was hanging from the after
    davits, one might say, by a thread, splashing and dashing in
    and out of the water, and crashing and splintering against the
    side of the yacht. All hands were speedily on deck; and in
    spite of the risk they ran, and of the remonstrances of their
    comrades, two of the gig's crew jumped into her with a rope,
    which they tried to pass round her. It was a difficult task in
    that heavy sea, and many times they failed, and we constantly
    feared that men, boat, and all were gone. Half a dozen of the
    crew caught hold of the rigging outside, put their backs
    against the yacht, and with legs outstretched tried to keep the
    gig off the ship's side, while all the loose gear was floating
    away out of her. At last there was a shout of triumph. The rope
    was round her, the men jumped on board the yacht again, whilst
    sailors, stewards, and passengers proceeded to hoist and drag
    the boat in, with all their might and main. Alas! she was only
    a wreck. Her sides were stove in, her planks were started,
    there was a hole in her bottom, and the moon shone through her
    many cracks.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 310<a name="Page_310"
       id="Page_310"></a></span> <i>Saturday, January
       27th</i>.&mdash;About two o'clock this morning the yacht
       plunged so heavily into a deep sea, that the jibboom, a
       beautiful spar, broke short off, and the foretop-gallant
       mast and topgallant yard were carried away almost at the
       same moment, with a terrible noise. It took about eight
       hours to clear the wreck, all hands working all night; and a
       very forlorn appearance the deck presented in the morning,
       lumbered up with broken spars, ropes, &amp;c. The jibboom
       fell right across the forefoot of the yacht, and now looks
       as if it had been cut at for weeks with some blunt tool.</p>

    <p>The weather cleared a little to-day, but there was still a
    heavy sea and nearly a head wind. The crew were busily engaged
    in repairing damages. Unfortunately, two of them are ill, and
    so is the carpenter, a specially important person at this
    juncture. No men could have behaved better than they all did
    after the accident. It was frightful to see them aloft in such
    weather, swinging on the ends of the broken spars, as the yacht
    rolled and pitched about. When it comes to a pinch they are all
    good men and true: not that they are perfection, any more than
    other men are.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, January 28th</i>.&mdash;It is finer, but bitterly
    cold. Several of my tropical birds are already dead. The little
    pig from Harpe Island, and the Hawaiian geese, look very
    wretched, in spite of all my precautions.</p>

    <p>We had the Litany at eleven, and prayer and a sermon at
    four; after which Tom addressed the men, paying them some
    well-deserved compliments on their behaviour on Friday
    night.</p>

    <p>The decks were very slippery, and as we kept rolling about a
    good deal there were some nasty falls among the passengers. We
    had a splendid though stormy sunset, which did not belie its
    promise, for the wind shortly afterwards became stiffer and
    stronger, until at last we had two reefs down, and were
    tumbling about in all directions, as we rushed through the
    water. The dining-tables tilted till they could go
    <span class="pagenum">Page 311<a name="Page_311"
       id="Page_311"></a></span> no further, and then paused to go
       back again; but not quickly enough, for the glasses began to
       walk uphill and go over the edge in the most extraordinary
       manner. On deck the night looked brilliant but rather
       terrible. The full moon made it as light as day, and
       illuminated the fountains of spray blown from the waves by
       which we were surrounded. Without her heavy jibboom, and
       with her canvas well reefed down, the 'Sunbeam' rode through
       it all, dipping her head into the sea, shivering from stem
       to stern, and then giving herself a shake, preparatory to a
       fresh start, just like a playful water-bird emerging from a
       prolonged dive.</p>

    <p>At midnight a tremendous sea struck her, and for a minute
    you could not see the yacht at all, as she was completely
    enveloped in spray and foam. Tom said it was just like being
    behind the falls of Niagara, with the water coming over you
    from every quarter at once. It was only loose stuff, however,
    for not a green sea did she take on board the whole night
    through. Our old engineer, who has been with us so long, made
    up his mind that we had struck on a rock, and woke up all the
    servants and told them to go on deck. I never felt anything
    like it before, and the shock sent half of us out of our
    beds.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, January 29th</i>.&mdash;At four o'clock I was
    called to go on deck to see the burning mountain. The wind was
    still blowing hard, but we were among the islands, and in
    comparatively smooth water. The full moon still rode high in
    the heavens, her light being reflected in rainbow hues from the
    spray and foam that drifted along the surface of the water. On
    every side were islands and rocks, among which the sea boiled,
    and seethed, and swirled, while the roaring breakers dashed
    against the higher cliffs, casting great columns of spray into
    the air, and falling back in heavy rollers and surf. Just
    before us rose the island of Vries, with its cone-shaped
    volcano, 2,600 feet high, emitting volumes of smoke and flame.
    It was overhung by a cloud of <span class="pagenum">Page
    312<a name="Page_312"
       id="Page_312"></a></span> white vapour, on the under side of
       which shone the lurid glare of the fires of the crater.
       Sometimes this cloud simply floated over the top of the
       mountain, from which it was quite detached; then there would
       be a fresh eruption; and after a few moments' quiet, great
       tongues of flame would shoot up and pierce through the
       overhanging cloud to the heavens above, while the molten
       lava rose like a fountain for a short distance, and then ran
       down the sides of the mountain. It was wondrously beautiful;
       and, as a defence against the intense cold, we wrapped
       ourselves in furs, and stayed on deck watching the scene,
       until the sun rose glorious from the sea, and shone upon the
       snow-covered sides of Fujiyama, called by the Japanese 'the
       matchless mountain.' It is an extinct crater, of the most
       perfect form, rising abruptly from a chain of very low
       mountains, so that it stands in unrivalled magnificence.
       This morning covered with the fresh-fallen snow, there was
       not a spot nor a fleck to be seen upon it, from top to
       bottom. It is said to be the youngest mountain in the world,
       the enormous mass having been thrown up in the course of a
       few days only 862 years B.C.</p>

    <p>We reached the entrance to the Gulf of Yeddo about nine
    o'clock, and passed between its shores through hundreds of
    junks and fishing boats. I never saw anything like it before.
    The water was simply covered with them; and at a distance it
    looked as though it would be impossible to force a passage. As
    it was, we could not proceed very fast, so constantly were the
    orders to 'slow,' 'stop,' 'port,' 'starboard,' given; and I
    began at last to fear that it would be impossible to reach
    Yokohama without running down at least one boat.</p>

    <p>The shores of the gulf, on each side, consist of sharp-cut
    little hills, covered with pines and cryptomerias, and dotted
    with temples and villages. Every detail of the scene exactly
    resembled the <span class="pagenum">Page 313<a name="Page_313"
       id="Page_313"></a></span> Japanese pictures one is
       accustomed to see in England; and it was easy to imagine
       that we were only gazing upon a slowly moving panorama,
       unrolling itself before us.</p>

    <p>It was twelve o'clock before we found ourselves among the
    men-of-war and steamers lying near the port of Yokohama, and
    two o'clock before the anchor could be dropped.</p>

    <p>During this interval we were surrounded by a swarm of boats,
    the occupants of which clamoured vociferously to be allowed on
    board, and in many cases they succeeded in evading the
    vigilance of the man at the gangway, by going round the other
    side and climbing over the rail. A second man was put on guard;
    but it was of no use, for we were invaded from all directions
    at once. We had a good many visitors also
    <span class="pagenum">Page 314<a name="Page_314"
       id="Page_314"></a></span> from the men-of-war, Japanese and
       English, and from the reporters of newspapers, full of
       curiosity, questions, and astonishment.</p>

    <p>Having at last managed to get some lunch, Tom went to bed to
    rest, after his two hard nights' work, and the rest of us went
    on shore. Directly we landed at the jetty we were rushed at by
    a crowd of <i>jinrikisha</i> men, each drawing a little vehicle
    not unlike a Hansom cab, without the seat for the
    driver&mdash;there being no horse to drive. The man runs
    between the shafts, and is often preceded by a leader,
    harnessed on in front, tandem fashion. Each of these vehicles
    holds one person, and they go along at a tremendous pace.</p>

    <p>We went first to the Consul's, where we got a few letters,
    and then to the Post Office, where many more awaited us. We had
    then to go to various places to order stores, fresh provisions,
    coals, and water, all of which were urgently needed on board,
    and to give directions for the repair of boats, spars, &amp;c.,
    with as little delay as possible. All this business, including
    the inevitable search for a good laundress, lay in the European
    quarter of the town, the appearance of which was not
    remarkable. But the people we met in the streets were a study
    in themselves. The children said they looked 'like fans walking
    about;' and it was not difficult to understand their meaning.
    The dress of the lower orders has remained precisely the same
    for hundreds of years; and before I had been ashore five
    minutes I realised more fully than I had ever done before the
    truthfulness of the representations of native artists, with
    which the fans, screens, and vases one sees in England are
    ornamented.</p>

    <p>While we were going about, a letter was brought me,
    containing the sad news (received here by telegram) of the
    death of Tom's mother. It was a terrible shock, coming, too,
    just as we were rejoicing in the good accounts from home which
    our letters contained. I went on board at
    <span class="pagenum">Page 315<a name="Page_315"
       id="Page_315"></a></span> once to break the bad news to Tom.
       This sad intelligence realised a certain vague dread of
       something, we knew not what, which has seemed to haunt us
       both on our way hither.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, January 30th</i>.&mdash;When we awoke from our
    slumbers this morning, it was very cold and dark, and we heard
    noises of a strange kind. On going on deck to ascertain the
    cause of this state of things, we discovered that the
    sky-lights and portholes were all covered and blocked up with
    snow, and that the water froze as it came out of the hose,
    forming a sheet of ice on the deck. Masses of snow and ice were
    falling from the rigging, and everything betokened that our
    welcome to Japan would not be a warm one.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 317<a name="Page_317"
       id="Page_317"></a></span> After breakfast we had many
       visitors, and received letters from Sir Harry and Lady
       Parkes, inviting us to go up to Yeddo to-morrow for a long
       day, to settle our future plans.</p>

    <p>Having landed, we went with the Consul to the native town,
    to see the curio shops, which are a speciality of the place.
    The inhabitants are wonderfully clever at making all sorts of
    curiosities, and the manufactories of so-called 'antique
    bronzes' and 'old china' are two of the most wonderful sights
    in Yokohama. The way in which they scrape, crack, chip, mend,
    and colour the various articles, cover them with dust,
    partially clean them, and imitate the marks and signatures of
    celebrated makers, is more creditable to their ingenuity than
    to their honesty. Still, there are a good many genuine old
    relics from the temples, and from the large houses of the
    reduced Daimios, to be picked up, if you go the right way to
    work, though the supply is limited. Dealers are plentiful, and
    travellers, especially from America, are increasing in numbers.
    When we first made acquaintance with the shops we thought they
    seemed full of beautiful things, but even one day's shopping,
    in the company of experienced people, has educated our taste
    and taught us a great deal; though we have still much to learn.
    There are very respectable-looking lacquer cabinets ranging in
    price from 5<i>s</i>. to 20<i>l</i>. But they are only made for
    the foreign market. No such things exist in a Japanese home. A
    really good bit of old lacquer (the best is generally made into
    the form of a small box, a portable medicine-chest, or a
    chow-chow box) is worth from 20<i>l</i>. to 200<i>l</i>. We saw
    one box, about three inches square, which was valued at
    45<i>l</i>.; and a collection of really good lacquer would be
    costly and difficult to procure even here. The best specimens I
    have ever seen are at Lady Alcock's; but they are all either
    royal or princely presents, not to be bought with money. The
    tests of good lacquer are its exquisite finish, its satiny,
    oily feel, and the impossibility of making any impression on it
    with your thumb-nail. It<span class="pagenum">Page
    318<a name="Page_318"
       id="Page_318"></a></span> is practically indestructible, and
       will wear for ever. All the poor as well as the rich people
       here use it, and have used it for centuries, instead of
       china and glass, for cups, saucers, dishes, bowls, which
       would need to be often washed in the hottest of water. It is
       said that the modern Japanese have lost the art of lacquer
       making; and as an illustration I was told that many
       beautiful articles of lacquer, old and new, had been sent
       from this country to the Vienna Exhibition in 1873, but the
       price put on them was so exorbitant that few were sold, and
       nearly all had to be sent back to Japan. Just as the ship
       with these things on board reached the Gulf of Yeddo, she
       struck on a rock and sank in shallow water. A month or two
       ago a successful attempt was made to raise her, and to
       recover the cargo, when it was found that the new lacquer
       had been reduced to a state of pulp, while the old was not
       in the least damaged. I tell you the tale as it was told to
       me.</p>

    <p>After a long day's shopping, we went to dine, in real
    Japanese fashion, at a Japanese tea-house. The establishment
    was kept by a very pleasant woman, who received us at the door,
    and who herself removed our exceedingly dirty boots before
    allowing us to step on to her clean mats. This was all very
    well, as far as it went; but she might as well have supplied us
    with some substitute for the objectionable articles, for it was
    a bitterly cold night, and the highly polished wood passages
    and steep staircase felt very cold to our shoeless feet. The
    apartment we were shown into was so exact a type of a room in
    any Japanese house, that I may as well describe it once for
    all. The woodwork of the roof and the framework of the screens
    were all made of a handsome dark polished wood, not unlike
    walnut. The exterior walls under the verandah, as well as the
    partitions between the other rooms, were simply wooden
    lattice-work screens, covered with white paper, and sliding in
    grooves; so that you could walk in or out at any part of the
    wall you chose, and it was, in like manner, impossible to
    say<span class="pagenum">Page 319<a name="Page_319"
       id="Page_319"></a></span> whence the next comer would make
       his appearance. Doors and windows are, by this arrangement,
       rendered unnecessary, and do not exist. You open a little
       bit of your wall if you want to look out, and a bigger bit
       if you want to step out. The floor was covered with several
       thicknesses of very fine mats, each about six feet long by
       three broad, deliciously soft to walk upon. All mats in
       Japan are of the same size, and everything connected with
       house-building is measured by this standard. Once you have
       prepared your foundations and woodwork of the dimensions of
       so many mats, it is the easiest thing in the world to go to
       a shop and buy a house, ready made, which you can then set
       up and furnish in the scanty Japanese fashion in a couple of
       days.</p>

    <p>On one side of the room was a slightly raised da&iuml;s,
    about four inches from the floor. This was the seat of honour.
    On it had been placed a stool, a little bronze ornament, and a
    china vase, with a branch of cherry-blossom and a few
    flag-leaves gracefully arranged. On the wall behind hung
    pictures, which are changed every month, according to the
    season of the year. There was no other furniture of any sort in
    the room. Four nice-looking Japanese girls brought us thick
    cotton quilts to sit upon, and braziers full of burning
    charcoal, to warm ourselves by. In the centre of the group
    another brazier was placed, protected by a square wooden
    grating, and over the whole they laid a large silk eider-down
    quilt, to retain the heat. This is the way in which all the
    rooms, even bedrooms, are warmed in Japan, and the result is
    that fires are of very frequent occurrence. The brazier is
    kicked over by some restless or careless person, and in a
    moment the whole place is in a blaze.</p>

    <p>Presently the eider down and brazier were removed, and our
    dinner was brought in. A little lacquer table, about six inches
    high, on which were arranged a pair of chop-sticks, a basin of
    soup, a bowl for<span class="pagenum">Page
    320<a name="Page_320"
       id="Page_320"></a></span> rice, a <i>saki</i> cup, and a
       basin of hot water, was placed before each person, whilst
       the four Japanese maidens sat in our midst, with fires to
       keep the <i>saki</i> hot, and to light the tiny pipes with
       which they were provided, and from which they wished us to
       take a whiff after each dish. <i>Saki</i> is a sort of
       spirit, distilled from rice, always drunk hot, out of small
       cups. In this state it is not disagreeable, but we found it
       exceedingly nasty when cold.</p>

    <p>Everything was well cooked and served, though the
    ingredients of some of the dishes, as will be seen from the
    following bill of fare, were rather strange to our ideas. Still
    they were all eatable, and most of them really palatable.</p>

    <p class="ctr"><i>Soup</i>.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Shrimps and Seaweed</i>.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Prawns, Egg Omelette, and Preserved Grapes</i>.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Fried Fish, Spinach, Young Rushes, and Young
    Ginger</i>.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Raw Fish, Mustard and Cress, Horseradish, and Soy</i>.<br />
    <br />

    <i>Turnip Tops and Root Pickled</i>.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Rice ad libitum in a large bowl</i>.<br />
    <br />
    <i>Hot Saki, Pipes and Tea</i>.<br /></p>

    <p>The meal concluded with an enormous lacquer box of rice,
    from which all our bowls were filled, the rice being thence
    conveyed to our mouths by means of chop-sticks. We managed very
    well with these substitutes for spoons and forks, the knack of
    using which, to a certain extent, is soon acquired. The long
    intervals between the dishes were beguiled with songs, music,
    and dancing, performed by <span class="pagenum">Page
    321<a name="Page_321"
       id="Page_321"></a></span> professional singing and dancing
       girls. The music was somewhat harsh and monotonous; but the
       songs sounded harmonious, and the dancing was graceful,
       though it was rather posturing than dancing, great use being
       made of the fan and the long trailing skirts. The girls, who
       were pretty, wore peculiar dresses to indicate their
       calling, and seemed of an entirely different stamp from the
       quiet, simply dressed waitresses whom we found so attentive
       to our wants. Still they all looked cheery, light-hearted,
       simple creatures, and appeared to enjoy immensely the little
       childish games they played amongst themselves between
       whiles.</p>

    <p>After dinner we had some real Japanese tea, tasting exactly
    like a little hot water poured on very fragrant new-mown hay.
    Then, after a brief visit to the kitchen, which, though small,
    was beautifully clean, we received our boots, and were bowed
    out by our pleasant hostess and her attentive handmaidens.</p>

    <p>On our return we had considerable difficulty in procuring a
    boat, our own boats being all ashore under repair. It was a
    beautiful moonlight night, but bitterly cold. The harbour being
    so full of shipping, our boatmen were at first puzzled how to
    find the yacht, till we pointed to the lights in the
    deck-house&mdash;always a good beacon at night in a crowded
    harbour.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, January 31st</i>. We left the yacht soon after
    eight o'clock, and started by the 9.34 a.m. train for the city
    formerly called Yeddo, but latterly, since the Mikado has
    resided there, Tokio, or eastern capital of Japan. The ground
    was covered with snow, and there were several degrees of frost,
    but the sun felt hot, and all the people were sunning
    themselves in the doorways or wide verandahs of their
    houses.</p>

    <p>Yokohama has been so completely Europeanised, that it was
    not until we had left it that we caught our first glimpse of
    Japanese life; and the whole landscape and the many villages
    looked very like a set of living fans or
    <span class="pagenum">Page 322<a name="Page_322"
       id="Page_322"></a></span>tea-trays, though somehow the snow
       did not seem to harmonise with it.</p>

    <p>We crossed several rivers, and reached Tokio in about an
    hour, when we at once emerged into the midst of a clattering,
    chattering crowd, amongst whom there did not seem to be a
    single European. The reverberation, under the glass roof of the
    station, of the hundreds of pairs of wooden clogs, pattering
    along, was something extraordinary. Giving up our tickets, and
    following the stream, we found ourselves surrounded by a still
    more animated scene, outside the station. We were just
    deliberating what to do next, when a smart little Japanese,
    with a mail-bag over his shoulder, stepped forward and said
    something about Sir Harry Parkes. He then popped us all into
    several double and treble-manned <i>jinrikishas</i>, and
    started off himself ahead at a tremendous pace, shouting and
    clearing the way for us.</p>

    <p>Tokio is a genuinely Japanese town. Not a single foreigner
    resides within its limits, with the exception of the foreign
    Ministers. There is no hotel nor any place of the kind to stay
    at; so that, unless you have friends at any of the Legations,
    you must return to Yokohama the same day, which makes a visit
    rather a fatiguing affair<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
       id="FNanchor_16_16">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_16_16"
       class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_16_16"
           id="Footnote_16_16"></a>
           <a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
           I have since heard that there are two hotels at Tokio,
           such as they are.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Our first halting-place was at the Temple of Shiba, not far
    from the station, where most of the Tycoons have been buried.
    It is a large enclosure, many acres in extent, in the centre of
    the city, with walls overgrown with creepers, and shadowed by
    evergreen trees, amid whose branches rooks caw, ravens croak,
    and pigeons coo, as undisturbedly as if in the midst of the
    deepest woodland solitude. I had no idea there was anything so
    beautiful in Japanese architecture as this temple. The primary
    idea in the architecture of Japan is evidently that of a tent
    among trees. The lines of the high, overhanging, richly
    decorated roofs, with pointed gable ends, are not straight, but
    <span class="pagenum">Page 323<a name="Page_323"
       id="Page_323"></a></span>delicately curved, like the
       suspended cloth of a tent. In the same way, the pillars have
       neither capital nor base, but seem to run through the
       building perpendicularly, without beginning or end. The
       principal temple was burnt down a few years ago; but there
       are many smaller ones remaining, built in exactly the same
       style, and all the tombs are perfect. Some people say the
       bodies are enclosed in coffins, filled with vermilion, but I
       need hardly say we had no opportunity of ascertaining the
       correctness of this statement. We entered several of the
       temples, which are perfect marvels of carving, gilding,
       painting, and lacquer work. Their style of decoration may be
       somewhat barbaric; but what a study they would form for an
       artist! Outside, where no colour is used, the overhanging
       roofs and the walls are carved with a depth and boldness,
       and yet a delicacy, I have seldom seen equalled; the doors
       and railings being of massive bronze, brought from the
       Corea. Within, a dim religious light illumines and
       harmonises a dazzling mass of lacquer, gold, and painting.
       It is the grandest burial-place imaginable; too good for the
       long line of men who have tyrannised over Japan and its
       lawful sovereigns for so many centuries past.</p>

    <p>The streets of Tokio were crowded with a motley throng up to
    the very gates of the citadel, where, within the first moat,
    stand all the <i>yashgis</i>, or residences of the Daimios.
    Each <i>yashgi</i> is surrounded by a blank wall, loopholed,
    and with a tower at each of the four corners. Within this outer
    wall is the court of the retainers, all of them 'two-sworded'
    men; then comes a second wall, also loopholed, inside which
    dwell distant relations of the Daimio; and then again a third
    enclosure, guarding the Daimio himself, with his immediate
    belongings. After crossing the third moat we reached the
    Mikado's gardens and palace, the public offices, and the
    residences of the foreign Ministers, all of which were formerly
    occupied by the Tycoon, or Shogun, and his ministers. On the
    waters <span class="pagenum">Page 324<a name="Page_324"
       id="Page_324"></a></span>of the inner moat were thousands of
       wild ducks and geese. Nobody is allowed to harm them, and
       the birds seem to be perfectly aware of this fact, for they
       disport themselves with the greatest confidence.</p>

    <p>The English Embassy is a nice red brick house, built in the
    centre of a garden, so as to be as secure as possible from fire
    or attack. After a most pleasant luncheon we looked over the
    nucleus of a second collection which Lady Parkes is beginning
    to form. Her former beautiful collection was burnt a few years
    ago, a most disheartening misfortune, especially as the
    opportunities for obtaining really old and good things in Japan
    are diminishing day by day.</p>

    <p>A little later we started in great force, some in carriages
    and some on horseback, attended by running grooms, to see
    something more of the city. These men think nothing of running
    by the side of a horse and carriage some forty miles a day.
    They form a distinct class, and when working on their own
    account wear little clothing. When in the service of private
    individuals they are dressed in tight-fitting dark-blue
    garments, with short capes, fastened to their arms, and large
    hats.</p>

    <p>Just outside the Embassy we passed two of the finest of the
    still existing <i>yashgis</i>, the larger one being used as the
    Home Office, the other as the Foreign Office.</p>

    <p>There is always a festival going on in some part of Tokio.
    To-day there had been a great wrestling-match, and we met all
    the people coming away. Such crowds of <i>jinrikiskas</i>, full
    of gaily dressed and painted women and children, with their
    hair plastered into all sorts of inconceivable shapes, and
    decorated with artificial flowers and glittering pins! We met
    six of the wrestlers themselves, riding in
    <i>jinrikishas</i>&mdash;big men, prodigiously fat, and not at
    all, according to our ideas, in fighting or wrestling
    condition. One of their <i>jinrikisha</i> men stumbled and
    fell, just as they passed us, and the wrestler shot out, head
    over heels, and lay, a helpless ball of fat, in the middle of
    the <span class="pagenum">Page 325<a name="Page_325"
       id="Page_325"></a></span>road, till somebody came and picked
       him up. He was not in the least hurt, and, as soon as he was
       set on his feet again, began to belabour the poor
       <i>jinrikisha</i> man most unmercifully. After a long and
       delightful drive we arrived at the station just in time to
       catch the train.</p>

    <p>The return journey to Yokohama, in the omnibus-like railway
    carriages, was very cold, and the <i>jinrikisha</i> drive to
    the Grand Hotel colder still; but a roaring fire and a capital
    dinner soon warmed and comforted us.</p>

    <p>After dinner we looked over a fine collection of photographs
    of Japanese scenery and costumes, and then returned to the
    yacht in the house-boat belonging to the hotel, which was
    prettily decorated with bright-coloured lanterns, and which
    afforded welcome shelter from the biting wind.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, February 1st</i>.&mdash;Careful arrangements
    have been made for our excursion to the Island of Inoshima, to
    see the great figure of Daibutz. By eight o'clock we had
    landed, and packed ourselves into a funny little shaky
    carriage, drawn by four horses. We drove quickly through the
    town, past the station, along the Tokaido, or imperial road,
    running from one end of the Island of Niphon to the other, and
    on which so many foreigners have been murdered even within the
    last ten years. Now, however, it is perfectly safe. The houses
    are one story high, and their walls are made of the screens I
    have already described. These screens were all thrown back, to
    admit the morning air, cold as it was. We could consequently
    see all that was going on within, in the sitting-room in front,
    and even in the bedrooms and kitchen. At the back of the house
    there was invariably a little garden to be seen, with a
    miniature rockery, a tree, and a lake; possibly also a bridge
    and a temple. Even in the gardens of the poorest houses an
    attempt at something of the sort had been made. The domestic
    occupations of the inhabitants being conducted in this public
    manner, a very good idea might be obtained, even at the end of
    a few miles' drive, of how the lower <span class="pagenum">Page
    326<a name="Page_326"
       id="Page_326"></a></span>class of Japanese wash and dress
       themselves and their children, how very elaborate the
       process of hair-dressing is, to say nothing of a bird's-eye
       view of the ground-plan of the houses, the method of cooking
       food, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>As we emerged into the open country the landscape became
    very pretty, and the numerous villages, nestling in the valleys
    at the foot of the various small hills, had a most picturesque
    appearance. At a stone-quarry that we passed, on the side of a
    mountain, there were about seventy men at work, without any
    clothing, though the thermometer was far below freezing point.
    The Japanese are a sensitive nation, and finding that
    foreigners were astonished and shocked at the habits of the
    people, in going about without clothes, and in bathing in
    public and at their house doors, they passed a law prohibiting
    these customs in towns. In the country, however, the more
    primitive customs are still in force, and every dwelling has
    its half-open bath-house, whilst the people do as they like in
    the matter of clothing.</p>

    <p>After stopping twice on the road, to drink the inevitable
    tea, we changed from our carriage to <i>jinrikishas</i>, each
    drawn and pushed by four strong men, bowling along at a merry
    pace. The sun was very warm in the sheltered valleys, and the
    abundance of evergreens of all kinds quite deluded one into the
    belief that it was summer time, especially as camellias grew
    like forest trees, covered with red and white bloom, amidst a
    dense tangle of bamboos and half-hardy palms. There were many
    strange things upside down to be seen on efther
    hand&mdash;horses and cows with bells on their tails instead of
    on their necks, the quadrupeds well clothed, their masters
    without a scrap of covering, tailors sewing from them instead
    of to them, a carpenter reversing the action of his saw and
    plane. It looked just as if they had originally learned the
    various processes in 'Alice's Looking-glass World' in some
    former stage of their existence.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 327<a name="Page_327"
       id="Page_327"></a></span>We had not long left the town
       before our men began to undress each other; for their
       clothes were so tight that it required no inconsiderable
       effort to remove them. Some of them were beautifully
       tattooed. My wheeler had the root of a tree depicted on one
       foot, from which sprang the trunk and branches, spreading
       gradually, until on his back and chest they bore fruit and
       flowers, amongst which birds were perched. On his other leg
       was a large stork, supposed, I imagine, to be standing under
       the shadow of the same tree. Another man had human figures
       tattooed all over him, in various attitudes.</p>

    <p>In less than an hour we reached the narrow strip of land
    which at low water connects the island or peninsula of Inoshima
    with the mainland. This isthmus was covered with natives
    gathering shells and seaweed, casting their nets, and pushing
    off or dragging up their boats; whilst an island rose fresh and
    green from the sea, with a background of snowy mountains,
    stretching across the bay, <span class="pagenum">Page
    328<a name="Page_328"
       id="Page_328"></a></span>above which Fujiyama towered
       grandly. This name signifies 'not two, but one mountain,'
       the Japanese thinking it impossible that there can be
       another like it in the world. The lovely little island is
       called Inoshima, and is conical in shape and covered with
       evergreens and Buddhist temples, with a few small fishing
       villages scattered on its shores. We walked right across it
       in about an hour; so you may imagine it is not very large.
       The sea teems with curiously shaped fish and beautiful
       shells. The staple food of the inhabitants seems to be those
       lovely 'Venus's ears, <a name="FNanchor_17_17"
       id="FNanchor_17_17">'</a> <a href="#Footnote_17_17"
       class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as they are called&mdash;a
       flattish univalve, about as big as your hand, with a row of
       holes along the edge, and a lining of brilliant black
       mother-of-pearl. These were lying about in heaps mixed with
       white mother-of-pearl shells, as big as your two fists, and
       shaped like a snail-shell.</p>

    <p>Our <i>jinrikisha</i> men deposited us at the bottom of the
    main street of the principal village, to enter which we passed
    through a simple square arch of a temple. The street was steep
    and dirty, and consisted principally of shell-fish and seaweed
    shops. <span class="pagenum">Page 329<a name="Page_329"
       id="Page_329"></a></span></p>

    <p>An old priest took us in hand, and, providing us with stout
    sticks, marched us up to the top of the hill to see various
    temples, and splendid views in many directions. The camellias
    and evergreens on the hillside made a lovely framework for each
    little picture, as we turned and twisted along the narrow path.
    I know not how many steps on the other side of the island had
    to be descended before the sea-beach was reached. Here is a
    cavern stretching 500 feet straight below high-water mark, with
    a shrine to Benton Sama, the Lucina of Japan; and having been
    provided with candles, we proceeded a few hundred feet through
    another cave, running at right angles to the first.</p>

    <p>As it would have been a long steep walk back, and I was very
    tired, we called to one of the numerous fishing boats near the
    shore, and were quickly conveyed round to our original starting
    place. Before we said good-bye, one of the old priests implored
    to be allowed to dive into the water for half-a-dollar. His
    request was complied with, and he caught the coin most
    successfully.</p>

    <p>We lunched at a tea-house, our meal consisting of fish of
    all kinds, deliciously cooked, and served, fresh from the fire,
    in a style worthy of Greenwich; and as we had taken the
    precaution to bring some bread and wine with us, we were
    independent of the usual rice and <i>saki</i>.</p>

    <p>After this we proceeded on our way towards the Daibutz, or
    Great Buddha, situated within the limits of what was once the
    large city of Kama-kura, now only a collection of small
    hamlets. As all Japanese cities are built of wood, it is not
    wonderful that they should in time <span class="pagenum">Page
    330<a name="Page_330"
       id="Page_330"></a></span>entirely disappear, and leave no
       trace behind them. But there still remain some of the
       columns of the temple which once existed in the gardens
       surrounding the idol. Now he is quite alone; and for
       centuries has this grand old figure sat, exposed to the
       elements, serenely smiling on the varying scene beneath him.
       The figure is of bronze, and is supposed to have been cast
       about the year 1250 or 1260.</p>

    <p>It is some 50 ft. high, with golden eyes and a silver spiral
    horn on the forehead. It is possible to sit or stand on the
    thumb, and within the hollow body an altar is erected, at which
    the priests officiate. Sitting there, amidst a grove of
    enormous cryptomerias and bamboos, there is an air of ineffable
    silent strength about that solitary figure, which affords a
    clue to the tenacity with which the poorer classes cling to
    Buddhism. The very calmness of these figures must be more
    suggestive of relief and repose to the poor weary worshippers
    than the glitter of the looking-glass and crystal ball to be
    found in the Shintoo temples. The looking-glass is intended to
    remind believers that the Supreme Being can see their innermost
    thoughts as clearly as they can perceive their own reflection;
    while the crystal ball is an emblem of purity. Great store is
    set by the latter, especially if of large size and without
    flaw; but to my mind the imperfect ones are the best, as they
    refract the light and do not look so much like glass.</p>

    <p>In another village close by&mdash;also part of the ancient
    Kama-kura&mdash;there is a fine temple, dedicated to the God
    <span class="pagenum">Page 331<a name="Page_331"
       id="Page_331"></a></span> of War; but we were pressed for
       time, and hurried back to the little carriages. The homeward
       drive was long and cold; but the Tokaido looked very pretty
       lighted up, the shadows of the inmates being plainly visible
       on the paper walls, reminding one of a scene in a pantomime.
       On our way down a very steep hill we met the men carrying a
       <i>cango</i>. It is a most uncomfortable-looking basket-work
       contrivance, in which it is impossible to sit or lie with
       ease. These <i>cangoes</i> used formerly to be the ordinary
       conveyance of Japan, but they are now replaced by the
       <i>jinrikishas</i>, and they are seldom met with, except in
       the mountains or in out-of-the-way places.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, February 2nd</i>.&mdash;I was called at five
    o'clock, and at half-past six Mabelle and I started for the
    market. It was blowing a gale, and our four oarsmen found it as
    much as they could do to reach the shore. The Shanghai
    mail-boat was just in, and I pitied the poor passengers, who
    were in all the misery of being turned out into the cold of the
    early morning, with the spray breaking over them as they sat in
    the small boats.</p>

    <p>The market at Yokohama is one of the sights of the place.
    There were large quantities of birds and game of all
    kinds&mdash;pheasants with tails six feet long, of a rare
    copper-coloured variety, ducks, pigeons, small birds, hares,
    deer, rabbits. The fish-market was well supplied, especially
    with cuttle-fish. They are not inviting-looking, but are
    considered a delicacy here. A real octopus, in a basket, with
    its hideous body in the centre, and its eight arms, covered
    with suckers, arranged in the form of a star, is worth from a
    dollar to a dollar and a half, according to its size. I was not
    tempted, however, to make any purchases.</p>

    <p>From the market we went to one or two small shops in back
    streets, and thence over the bluffs, in the teeth of a bitterly
    cold wind, to a nursery garden, to examine the results of the
    Japanese art of dwarfing and distorting trees. Some of the
    specimens were very curious and some beautiful,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 332<a name="Page_332"
       id="Page_332"></a></span>but most were simply hideous. We
       saw tiny old gnarled fruit-trees, covered with blossom, and
       Scotch firs and other forest trees, eight inches high,
       besides diminutive ferns and creepers.</p>

    <p>It being now half-past nine o'clock, we went to the hotel to
    meet the rest of the party for breakfast, and at one o'clock we
    returned to the yacht. At half-past one Lady Parkes and several
    other friends from Tokio came on board to luncheon. They told
    of three disastrous fires that had taken place in Tokio
    yesterday, by which the Home Office&mdash;one of the finest old
    Tartar <i>yashgis</i>&mdash;and several smaller edifices had
    been destroyed.</p>

    <p>After the departure of our guests we paid another visit to
    the shore, and saw the foxhounds. They are a nice pack, and
    have good kennels outside the foreign settlement. They were out
    this morning at 6.30, but unfortunately we did not know of it.
    There are plenty of foxes, and some very fair country not far
    from here; so they expect to have good sport.</p>

    <p>We weighed anchor at 8.30 p.m. and proceeded under steam. At
    11.30, when off Touraya-saki, we set some of the head canvas.
    It was a cold night, with sleet and snow, though it was not
    blowing as hard as during the day.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, February 3rd</i>.&mdash;The occasional glimpses
    of the coast scenery through the sleet and snow were very fine.
    We passed Rocky Island, Lady Inglis rocks, and Matoya. But
    Mabelle and I spent most of the day in bed; she suffering from
    a blow from the boom, which had produced slight concussion of
    the brain, and I having a wretched cold, which has been
    gradually getting worse the last few days, and which has quite
    taken away my voice.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, February 4th</i>.&mdash;It was blowing hard all
    day, raining, snowing, and sleeting. The scenery appeared to be
    pretty, and we passed through crowds of picturesque junks.</p>

    <p>At 4.25 we rounded Tomamgai Smia, and at 9 p.m. anchored off
    the town of Kobe, or Hiogo.</p>

    <p>These constant changes of names are very puzzling. Miaco and
    Yeddo, which we did know something about, are quite cut out,
    and replaced by Kioto and Tokio. Oddly enough, the same
    syllables, reversed, mean capital of the Western Empire and
    capital of the Eastern Empire respectively.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, February 5th</i>.&mdash;By seven o'clock a boat
    was alongside with letters from the Consul and Sir Harry
    Parkes, who had kindly made all the necessary arrangements for
    us to see the opening of the railway from Kobe
    <span class="pagenum">Page 334<a name="Page_334"
       id="Page_334"></a></span>to Kioto, and for the presentation
       of the gentlemen to the Mikado.</p>

    <p>It certainly was a great opportunity for seeing a Japanese
    holiday crowd, all dressed in their best. Thousands and
    thousands of people were in the streets, who, though naturally
    anxious to see as much as possible, behaved in the most quiet
    and orderly manner. The station was beautifully decorated with
    evergreens, camellias, and red berries. Outside there was a
    most marvellous pavilion, the woodwork of which had been
    entirely covered with evergreens, and ornamented with life-size
    dragons and phoenixes (the imperial insignia of Japan), all
    made in flowers. The roof was studded with large
    chrysanthemums&mdash;the private device of the Mikado, that of
    the Tycoon being three hollyhock leaves. The sides of the
    pavilion were quite open, the roof being simply supported on
    pillars; so that we could see everything that went on, both
    inside and out. The floor was covered with red cloth; the
    da&iuml;s with an extremely ugly Brussels carpet, with a large
    pattern. On this the Mikado's throne was placed, with a second
    canopy above it. Tom in R.N.R. uniform, the other gentlemen in
    evening dress, accompanied the Consul on to the platform to
    receive the Mikado; while the children and I went with Mrs.
    Annesley to seats reserved for the foreign representatives.
    There were not many Europeans present; but the platform was
    densely crowded with Japanese, sitting on their heels, and
    patiently waiting to see the extraordinary sight of their
    hitherto invisible spiritual Emperor brought to them by a steam
    engine on an iron road. The men had all had their heads fresh
    shaven, and their funny little pigtails rearranged for the
    occasion. The women's hair was elaborately and stiffly done up
    with light tortoiseshell combs and a large pin, and decorated
    with artificial flowers. Some of the children were gaily
    dressed in red and gold under garments, the prevailing colour
    of the costumes being dark blue, turned up with red. They also
    wore gay <span class="pagenum">Page 335<a name="Page_335"
       id="Page_335"></a></span>embroidered <i>obis</i>, or large
       sashes, which are put on in a peculiar fashion. They are of
       great width, and are fastened tightly round the waist, while
       an enormous bow behind reaches from between the shoulders to
       far below the hips. The garments fit tightly in front, while
       at the back they form a sort of huge bunch. On their
       high-heeled clogs the women walk with precisely the same
       gait as ladies in high-heeled boots. In fact, so exactly do
       the Japanese women (you never see Japanese <i>ladies</i>
       walking about in the streets) caricature the present
       fashionable style of dress in Europe, that I have formed a
       theory of my own on the subject, and this is it.</p>

    <p>Some three or four years ago, among other proposed reforms
    in Japan, the Ministers wished the Empress and her Court to be
    dressed in European fashion. Accordingly a French milliner and
    dressmaker, with her assistants, was sent for from Paris, and
    in due time arrived. The Empress and her ladies, however, would
    not change their style of dress. They knew better what suited
    them, and in my opinion they were very sensible. This is what I
    hear. Now what I think is, that the Parisienne, being of an
    enterprising turn of mind, thought that she would not take so
    long a journey for nothing&mdash;that if the Japanese ladies
    would not follow European fashions, at least European ladies
    should adopt the Japanese style. On her return to Paris I am
    convinced that she promulgated this idea, and gradually gave it
    effect. Hence the fashions of the last two years.</p>

    <p>Watching the crowd occupied the time in a most interesting
    manner, till the firing of guns and the playing of bands
    announced the arrival of the imperial train. The Mikado was
    received on the platform, and after a very short delay he
    headed the procession along the covered way on to the
    da&iuml;s.</p>

    <p>He is a young, not very good-looking man, with rather a
    sullen expression, and legs that look as though they
    <span class="pagenum">Page 336<a name="Page_336"
       id="Page_336"></a></span>did not belong to him&mdash;I
       suppose from using them so little, and sitting so much on
       his heels; for until the last few years the Mikado has
       always been considered far too sacred a being to be allowed
       to set foot on the earth. He was followed by his highest
       Minister, the foreign Ministers, and a crowd of Japanese
       dignitaries, all, with one or two exceptions, in European
       official dress, glittering with gold lace. I believe it was
       the first time that many of them had ever worn it. At any
       rate, they certainly had never learned to put it on
       properly. It would have driven to distraction the tailor who
       made them, to see tight-fitting uniforms either left
       unbuttoned altogether, or hooked askew from top to bottom,
       and to behold the trousers turned up and disfigured by the
       projecting tags of immense side-spring boots, generally put
       on the wrong feet. Some of the visitors had no gloves, while
       others wore them with fingers at least three inches too
       long. Certainly a court dresser as well as a court tailor
       ought to be appointed to the Mikado's establishment, before
       the European costume becomes generally adopted.</p>

    <p>I could not help thinking that the two or three old
    conservative Ministers who had stuck to their native dress must
    have congratulated themselves on their firmness, when they saw
    the effect of the unaccustomed garments upon their
    <i>confr&egrave;res</i>. The old court dress of the Daimios is
    very handsome, consisting of rich silks and brocades, with
    enormously long loose trousers trailing two or three feet on
    the ground, and with sleeves, like butterfly wings, of
    corresponding dimensions. A small high-peaked black cap is worn
    on the head, to accommodate the curious little cut-off pigtail,
    set up like a cock's comb, which appears to be one of the
    insignia of a Daimio's rank in Japan.</p>

    <p>As soon as the people had arranged themselves into three
    sides of a square, Sir Harry Parkes read an address, and
    presented his five compatriots to the Mikado, who replied in
    inaudible but no doubt suitable terms. Then the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 337<a name="Page_337"
       id="Page_337"></a></span>Governor of Kobe had to read an
       address, and I pitied the poor man from the bottom of my
       heart. His knees shook, his hands trembled, and his whole
       body vibrated to such an extent, that his cocked hat fell
       and rolled on the floor of the da&iuml;s, and finally hopped
       down the steps, while the address nearly followed its
       example. How thankful he must have felt when it was
       over!</p>

    <p>The proceedings in the pavilion being now at an end, the
    Mikado walked down the middle of the assembly, followed by all
    his Ministers in single file, on his way to the luncheon tent.
    After they had gone, we inspected the imperial railway
    carriage, the soldiers, guns, &amp;c., and just as we were
    leaving the station yard, to look at the daylight fireworks
    they were letting off in honour of the occasion, a salute
    announced the departure of the Mikado for Kioto.</p>

    <p>We lunched at the Consulate, our gentlemen changed to more
    comfortable attire, and then we went to see a Buddhist temple,
    supposed to be rather a fine specimen of woodwork. It is
    specially curious on account of some monkeys and a white horse,
    each kept in a sort of side shrine. Every worshipper at the
    temple stopped before these shrines, and for a small coin
    bought rice or beans to feed them with, through the priest.
    Whether it was an act of worship, or simply of kindness, I
    could not discover, though I paid several visits to the spot
    during our stay at Kobe.</p>

    <p>From the temple we went to the shops in the main street of
    Hiogo, and full of interest and temptation we found them. The
    town itself is quite Japanese, and consists, as usual, of
    wooden houses, narrow streets, and quaint shops. To-day all was
    <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>, in preparation for the illuminations
    to-night.</p>

    <p>Kobe, the foreign settlement, is, on the contrary, bran-new,
    spick and span, with a handsome parade, and grass and trees,
    planted boulevard fashion, along the edge of the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 338<a name="Page_338"
       id="Page_338"></a></span>sea. It is all remarkably clean,
       but quite uninteresting. To-night, however, it looked very
       well, illuminated by thousands and thousands of coloured
       paper lanterns, arranged in all sorts of fanciful devices.
       It was dark and clear, and there was no wind, so that
       everything went off well.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 6th</i>.&mdash;My cold being still bad,
    Mabelle by no means well yet, and Tom very busy, we at first
    thought of keeping quiet to-day. But our time is so short, that
    we could not afford to waste it; so half our party started
    early for Kioto, it being arranged that Tom and Mabelle should
    follow us by an early train to-morrow. It was a wet cheerless
    day, and the country did not look its best. Still, the novelty
    of the scenes around could not fail to make them interesting.
    The Japanese have an intense horror of rain, and it was
    ludicrous to see the peasants walking along with scarcely any
    clothes on except a pair of high clogs, a large hat, and a
    paper umbrella. We crossed several large bridges, stopped at a
    great many stations, where heaps of native travellers got in
    and out, and finally reached Kioto at half-past two o'clock. It
    was still raining, and all the <i>jinrikisha</i> men wore their
    large rain hats and rain cloaks, made either of reeds or of
    oiled paper. Most of the <i>jinrikishas</i>, too, had oiled
    paper hoods and aprons.</p>

    <p>The drive to our hotel, through long, narrow, crowded,
    picturesque streets, seemed long and wearisome. It was still a
    holiday, and remains of the previous night's illuminations were
    to be seen on all sides. The large paper lanterns still
    remained fastened to the high poles, <span class="pagenum">Page
    339<a name="Page_339"
       id="Page_339"></a></span>with an open umbrella at the top to
       afford protection from the rain.</p>

    <p>Kioto is a thoroughly Japanese town. I do not suppose it
    contains a single European resident; so that the manners and
    customs of the natives may be seen in perfection. Its theatres
    and jugglers are famous throughout Japan. In the suburb, where
    the two hotels are situated, stand numberless tea-houses and
    other places of entertainment. Our hotel is situated half-way
    up the hill called Maruyama.</p>

    <p>After about three-quarters of an hour's ride in the
    <i>jinrikiska</i>, we were deposited at the bottom of a flight
    of steps, which appeared to lead to a temple, but by which we
    reached the hotel in about five minutes. We were received by
    servants, who bowed to the ground, but who did not speak a word
    which we could understand. The rooms looked clean and
    comfortable, and the dining-room boasted a table and six
    chairs, besides several screens and <i>hibatchis</i>. The
    bedrooms, too, had beds, screens, and washstands; quite an
    unexpected luxury. Still more so was a strip of glass about
    half-way up the screens, through which we could admire the fine
    prospect. Anything in the shape of a transparent window is a
    complete novelty in a Japanese house, where, in winter, you
    feel as if you were imprisoned. The view from the verandah of
    the hotel over the pretty fantastic garden, the temple grounds,
    the town of Kioto, and the mountains in the distance was an
    endless source of delight to me.</p>

    <p>The servants soon produced a luncheon, excellently well
    cooked; and' directly we had finished it we sallied forth again
    to see what we could before dark. First we went to the temple
    of Gion, a fine building, standing in extensive grounds, and
    surrounded by smaller temples and houses for the priests. The
    Dutch envoys used to stay here when they were brought through
    the country, like prisoners, to pay their annual tribute for
    being allowed to <span class="pagenum">Page
    340<a name="Page_340"
       id="Page_340"></a></span>trade with Japan. They were
       subjected to all kinds of indignities, and used to be made
       to dance and sing, pretend to be drunk, and play all sorts
       of pranks, for the amusement of the whole court as well as
       for the Mikado and the empress, hidden behind a grating.</p>

    <p>From Gion we went to see other temples, and wandered about
    under the large conifers of all kinds, trying to find out the
    quarters of the British Legation for some time, until Sir Harry
    Parkes returned. The rooms at his residence were comfortable,
    but cold-looking, for mats and paper screens do not look nice
    in a frost. There were tables and chairs and paraffin lamps,
    but no bedsteads, only about a dozen cotton and silk quilts,
    some of which were supposed to serve as a couch, while others
    were to be used as coverings.</p>

    <p>Sir Harry has had, I fear, a great deal of trouble about the
    yacht. She is the first vessel of the kind ever seen in Japan,
    with the exception of the one sent out in 1858 as a present
    from the Queen to the then Tycoon, and now used by the Mikado.
    The officials, it seems, cannot make the 'Sunbeam' out. 'Is she
    a man-of-war? We know what that is.' 'No.' 'Is she a merchant
    ship?' 'No; she is a yacht.' But what can be the object of a
    vessel without guns is quite beyond their comprehension. At
    last it has been settled that, in order to be like other
    nations, the Japanese officials will not force us to enter at
    the Custom House, or to pay a fine of sixty dollars a day for
    not doing so. As a matter of precedent, it was important that
    the point should be settled, though I hardly imagine that many
    yachts will follow our example, and come out to Japan through
    the Straits of Magellan and across the Pacific.</p>

    <p>As it was now growing late, we returned to the hotel for
    dinner. The night was cold, and <i>hibatchis</i> and lamps
    alike failed to warm the thinly walled and paper-screened room.

    <p>Sir Harry Parkes came and spent the evening with us, and
    taught us more about Japan in two or three hours than we could
    have learned by much study of many books. The fact is, that in
    this fast-changing country guide-books get out of date in two
    or three years. Besides which, Sir Harry has been one of the
    chief actors in many of the most prominent events we have
    recently been reading about. To hear him describe graphically
    the wars of 1868, and the Christian persecutions in 1870, with
    the causes that led to the revolution, and the effect it has
    had on the country, was indeed interesting. Still more so was
    his account of his journey hither to force the newly emerged
    Mikado and his Ministers to sign the treaty, which had already
    received the assent (of course valueless) of the deposed
    Tycoon.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 7th</i>.&mdash;A misty but much
    warmer morning succeeded a wet night. At 8.30 Sir Harry Parkes
    and two other gentlemen arrived, and we all started at once in
    jinrikishas to see what could be seen in the limited time at
    our disposal. We went first to the temple of Gion Chiosiu,
    described elaborately in books by other travellers. It is
    specially interesting to Europeans, as it was the temple
    assigned to the foreign envoys when they paid their first visit
    to the Mikado in 1868. Sir Harry Parkes showed us all their
    apartments, and the large though subsidiary temple once used as
    a hospital, and we afterwards went to see the service performed
    in the temple. A dozen bonzes, or priests, were sitting round
    in a circle, chanting monotonously from ponderous volumes, with
    an occasional accompaniment from a gong or drum. Incense was
    being burned, vestments worn, processions formed, and prayers
    offered to Buddha to intercede with the Supreme Being. The
    accessories and surroundings were of course different, but the
    ceremonial struck me as being much the same as that in use at
    Roman Catholic places of worship. Mr. Simpson, however, thinks
    differently. He says:</p>

    <p>'I was only a month in Japan, and that is far too short
    <span class="pagenum">Page 342<a name="Page_342"
       id="Page_342"></a></span> a time for anything like serious
       study; but I was much struck by the temples, and I find I
       have some notes in my book comparing them with the Jewish.
       How any direct connection could possibly exist, is far
       beyond my powers of conjecture; but I will state the points
       of resemblance, and leave others to inquire further and
       collect additional information. Wood and bronze to this day
       furnish the material of which temples are constructed in
       Japan, with stone as a base. Such also were the materials of
       Solomon's temple. There are enclosures round each court or
       shrine, and sometimes these courts are three in number.
       Hills or groves are usually sites for a temple, the ascent
       to which is by a long flight of steps; usually two flights
       give access to the shrine. One is long, straight, and steep,
       for the men; the other, less steep, but curved, is for the
       women. It will be remembered that it was the great stairs at
       Solomon's temple that so impressed the Queen of Sheba. Small
       shrines or miniature temples, called Tenno Samma, or
       "Heaven's Lord," are carried on staves, like the Ark of the
       Covenant, at their religious ceremonies. The inner shrine,
       or Holy of Holies, is small, and a cube, or nearly so, in
       proportion. It is usually detached behind the other portions
       of the temple, the door being closed, so that it cannot be
       seen into, and it generally contains, not an image, but a
       tablet, or what the Japanese call a "Gohei," or piece of
       paper, cut so that it hangs down in folds on each side. In
       the early days of writing, a tablet was a book, a stylus the
       pen. The stone on which the law was inscribed was only a
       form of the book, and the Chinese ancestral tablet, or other
       tablet, in a temple, is only a variety of this book form.
       These "Goheis" are so common in Japan, and occupy so
       important a place in all their temples, that I had a great
       desire to know what they originally meant; but as on many
       questions of this kind I could get no information, the only
       suggestion which presented itself to me was, that it might
       be some form of the book, for the book was a very sacred
       <span class="pagenum">Page 343<a name="Page_343"
       id="Page_343"></a></span>thing in past time, and that which
       is yet called the "Ark," in a Jewish synagogue, contains now
       nothing but a book. There is a distinct priesthood who wear
       vestments, and they use incense, music, and bells. There are
       two religions in Japan, Buddhism and Shintooism; the latter
       being the primitive faith, and the former an importation
       from China. The forms of the two have become slightly mixed,
       both in the construction of their temples and in the
       ceremonial; but the remarks I have just made apply
       particularly to the Shintoo religion.'</p>

    <p>One of the late acts of the government has been to declare
    the Shintoo, as the old religion of the country, to be the only
    State faith. This is the disestablishment of Buddhism, but it
    does not imply its suppression. The Buddhist priests complain
    very much, saying that their temples are not now so popular,
    and many are being closed. Speculators are buying up their fine
    bronze bells, and sending them home to be coined into English
    pennies and halfpennies. Changes in faith present many strange
    aspects, and this is certainly a curious one.</p>

    <p>We strolled about the temple grounds, and ascended the hill
    to see the famous bell, which is the second biggest in Japan.
    The immense beam which strikes it was unlashed from the
    platform for our edification, and the bell sent forth a
    magnificent sound, pealing over the city and through the woods.
    At one of the gates there is a curious staircase, leading up to
    the top, and there, over the gate, is seated a figure of
    Buddha, surrounded by twelve disciples, all carved in wood and
    coloured. They are quite worth a scramble up to see.</p>

    <p>From Chiosiu we went right across the city to the temple of
    Nishni Hongangi. On our way we were more than once stopped and
    turned off the direct road, which was kept by soldiers for the
    passage of the Mikado to worship at the tombstone of his
    innumerable ancestors, real or imaginary. Being a spiritual
    Emperor, he has to be well <span class="pagenum">Page
    344<a name="Page_344"
       id="Page_344"></a></span>kept up to his religious duties,
       and is always being sent off to worship at some shrine or
       another, in order to maintain his popularity with the
       people, his Ministers meanwhile managing the affairs of
       state. Tanjo and Ikawura went off in haste to-day to Tokio,
       as there are rumours of a rebellion in the south.</p>

    <p>Nishni Hongangi is one of the largest and finest temples we
    have yet seen, even in spite of a large portion having been
    destroyed by the disastrous fire of 1864. The gates are
    splendidly ornamented, with carved chrysanthemum flowers. The
    centre temple is very fine, and is surrounded by smaller rooms,
    all decorated by the best Japanese artists of about two hundred
    years ago. Notice had been sent that the English Minister was
    coming with a party of friends, and everything had accordingly
    been prepared for our reception. In some places they had even
    put down carpets, to obviate the necessity of our having to
    take off our boots. The Abbot was out, which I much regretted,
    for he belongs to the Montos, the most advanced sect of
    Buddhism, and has more than once remarked to English visitors
    that he thought their own principles were so enlightened that
    they were paving the way for a higher form of religion, in the
    shape of Christianity&mdash;rather a startling confession to
    come from the lips of a Buddhist priest.</p>

    <p>After spending a long time among the paintings,
    wood-carvings, lacquers, bronzes, and gardens, we left the
    temple, and crossed several court-yards, before the main street
    was reached. Then, after a short walk, we came to another
    beautiful garden, laid out like a miniature park, with lakes,
    bridges, rocks, streams, canals, pavilions, &amp;c. All these
    surround a house built by the celebrated Tycoon, Tako Sama, in
    the fifteenth century. Here, again, everything was prepared for
    our reception. Fires were lighted, flowers arranged, carpets
    laid down, and fruit and cakes placed in readiness, with
    <i>hibatchis</i> to warm each and all of us. We went all over
    the house, which differs little from a Japanese
    <span class="pagenum">Page 345<a name="Page_345"
       id="Page_345"></a></span>house of the present day, except
       that a higher style of art was employed in its construction
       and decoration.</p>

    <p>From here we went to quite another quarter of the city to
    see what was formerly the Tycoon's palace, now used as a sort
    of police office. It is built on the same plan of three
    enclosures as all the <i>yashgis</i>, though on a very
    different scale from the one at Tokio. There, the Tycoon reigns
    in undisturbed sovereignty. Here, he appears as a humble
    servant of his rightful master&mdash;really his prisoner. The
    late Tycoon, after the last battle, fought at this place, fled
    to his castle at Osaka, where, though he might have held out
    for an indefinite period, he preferred to surrender. Two of his
    Ministers came to him and represented that he must not only
    think of himself, but of the party who supported the Shogunate,
    and that as he had betrayed them by false hopes he had no
    choice but to perform Hara-kiru. This he refused to do,
    although they set him the example; and he is now living as a
    private individual on an estate in the country, not far from
    Tokio, where he amuses himself with hunting, shooting, and
    fishing. It is said that it is possible he may one day join the
    ministry of the present Mikado.</p>

    <p>From the Tycoon's palace we drove to the 'Toshio,' or court
    quarter of the town, where the Mikado and all his relatives
    live, in palaces, surrounded by large gardens, enclosed in
    whitewashed walls. We saw the whole of Tako Sama's household
    furniture and wearing apparel, the celebrated swords of
    Yoritiome, called the 'knee-cutter' and the 'beard-cutter,'
    from their wonderful sharpness, and many other interesting
    objects.</p>

    <p>Here we said good-bye to Sir Harry Parkes, and returned
    across the town by another route to our hotel to lunch, after
    which we made another expedition to one or two more temples,
    and then to a pawnbroker's shop, in the heart of the city,
    which had been strongly recommended to us. The exterior did not
    look promising; the <span class="pagenum">Page
    346<a name="Page_346"
       id="Page_346"></a></span> shop itself was small and dirty;
       and they had to take some very filthy garments out of the
       way before we could enter. Once inside, however, it was a
       very different story. They showed us splendid old
       embroideries, and quantities of second-hand court dresses,
       embroidered in gold, silver, and colours, with exquisite
       designs. The Empress has thirteen ladies of honour, who wear
       their best dresses only twice, and then sell them: hence the
       pawnbrokers abundant stock.</p>

    <p>Wherever we went a large but perfectly civil crowd followed
    us, and people ran on before to tell others to come to their
    doors and look at us, though we were under the charge of an
    officer and two men. It was now getting dark, and we were very
    tired; so we at last turned back, and once more climbed those
    weary steps to our hotel. To-night there is some
    <i>f&ecirc;te</i> going on in this suburb, and the whole place
    is alive with lights, dancing, music, and tum-tums.</p>

    <p>After dinner all our purchases arrived, each accompanied by
    at least four or five men. Other people had heard of our visit,
    and had brought more things for us to look at; so that the room
    soon resembled a bazaar. At last we got rid of them, having
    settled that they should pack our things and take them down to
    Kobe, where they would be paid for. The Japanese shopkeepers,
    though difficult to deal with, are incorruptible when once the
    bargain is made. They pack most carefully, frequently adding
    boxes, bags, and baskets, not originally included in the
    purchase, in order that the articles may travel more safely.
    The smallest article is sure to be put in, and the greatest
    care is taken of everything, even if they know you do not mean
    to open the cases for months.</p>

    <p>If it were only warmer, how delightful it would all be! The
    cold spoils everything to a certain extent. At night we have to
    choose whether to be half frozen in our beds, or stifled with
    the fumes of charcoal from the <i>hibatchis</i>.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 347<a name="Page_347"
       id="Page_347"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Thursday, February 8th</i>.&mdash;The sunrise over the
    city, with the river and mountains beyond, was superb. We
    breakfasted at eight; but even by that hour the courtyard and
    passage were crowded with vendors of curiosities of all sorts,
    and no doubt great bargains might have been picked up. But we
    had no time to lose, for our train started at 9.30, and we had
    a delightfully rapid drive to the station through the sunny
    streets of Kioto.</p>

    <p>Arrived at Kobe, we went first to lunch with some friends,
    and immediately after hastened on board to receive the foreign
    Ministers and other friends; and did not land again that
    evening.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, February 9th</i>.&mdash;We left by ten o'clock
    train for Osaka, which has been called the Venice of Japan. It
    is intersected by innumerable rivers and canals, and boats were
    continually making their appearance at points where they were
    least expected, as our <i>jinrikisha</i> men hurried us along
    the narrow and not very sweet-smelling streets. We went so fast
    that, more than once before we reached the Mint, I thought we
    should have been tipped into one of the canals, as we turned a
    sharp corner. Our men upset the baskets and stalls that
    encroached on the road, in the most unceremonious manner; but
    their proprietors did not seem to mind, many of them quietly
    moving their wares out of the way as they heard the shouts that
    announced our approach. The smell in the fish-market was
    disgusting, and enough to poison the air for miles around, but
    the people did not seem to mind it in the least.</p>

    <p>At last we left the river and town, and, climbing a slight
    eminence, crossed the first moat by a stone bridge, and reached
    the guard-house on the other side. There was some hesitation at
    first about admitting us; but it was soon overcome. This
    castle, the last stronghold of the Tycoon, is built on exactly
    the same plan as the <i>yashgis</i> we had already visited, but
    much stronger, being composed of enormous blocks of stone. One
    wonders how human <span class="pagenum">Page
    348<a name="Page_348"
       id="Page_348"></a></span>labour could ever have transported
       them from their quarry to this place, for some measured 40
       ft. long by 20 ft. high. We crossed the three moats and the
       three enclosures, now all full of barracks and soldiers. In
       the very centre, the old well and a little square tower are
       still standing, part of the Tycoon's original residence,
       which was destroyed by fire. The view from the top over the
       town and surrounding country is very fine. You can see
       countless streams coming from the mountains, and flowing
       into Odawarra, on which Osaka is situated. The course of the
       river itself could be traced to the bay; and the line of
       coast to Kobe, and the far-off mountains in the Inland Sea
       were plainly visible.</p>

    <p>On returning to the Mint we found luncheon awaiting us, and
    afterwards spent a pleasant time looking at a wonderful
    collection of curios.</p>

    <p>The Imperial Mint of Japan is a large handsome building, in
    great force just now, for the whole of the old money is being
    called in and replaced by the government. The contrast between
    the two moneys is very great. The ancient coinage consisted of
    long thin oval obangs and shobangs, worth from two dollars to
    eighteen pounds each, square silver itzeboos, and square copper
    pieces, with a hole in the centre; while that which is taking
    its place is similar to European coinage, and is marked in
    English characters, and ornamented with Japanese devices, such
    as the phoenix and the dragon. It did not seem worth while to
    go minutely over the Mint, as it is arranged on exactly the
    same principle as the one in London, and the processes are
    carried out in the same manner.</p>

    <p>Osaka used to be the emporium of all the inland commerce,
    and was considered the pearl of Japanese cities. After the
    revolution, and when the Mint was built, there was some
    intention of making it the capital of the empire. That idea
    was, however, abandoned; and the inconvenience of having the
    Mint so far away from the seat of government is
    <span class="pagenum">Page 349<a name="Page_349"
       id="Page_349"></a></span>greatly felt, all the bullion
       having to be sent backwards and forwards at great expense by
       sea. Commerce has now almost deserted Osaka, owing to the
       difficulty experienced by large ships in anchoring near the
       town, and the impossibility of their crossing the bar. The
       foreign consuls and representatives have all left the place
       for the newly established settlement at Kobe, where they
       feel safer, with men-of-war at anchor just under their
       windows.</p>

    <p>There was just time to go round some of the old streets, and
    to some of the shops, before the hour by which we were due at
    the station. Osaka is famous for its waxworks and theatres.
    Five of the best of these have, however, been burnt down within
    the last eighteen months, with terrible loss of life. We heard
    that a short time ago there was nearly being serious trouble,
    in consequence of one of the managers having produced on the
    stage, in a most objectionable manner, a representation of the
    cruel and unprovoked assassination of an officer and two men,
    part of a boat's crew of a French ship. The English and French
    consuls went to the governor of the town, who promised that the
    piece should be stopped, and the obnoxious placards announcing
    the performance removed at once. But his instructions were not
    complied with, for the next day the piece was again performed,
    and the placards were still there. Some French sailors, luckily
    accompanied <span class="pagenum">Page 350<a name="Page_350"
       id="Page_350"></a></span> by their officers, saw the latter
       and wanted to tear them down; but they were persuaded to
       wait while the consuls were telegraphed for. They came at
       once, and again saw the governor, who sent some soldiers to
       stop the play and remove the bills; and so the affair ended
       peaceably.</p>

    <p>We reached Kobe about seven o'clock, and went on board at
    once to dinner.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, February 10th</i>.&mdash;We were to have gone
    early this morning to Arrima, a village in the mountains,
    situated among groves of bamboos, where there are mineral
    springs and a hot-water bath, in which people bathe in the old
    style. But the weather was impossibly bad for our intended
    expedition, with showers of snow and sleet. We waited till
    half-past eleven, and then landed and talked of going to Osaka
    again by train; but finally decided that even this was not
    practicable, and that we had better stay and potter about at
    Kobe and Hiogo. The children set out to buy toys, whilst I went
    with a lady to pay another visit to the white horse and monkeys
    at the temple, and then walked on to a waterfall, prettily
    situated in a ravine, a little way behind the town. We
    afterwards visited several pawnbrokers' shops, at all of which
    there was something interesting to be seen. Many are perfect
    museums; but their proprietors never seem to care much to show
    you what they have, unless you are accompanied by a resident or
    some one they know. Then they invite you into the iron
    fire-proof 'godown' or store, at the back, and out of funny
    little boxes and bags and parcels produce all sorts of rare and
    curious things which have been sent to them to be sold, or
    which they may possibly have bought themselves. It is not of
    the slightest use to go to the large shops, full of things, if
    you want anything really good, for you will only find there
    articles specially prepared for the European and American
    market.</p>

    <p>I am very glad to hear that Dr. Dresser is here, collecting,
    lecturing, and trying to persuade the Japanese to
    <span class="pagenum">Page 351<a name="Page_351"
       id="Page_351"></a></span>adhere to their own forms and taste
       in art and decoration. It is a great pity to observe the
       decadence of native art, and at the same time to see how
       much better the old things are than the new. A true Japanese
       artist never repeats himself, and consequently never makes
       an exact pair of anything. His designs agree generally, and
       his vases are more or less alike, without being a precise
       match. He throws in a spray of flowers, a bird, or a fan, as
       the fancy strikes him, and the same objects are therefore
       never placed in exactly the same relative position. Modern
       articles are made precisely alike, not only in pairs, but by
       the dozen and the hundred.</p>

    <p>There are beautiful bantams to be seen in some of the shops
    here; but they cannot be bought, as they are private pets. They
    seem generally very small, and one I saw to-day had his head
    far behind his tail, which divided in the middle outwards, and
    fell forward on either side of his neck in the most
    extraordinary way. How he picked up his food and got through
    life, I am sure I don't know. There are plenty of little
    Japanese dogs; but they are not seen to advantage this cold
    weather, and there would be great difficulty in getting them
    home.</p>

    <p>I bought some fine bantams at Yokohama, and a whole cage
    full of rice-birds. They are the dearest little things, and
    spend most of the day bathing and twittering, occasionally
    getting all together into one nest, with their twenty-five
    heads peeping out. They are exactly like a magnified grain of
    rice, with legs and a bill. I hope I shall take them home
    alive, as they have borne the cold very well so far. We have
    also some mandarin ducks on board, and some gold and silver
    fish with two tails. Our sailors have over a hundred birds of
    their own, which never appear on deck, except on very sunny
    days. I don't know where they can keep them, unless they stow
    them away in their Japanese cabinets.</p>

    <p>We went on board about dark, and a few friends came to
    dinner. <span class="pagenum">Page 352<a name="Page_352"
       id="Page_352"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Sunday, February 11th</i>.&mdash;About 7 a.m., two
    Japanese officers came on board with a message which nobody
    could understand. When we went on deck, we saw that all the
    ships were dressed, and concluded that we had been asked to do
    the same; but we thought it better to send ashore to ascertain
    positively. The next difficulty was to get a Japanese flag. Tom
    went on board the 'Thabor,' a Japanese ship, to borrow one, and
    found everything was in bustle and confusion, news having
    arrived from Kiusiu that the rebels were mustering in great
    force, and that they had seized some ships. The 'Thabor,' 'Mihu
    Maru,' and three others, are therefore to go through the Inland
    Sea to Nagasaki this afternoon.</p>

    <p>The Japanese admiral sent word early this morning that he
    would come on board at two o'clock with some of his captains,
    and the French admiral also expressed a hope that it would be
    convenient to receive him and his captains at three. Their
    visits occupied nearly all the afternoon. We afterwards landed
    with the French admiral, paid some farewell visits, and went to
    look at a collection of old lacquer and Satsuma china, before
    we returned to the yacht.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, February 12th</i>.&mdash;Fires were lighted at 4
    a.m., and by six we were steaming slowly out of the beautiful
    bay of Kobe. It was a cold bright morning, with a strong head
    wind, increasing every moment as we proceeded, until, in the
    straits of Akashi, it became almost impossible to make any way
    against it. There was not much sea, but the wind impeded our
    progress so much, that it was at last reduced to one mile
    instead of nine an hour. The straits are very fine, and the old
    castle presents an admirable specimen of the architecture of a
    Daimio's residence.</p>

    <p>We proceeded across the Harima Nada, where we were more or
    less exposed to the open sea, and where we took more water on
    board than we had done in the gale before arriving at Yokohama.
    There were no big waves, but we rolled tremendously, and the
    spray came over us, though the mere force of the wind seemed to
    keep the sea down.</p>

    <p>After struggling until twelve o'clock, and having done but
    little good for the last three hours, Tom determined to run
    back, and in a short time we found ourselves once more at
    anchor in the harbour of Kobe. It was a work of considerable
    difficulty, owing to the strong wind and tide, to steer
    <span class="pagenum">Page 354<a name="Page_354"
       id="Page_354"></a></span>safely among the numerous vessels,
       and for a few minutes we thought we were aground, as we did
       not make the slightest progress, though the engines were
       working ahead full speed. The proveedor's boat came out to
       us as soon as we were perceived, and we landed in her; but
       it was as much as the six stout oarsmen could do to make way
       against the wind.</p>

    <p>We went for a walk, or rather a scramble, to the waterfall,
    half-way up to the Temple of the Moon. Much of the ground was
    covered with snow, the streams were frozen at the sides, and
    there were hanging icicles to be seen, six feet in length; and
    yet on either side were camellias and tea-trees covered with
    red and white blossoms, orange-trees, laden with fruit;
    gold-fish swimming about in ponds, overhung with maidenhair
    fern, besides pteris and hothouse ferns, shaded by bamboos,
    palms, and castor-oil plants. The order of vegetation seems to
    be as much reversed as everything else in this strange country.
    In England all those plants would require conservatories, or at
    least sheltered spots, and the greatest care, instead of being
    exposed to frost and snow.</p>

    <p>Getting on board again was even a more difficult business
    than landing had been; but we arrived at last without
    mishap.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 13th</i>.&mdash;The wind dropped at
    sunset, and as it continued calm all night, Tom ordered fires
    to be lighted at 4 a.m. By six o'clock, however, it was blowing
    harder than ever, and we therefore decided to make an excursion
    to Arrima instead of attempting another start.</p>

    <p>We went ashore to make the necessary arrangements, and it
    was settled that we should start at ten o'clock, which we did,
    with the Consulate constable as our guide.</p>

    <p>We had three men to each <i>jinrikisha</i>, and went along
    at a merry pace through the long straggling towns of Kobe and
    Hiogo. The cold was intense, and before we started our poor
    <i>jinrikisha</i> men were shivering until they nearly shook
    <span class="pagenum">Page 355<a name="Page_355"
       id="Page_355"></a></span>us out of the vehicles. Soon they
       were streaming with perspiration, and at our first
       halting-place they took off almost all their garments,
       though it was as much as we could do to keep warm in our
       furs and wraps. We waited while they partook copiously of
       hot tea and bowls of rice, and bought new straw shoes, or
       rather sandals, for less than a farthing a pair.</p>

    <p>To-day being the Japanese New Year's Day, all the little
    shrines in the houses and along the road were prettily
    decorated, and had offerings of rice, <i>saki</i>, and fruit
    deposited upon them. The spirits of the departed are supposed
    to come down and partake, not of the things themselves, but of
    the subtle invisible essence that rises from them. The road now
    became very pretty, winding through the valleys, climbing up
    and dipping down the various hills, and passing through
    picturesque villages, where all the people, leaving their meals
    or their games, came out to look at us, while some of the
    children scampered on to secure a good view of the foreigners,
    and others ran away frightened and screaming. They were all
    dressed in dark blue clothes, turned up with red, with bright
    embroidered <i>obis</i> and flowers in their elaborately
    dressed hair. I have managed to get some dolls' wigs, which
    give a good idea of the various styles of hair-dressing.</p>

    <p>In rather more than three hours we reached Arrima, a village
    far more beautifully situated than any we had seen, in the very
    centre of the mountains, where a dozen valleys converge into
    one centre. On one side are mineral springs, on the other a
    river. Bamboos grow luxuriantly on all sides, and the
    inhabitants of the various valleys obtain their livelihood by
    manufacturing from them all sorts of articles: boxes for every
    conceivable purpose; baskets, fine and coarse, large and small,
    useful and ornamental, coloured and plain; brushes, pipes,
    battledores and shuttlecocks, sticks, spoons, knives and forks,
    sauce ladles, boats, lamps, cradles, &amp;c.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 356<a name="Page_356"
       id="Page_356"></a></span></p>

    <p>The first glimpse of the village is lovely; that from the
    bridge that crosses the river is still more so. We clambered up
    narrow streets, with quaint carved houses and overhanging
    balconies, till we reached a tea-house, kept by a closely
    shaven bonze, or priest. He seemed very pleased to see us, and
    bowed and shook hands over and over again. He placed his whole
    house at our disposal, and a very clean, pretty, and
    well-arranged house it was, with a lovely little formal garden,
    ornamented with mimic temples and bridges of ice, fashioned by
    the hard frost, with but little assistance from the hand of
    man. Bits of wood and stone, a few graceful fern-leaves and
    sprays of bamboo, and a trickling stream of water produced the
    most fairy-like crystalline effects imaginable. If only some
    good fairy could, with a touch of her wand, preserve it all
    intact until a few months hence, what a delight it would be in
    the hot summer weather!</p>

    <p>To-day the paper house was indeed cold; but even so slight a
    shelter from the bitter wind was acceptable, though we
    regretted the screens could not be opened to enable us to
    admire the prospect on all sides. The luncheon basket being
    quickly unpacked, the good priest warmed our food and produced
    a bottle of port wine, which he mulled for our benefit. Cheered
    and refreshed we proceeded on our way, leaving him much
    delighted with what seemed to us but a small recompense for his
    courtesy.</p>

    <p>Every house and shop in those narrow picturesque streets was
    a study in itself, and so were the quaint groups of people we
    met, and who gazed eagerly at us. We looked into the public
    baths, two oblong tanks, into which the mineral springs came
    bubbling up, thick and yellow, and strongly impregnated with
    iron, at a temperature of 112&deg;. They are covered in, and
    there is a rough passage round them. Here, in the bathing
    season, people of both sexes stand in rows, packed as tight as
    herrings in a barrel, and there are just as many outside
    waiting their turn to <span class="pagenum">Page
    357<a name="Page_357"
       id="Page_357"></a></span>enter. To-day there were only two
       bathers, immersed up to their chins in the steaming water.
       They had left all their clothes at home, and would shortly
       have to pass through the streets without any covering,
       notwithstanding the cold.</p>

    <p>From the baths we went to some of the best basket shops,
    where the beauty and cheapness of the articles exposed for sale
    offered great temptations. We had to disturb our
    <i>jinrikiska</i> men, who were enjoying their frugal meal at a
    separate tea-house. It was beautifully served, and as clean and
    nicely cooked as possible, though consisting of viands which we
    might not have fancied, such as various kinds of fish, seaweed,
    sea-snails (<i>b&ecirc;che de mer</i>), and rice. Each man had
    his own little table and eight or ten separate dishes, a bottle
    of <i>saki</i>, tea-pipe, and <i>hibatchi</i>, arranged exactly
    as ours had been at the tea-house at Yokohama. How well they
    managed their chop-sticks, how quickly they shovelled the food
    down, and how clean they left each dish! Habit is
    everything.</p>

    <p>We were anxious to make the best of our way home, and
    starting at four, with but a short stop at the halfway
    tea-house, <span class="pagenum">Page 358<a name="Page_358"
       id="Page_358"></a></span>we reached the hotel soon after
       seven, having taken less than an hour to come five miles
       over a very bad road, an inch deep in mud. So much for a
       'man-power carriage,' the literal translation of the word
       <i>jinrikisha</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18"
       id="FNanchor_18_18">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_18_18"
       class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Soon after an excellent dinner we
       returned on board, so as to be ready for an early start
       to-morrow morning.</p>

    <div class="footnote">

           <a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
           Or 'pull-man-car,' as it is sometimes called.</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 14th</i>.&mdash;We were called at 4
    a.m. Fires were lighted, but before steam was up the wind had
    risen; so our start was once more postponed to the afternoon.
    We steamed out to the buoy, from among the shipping, in order
    to be able to get away more easily at night. The wind generally
    goes down at sunset, and Tom hoped that, by taking our
    departure then, we should get through the worst part of the
    Inland Sea before the wind again rose with the sun.</p>

    <p>After breakfast we went ashore, and dispersed in different
    directions, to meet again at the hotel for luncheon. Then we
    all again separated, the children going to the circus, whilst I
    took a drive, with a pair of black and white Hakodadi ponies,
    to the foot of the hills behind the town.</p>

    <p>It was a pleasant circuit by pretty valleys, and brought us
    back to the town by a different road. I went to pick up the
    children at the circus, and found them just coming out, with
    delighted faces, having most thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
    They went on board to tea, but Mabelle and I went with the
    Consul in <i>jinrikishas</i> to a Japanese theatre at Hiogo.
    The streets were crowded with holiday-makers; for to-day is the
    first of the Chinese new year, as yesterday was the first of
    the Japanese new year. The floor of the theatre was crowded
    with people, all squatting on their heels, each with his or her
    chow-chow box and <i>hibatchi</i> or brazier of burning
    charcoal to keep themselves warm. The performance frequently
    goes on for ten or twelve hours, with short intervals and whole
    families come and take up their abode at the theatre for twelve
    hours at a <span class="pagenum">Page 359<a name="Page_359"
       id="Page_359"></a></span>time. The acting was not at all
       bad, and the performers were beautifully dressed.</p>

    <p>We did not stay very long at the theatre, but were soon
    tearing back again through the streets to the Consulate. These
    quick rides in a <i>jinrikisha</i>, especially at night, are
    very amusing. You have the pleasure of going at a high speed,
    and yet, being on a level with the people, you can see much
    more of them and of their manners than would be possible in a
    carriage.</p>

    <p>When we reached the Consulate we found the chief of the
    police of the foreign settlement waiting for the Consul, to
    inform him that Japanese soldiers were patrolling the town with
    fixed bayonets, alleging that information had been sent to the
    Governor that some of the rebels were in the hills at the back
    of the town, and might appear at any moment. The ships-of-war
    were to be communicated with at once for the protection of the
    inhabitants. They do not expect a general attack here, but seem
    to think the rebels' plan is to creep up by degrees to Osaka,
    where the Mikado is shortly expected to stay, and take
    possession of his person and the imperial treasure at one
    blow.</p>

    <p>When I got on board the 'Sunbeam' again, I found that steam
    was up and all was ready for starting; but the wind was still
    strong against us, and it was evidently necessary again to wait
    until four o'clock to-morrow morning.</p>

    <p>We were rolling a good deal, and, coming along the
    engine-room passage, my foot slipped, a door banged to, and my
    thumb was caught in the hinge and terribly crushed. Dressing it
    was a very painful affair, as the doctor had to ascertain
    whether the bone was broken, and I fainted during the
    operation. At last I was carried to my cabin and put to bed,
    after taking a strong dose of chloral to soothe the agonising
    pain.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, February 15th</i>.&mdash;I wonder if anybody
    who has not experienced it can realise the stupefying, helpless
    sensation of being roused up from a sound sleep, in the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 360<a name="Page_360"
       id="Page_360"></a></span>middle of the night, on board ship,
       by the cry of 'Fire!' and finding oneself enveloped in a
       smoke so dense as to render everything invisible.</p>

        <a href="images/375.gif">View full size illustration.</a>
    </div>

    <p>At 2.30 a.m. I was awakened by a great noise and a loud cry
    of 'The ship is on fire!' followed by Mr. Bingham rushing into
    our cabin to arouse us. At first I could hardly realise where
    we were, or what was happening, as I was half stupid with
    chloral, pain, and smoke, which was issuing from each side of
    the staircase in dense volumes. My first thought was for the
    children, but I found they had not been forgotten. Rolled up in
    blankets, they were already in transit to the deck-house. In
    the meantime Mr. Bingham had drenched the flames with every
    available jug of water, and Tom had roused the crew, and made
    them screw the hose on to the pump. They were afraid to open
    the hatches, to discover where the fire was, until the hose and
    <i>extincteurs</i> were ready to work, as they did not know
    whether or not the hold was on fire, and the whole ship might
    burst <span class="pagenum">Page 361<a name="Page_361"
       id="Page_361"></a></span>into a blaze the moment the air was
       admitted. Allen soon appeared with an <i>extincteur</i> on
       his back, and the mate with the hose. Then the cupboard in
       Mr. Bingham's room was opened, and burning cloaks, dresses,
       boxes of curios, portmanteaus, &amp;c., were hauled out,
       and, by a chain of men, sent on deck, where they were
       drenched with sea-water or thrown overboard. Moving these
       things caused the flames to increase in vigour, and the
       <i>extincteur</i> was used freely, and with the greatest
       success. It is an invaluable invention, especially for a
       yacht, where there are so many holes and corners which it
       would be impossible to reach by ordinary means. All this
       time the smoke was pouring in volumes from the cupboard on
       the other side, and from under the nursery fireplace. The
       floors were pulled up, and the partitions were pulled down,
       until at last the flames were got under. The holds were next
       examined. No damage had been done there; but the cabin floor
       was completely burnt through, and the lead from the nursery
       fireplace was running about, melted by the heat.</p>

    <p>The explanation of the cause of the fire is very simple.
    Being a bitterly cold night, a roaring fire had been made up in
    the nursery, but about half-past ten the servants thought it
    looked rather dangerous and raked it out. The ashpan was not
    large enough, however, to hold the hot embers, which soon made
    the tiles red-hot. The woodwork caught fire, and had been
    smouldering for hours, when the nurse fortunately woke and
    discovered the state of affairs. She tried to rouse the other
    maids, but they were stupefied with the smoke, and so she
    rushed off at once to the doctor and Mr. Bingham. The former
    seized a child under each arm, wrapped them in blankets, and
    carried them off to the deck-house, Mabelle and the maids
    following, with more blankets and rugs, hastily snatched up.
    The children were as good as possible. They never cried nor
    made the least fuss, but composed themselves in the deck-house
    to sleep for the remainder of the <span class="pagenum">Page
    362<a name="Page_362"
       id="Page_362"></a></span> night, as if it were all a matter
       of course. When I went to see them, little Muriel remarked:
       'If the yacht is on fire, mamma, had not baby and I better
       get our ulsters, and go with Emma in the boat to the hotel,
       to be out of the way?' It is the third time in their short
       lives that they have been picked out of bed in the middle of
       the night and carried off in blankets away from a fire, so I
       suppose they are getting quite used to it.</p>

    <p>There can be no doubt that the preservation of the yacht
    from very serious damage, if not from complete destruction, was
    due to the prompt and efficient manner in which the
    <i>extincteurs</i> were used. It was not our first experience
    of the value of this invention; for, not very long before we
    undertook our present expedition, a fire broke out in our house
    in London, on which occasion the <i>extincteurs</i> we
    fortunately had at hand rendered most excellent service in
    subduing the flames.</p>

    <p>By half-past three all danger was past, and we began to
    settle down again, though it took a long time to get rid of the
    smoke.</p>

    <p>At four o'clock we weighed anchor, and once more made a
    start from Kobe, and passed through the Straits of Akashi. The
    wind was dead ahead, but not so strong as when we made our
    previous attempts. It was bitterly cold, the thermometer, in a
    sheltered place, being only one degree above freezing, and the
    breeze from the snowy mountains cutting like a knife.</p>

    <p>We were all disappointed with our sail to-day; perhaps
    because we had heard so much of the extreme beauty of the
    scenery, and this is not the best time of year for seeing it.
    The hills are all brown, instead of being covered with
    luxuriant vegetation, and all looked bleak and barren, though
    the outlines of the mountain ranges were very fine. We were
    reminded of the west coast of Scotland, the Lofoden Islands in
    the Arctic Circle, and the tamer portions of the scenery of the
    Straits of Magellan. <span class="pagenum">Page
    363<a name="Page_363"
       id="Page_363"></a></span></p>

    <p>After passing through the Straits, we crossed the Harima
    Nada&mdash;rather a wider portion of the sea&mdash;and then
    entered the intricate channels among the islands once more.
    There are three thousand of them altogether, so one may take it
    for granted that the navigation is by no means easy. The
    currents and tides are strong, sunken rocks are frequent, and
    the greatest care is requisite. Indeed, many people at Yokohama
    urged Tom to take a pilot.</p>

    <p>We had one lovely view in the afternoon of the island of
    Yoken San, with its snowy mountain at the back, and a pretty
    little village, with a few picturesque junks in the foreground.
    The yacht passed between Oki Sama and Le Sama, steering
    straight for the cone-shaped little island of Odutsi. Towards
    dusk we made the light of Nabae Sinaon Yo Sina, and, steering
    past it, had to take several sharp and awkward turns, to avoid
    two reefs off Siyako and Usi Suria. Thus we threaded the St.
    Vincent's Channel, and, avoiding the Conqueror bank by another
    sharp turn, dropped anchor at Imo Ura, in Hurusima, precisely
    at 8.30 p.m. Tom had been on the look-out since 5 a.m., and we
    were all more or less worn out with the fatigue and excitement
    of last night. <span class="pagenum">Page 364<a name="Page_364"
       id="Page_364"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Friday, February 16th</i>.&mdash;Off again at 4 a.m. The
    scenery was much finer than yesterday, and the wind not quite
    so bitterly cold.</p>

    <p>About 11 a.m. I heard a hurrying to and fro, and once more
    the cry of 'Fire!' This time it was in the store-room that it
    broke out. The iron plates on which the saloon and galley
    grates are fixed had become red-hot, and the wooden deck below
    had consequently caught fire. The boxes on both sides,
    containing the stores, were in flames; but they were quickly
    removed, water was poured down, and the second and third fires
    were thus soon extinguished.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, February 17th</i>.&mdash;At 3.15 a.m. we began
    to slow; at 3.45 the anchor was dropped near the lighthouse of
    Isaki, and we waited until daylight before proceeding through
    the Straits of Simono-seki. About nine o'clock a fresh start
    was made, under steam, but before long the wind freshened, and
    as soon as the anchorage near the town was reached we let go
    once more, near two men-of-war, who had preceded us from Kobe,
    but who were now wind-bound, like ourselves.</p>

    <p>To our astonishment, we also saw a large ship from Nova
    Scotia at anchor, the 'Mary Fraser,' although this is not a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 365<a name="Page_365"
       id="Page_365"></a></span>free port, nor within treaty
       limits. The gig was lowered at once, and we rowed alongside
       to gain what intelligence could be learned, as well as to
       ascertain what likelihood there might be of our obtaining
       fresh supplies here. The captain was very civil and kind,
       and volunteered to go on shore with us and act as our
       interpreter. We landed opposite a large teahouse, where we
       were immediately surrounded by a crowd of Japanese, who
       stared at us eagerly and even touched us, only through
       curiosity. They pursued us wherever we went, and when we
       entered a tea-house or shop the whole crowd immediately
       stopped, and if we retired to the back they surged all over
       the front premises, and penetrated into the interior as far
       as they could. A most amusing scene took place at one of the
       tea-houses, where we went to order some provisions for the
       yacht. It was rather a tedious process, and when we came out
       of the back room we found the whole of the front of the
       place filled by a gaping, curious crowd. The proprietor
       suggested that they should retire at once, and an abrupt
       retreat immediately took place, the difficulties of which
       were greatly augmented by the fact that every one had left
       his high wooden shoes outside, along the front of the house.
       The street was ankle deep in mud and half-melted snow, into
       which they did not like to venture in their stockings; but
       how the owners of two or three hundred pairs of clogs,
       almost exactly alike, ever found their own property again I
       do not understand, though they managed to clear out very
       quickly. I believe Muriel and I were the chief objects of
       attraction. They told us that no European lady or child had
       ever been at Simono-seki before. It is not a treaty port, so
       no one is allowed to land, except from a man-of-war, without
       special permission, which is not often given; it is,
       besides, the key to the Inland Sea, and the authorities are
       very jealous about any one seeing the forts. There is only
       one European resident here, connected with the telegraph;
       and a dull time he must have of it. The wire crosses the
       Straits a few miles higher up. <span class="pagenum">Page
       366<a name="Page_366"
       id="Page_366"></a></span></p>

    <p>The streets appeared to be full of soldiers, patrolling
    singly and in pairs, with fixed bayonets. The temples were
    being used as barracks, and the principal buildings seemed to
    be strongly guarded; but otherwise everything appeared to go on
    as usual.</p>

    <p>We waded through the mud and snow to the proverbial end of
    all things, always followed by the same crowd, and stared at by
    all the inhabitants of the houses we passed. They seemed very
    timid, and inclined to run away directly we turned round.
    Still, their curiosity, especially respecting my sealskin
    jacket and serge dress, was insatiable, and I constantly felt
    myself being gently stroked and touched.</p>

    <p>We returned to the yacht, and whilst we were at lunch some
    officers came on board to say that, this not being a treaty
    port, we could not purchase any provisions, except through
    them, and with special permission. This was soon arranged, and
    our visitors were rewarded for their trouble by being shown
    over the yacht.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, February 18th</i>.&mdash;We were awakened in the
    night by a heavy gale, with snow and sleet beating furiously on
    the deck. In the morning the land was covered with snow, the
    water froze as it was pumped on deck, and the bitter wind
    howled and whistled through the rigging. In the afternoon the
    wind even increased in violence, the snowstorms became more
    frequent, and the sky was dark and overcast.</p>

    <p>We had service at eleven and again at four. The sun set cold
    and stormy, promising a wild night. At times the shore was
    quite hidden by the snowstorms, though only a few cables'
    lengths off.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, February 19th</i>.&mdash;The wind and weather
    became worse than ever, and, as time was precious, Tom decided
    to retrace our steps for a short distance and go through the
    Bungo Channel, between the islands of Sikok and Kiusiu, instead
    of going out to sea through the Simono-seki Straits,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 367<a name="Page_367"
       id="Page_367"></a></span>as, in the latter case, the gale
       would be right in our teeth, and we should make but little
       progress. Now we shall be under the shelter of Kiusiu and
       the Linschoten and Luchu islands for at least two days, and
       so make a fair wind of it. Steering due south, too, we may
       hope to be soon out of this horrid weather. The only
       drawback to this plan is that we shall miss seeing Nagasaki,
       which I much regret. There are no great sights there, but
       the scenery is pretty, and the place is interesting owing to
       the fact that it was the first and for many years the only,
       port open to foreigners, and also the scene of the cruel
       murders of Christians and the site of the beautiful island
       of Pappenberg. Shanghai I do not think I regret so much,
       though Tom would have been interested to talk with the
       merchants about their commerce, and to see their houses,
       many of which are, I am told, perfect palaces. It would be
       very cold there, too, at this time of year; and I do so long
       to lose my cough and feel warm once more.</p>

    <p>At 8.30 p.m. we weighed and proceeded under steam. The views
    of the mountains, between the snowstorms, were lovely, with the
    fresh-fallen snow shining in an occasional gleam of sunshine.
    We soon passed the Isaki light, with wind and tide in our
    favour, and at sunset found ourselves in the open waters of the
    North Pacific.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 20th</i>.&mdash;A lovely day; the
    thermometer already twenty degrees higher than it was
    yesterday. The wind had dropped, and at 10 a.m. it had become
    so calm that fires were lighted.</p>

    <p>It was delightful to see everybody and everything on
    board&mdash;people, children, animals, and birds, all and each
    sunning themselves, and trying to get thawed after the freezing
    they have had. We have unfortunately lost one of the Hawaiian
    geese, which I much regret, as it is irreplaceable. None have,
    I believe, ever been exported before. The pig from Harpe Island
    is very well. We have not seen him all the cold weather, as he
    has been buried in <span class="pagenum">Page
    368<a name="Page_368"
       id="Page_368"></a></span>straw in a box, but they say that
       the cold has stopped his growth.</p>

    <p>We were continually passing islands throughout the day,
    sometimes six or seven being in sight at one time, some with
    active and more with extinct volcanoes. We saw smoke issuing
    from three of the cones, but by night we were too far off to
    notice the flames.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 21st</i>.&mdash;The calm still
    continues. The sun is bright, the sky blue, and the atmosphere
    warm. During the night we passed Suwa Sima, Akuisi Sima, and
    Yoko Sima.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon a light breeze sprang up; we stopped
    steaming, and before nightfall were bowling along smoothly at
    the rate of ten knots.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, February 22nd</i>.&mdash;The same delightful
    breeze continued throughout the night and most of the day. By
    noon we had done 220 miles. Everybody had on summer clothes,
    and we all felt ourselves gradually expanding after being
    shrivelled up by the cold of the last month.</p>

    <p>I should never recommend anybody to come to Japan in the
    winter. You do not see it at its best, I am sure, and the
    scanty protection afforded by houses and carriages makes
    travelling a penance rather than a pleasure. Travellers,
    however, who wish to see Japan should do so at once; for the
    country is changing every day, and in three years more will be
    so Europeanised that little will be left worth seeing; or a
    violent anti-foreign revulsion of feeling may have taken place,
    and then the ports will be closed more strictly than they were
    even before the execution of the first treaty. Nothing that we
    can give them do they really want; their exports are not large;
    and they have learned nearly all they care to know from the
    foreigner. We have seen many of the European engineers of
    Japanese vessels, and they all agree in declaring that the
    natives learn to imitate anything they see done with wonderful
    quickness. These men also averred that in a few years there
    will not <span class="pagenum">Page 369<a name="Page_369"
       id="Page_369"></a></span>be a single foreigner employed in
       Japan, as the Japanese will be quite in a position to
       dispense with such aid; and although the Government pay
       foreigners in a high position exceedingly well, their
       service offers no career to a young man. His engagement is
       for so many years, and when his subordinates have learned to
       do the work he may go where he likes. I am bound to add that
       I have heard the contrary opinion equally strongly
       expressed; but the facts I have mentioned make me lean
       rather to the former than to the latter side of the
       story.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, February 23rd</i>.&mdash;Another pleasant day.
    The wind dropped, fires were lighted, and at 4.30 p.m. we
    proceeded under steam. Soon after seven, whilst we were at
    dinner, the table gave a sudden lurch, which was followed by
    the sound of rain on the deck above. We found that a breeze had
    sprung up all at once, and had carried away some of our
    head-sails before they could possibly be taken in. Even under
    close-reefed canvas we had a most uneasy night, racing along at
    from ten to twelve knots an hour.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, February 24th</i>.&mdash;We were rushing along,
    literally <i>through</i> the water all day, for there was
    plenty of it on deck&mdash;not really any great quantity, but
    sufficient to make everything wet and uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>At 1.35 we made the island of Ockseu, a capital land-fall,
    and very satisfactory in every way; for the sky was too much
    overcast to get an observation, and the currents hereabouts are
    strong and variable. During the night the wind fell light, but
    we maintained a speed of from nine to ten knots.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, February 25th</i>.&mdash;A much finer day. At 8
    a.m. we had run 299 knots since the same time yesterday. We met
    a large steamer and passed a brigantine; also several Chinese
    junks. About twelve o'clock we saw a flag being waved
    frantically from a junk not far from us. At first we thought
    something was wrong with them; but <span class="pagenum">Page
    370<a name="Page_370"
       id="Page_370"></a></span>soon a small boat put off with
       three men, and we found, on its arrival alongside, that it
       contained a pilot anxious for a job. He was very
       disappointed that we would not let him come on board; but
       Tom always likes doing the pilotage himself. The boat was a
       rough wash-tub kind of affair, not much better than those
       used by the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego and
       Patagonia.</p>

    <p>About two o'clock we entered the tropics; but the weather is
    now colder again, and not nearly so pleasant as it was two days
    ago. I suppose it is owing to the north-east monsoon.</p>

    <p>In the course of the afternoon we received several more
    offers of pilotage, all of which were declined; and at 7.45 we
    got up steam and lay to all night, ready to go into Hongkong
    harbour at daylight.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, February 26th</i>.&mdash;At 4 a.m. we found
    ourselves close under the light on the eastern end of the
    island of Hongkong. We were surrounded by islands, and the
    morning was dark and thick; so we waited till 5.30, and then
    steamed on through the Kowloon passage up to the city of
    Victoria, as it is really named, though it is generally called
    Hongkong. The channel is long, and in some places so narrow
    that it is like going through a mountain pass, with barren
    hills and rocks on either hand; but the combined effect of the
    blue waters, and red, brown, and yellow hills, is very
    fine.</p>

    <p>Off the town of Victoria the crowd of shipping is immense,
    and it became a difficult task to thread our way between the
    fleets of sampans and junks. The latter are the most
    extraordinary-looking craft I ever saw, with high, overhanging
    sterns and roll, or rather draw, up sails, sometimes actually
    made of silk, and puffed like a lady's net ball-dress. Then
    their decks are so crowded with lumber, live and dead, that you
    wonder how the boats can be navigated at all. But still they
    are much more picturesque than the Japanese junks, and better
    sea boats. The sampans <span class="pagenum">Page
    371<a name="Page_371"
       id="Page_371"></a></span>are long boats, pointed at both
       ends, and provided with a small awning. They have deep
       keels; and underneath the floor there is one place for a
       cooking fire, another for an altar, and a third where the
       children are stowed to be out of the way. In these sampans
       whole families, sometimes five generations, live and move
       and have their being. I never shall forget my astonishment
       when, going ashore very early one morning in one of these
       strange craft, the proprietor lifted up what I had thought
       was the bottom of the boat, and disclosed three or four
       children, packed away as tight as herrings, while under the
       seats were half-a-dozen people of larger growth. The young
       <span class="pagenum">Page 372<a name="Page_372"
       id="Page_372"></a></span>mother of the small family
       generally rows with the smallest baby strapped on to her
       back, and the next-sized one in her arms, whom she is also
       teaching to row. The children begin to row by themselves
       when they are about two years old. The boys have a gourd,
       intended for a life-preserver, tied round their necks as
       soon as they are born. The girls are left to their fate, a
       Chinaman thinking it rather an advantage to lose a daughter
       or two occasionally.</p>

    <p>Many of these sampan people have never set foot on shore in
    their lives, and this water-life of China is one of the most
    extraordinary features of the country. It is what strikes all
    travellers, and so has tempted me to a digression.</p>

    <p>A lieutenant from the flag-ship came on board and piloted us
    into a snug berth, among the men-of-war, and close to the
    shore, where we were immediately surrounded by sampans, and
    pestered by pertinacious Chinese clambering on board. The
    donkey-engine, with well-rigged hose, soon, however, cleared
    the decks, bulwarks, and gangways, and we were not bothered any
    more.</p>

    <p>After breakfast we landed on the Praya, a fine quay,
    extending the whole length of the town. On it are situated many
    of the large stores, offices, and markets of the city. The
    streets are wide and handsome, and the buildings in European
    style, with deep verandahs and arcades, all built of stone. The
    town is built on the side of a hill, with ferny, moss-covered
    banks, overhung by tropical trees, close to some of the
    principal offices. At the back are the mountains, the peak
    overhead, with the signal station on the top, always busily at
    work, making and answering signals with flags as ships and
    junks enter or leave the harbour. Soldiers and sailors abound
    in the streets; and if it were not for the sedan-chairs and
    palanquins, in which everybody is carried about by Chinese
    coolies with enormous hats, one might easily fancy oneself at
    dear old Gib., so much do these dependencies of the Crown in
    foreign <span class="pagenum">Page 373<a name="Page_373"
       id="Page_373"></a></span>countries resemble one another,
       even in such opposite quarters of the globe.</p>

    <p>We were very anxious to leave the yacht here and to go up to
    Canton; but we find there is no possible hotel at the latter
    place. This is rather unfortunate, as, after our long residence
    on board, and all the knocking about at sea, the yacht requires
    repairing and refitting. She looks very well painted white, and
    the change is a great comfort in hot weather; but white paint
    does not wear well, and in order to maintain her good looks she
    ought to receive a fresh coat at every port. We can only go up
    the Pearl River at the very top of the tide, for in several
    places there are not fourteen feet of water over the shoals. It
    will, therefore, take us two or three days to accomplish what
    the steamers do in six hours, and a great waste of time will be
    involved.</p>

    <p>To-day, for the first time, we have heard 'pidgin English'
    seriously spoken. It is very trying to one's composure to hear
    grave merchants, in their counting-houses, giving important
    orders to clerks and compradors in what sounds, until one gets
    accustomed to it, like the silliest of baby-talk. The term
    really means 'business English;' and certain it is that most
    Chinamen you meet understand it perfectly, though you might
    just as well talk Greek as ordinary English to them. 'Take
    piecey missisy one piecey bag topside,' seems quite as
    difficult to understand as 'Take the lady's bag upstairs' would
    be; but it is easier to a Chinaman's intellect.</p>

    <p>From the Praya we went up the hill to write our names in the
    Governor's book. It was a beautiful road all the way, running
    between lovely gardens and beneath shady trees. Government
    House is a fine building, situated on a high point of land,
    commanding extensive views in every direction. After a pleasant
    chat we descended the hill again, and proceeded to the Hongkong
    hotel for tiffin. It does not seem a very desirable abode,
    being large, dirty, <span class="pagenum">Page
    374<a name="Page_374"
       id="Page_374"></a></span>and ill-kept. At one o'clock a bell
       rang, and the visitors all rushed in and took their places
       at various little tables, and were served with a 'scrambly'
       sort of meal by Chinese boys.</p>

    <p>After this, a carriage was sent for us, and we drove to the
    race-course. This is the fourth and last day of the races, and
    there is to be a ball to-night to wind up with, to which
    everybody seems to be going. The drive was a very pleasant one,
    the road presenting a most animated appearance, with crowds of
    soldiers, sailors, Chinamen, Parsees, Jews, all hurrying along
    by the side of the numerous sedan-chairs and carriages. We were
    puzzled to imagine where, on this rocky, hilly island, there
    could possibly be found a piece of ground flat enough for a
    race-course. But the mystery was solved when we reached a
    lovely little valley, about two miles from the town, where we
    found a very fair course, about the size of that at Chester,
    but not so dangerous. The grand stand is a picturesque object,
    with its thatched roof, verandahs, and sun-blinds. The
    interior, too, looks comfortably arranged, and certainly
    contains the most luxurious basket-chairs one could possibly
    desire. There are a lawn and a paddock attached, and very good
    temporary stables, over many of which are private stands and
    tiffin-rooms.</p>

    <p>Hongkong races are a great event, and people come down from
    Canton, Shanghai, Macao, and all sorts of places for them.
    Everybody knows everybody, and it seems to be altogether a most
    pleasant social meeting. Many ladies were present. Some of the
    races were capital, the little Chinese ponies scuttling along
    at a great pace under their big riders, whose feet seemed
    almost to touch the ground. There was also a race for
    Australian horses. But the most amusing event of all was the
    last scramble for Chinese ponies ridden by Chinese boys, in
    which horses and riders seemed to be exactly suited to one
    another. <span class="pagenum">Page 375<a name="Page_375"
       id="Page_375"></a></span></p>

    <p>The sun went down, and it grew cold and dark before all was
    over. The gentlemen walked back to the town, and I went down to
    the landing-place in solitary state, in a carriage driven by an
    Indian coachman, attended by a Chinese footman. I was
    immediately surrounded by a vociferating crowd, each individual
    member of which was anxious to extol the merits of his own
    sampan. The carriage having driven off, I was quite alone, and
    had some difficulty in dispersing them, and being allowed to
    enter the sampan I had selected. However, I did succeed at
    last, and making my boatmen understand that they were to take
    me to 'the white ship,' as the yacht is generally called,
    returned on board to rest.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 27th</i>.&mdash;Until half-past ten we
    were occupied in the pleasant task of reading news from
    home&mdash;all good this time, I am happy to say. At 10.30 we
    landed and went up the hill to breakfast with Sir Arthur and
    Miss Kennedy, and heard a good deal about the colony. It is
    wonderful to think that thirty years ago it scarcely existed,
    and now it is a large and flourishing place, with splendid
    houses, institutions, roads, and gardens. We were also most
    agreeably surprised by the beauty of the scenery. It is really
    lovely, and, though the hills around are barren, wherever
    cultivation has been attempted, vegetation appears to flourish
    luxuriantly. The climate cannot be very bad, judging by the
    healthy look of the residents and troops. Typhoons seem to be
    the greatest drawback. They come without any warning, and it is
    impossible to guard against them and their disastrous effects.
    Thousands of lives, and millions of pounds' worth of property,
    are destroyed in a few hours. We have been shown some of the
    effects of a very severe typhoon that occurred in 1874. It
    seems almost incredible that the mere force of the wind can
    snap iron posts in two, break granite columns, and blow off
    heavy roofs.</p>

    <p>After breakfast the ceremony of presenting the departing
    Governor with a State umbrella took place. It was a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 377<a name="Page_377"
       id="Page_377"></a></span>token of respect from ten thousand
       Chinese inhabitants of Hongkong, and is the greatest
       compliment that can be paid to any official. It arrived in a
       large camphor-wood box, and the address, beautifully
       embroidered in gold thread and silk, was enclosed in a
       magnificent sandal-wood box about four feet long, covered
       with the richest carving. Precisely at twelve some forty
       vermilion-coloured visiting cards were handed in, with the
       name of each member of the deputation written in Chinese and
       English characters. The visitors were all received in a
       large drawing-room, whilst we ladies observed the
       proceedings through the doors leading from a smaller room.
       It is not considered etiquette by the Chinese for ladies to
       appear at these public ceremonies.</p>

    <p>After it was all over, a stroll through the town, and a look
    at the shops, filled up the rest of the time in the morning,
    until we went on board to fetch the children for an expedition
    up the Peak to the signal station. As usual many visitors came
    on board the yacht, and it was later than we had intended
    before we could make a start. <span class="pagenum">Page
    378<a name="Page_378"
       id="Page_378"></a></span>I had to be carried up the steep
       ascent in a chair, but the children and dogs thoroughly
       enjoyed themselves scampering about. The little ones picked
       heaps of flowers and ferns. The dogs had not been allowed to
       land before, as everybody told me they would be sure to be
       stolen directly. We returned on board before sunset, and had
       time for a little rest before some friends arrived to
       dinner. We have shipped two Chinese boys here to work in the
       pantry and kitchen. They are excellent servants as a rule,
       but how they will get on with the others, and how they will
       like the sea-life, remains to be proved.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 28th</i>.&mdash;I was up and off at
    half-past six to the market, and returned to a late breakfast
    on board; after which a large party of China merchants came as
    a deputation to invite Tom to fix a day to dine with them. I
    think they proposed to pay him what is for them an unusual
    compliment, partly because they were pleased with some remarks
    he made yesterday at Government House, and partly because they
    think so much of his enterprise in making a voyage round the
    world in a yacht with his wife and family. They examined
    everything on board, and seemed to be specially interested in
    Tom's Board of Trade certificate, which one of their number
    translated in full for the benefit of the rest.</p>

    <p>The Chinese part of the town stands quite away from the
    foreign settlement. It is dirty and crowded in spite of its
    wide streets, and the large, gaily coloured houses have the
    names and advertisements of their proprietors painted all
    across them. The theatre is in the middle of the city, and was
    densely crowded. A box had been reserved for us, for the
    ordinary seats are like a carpenter's bench. On the floor of
    the house men and women sat together, but in the galleries the
    men sat apart, and there were separate boxes for the women. The
    acting was rough, and accompanied by the most discordant music.
    The scenery seemed of an excessively rudimentary description,
    as you may imagine <span class="pagenum">Page
    379<a name="Page_379"
       id="Page_379"></a></span>when I tell you that a steep hill
       up which the hero and heroine climbed with great difficulty
       was composed of five kitchen chairs arranged in a pyramid on
       the top of three kitchen tables, held in position by men in
       their ordinary dress. The fugitives were supposed to be a
       Tartar general and his wife, escaping from their enemies
       after a great battle. The fighting was renewed at intervals
       with great noise and spirit. Some of the costumes were very
       fine, and cost from 30<i>l</i>. to 40<i>l</i>. apiece.</p>

    <p>From the theatre we drove to the Chinese hospital, and
    thence to the Chinese recreation ground, where we saw sundry
    itinerant quacks and vendors of all sorts of rubbish. As we
    were walking along, having left our chairs for a few minutes to
    look at the Chinese shops, a man picked my pocket of a
    one-dollar note. Mr. Freer and the Doctor saw, pursued, and
    caught him. He vehemently protested his innocence, but to no
    avail. They proceeded to strip him, found the note, gave him a
    good shaking, and told him to go. <span class="pagenum">Page

       id="Page_380"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 1st</i>.&mdash;A most lovely morning
    ushered in the new month, which having come in like the most
    peaceable of lambs, will, we hope, not end like a roaring lion
    just as we expect to be in the middle of the Bay of Bengal. We
    left the yacht at 7.30, and went on board the 'Kin-Shan,' which
    is a regular American river steamer with beam engines and many
    deck-houses, which are painted white. The lower deck is crowded
    with the most inferior class of Chinese, some eight hundred of
    them being on board. It gave us rather a turn to see them all
    padlocked in under the hatchways and iron gratings. At each
    opening is posted an armed sentinel, ready to fire among the
    crowd in case of any disturbance. In the saloon, also, is a
    stand of pistols, and rifles with fixed bayonets, ready for the
    European passengers to defend themselves with, in case of
    emergency. These are very necessary precautions, on account of
    the numerous pirates who occasionally ship in disguise among
    the crowd, murder the passengers and crew, and take possession
    of the steamer. Not quite two years ago a vessel belonging to
    this same company was assailed in that way. Every one on board
    was murdered, and the ship taken to Macao
    <a name="FNanchor_19_19"
       id="FNanchor_19_19">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_19_19"
       class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But this voyage was more
       prosperous, the captain was most kind and polite, and the
       boat clean and comfortable. An excellent breakfast and an
       elaborate tiffin were served at noon, all for the sum of
       four dollars a head, including wine, beer, and spirits <i>ad
       libitum</i>.</p>

    <div class="footnote">

           <a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a>
           I have since been told that only the captain and one or
           two passengers were killed, and the vessel run ashore
           near, not at Macao.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On first leaving Hankow the course lies between islands and
    through fine mountain passes. Later on the country becomes flat
    and uninteresting till the Bogue Forts are reached. Here are to
    be seen the remains of the old forts knocked down by the French
    and English guns.</p>

    <p>About one o'clock we reached Whampoa, the leading port of
    Canton. The Pearl River is too shallow for large
    <span class="pagenum">Page 381<a name="Page_381"
       id="Page_381"></a></span>steamers to go up any higher; so we
       stopped here only a few minutes to disembark some of the
       Chinese passengers, and from this point the interesting part
       of the voyage began. The river, as well as all the little
       supplementary creeks, was alive with junks and
       sampans&mdash;masts and sails stuck up in every direction,
       gliding about among the flat paddy-fields. Such masts and
       sails as they are! The mandarins' boats, especially, are so
       beautifully carved, painted, and decorated, that they look
       more as if they were floating about for ornament than for
       use. Just about two o'clock our large steamer was brought up
       close alongside the wooden pier as easily as a skiff, but it
       must require some skill to navigate this crowded river
       without accident. On the shore was an excited, vociferating
       crowd, but no one came to meet us; and we had begun to
       wonder what was to become of us&mdash;what we should do, and
       whither we should go in a strange city, where we did not
       know a soul&mdash;when we were relieved from our
       embarrassment by the appearance of the Vice-Consul, who came
       on board to meet a friend. He told us that, owing to an
       expected ball, all the houses <span class="pagenum">Page
       382<a name="Page_382"
       id="Page_382"></a></span>were unusually full, and that not
       one of the people who had been written to could take us in.
       This was rather bad news, but we felt sure that something
       would turn up.</p>

    <p>We landed, and, after proceeding a short distance along the
    dirty street, came to a bridge with iron gates, which were
    thrown open by the sentry. After crossing a dirty stream we
    found ourselves in the foreign settlement&mdash;Shameen it is
    called&mdash;walking on nice turf, under the shade of fine
    trees. The houses of the merchants which line this promenade
    are all fine, handsome stone buildings, with deep verandahs. At
    the back there are compounds with kitchen gardens, and under
    the trees dairy cows are grazing. Every household appears to
    supply itself with garden and farm produce, and the whole scene
    has a most English, home-like appearance. We went first to the
    Vice-Consul, and then to the Jardine Hong. All the business
    houses retain the names of the firms to which they originally
    belonged, even when they have passed into entirely different
    hands. After a little chat we went on to the Deacon Hong, where
    we found they had just done tiffin, and where we met some old
    friends. <span class="pagenum">Page 383<a name="Page_383"
       id="Page_383"></a></span></p>

    <p>By the kindness of various people, to whom we were
    introduced, we all found ourselves gradually installed in
    luxurious quarters. As for us, we had a large room comfortably
    furnished in English fashion, with a bath-room attached. All
    the houses are very much alike, and are fitted up in an equally
    comfortable style.</p>

    <p>About three o'clock we started in five chairs, with
    Man-look-Chin for our guide. Tom vigorously protested against
    not being allowed to use his own legs, but everybody assured
    him that it was impossible in the crowded streets of the city,
    so he had to submit to being carried. No Chinaman, except those
    employed by foreigners, is allowed to cross any of the bridges
    over the stream, which completely surrounds the foreign
    settlement, and makes the suburb of Shameen a perfect island.
    There are iron gates on each bridge, guarded by sentries. The
    contrast in the state of things presented by the two sides of
    the bridge is most marvellous. From the quiet country park,
    full of large villas and pretty gardens, you emerge into a
    filthy city, full of a seething, dirty population, and where
    smells and sights of the most disgusting description meet you
    at every turn. People who have seen many Chinese cities say
    that Canton is the cleanest of them all. What the dirtiest must
    be like is therefore beyond my imagination. The suburbs of the
    city, where all sorts of cheap eating-shops abound&mdash;where
    the butchers and fishmongers expose the most untempting-looking
    morsels for sale, and where there are hampers of all sorts of
    nasty-looking compounds, done up ready for the buyer of the
    smallest portion to take home&mdash;are especially revolting.
    The Chinese, however poor, like several courses to their meals,
    which are served in little bowls on a small table to each
    person, and eaten with chop-sticks, as in Japan. It is to
    gratify this taste that what we should think a very minute
    fish, or a tiny chicken, is cut up into half-a-dozen pieces and
    sold to several purchasers.<span class="pagenum">Page
    384<a name="Page_384"
       id="Page_384"></a></span></p>

    <p>The Chinese are very fond of fish, and are most ingenious in
    propagating, rearing, and keeping them. The dried-fish and
    seaweed shops are not at all picturesque or sweet-smelling,
    especially as all the refuse is thrown into the streets in
    front. Men go about the streets carrying pails of manure,
    suspended on bamboo poles across their shoulders, and clear
    away the rubbish as they go. I was very glad when we got
    through all this to the better part of the town, and found
    ourselves in a large shop, where it was cool, and dark, and
    quiet.</p>

    <p>The streets of the city are so narrow, that two chairs can
    scarcely pass one another, except at certain points. The roofs
    of the houses nearly meet across the roadway, and, in addition,
    the inhabitants frequently spread mats overhead, rendering the
    light below dim and mysterious. Every shop has a large
    vermilion-coloured board, with the name of its occupant written
    in Chinese characters, together with a list of the articles
    which he sells, hung out in front of it, so that the view down
    the narrow streets is very bright and peculiar. These highways
    and byways are not unlike the bazaars at Constantinople and
    Cairo, and different wares are also sold in different
    localities after the Eastern fashion. This is, in some
    respects, a great advantage, as, if you are in search of any
    particular article, you have almost an unlimited choice of
    whatever the town has to offer. But, on the other hand, if you
    want a variety of articles, it is an inconvenient arrangement,
    as you have to go all over the place to find them, and probably
    have to visit the most opposite quarters. We saw thousands of
    china vases, and bowls, and tea and dinner services, some very
    handsome, but many extremely poor. There were a few specially
    made for the French Exhibition next year, which were
    exceedingly handsome. We visited an ivory shop, and saw some
    splendid specimens of carving. One man had been for fifteen
    months employed in carving on one side of an enormous
    elephant's tusk the representation of a battle
    <span class="pagenum">Page 385<a name="Page_385"
       id="Page_385"></a></span>scene, and on the other that of a
       thanksgiving procession. It will take him at least another
       year to finish the job. It is for the Paris Exhibition. It
       will be quite interesting to look for our old Japanese and
       Chinese friends and their products on that occasion.</p>

    <p>From ivory carving, we went to a black-wood furniture shop,
    where we saw some very handsome things, by no means dear
    considering the amount of time and labour bestowed upon them.
    We finished up with the Temple of the Five Hundred Genii, whose
    five hundred carved wooden statues, thickly gilt, all very
    ugly, and all in different attitudes, stand round the statue of
    a European in sailor's costume, said to be meant for Marco
    Polo, but, whoever it may be, evidently considered an object at
    least of veneration, if not of worship.</p>

    <p>We now returned through the dirty city to Shameen, and the
    relief, after crossing the bridge into an open space where one
    could breathe freely and see the blue sky, was
    indescribable.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, March 2nd</i>.&mdash;Before we had finished
    breakfast the other gentlemen strolled in from their various
    quarters, and the drivers and guides arrived from the
    Vice-Consul's. A long morning's work had been mapped out for
    us&mdash;thirteen sights before luncheon, then a visit to the
    French Consulate, followed by eight more objects of interest to
    be seen before we finally crossed the Pearl River to visit the
    Honan Temple. Quitting the pretty cool suburb by another
    bridge, we passed through streets quite as dirty as those of
    yesterday, until the heart of the city had been reached. We
    went first to the wedding-chair shop, where they keep
    sedan-chairs, of four qualities, for hire whenever a wedding
    occurs. Even the commonest are made gorgeous by silver gilding
    and lacquer, while the best are really marvels of decorative
    art, completely covered with the blue lustrous feathers of a
    kind of kingfisher. In shape they are like a square pagoda, and
    round each tier are groups of figures.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 386<a name="Page_386"
       id="Page_386"></a></span>The dresses are also made of
       expensive feathers, but then they last for generations.
       There are no windows to these strange conveyances, in which
       the bride is carried to her future home, closely shut up,
       with joss-sticks burning in front of her. Recently there
       have been two sad accidents. In one case the journey was
       long, there was no outlet for the smoke of the joss-sticks,
       and when they arrived and opened the chair, the bride was
       found dead from suffocation. The other accident occurred
       through the chair catching fire while it was passing through
       some narrow street under an archway. The bearers became
       frightened, put down their burden, and ran away, leaving the
       poor bride locked up inside to be burnt to death.</p>

    <p>From the chair shop we went to the embroiderers, to see them
    at work. Their productions are exquisite, and it is a pity that
    better specimens are not seen in England. The process of
    lacquer-making, too, is very interesting. We had, however, to
    go from house to house to witness it, as only one portion of
    the process is carried on at each&mdash;from the gradual
    coating of the roughest wood with three coatings of varnish,
    until it is finally ornamented with delicate designs, and
    polished ready for sale. In appearance, price, and length of
    wear there is a vast difference.</p>

    <p>The next thing to see was the weaving of silk, which is done
    in the most primitive manner. One man throws the shuttle, while
    another forms the pattern by jumping on the top of the loom and
    raising a certain number of threads, in order to allow the
    shuttle to pass beneath them.</p>

    <p>Then came a visit to the Temple of Longevity, a large
    Buddhist temple, with a monastic establishment of about ninety
    priests attached to it. It contains three shrines with large
    figures, but nothing specially interesting. There is a large
    pond in the midst of the garden, covered with duckweed, and
    full of beautiful gold and silver fish of many kinds. The
    Chinese certainly excel in producing gold and silver and red
    fish; they are the pets of every <span class="pagenum">Page
    387<a name="Page_387"
       id="Page_387"></a></span>household, and are of all colours,
       some being striped and spotted, and boasting any number of
       tails from one to five.</p>

    <p>Outside the temple stands the Jadestone Market, where
    incredible quantities of this valuable stone change hands
    before ten o'clock every morning, both in its rough and its
    polished state. The stalls are the simplest wooden stands, and
    the appearance of the vendors is poor in the extreme. The
    contents of the stalls, however, are worth from 500<i>l</i>. to
    l,000<i>l</i>. (not dollars), and there are hundreds of these
    stalls, besides an entire jadestone street which we afterwards
    visited. We saw several of the shops, and asked the prices, as
    we wished to take home a small specimen; but they had no good
    carved cups, which were what we wanted, and for what they had
    they asked an enormous price. Jadestone is a material very
    difficult to work, and in many cases the result attained is not
    worth the labour expended upon it. It is more a <i>tour de
    force</i> than a work of art. For a good stone, green as grass
    (as it ought to be), they ask from 2,500 to 3,000 dollars; for
    a necklace of beads, 5,000 dollars; a set of mandarin's
    buttons, one large and one small, 50 to 150 dollars.</p>

    <p>After looking in at the goldbeaters at work, we next made
    our way to the temple of the Five Genii who are supposed to
    have founded the city of Canton. Being a Tartar temple, all the
    gods have a totally different cast of features, and are
    represented as Tartars with long beards. It is much frequented
    by women of all classes, and up and down the numerous flights
    of steps leading from one shrine to another, poor little women
    tottered and tumbled on their crippled feet, holding on to one
    another, or leaning on a stick. This temple is interesting as
    having been the head-quarters of the allied forces during their
    occupation of Canton from 1858 to 1861. The great bell in front
    of its principal shrine has been broken by a shot.</p>

    <p>We then went to see the Flowery Pagoda, built A.D. 512, but
    now deprived of many of its decorations. The Brilliant
    <span class="pagenum">Page 388<a name="Page_388"
       id="Page_388"></a></span>Pagoda too, so called from having
       once been covered with snow-white porcelain, is now only a
       tall brick-pointed tower nine stories high.</p>

    <p>By this time we all felt hungry, and began to wend our way
    towards the <i>yamun</i>. On the outskirts may be seen
    prisoners in chains, or wearing the <i>cangue</i>, imprisoned
    in a cage, or else suffering one of the numerous tortures
    inflicted in this country. I did not go to see any of these
    horrors, neither did I visit the execution ground; but some of
    the party did, and described it as a most horrible sight.
    Skulls were lying about in all directions, one of which had
    been quite recently severed from its trunk, the ground being
    still moist and red.</p>

    <p>Whilst luncheon was being prepared we were taken over many
    of the rooms and through several of the enclosures within the
    fortified gate. The meal was excellently served by Chinese
    servants in a charmingly picturesque Tartar room, and after it
    we wandered about the park, looked at the deer, and admired the
    Nagasaki bantams. Then it was time to start on a fresh
    sight-seeing expedition, armed with fresh directions. We set
    out first to the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha, where there is
    a large, fat, reclining figure; then to the Temple of
    Horrors&mdash;most rightly named, for in a suite of rooms built
    round three sides of a large yard are represented all the
    tortures of the Buddhist faith, such as boiling in oil, sawing
    in pieces, and other horrible devices. The yard itself is
    crowded with fortune-tellers, charm-sellers, deputy
    prayer-sayers, beggars, and all sorts of natural horrors,
    exhibiting various deformities. Altogether it is a most
    unpleasant place, but still it is one of the characteristic
    sights of Canton.</p>

    <p>We saw the hotel to-day for the first time. It certainly
    looks very hopeless. We were anxious to get in there if
    possible, as we were such a large party, but everybody assured
    us it was quite out of the question. One gentleman told me he
    never could fancy using his portmanteau
    <span class="pagenum">Page 389<a name="Page_389"
       id="Page_389"></a></span>again after even laying it down on
       the floor for a few minutes. The absence of a decent hotel
       renders Canton an inconvenient place to visit. The European
       inhabitants are so very kind, however, that you are sure to
       find somebody who knows somebody else who will hospitably
       take you in.</p>

    </div>

    <p>From the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha we went up the height
    to breathe a little fresh air, and to see the five-storied
    pagoda at the spot where the allied forces had encamped, the
    Chinese groves in the White Cloud Mountains beyond, and to gain
    a general view of the densely crowded city beneath. It is all
    too flat, however, to be picturesque. The three <i>yamuns</i>
    at our feet, with their quaint towers, grand old trees, flags,
    and the broad Pearl River on the other side of the city, are
    the only elements of positive beauty in the landscape.</p>

    <p>We soon descended the heights again, and, passing the
    Cantonese Viceroy's <i>yamuns</i> paid our promised visit to
    the <span class="pagenum">Page 390<a name="Page_390"
       id="Page_390"></a></span>French Consul. His residence is, if
       possible, more quaint and beautiful than that of the English
       representative. The trees are finer, especially one grand
       avenue leading from the outer gates to the private
       apartments. We were most kindly received, and shown a
       wonderful collection of embroideries and china. It was a
       delightful visit, but we could not remain so long as we
       wished, for we had to see the water clock. The tower in
       which it stands is approached by a flight of steps, and was
       built between the years A.D. 624 and 907; but it has been
       repaired, destroyed, and repaired again, several times,
       having suffered in the bombardment of the town by the allied
       fleets in 1857.</p>

    <p>In the next street, Treasury Street (said to be the finest
    in Canton), you can buy burning-sticks measured to mark the
    time. They are extremely cheap, but perfectly accurate, and
    there seems little doubt that they have been used by the
    Chinese for thousands of years before the Christian era. Here,
    too, were the large spectacles so much worn; opium pipes, with
    all the paraphernalia for cleaning and smoking them; water
    pipes in pretty little shagreen cases, and many other curious
    articles in common use, of which we purchased specimens.</p>

    <p>In the Feather Street are innumerable shops containing
    nothing but feathers of all kinds for mandarins, actors, and
    ordinary mortals; but the great ambition of every Chinaman is
    to have a feather from the Emperor. They are all called
    peacocks' feathers, one-eyed, two-eyed, or three-eyed; but, in
    reality, many are pheasants' feathers. Some of these are from
    six to eight feet in length, beautifully marked. I bought two
    pairs over seven feet long. They are rather rare, as each bird
    has only two long feathers, and these are in perfection for but
    one month in the year. In this part of the town stands a
    Chinese restaurant where only cats' and dogs' flesh is
    served.</p>

    <p>We passed through innumerable streets, and at last reached
    the site of the old factories, now only occupied by
    <span class="pagenum">Page 391<a name="Page_391"
       id="Page_391"></a></span>a large and comfortable house. We
       were to have embarked in the Consul's boat to visit the
       Temple of Honan across the river, but it was getting late,
       and every one felt tired; so we went back through more
       crowded streets to rest awhile, before dressing to go out to
       dinner at eight o'clock. The dinner was quite English in its
       style, and the table looked bright with tea roses,
       heliotrope, and mignonette. The tables had been charmingly
       decorated by the Chinese servants, and even the <i>menu</i>
       had been arranged by them. They seem to save their employer
       all trouble, even that of thinking, provided the services of
       really good ones can be secured. We have had one for only a
       few days, and he does everything for Tom and me. He appears
       to know exactly what we want to do or to wear, and to
       foresee all our requirements.</p>

    <p>But to return to this famous repast. It began with mandarin
    bird's-nest soup, with plover's eggs floating about in it. This
    is a most delicious and dainty dish, and is invariably given to
    strangers on their first arrival. I had no idea how expensive
    the nests were&mdash;54 dollars a 'pice,' weighing something
    under a pound, and it takes two or three ounces to make enough
    soup for ten people. We had a very pleasant evening, talking
    over our experiences, and exchanging news as to our mutual
    friends.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, March 3rd</i>.&mdash;After our long day
    yesterday, I did not feel capable of acceding to our guide's
    proposition of being ready at half-past six for further
    explorations before breakfast; besides, I wanted to see Tom off
    by the nine o'clock boat to Hongkong, whither he is obliged to
    return in order to keep various engagements. The rest of our
    party have been persuaded to stay and see a little more of
    Canton and to go with some friends to a picnic in the White
    Cloud Mountains. A man brought home to-day some carved
    tortoiseshell brushes Tom has given me, with my name carved on
    them in Chinese. It was no good writing it down for the
    engraver's guidance, and after hearing it several times he
    wrote down two characters; but, as the 'r' is always a great
    difficulty with the Chinese, I much doubt whether the name is
    really spelt rightly.</p>

    <p>It was a most lovely day, and after some little delay we
    started about eleven o'clock, a party of seventeen in chairs.
    There were five ladies and twelve gentlemen&mdash;a most
    unusual proportion for Canton. A few weeks ago they wanted to
    get up a fancy ball, but there were only five available ladies
    to be found in the city. At present one or two more are staying
    here on a visit, and it is hoped that
    <span class="pagenum">Page 393<a name="Page_393"
       id="Page_393"></a></span>another ball may be arranged during
       this week, which may boast of at least ten ladies. We made
       quite a procession, with all the servants, bearers, &amp;c.,
       and excited much commotion in the narrow streets, where
       everybody had to make room and squeeze up to the side as
       best they could. Men ran before to clear the way for us,
       shouting, yet we were more than an hour going right across
       the city. On our way we passed through the egg market, saw
       the pork fat market, and the poulterers' and fowlers'
       shops.</p>

    <p>We managed to visit several shops for the sale of real
    Chinese furniture. It is very handsome, but curious in form,
    and, unless it is specially ordered, is made only for native
    use. Every Chinese reception-room is furnished in precisely the
    same manner, with very stiff high arm-chairs, arranged in two
    rows. A small four-legged square table stands between every two
    chairs, a larger table in the centre, and at the end an
    enormous sofa, big enough for six or eight people to lie full
    length across. The sofa and all the chairs have marble seats
    and backs, and the tops of the tables are also made of marble,
    or a sort of soapstone, on which may be distinguished natural
    landscapes slightly assisted by art.</p>

    <p>In the bird market I saw numbers of little birds for sale,
    for the Chinese are very fond of pets, and often take their
    birds out in a cage with them when they go for a walk, just as
    we should be accompanied by a dog. They manage to tame them
    thoroughly, and when they meet a friend they will put the cage
    down, let the bird out, and give him something to eat while
    they have their chat. I saw this done several times.</p>

    <p>Our road next led us through part of the butchers' quarter,
    where rats were hung up by their tails, and what looked very
    like skinned cats and dogs dangled beside them. Whole cages
    full of these animals were exposed for sale alive. Some
    travellers deny that the Chinese eat cats and dogs and rats,
    but there can be no question that they do so, though they may
    be the food only of the <span class="pagenum">Page
    394<a name="Page_394"
       id="Page_394"></a></span>lower classes. Nor do 'puppy dogs'
       appear on the tables of the rich, except on one particular
       day in the year, when to eat them is supposed to bring good
       luck. We passed a restaurant where I was shown the bill of
       fare in Chinese of which this is a translation:&mdash;</p>

    <p>The fish here, as at Hongkong, are almost always kept alive
    in large tubs of water, with a fountain playing over them. They
    even keep some sea-fish alive in salt water. But it is in the
    north of China that they excel in rearing fish in large
    quantities. At Foo-chow cormorant fishing may be seen to great
    perfection, and it is said to be a very amusing sight.</p>

    <p>At last the city gates were reached, and we once more found
    ourselves outside the walls, and able to breathe again. Here a
    halt was made, and several of the party got out of their chairs
    and walked, and we were able to chat, whilst we wended our way
    by a narrow path through nursery gardens and graveyards. In
    fact the whole of the White Cloud Mountain is one vast
    cemetery&mdash;it is the <span class="pagenum">Page
    395<a name="Page_395"
       id="Page_395"></a></span>Chinese Holy of Holies, whither
       their bodies are sent, not only from all parts of China, but
       from all parts of the world. Frequently a shipload of 1,500
       or 1,600 bodies arrives in one day. The Steamboat Company
       charges 40 dollars for the passage of a really live
       Chinaman, as against 160 dollars for the carriage of a dead
       celestial. The friends of the deceased often keep the bodies
       in coffins above ground for several years, until the priests
       announce that they have discovered a lucky day and a lucky
       spot for the interment. This does not generally happen until
       he&mdash;the priest&mdash;finds he can extract no more money
       by divination, and that no more funeral feasts will be given
       by the friends. We passed through what they call the city of
       the dead, where thousands of coffins waiting for interment
       were lying above ground. The coffins are large and massive,
       but very plain, resembling the hollowed-out trunk of a tree.
       The greatest compliment a Chinese can pay his older
       relatives is to make them a present of four handsome
       longevity boards for their coffins. Outside the city of the
       dead were the usual adjuncts of a large
       burying-place&mdash;coffin-makers and stone-carvers, all
       living in dirty little cottages, surrounded by pigs, ducks,
       and young children.</p>

    <p>Leaving the cemetery and cottages behind, a too short drive
    brought us to a lovely valley, where we were to lunch at the
    temple of San Chew, in one of its fairest gorges. The meal was
    spread in a large hall in a most luxurious manner, and as the
    wind changed almost immediately, and it came on to rain, we
    felt ourselves fortunate indeed in having reached shelter. We
    had plenty of wraps, and the bearers ran us down the hill again
    very quickly, so that we suffered no discomfort.</p>

    <p>By the time the city walls were reached, the rain had
    ceased, and a glorious red sunset glowed over the roofs,
    glinting through the holes in the mats, and lighting up all the
    vermilion boards and gold characters with which the houses and
    shops are decorated. The shadowy streets
    <span class="pagenum">Page 396<a name="Page_396"
       id="Page_396"></a></span>were now full of incense or rather
       joss-stick smoke, for every house and every shop has a large
       altar inside, and a small one without, before which
       joss-sticks are burnt more or less all day long.</p>

    <p>The streets seemed more crowded even than usual. Each of our
    bearers struck out a line of his own, and it was not until we
    reached Shameen that we all met again. Some of the ladies had
    been rather frightened at finding themselves alone in the dark,
    crowded city. We were only just in time to dress and go to
    dinner, after which we examined an interesting collection,
    chiefly of coins, in process of formation for the French
    Exhibition. They are carefully arranged, and will be most
    valuable and interesting when complete. The knife-and-fork
    coins are particularly curious and rare, some of them being
    worth as much as 5,000 dollars each, as curiosities. All the
    coins have holes in the centre for convenience of carriage.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, March 4th</i>.&mdash;There is a fine cathedral at
    Shameen, in which the services are beautifully performed. A
    lady kindly lent us her house-boat, and after service we rowed
    across to Fa-ti, to see the gardens of Canton. They are laid
    out on an island a very short way up the river. The gardens are
    very wonderful, and contain plants cut into all sorts of
    shapes, such as men, birds, beasts, fishes, boats, houses,
    furniture, &amp;c. Some are full-sized, others only in
    miniature. But almost all must have required considerable time
    and patience to reach their present growth, for their ages vary
    from 10 to 150 years. There are other plants not so elaborately
    trained, but the effect of the whole is rather too formal to be
    pretty. I managed to bring home some euphorbias, cut into the
    form of junks, and some banyan trees, one 100 and one 50 years
    old. I believe they are the first that have ever reached
    England alive and have flourished. Not far from Fa-ti are the
    duck-hatching establishments, and still further up the river
    are the duck-sampans, where the crowds of ducks are reared.
    They are <span class="pagenum">Page 397<a name="Page_397"
       id="Page_397"></a></span>sent out every morning to get their
       own living and return at night. Until they learn to obey
       their keeper's call quickly the last duck is always whipped.
       I am told it is most ridiculous to see the hurry of the last
       half-dozen birds of a flock of some thousands of ducks. I
       was most anxious to see them, but it is not the right time
       of year now. The young ducks are only just beginning to
       hatch, and the old ones are not numerous, and are mostly
       laying.</p>

    <p>There was no time to go and see the temple of Honan, for we
    were more anxious to avail ourselves of a chance of visiting
    some interesting places in the Chinese city. We went through a
    street, consisting entirely of fruiterers' shops, to which the
    name of Kwohlaorn, or fruit-market, is applied. In this market,
    which is of great extent, there is for sale at all seasons of
    the year an almost countless variety of fruit.</p>

    <p>A silkworm establishment was pointed out to us in the
    distance, but we did not go over it, as we had seen many
    before, and it is not the best season of the year. The
    silkworms are most carefully tended, the people who look after
    them being obliged to change their clothes before entering the
    rooms where they are kept, and to perform all sorts of
    superstitious ceremonies at every stage of the insect's growth.
    No one at all ailing or deformed is allowed to approach a
    building where they are kept. The worms are supposed to be very
    nervous, and are guarded from everything that can possibly
    frighten them, as well as from all changes of temperature or
    disturbances of the atmosphere. Thunder and lightning they are
    supposed specially to dread, and great pains are taken to
    shelter them by artificial means, and keep them from all
    knowledge of the storm.</p>

    <p>The next place we visited was a bird's-nest-soup-shop
    street, where we went into one of the best and most extensive
    establishments. There were three or four well-dressed
    assistants behind the counter, all busily occupied in sorting
    and packing birds' nests. Some of the best were as white as
    snow, and were worth two dollars each,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 398<a name="Page_398"
       id="Page_398"></a></span>while a light brown one was worth
       only one dollar, and the black dirty ones, full of feathers
       and moss, could be purchased at the rate of a quarter
       dollar.</p>

    <p>Certainly the Chinese seem an exception to the rule laid
    down by some writers, that no people can flourish who do not
    rest every seventh day. In many ways they are an abnormal
    people, one striking point in their condition being the state
    of dirt and filth in which they not only exist, but increase
    and multiply. The children look healthy and happy too, in spite
    of these apparent drawbacks, and notwithstanding the fact that
    in many cases their poor little feet must be cruelly tortured
    by the practice of bandaging them tightly to make them
    small.</p>

    <p>When we got back to Shameen there was time for a stroll
    along the Bund. It is very pleasant, for the river runs close
    under the parapet, and its surface is always covered with
    junks, sampans, and boats and ships, going swiftly up or down
    with the strong tide. The walk is shaded with trees, and seats
    stand at intervals all along it.</p>

    <p>An agreeable saunter was followed by a quiet, pleasant
    little dinner, and though we have been here only a few days we
    feel quite sorry that this is to be our last night in Canton,
    so kind has everybody been to us.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, March 5th</i>.&mdash;I was awake and writing from
    half-past four this morning, but before I got up, a woman who
    comes here every day to work brought me some small ordinary
    shoes which I had purchased as curiosities, and took the
    opportunity of showing me her feet. It really made me shudder
    to look at them, so deformed and cramped up were they, and, as
    far as I could make out, she must have suffered greatly in the
    process of reducing them to their present diminutive size. She
    took off her own shoes and tottered about the room in
    <span class="pagenum">Page 399<a name="Page_399"
       id="Page_399"></a></span>those she had brought, and then
       asked me to show her one of mine. Having most minutely
       examined it, she observed, with a melancholy shake of the
       head, 'Missisy foot much more good, do much walky, walky;
       mine much bad, no good for walky.'</p>

    <p>Having said farewell to our kind hostess, we went off in the
    house-boat to the steamer. There was a great crowd on the lower
    deck&mdash;at least 900 Chinamen&mdash;to struggle through in
    order to reach the European quarters. We found other friends on
    board, who had come to see us off.</p>

    <p>A few minutes before nine o'clock the bell rang as a signal
    for our friends' departure, and we steamed ahead, among such a
    crowd of sampans and junks that it was more like moving through
    a town than along a river. No accident, however, occurred,
    though one junk and one sampan had the very narrowest
    escape.</p>

    <p>The voyage down took much longer than our voyage up, on
    account of the tide being against us, and in consequence we did
    not reach Hongkong until 3.30 p.m., when the gig with the
    children was soon alongside. We got off as soon as we could,
    for we expected some friends to afternoon tea on board the
    yacht. There was just time to dress before the first visitors
    arrived, and by half-past six at least two hundred had come. At
    one time quite a flotilla of boats lay around us, looking very
    pretty with all their flags flying. I think the people enjoyed
    it very much as something new, and we only wanted a band to
    enliven the proceedings.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, March 6th</i>.&mdash;The little girls and I went
    ashore at 7.30, to collect all our purchases with the help of a
    friend. We glanced at the museum too, which contains some
    curious specimens of Chinese and Japanese arms and armour, and
    the various productions of the two countries, besides many
    strange things from the Philippine and other islands. I was
    specially interested in the corals and shells. There were
    splendid conch shells from Manilla, <span class="pagenum">Page
    400<a name="Page_400"
       id="Page_400"></a></span>and a magnificent group of Venus
       flower-baskets, dredged from some enormous depth near
       Manilla. There were also good specimens of reptiles of all
       sorts, and of the carved birds' heads for which Canton is
       famous. They look very like amber, and are quite as
       transparent, being carved to a great depth. I believe the
       bird is a kind of toucan or hornbill, but the people here
       call it a crane.</p>

    <p>It was now time to say good-bye to Hongkong and to our kind
    friends, for we had to go on board the 'Flying Cloud,' which
    starts for Macao at two o'clock precisely, and our passages had
    been taken in her. Tom could not go with us, as he had fixed
    to-night for the dinner at which the Chinese gentlemen proposed
    to entertain him; but he came to see us off. We went out of the
    harbour by a different way, and passed along a different side
    of the island of Hongkong, but the scenery was not particularly
    interesting. Off Choolong a heavy ground-swell, called 'Pon
    choughai,' made us roll about most unpleasantly. In bad
    weather, or with a top-heavy ship, this passage could not be
    attempted. Sometimes there are very heavy fogs, and always
    strong currents, so that the short voyage of forty-two miles is
    not absolutely free from danger.</p>

    <p>The town of Macao is situated on a peninsula at the end of
    the island of the same name. It was the first foreign
    settlement in China belonging to the Portuguese, and was once a
    fine, handsome town, with splendid buildings. Unfortunately
    Macao lies in the track of the typhoons, which at times sweep
    over it with a resistless force, shattering and smashing
    everything in their career. These constantly recurring storms,
    and the establishment of other ports, have resulted in driving
    many people away from the place, and the abolition of the
    coolie traffic has also tended to diminish the number of
    traders. Now the town has a desolate, deserted appearance, and
    the principal revenue of the government is derived from the
    numerous gambling-houses.<span class="pagenum">Page
    401<a name="Page_401"
       id="Page_401"></a></span></p>

    <p>We landed at the pier soon after five o'clock, and were
    carried across the peninsula through the town to the Praya on
    the other side. Here we found a large unoccupied mansion,
    situated in a garden overlooking the sea, and, having delivered
    our Chinese letters, were received with the greatest civility
    and attention by the comprador and the servants who had been
    left in charge of our friend's house. The rooms upstairs, to
    which we were at once shown, were lofty and spacious, opening
    into a big verandah. Each room had a mosquito room inside it,
    made of wire gauze and wood, like a gigantic meat-safe, and
    capable of containing, besides a large double bed, a chair and
    a table, so that its occupant is in a position to read and
    write in peace, even after dark. This was the first time we had
    seen one of these contrivances. By the direction of the
    comprador the house chairs were prepared, and coolies were
    provided to take us for an expedition round the town, while our
    things were being unpacked, and the necessary arrangements made
    for our comfort. Macao is a thoroughly Portuguese-looking town,
    the houses being painted blue, green, red, yellow, and all
    sorts of colours. It is well garrisoned, and one meets soldiers
    in every direction. We passed the fort, and went up to the
    lighthouse, which commands a fine view over land and sea;
    returning home by a different way through the town again, which
    we entered just as the cathedral bell and the bells of all the
    churches were pealing the Ave Maria. On our return we found a
    fire lighted and everything illuminated, and by half-past eight
    we had a capital impromptu dinner served. Chinese Tommy, who
    waited on us, had decorated the table most tastefully with
    flowers. Macao is a favourite resort for the European residents
    of Hongkong who are addicted to gambling. The gentlemen of our
    party went to observe the proceedings, but to-night there were
    only a few natives playing at fan-tan&mdash;a game which,
    though a great favourite with the natives, appears very stupid
    to a European. The croupier takes <span class="pagenum">Page
    402<a name="Page_402"
       id="Page_402"></a></span>a handful of copper cash and throws
       it upon the table; he then with chop-sticks counts the coins
       by fours, the betting being upon the possible number of the
       remainder. It takes a long time to count a big handful, and
       you have only one, two, three, or four to back&mdash;no
       colours or combinations, as at <i>rouge-et-noir</i>, or
       <i>trente-et-quarante</i>.</p>

    <p>At Macao the sleep-disturbing watchmen, unlike those of
    Canton, come round every hour and beat two sharp taps on a drum
    at intervals of half a minute, compelling you to listen against
    your will, until the sound dies away in the distance for a
    brief interval.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, March 7th</i>.&mdash;We started soon after ten
    o'clock on another exploring expedition, going first in chairs
    through the town, and across the peninsula to where we left the
    steamer yesterday. Here we embarked&mdash;chairs, bearers, and
    all, in a junk, evidently cleaned up for the occasion, for it
    was in beautiful order, and mats were spread under an awning
    upon deck.</p>

    <p>All along beneath the deck was a cabin, between two and
    three feet high, which contained the altar, the kitchen, and
    the sleeping and living apartments of the family. There was
    also a dear little baby, two months old, which seemed to take
    life very quietly, while its mother assisted its grandfather to
    row.</p>

    <p>We soon reached the island of Chock-Sing-Toon, and
    disembarked at a small pier near a village, which looked more
    like sampans pulled up on the shore than huts or cottages. The
    children and I rode in chairs, while the gentlemen walked,
    first over a plain covered with scrubby palms, then through
    miles of well-cultivated plots of vegetable ground, till we
    reached a temple, built at the entrance to the valley for which
    we were bound. Thence the path wound beside the stream flowing
    from the mountains above, and the vegetation became extremely
    luxuriant and beautiful. Presently we came to a spot where a
    stone bridge spanned the torrent, with a temple on one side and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 403<a name="Page_403"
       id="Page_403"></a></span>a joss-house on the other. It was
       apparently a particularly holy place, for our men had all
       brought quantities of joss-sticks and sacred paper with them
       to burn. There was a sort of eating-house close by, where
       they remained whilst we climbed higher up to get a view. The
       path was well made, and evidently much used, judging from
       the large number of natural temples we found adapted and
       decorated among the rocks. As usual, our descent was a
       comparatively quick affair, and we soon found ourselves on
       board the junk on our way back to Macao, beating across the
       harbour.</p>

    <p>Just before tiffin the yacht made her appearance, causing
    great excitement in the minds of the natives. The gig was soon
    lowered and came as close as she could. There was not water
    enough for her to come within four miles of the shore, but we
    went out to meet her occupants. Tom, who was one of them,
    looked so ill and miserable that I felt quite alarmed for a few
    minutes, till the doctor comforted me by assurances that it was
    only the effect of the Chinese dinner last night&mdash;an
    explanation I had no difficulty in accepting as the correct one
    after perusing the bill of fare. In their desire to do him
    honour, and to give him pleasure, his hosts had provided the
    rarest delicacies, and of course he felt obliged to taste them
    all. Some of the dishes were excellent, but many of them were
    rather trying to a European digestion, especially the fungus
    and lichen. One sort had been grown on ice in the Antarctic
    Sea, the whale's sinews came from the Arctic Ocean, the shark's
    fins from the South Sea Islands, and the birds' nests were of a
    quality to be found only in one particular cave in one
    particular island. To drink, they had champagne in English
    glasses, and arrack in Chinese glasses. The whole dinner was
    eaten with chop-sticks, though spoons were allowed for the
    soup. After dinner there were some good speeches, the chief
    host expressing his deep regret that their manners and customs
    did not permit them to ask <span class="pagenum">Page
    404<a name="Page_404"
       id="Page_404"></a></span>ladies, as they were particularly
       anxious to invite me, and had only abandoned the idea of
       doing so after considerable discussion. I append the bill of
       fare:&mdash;</p>

    <p>We went all round the town, and then to see the ruins of the
    cathedral, and the traces of the destruction caused by the
    typhoon in 1874. Next we paid a visit to the garden
    <span class="pagenum">Page 405<a name="Page_405"
       id="Page_405"></a></span>of Camoens, where he wrote his
       poems in exile<a name="FNanchor_20_20"
       id="FNanchor_20_20">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_20_20"
       class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The garden now belongs to a most
       courteous old Portuguese, with whom I managed, by the aid of
       a mixture of Spanish and French, to hold a conversation. The
       place where Camoens' monument is erected commands, however,
       an extensive prospect, but we had already seen it, and as
       Tom was anxious to get clear of the islands before dark we
       were obliged to hasten away.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_20_20"
           id="Footnote_20_20"></a>
           <a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a>
           Luiz de Camoens, a celebrated Portuguese poet, born
           about 1520; fought against the Moors, and in India; but
           was often in trouble, and was frequently banished or
           imprisoned. During his exile in Macao he wrote his great
           poem 'The Lusiads,' in which he celebrates the principal
           events in Portuguese history.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On reaching the yacht, after some delay in embarking, we
    slipped our anchor as quickly as possible, and soon found
    ourselves in a nasty rolling sea, which sent me to bed at once.
    Poor Tom, though he felt so ill that he could hardly hold his
    head up, was, however, obliged to remain on deck watching until
    nearly daylight; for rocks and islands abound in these seas,
    and no one on board could undertake the pilotage except
    himself.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 8th</i>.&mdash;When I went on deck at
    half-past six o'clock there was nothing to be seen but a leaden
    sky, a cold grey rolling sea, and two fishing junks in the far
    distance, nor did the weather improve all day.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, March 9th</i>.&mdash;Everybody began to settle
    down to the usual sea occupations. There was a general
    hair-cutting all round, one of the sailors being a capital
    barber, and there is never time to attend to this matter when
    ashore. The wind was high and baffling all day. At night the
    Great Bear and the Southern Cross shone out with rivalling
    brilliancy: 'On either hand an old friend and a new.'</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, March 10th</i>.&mdash;A fine day, with a light
    fair breeze. Passed the island of Hainan, belonging to China,
    situated at the entrance of the Gulf of Tonquin, which,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 406<a name="Page_406"
       id="Page_406"></a></span>though very barren-looking,
       supports a population of 150,000.</p>

    <p>Repacked the curiosities and purchases from Canton and
    Hongkong, and made up our accounts.</p>

    <p>About noon we passed a tall bamboo sticking straight up out
    of the water, and wondered if it were the topmast of some
    unfortunate junk sunk on the Paranella Shoal. There were many
    flying-fish about, and the sunset was lovely.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, March 11th</i>.&mdash;We feel that we are going
    south rapidly, for the heat increases day by day. The services
    were held on deck at eleven and four.</p>

    <p>About five o'clock I heard cries of 'A turtle on the
    starboard bow,' 'A wreck on the starboard bow.' I rushed out to
    see what it was, and the men climbed into the rigging to obtain
    a better view of the object. It proved to be a large piece of
    wood, partially submerged, apparently about twenty or thirty
    feet long. The exposed part was covered with barnacles and
    seaweed, and there was a large iron ring attached to one end.
    We were sailing too fast to stop, or I should have liked to
    have sent a boat to examine this 'relic of the sea' more
    closely. These waifs and strays always set me thinking and
    wondering, and speculating as to what they were originally,
    whence they came, and all about them, till Tom declares I weave
    a complete legend for every bit of wood we meet floating
    about.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, March 13th</i>.&mdash;About 2.30 a.m. the main
    peak halyards were carried away. Soon after we gybed, and for
    two or three hours knocked about in the most unpleasant manner.
    At daybreak we made the island of Pulu Lapata, or Shoe Island,
    situated on the coast of Cochin China, looking snowy white in
    the early morning light.</p>

    <p>The day was certainly warm, though we were gliding on
    steadily and pleasantly before the north-east monsoon.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, March 14th</i>.&mdash;The monsoon sends us
    along at the rate of from six to seven knots an hour, without
    the <span class="pagenum">Page 407<a name="Page_407"
       id="Page_407"></a></span>slightest trouble or inconvenience.
       There is an unexpected current, though, which sets us about
       twenty-five miles daily to the westward, notwithstanding the
       fact that a 'southerly current' is marked on the chart.</p>

    <p><i>March 16th</i>.&mdash;There was a general scribble going
    on all over the ship, in preparation for the post to-morrow, as
    we hope to make Singapore to-night, or very early in the
    morning. About noon Pulo Aor was seen on our starboard bow. In
    the afternoon, being so near the Straits, the funnel was raised
    and steam got up. At midnight we made the Homburgh Light, and
    shortly afterwards passed a large steamer steering north. It
    was a glorious night, though very hot below, and I spent most
    of it on deck with Tom, observing the land as we slowly steamed
    ahead half speed.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, March 17th</i>.&mdash;We were off Singapore
    during the night. At 5 a.m. the pilot came on board and took us
    into Tangong Pagar to coal alongside the wharf. We left the
    ship as soon as possible, and in about an hour we had taken
    forty-three tons of coal on board and nearly twenty tons of
    water. The work was rapidly performed by coolies. It was a
    great disappointment to be told by the harbour-master that the
    Governor of the Straits Settlement and Lady Jervoise were to
    leave at eleven o'clock for Johore. We determined to go
    straight to the Government House and make a morning call at the
    unearthly hour of 8 a.m. The drive from the wharf was full of
    beauty, novelty, and interest. We had not landed so near the
    line before, and the most tropical of tropical plants, trees,
    flowers, and ferns, were here to be seen, growing by the
    roadside on every bank and dust-heap.</p>

    <p>The natives, Malays, are a fine-looking, copper-coloured
    race, wearing bright-coloured sarongs and turbans. There are
    many Indians, too, from Madras, almost black, and swathed in
    the most graceful white muslin garments, when they are not too
    hard at work to wear anything at all. The young women are very
    good-looking. They wear not <span class="pagenum">Page
    409<a name="Page_409"
       id="Page_409"></a></span>only one but several rings, and
       metal ornaments in their noses, and a profusion of metal
       bangles on their arms and legs, which jingle and jangle as
       they move.</p>

    <p>The town of Singapore itself is not imposing, its streets,
    or rather roads of wooden huts and stone houses, being mixed
    together indiscriminately. Government House is on the outskirts
    of the city in the midst of a beautiful park which is kept in
    excellent order, the green turf being closely mown and dotted
    with tropical trees and bushes. The House itself is large and
    handsome, and contains splendid suites of lofty rooms, shaded
    by wide verandahs, full of ferns and palms, looking deliciously
    green and cool. We found the Governor and his family did not
    start until 11.30, and they kindly begged us to return to
    breakfast at half-past nine, which we did. Before finally
    leaving, Sir William Jervoise sent for the Colonial Secretary,
    and asked him to look after us in his absence. He turned out to
    be an old schoolfellow and college friend of Tom's at Rugby and
    Oxford; so the meeting was a very pleasant one. As soon as the
    Governor and his suite had set off for Johore we went down into
    the hot dusty town to get our letters, parcels, and papers, and
    to look at the shops. There are not many Malay specialities to
    be bought here; most of the curiosities come from India, China,
    and Japan, with the exception of birds of Paradise from New
    Guinea, and beautiful bright birds of all colours and sizes
    from the various islands in the Malay Archipelago.</p>

    <p>The north-east monsoon still blows fresh and strong, but it
    was nevertheless terribly hot in the streets, and we were very
    glad to return to the cool, shady rooms at Government House,
    where we thoroughly appreciated the delights of the punkah.</p>

    <p>There are very few European servants here, and they all have
    their own peons to wait on them, and carry an umbrella over
    them when they drive the carriage or go for a walk on their own
    account. Even the private soldier <span class="pagenum">Page
    410<a name="Page_410"
       id="Page_410"></a></span>in Singapore has a punkah pulled
       over his bed at night. It is quite a sight to meet all the
       coolies leaving barracks at 5 a.m., when they have done
       punkah-pulling.</p>

    <p>At four o'clock Mr. Douglas called to take us for a drive.
    We went first to the Botanical Gardens, and saw sago-palms and
    all sorts of tropical produce flourishing in perfection. There
    were many beautiful birds and beasts, Argus pheasants, Lyre
    birds, cuckoos, doves, and pigeons, more like parrots than
    doves in the gorgeous metallic lustre of their plumage. The
    cages were large, and the enclosures in front full of Cape
    jasmine bushes (covered with buds) for the birds to peck at and
    eat.</p>

    <p>From the gardens we went for a drive through the pretty
    villas that surround Singapore in every direction. Every house
    outside the town is built on a separate little hill in order to
    catch every breath of fresh air. There is generally rather a
    long drive up to the houses, and the public roads run along the
    valleys between them.</p>

    <p>It was now dark, and we returned to dine at Government
    House.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, March 18th</i>.&mdash;At six o'clock this morning
    Mabelle and I went ashore with the steward and the comprador to
    the market. It is a nice, clean, octagonal building, well
    supplied with vegetables and curious fruits. The latter are
    mostly brought from the other islands, as this is the worst
    season of the year in Singapore for fruit. I do not quite
    understand why this should be, for, as it is only a degree
    above the line, there is very little variation in the seasons
    here. The sun always rises and sets at six o'clock all the year
    round; for months they have a north-east monsoon, and then for
    months together a south-west monsoon.</p>

    <p>We tasted many fruits new to us&mdash;delicious mangosteens,
    lacas, and other fruits whose names I could not ascertain.
    Lastly, we tried a durian, <i>the</i> fruit of the East, as it
    is called by people who live here, and having got
    <span class="pagenum">Page 411<a name="Page_411"
       id="Page_411"></a></span>over the first horror of the
       onion-like odour we found it by no means bad.</p>

    <p>The fish market is the cleanest, and best arranged, and
    sweetest smelling that I ever went through. It is situated on a
    sort of open platform, under a thick thatched roof, built out
    over the sea, so that all the refuse is easily disposed of and
    washed away by the tide. From the platform on which it stands,
    two long jetties run some distance out into the sea, so that
    large fishing boats can come alongside and discharge their
    cargoes from the deep at the door of the market with scarcely
    any exposure to the rays of the tropical sun.</p>

    <p>The poultry market is a curious place. On account of the
    intense heat everything is brought alive to the market, and the
    quacking, cackling, gobbling, and crowing that go on are really
    marvellous. The whole street is alive with birds in baskets,
    cages, and coops, or tied by the leg and thrown down anyhow.
    There were curious pheasants and jungle-fowl from Perak, doves,
    pigeons, quails, besides cockatoos, parrots, parrakeets, and
    lories. They are all very tame and very cheap; and some of the
    scarlet lories, looking like a flame of fire, chatter in the
    most amusing way. I have a cage full of tiny parrots not bigger
    than bullfinches, of a dark green colour, with dark red throats
    and blue heads, yellow marks on the back, and red and yellow
    tails. Having bought these, everybody seemed to think that I
    wanted an unlimited supply of birds, and soon we were
    surrounded by a chattering crowd, all with parrots in their
    hands and on their shoulders. It was a very amusing sight,
    though rather noisy, and the competition reduced the prices
    very much. Parrakeets ranged from twelve to thirty cents
    apiece, talking parrots and cockatoos from one to five dollars.
    At last the vendors became so energetic that I was glad to get
    into the gharry again, and drive away to a flower shop, where
    we bought some gardenias for one penny a dozen, beautifully
    fresh and fragrant, but with painfully short stalks.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 412<a name="Page_412"
       id="Page_412"></a></span></p>

    <p>Towards the end of the south-west monsoon, little native
    open boats arrive from the islands 1,500 to 3,000 miles to the
    southward of Singapore. Each has one little tripod mast. The
    whole family live on board. The sides of the boat cannot be
    seen for the multitudes of cockatoos, parrots, parrakeets, and
    birds of all sorts, fastened on little perches, with very short
    strings attached to them. The decks are covered with
    sandal-wood. The holds are full of spice, shells, feathers, and
    South Sea pearl shells. With this cargo they creep from island
    to island, and from creek to creek, before the monsoon, till
    they reach their destination. They stay a month or six weeks,
    change their goods for iron, nails, a certain amount of pale
    green or Indian red thread for weaving, and some pieces of
    Manchester cotton. They then go back with the north-east
    monsoon, selling their goods at the various islands on their
    homeward route. There are many Dutch ports nearer than
    Singapore, but they are over-regulated, and preference is given
    to the free English port, where the simple natives can do as
    they like so long as they do not transgress the laws.</p>

    <p>As we were going on board, we met the Maharajah of Johore's
    servant, just going off with invitations to dinner, lunch, and
    breakfast for the next two days for all our party, and with all
    sorts of kind propositions for shooting and other
    amusements.</p>

    <p>Some of our friends came off before luncheon to see the
    yacht, and we returned with them to tiffin at Government House.
    At four o'clock the carriage came round to take us to Johore.
    We wished good-bye to Singapore and all our kind friends, and
    started on a lovely drive through the tropical scenery. There
    is a capital road, fifteen miles in length, across the island,
    and our little ponies rattled along at a good pace. There was a
    pleasant breeze and not much dust, no sun, and a stream ran the
    whole way by the side of the road. The acacia
    flamboyante&mdash;that splendid tree which came originally from
    Rangoon and Sumatra&mdash;was <span class="pagenum">Page
    413<a name="Page_413"
       id="Page_413"></a></span>planted alongside the road, and
       produced a most charming effect. It is a large tree, with
       large leaves of the most delicate green; on its topmost
       boughs grow gorgeous clusters of scarlet flowers with yellow
       centres, and the effect of these scarlet plumes tossing in
       the air is truly beautiful. As we were driving along we
       espied a splendid butterfly, with wings about ten inches
       long. Mr. Bingham jumped out of the carriage and knocked it
       down with his hat; but it was so like the colour of leaves
       in grass that in the twilight nobody could distinguish it,
       and, to our great disappointment, we could not find it. We
       were equally unsuccessful in our attempted capture of a
       water-snake a couple of feet long. We threw sticks and
       stones and our syce waded into the stream, but all to no
       purpose; it glided away into some safe little hole under the
       bank.</p>

    <p>We reached the sea-shore about six o'clock, and found the
    Maharajah's steam-launch waiting to convey us across the
    Straits to the mainland. These Straits used to be the old route
    to Singapore, and are somewhat intricate. Tom engaged a very
    good pilot to bring the yacht round, but at the last moment
    thought that he should like to bring her himself; the result
    being that he arrived rather late for dinner. The Maharajah and
    most of the party were out shooting when we arrived; but Sir
    William Jervoise met us and showed us round the place, and also
    arranged about rooms for us to dress in. Johore is a charming
    place; the Straits are so narrow and full of bends that they
    look more like a peaceful river or inland lake in the heart of
    a tropical forest than an arm of the mighty ocean. As we
    approached we had observed a good deal of smoke rising from the
    jungle, and, as the shades of evening closed over the scene, we
    could see the lurid glare of two extensive fires.</p>

    <p>We sat down thirty to dinner at eight o'clock. There were
    the Maharajah's brothers, the Prime Minister, Harkim or judge,
    and several other Malay chiefs, the Governor
    <span class="pagenum">Page 414<a name="Page_414"
       id="Page_414"></a></span>of the Straits Settlements, his
       family and suite, and one or two people from Singapore. The
       dinner was cooked and served in European style; the table
       decorated with gold and silver &eacute;pergnes full of
       flowers, on velvet stands, and with heaps of small
       cut-flower glasses full of jasmine. We were waited on by the
       Malay servants of the establishment, dressed in grey and
       yellow, and by the Governor's Madras servants, in white and
       scarlet. The Maharajah and his native guests were all in
       English evening dress, with white waistcoats, bright
       turbans, and sarongs. The room was large and open on all
       sides, and the fresh evening breeze, in addition to the
       numerous punkahs, made it delightfully cool. The Maharajah
       is a strict Mohammedan himself, and drinks nothing but
       water. I spent the three hours during which the dinner
       lasted in very pleasant conversation with my two neighbours.
       We returned on board soon after eleven o'clock.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, March 19th</i>.&mdash;Mabelle and I went ashore
    at six o'clock for a drive. It was a glorious morning, with a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 415<a name="Page_415"
       id="Page_415"></a></span>delightfully cool breeze, and the
       excursion was most enjoyable. We drove first through the old
       town of Johore, once of considerable importance, and still a
       place of trade for opium, indigo, pepper, and other tropical
       products. Nutmeg and maize used to be the great articles of
       export, but latterly the growth has failed, and, instead of
       the groves we had expected to see, there were only solitary
       trees. After leaving the town we went along a good road for
       some distance, with cottages and clearings on either side,
       until we came to a pepper and gambir plantation. The two
       crops are cultivated together, and both are grown on the
       edge of the jungle, for the sake of the wood, which is
       burned in the preparation of the gambir. I confess that I
       had never heard of the latter substance before, but I find
       that it is largely exported to Europe, where it is
       occasionally employed for giving weight to silks, and for
       tanning purposes.</p>

    <p>The pepper garden we saw was many acres in extent. Some of
    the trees in the forest close by are very fine, especially the
    camphor-wood, and the great red, purple, and copper-coloured
    oleanders, which grow in clumps twenty and thirty feet in
    height. The orchids with which all the trees were covered,
    hanging down in long tassels of lovely colours, or spread out
    like great spotted butterflies and insects, were most lovely of
    all. By far the most abundant was the white phal&aelig;nopsis,
    with great drooping sprays of pure white waxy blossoms, some
    delicately streaked with crimson, others with yellow. It was a
    genuine jungle, and we were told that it is the resort of
    numerous tigers and elephants, and that snakes abound.</p>

    <p>On our way back through the town we stopped to see the
    process of opium making. This drug is brought from India in an
    almost raw state, rolled up in balls, about the size of
    billiard balls, and wrapped in its own leaves. Here it is
    boiled down, several times refined, and prepared for smoking.
    The traffic in it forms a very profitable
    <span class="pagenum">Page 416<a name="Page_416"
       id="Page_416"></a></span>monopoly, which is shared in
       Singapore between the English Government and the Maharajah
       of Johore.</p>

    <p>We also saw indigo growing; the dye is prepared very much in
    the same way as the gambir. That grown here is not so good as
    that which comes from India, and it is therefore not much
    exported, though it is used by the innumerable Chinese in the
    Malay peninsula to dye all their clothes, which are invariably
    of some deep shade of blue. We saw sago-palms growing, but the
    mill was not working, so that we could not see the process of
    manufacture; but it seems to be very similar to the preparation
    of tapioca, which we had seen in Brazil.</p>

    <p>On our passage through the town we went to look at a large
    gambling establishment; of course no one was playing so early
    in the morning, but in the evening it is always densely
    crowded, and is a great source of profit to the proprietor. I
    could not manage to make out exactly from the description what
    the game they play is like, but it was not fan-tan. We now left
    the carriage, and strolled to see the people, the shops, and
    the market. I bought all sorts of common curiosities, little
    articles of everyday life, some of which will be sure to amuse
    and interest my English friends. Among my purchases were a
    wooden pillow, some joss candles, a two-stringed fiddle, and a
    few preserved eggs, which they say are over a hundred years
    old. The eggs are certainly nasty enough for anything; still it
    seems strange that so thrifty a people as the Chinese should
    allow so much capital to lie dormant&mdash;literally buried in
    the earth.</p>

    <p>At half-past nine o'clock the Maharajah, with the Governor
    and all his guests, came on board. His Highness inspected the
    yacht with the utmost minuteness and interest, though his
    Mohammedan ideas about women were considerably troubled when he
    was told that I had had a great deal to do with the designing
    and arrangement of the interior. At half-past eleven the party
    left, and an hour afterwards we went to make our adieux to the
    Maharajah. <span class="pagenum">Page 417<a name="Page_417"
       id="Page_417"></a></span></p>

    <p>On our departure the Maharajah ordered twenty coolies to
    accompany us, laden with fragrant tropical plants. He also gave
    me some splendid Malay silk sarongs, grown, made, and woven in
    his kingdom, a pair of tusks of an elephant shot within a mile
    of the house, besides a live little beast, not an alligator,
    and not an armadillo or a lizard; in fact I do not know what it
    is; it clings round my arm just like a bracelet, and it was
    sent as a present by the ex-Sultan of Johore. Having said
    farewell to our kind host and other friends, we pushed off from
    the shore, and embarked on board the yacht; the anchor was up,
    and by five o'clock a bend in the Straits hid hospitable and
    pleasant Johore from our view, and all we could see was the
    special steamer on her way back to Singapore with the
    Maharajah's guests on board. At Tanjore we dropped our funny
    little pilot, and proceeded on our course towards Penang. The
    Straits are quite lovely, and fully repaid the trouble and time
    involved in the detour made to visit them. The sun set and the
    young moon arose over as lovely a tropical scene as you can
    possibly imagine.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, March 20th</i>.&mdash;At 5.30, when we were
    called, the Doctor came and announced that he had something
    very important to communicate to us. This proved to be that one
    of our men was suffering from small-pox, and not from rheumatic
    fever, as had been supposed. My first thought was that Muriel
    had been with the Doctor to see him <span class="pagenum">Page
    418<a name="Page_418"
       id="Page_418"></a></span>yesterday evening; my next, that
       many men had been sleeping in the same part of the vessel
       with him; my third, that for his greater comfort he had been
       each day in our part of the ship; and my fourth, what was to
       be done now? After a short consultation, Tom decided to
       alter our course for Malacca, where we arrived at half-past
       nine; the Doctor at once went on shore in a native prahu to
       make the best arrangements he could under the circumstances.
       He was fortunate enough to find Dr. Simon, nephew of the
       celebrated surgeon of the same name, installed as head
       physician at the civil hospital here. He came off at once
       with the hospital boat, and, having visited the invalid,
       declared his illness to be a very mild case of small-pox. He
       had brought off some lymph with him, and recommended us all
       to be re-vaccinated. He had also brought sundry
       disinfectants, and gave instructions about fumigating and
       disinfecting the yacht. All the men were called upon the
       quarter-deck, and addressed by Tom, and we were surprised to
       find what a large proportion of them objected to the
       operation of vaccination. At last, however, the prejudices
       of all of them, except two, were overcome. One of the latter
       had promised his grandfather that he never would be
       vaccinated under any circumstances, while another would
       consent to be inoculated, but would not be vaccinated. We
       had consulted our own medical man before leaving England,
       and knew that for ourselves the operation was not necessary,
       but we nevertheless underwent it <i>pour encourager les
       autres</i>. While the Doctor was on shore we had been
       surrounded by boats bringing monkeys, birds, ratan and
       Malacca canes, fruit, rice, &amp;c., to sell, and as I did
       not care to go ashore, thinking there might be some bother
       about quarantine, we made bargains over the side of the
       yacht with the traders, the result being that seven monkeys,
       about fifty birds of sorts, and innumerable bundles of
       canes, were added to the stock on board. In the meantime Dr.
       Simon had removed our invalid to the
       hospital.<span class="pagenum">Page 419<a name="Page_419"
       id="Page_419"></a></span></p>

    <p>Malacca looks exceedingly pretty from the sea. It is a
    regular Malay village, consisting of huts, built on piles close
    to the water, overshadowed by cocoa palms and other forms of
    tropical vegetation. Mount Ofia rises in the distance behind;
    there are many green islands, too, in the harbour. By one
    o'clock we were again under way, and once more <i>en route</i>
    for Penang.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, March 21st</i>.&mdash;During the night we had
    heavy thunder storms. About 11 a.m. we passed a piece of
    drift-wood with a bird perched on the top, presenting a most
    curious effect. Several of the men on board mistook it for the
    back fin of a large shark. About 5 p.m. we made the island of
    Penang. After sunset it became very hazy, and we crept slowly
    up, afraid of injuring the numerous stake nets that are set
    about the Straits most promiscuously, and without any lights to
    mark their position. Before midnight we had dropped our
    anchor.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 22nd</i>.&mdash;At 5 a.m., when we were
    called, the whole sky was overcast with a lurid glare, and the
    atmosphere was thick, as if with the fumes of some vast
    conflagration. As the sun rose in raging fierceness,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 420<a name="Page_420"
       id="Page_420"></a></span>the sky cleared, and became of a
       deep, clear, transparent blue. The island of Penang is very
       beautiful, especially in the early morning light. It was
       fortunate we did not try to come in last night, as we could
       now see that we must inevitably have run through some of the
       innumerable stake nets I mentioned. As we approached
       Georgetown, the capital of the province, we passed many
       steamers and sailing ships at anchor in the roads. A pilot
       offered his services, but Tom declined them with thanks, and
       soon afterwards skilfully brought us up close in shore in
       the crowded roadstead. The harbour-master sent off, as did
       also the mail-master, but no Board of Health officials
       appeared; so, after some delay, the Doctor went on shore to
       find the local medical man, promising shortly to return. He
       did not, however, reappear, and, after waiting a couple of
       hours, we landed without opposition. We packed off all the
       servants for a run on shore, and had all the fires put out
       in order to cool the ship. Our first inquiry was for an
       hotel where we could breakfast, and we were recommended to
       go to the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe.</p>

    <p>Our demands for breakfast were met at first with the reply
    that it was too late, and that we must wait till one o'clock
    tiffin; but a little persuasion induced the manager to find
    some cold meat, eggs, and lemonade. We afterwards drove out to
    one or two shops, but anything so hopeless as the stores here I
    never saw. Not a single curiosity could we find, not even a
    bird. We drove round the town, and out to the Governor's house;
    he was away, but we were most kindly received by Mrs. Anson and
    his daughter, and strongly recommended by them to make an
    expedition to the bungalow at the top of the hill. In about an
    hour and a half, always ascending, we reached the Governor's
    bungalow, situated in a charming spot, where the difference of
    10&deg; in the temperature, caused by being 1,500 feet higher
    up, is a great boon. After tiffin and a rest at the hotel, a
    carriage came to take us to the foot of the hill,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 421<a name="Page_421"
       id="Page_421"></a></span>about four miles from the town. We
       went first to a large Jesuit establishment, where some most
       benevolent old priests were teaching a large number of Malay
       boys reading, writing, and geography. Then we went a little
       further, and, in a small wooden house, under the cocoa
       trees, at last found some of the little humming birds for
       which the Malay Archipelago is famous. They glisten with a
       marvellous metallic lustre all over their bodies, instead of
       only in patches, as one sees upon those in South America and
       the West Indies. The drive was intensely tropical in
       character, until we reached the waterfall, where we left the
       carriage and got into chairs, each carried by six coolies.
       The scenery all about the waterfall is lovely, and a large
       stream of sparkling, cool, clear water tumbling over the
       rocks was most refreshing to look at. Many people who have
       business in Penang live up here, riding up and down morning
       and evening, for the sake of the cool, refreshing night air.
       One of the most curious things in vegetation which strikes
       our English eyes is the extraordinary abundance of the
       sensitive plant. It is interwoven with all the grass, and
       grows thickly in all the hedgerows. In the neatly kept turf,
       round the Government bungalow, its long, creeping, prickly
       stems, acacia-like leaves, and little fluffy mauve balls of
       flowers are so numerous, that, walking up and down the
       croquet lawn, it appears to be bowing before you, for the
       delicate plants are sensible of even an approaching
       footstep, and shut up and hide their tiny leaves among the
       grass long before you really reach them.</p>

    <p>From the top of the hill you can see ninety miles in the
    clear atmosphere, far away across the Straits of Perak to the
    mainland. We could not stay long, and were carried down the
    hill backwards, as our bearers were afraid of our tumbling out
    of the chairs if we travelled forwards. The tropical vegetation
    is even more striking here, but, alas! it is already losing its
    novelty to us. Those were indeed pleasant days when everything
    was new and strange; it seems now <span class="pagenum">Page
    422<a name="Page_422"
       id="Page_422"></a></span>almost as if years, not months, had
       gone past since we first entered these latitudes. We found
       the carriage waiting for us when we arrived at the bottom of
       the hill about seven o'clock, and it was not long before we
       reached the town.</p>

    <p>The glowworms and fireflies were numerous. The natives were
    cooking their evening meal on the ground beneath the tall
    palm-trees as we passed, with the glare of the fires lighting
    up the picturesque huts, their dark figures relieved by their
    white and scarlet turbans and waist-cloth. The whole scene put
    us very much in mind of the old familiar pictures of India, the
    lithe figures of the natives looking like beautiful bronze
    statues, the rough country carts, drawn by buffaloes without
    harness, but dragging by their hump, and driven by
    black-skinned natives armed with a long goad. We went straight
    to the jetty, and found to our surprise that in the roads there
    was quite a breeze blowing, and a very strong tide running
    against it, which made the sea almost rough.</p>

    <p>Mrs. and Miss Anson, Mr. Talbot, and other friends, dined
    with us. At eleven they landed, and we weighed anchor, and were
    soon gliding through the Straits of Malacca, shaping for Acheen
    Head, <i>en route</i> to Galle.</p>

    <p>It seems strange that an important English settlement like
    Penang, where so many large steamers and ships are constantly
    calling, should be without lights or quarantine laws. We
    afterwards learned on shore that the local government had
    already surveyed and fixed a place for two leading lights. The
    reason why no health officers came off to us this morning was
    probably that, small-pox and cholera both being prevalent in
    the town, they thought that the fewer questions they asked, and
    the less they saw of incoming vessels, the better.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, March 23rd</i>.&mdash;A broiling day, everybody
    panting, parrots and parrakeets dying. We passed a large barque
    with every sail set, although it was a flat calm, which made us
    rejoice in the possession of steam-power. Several
    <span class="pagenum">Page 423<a name="Page_423"
       id="Page_423"></a></span>people on board are very unwell,
       and the engineer is really ill. It is depressing to
       speculate what would become of us if anything went wrong in
       the engine-room department, and if we should be reduced to
       sail-power alone in this region of calmness. At last even I
       know what it is to be too hot, and am quite knocked up with
       my short experience.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Saturday, March 24th</i>.&mdash;Another flat calm. The
    after-forecastle, having been battened down and fumigated for
    the last seventy-two hours, was to-day opened, and its contents
    brought up on deck, some to be thrown overboard, and others to
    be washed with carbolic acid. I never saw such quantities of
    things as were turned out; they covered the whole deck, and it
    seemed as if their cubic capacity must
    <span class="pagenum">Page 424<a name="Page_424"
       id="Page_424"></a></span> be far greater than that of the
       place in which they had been stowed. Besides the beds and
       tables of eight men, there were forty-eight birds, four
       monkeys, two cockatoos, and a tortoise, besides Japanese
       cabinets and boxes of clothes, books, china, coral, shells,
       and all sorts of imaginable and unimaginable things. One
       poor tortoise had been killed and bleached white by the
       chlorine gas.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, March 25th</i>.&mdash;Hotter than ever. It was
    quite impossible to have service either on deck or below. We
    always observe Sunday by showing a little extra attention to
    dress, and, as far as the gentlemen are concerned, a little
    more care in the matter of shaving. On other days I fear our
    toilets would hardly pass muster in civilised society. Tom set
    the example of leaving off collars, coats, and waistcoats; so
    shirts and trousers are now the order of the day. The children
    wear grass-cloth pinafores and very little else, no shoes or
    stockings, Manilla or Chinese slippers being worn by those who
    dislike bare feet. I find my Tahitian and Hawaiian dresses
    invaluable: they are really cool, loose, and comfortable, and I
    scarcely ever wear anything else.</p>

    <p>We passed a large steamer about 7.30 a.m., and in the
    afternoon altered our course to speak the 'Middlesex,' of
    London, bound to the Channel for orders. We had quite a long
    conversation with the captain, and parted with mutual good
    wishes for a pleasant voyage. It was a lovely moonlight night,
    but very hot, though we found a delightful sleeping-place
    beneath the awning on deck.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, March 26th</i>.&mdash;The sun appeared to rise
    even fiercer and hotter than ever this morning. I have been
    very anxious for the last few days about Baby, who has been
    cutting some teeth and has suffered from a rash. Muriel has
    been bitten all over by mosquitoes, and Mabelle has also
    suffered from heat-rash. Just now every little ailment suggests
    small-pox to our minds.</p>

    <p>About noon, when in latitude 6.25 North, and in longitude
    88.25 East, we began to encounter a great deal of drift
    <span class="pagenum">Page 425<a name="Page_425"
       id="Page_425"></a></span>wood, many large trees, branches,
       plants, leaves, nautilus shells, back-bones of cuttlefish,
       and, in addition, large quantities of yellow spawn,
       evidently deposited by some fish of large size. The spawn
       appeared to be of a very solid, consistent character, like
       large yellow grapes, connected together in a sort of
       gelatinous mass. It formed a continuous wide yellow streak
       perhaps half a mile in length, and with the bits of wood and
       branches sticking up in its midst at intervals, it would not
       have required a very lively imagination to fashion it at a
       little distance into a sea serpent. Where does all this
       <i>d&eacute;bris</i> come from? was the question asked by
       everybody. Out of the Bay of Bengal probably, judging from
       the direction of the current. We wondered if it could
       possibly be the remains of some of the trees uprooted by the
       last great cyclone.</p>

    <p>At 1.30 p.m. a man cried out from the rigging, 'Boat on the
    starboard bow!' a cry that produced great excitement
    immediately; our course was altered and telescopes and glasses
    brought to bear upon the object in question. Every one on
    board, except our old sailing master, said it was a native
    boat. Some even said that they could see a man on board waving
    something. Powell alone declared it to be the root of a palm
    from the Bay of Bengal, and he proved right. A very large root
    it was, with one single stem and a few leaves hanging down,
    which had exactly the appearance of broken masts, tattered
    sails, and torn rigging. We went close alongside to have a good
    look at it; the water was as clear as crystal, and beneath the
    surface were hundreds of beautifully coloured fish, greedily
    devouring something&mdash;I suppose small insects, or fish
    entangled among the roots.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, March 27th</i>.&mdash;It requires a great effort
    to do anything, except before sunrise or after sunset, owing to
    the intense heat; and when one is not feeling well it makes
    exertion still more difficult. At night the heat below is
    simply unbearable; the cabins are deserted, and all mattresses
    are brought up on deck.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, March 28th</i>.&mdash;At midnight the wind was
    slightly ahead, and we could distinctly smell the fragrant
    breezes and spicy odours of Ceylon. We made the eastern side of
    the island at daylight, and coasted along its palm-fringed
    shores all day. I had been very unwell for some days past, but
    this delightful indication of our near approach to the land
    seemed to do me good at once. If only the interior is as
    beautiful as what we can see from the deck of the yacht, my
    expectations will be fully realised, brilliant as they are.</p>

    <p>As the sun set, the beauty of the scene from the deck of the
    yacht seemed to increase. We proceeded slowly, and at about
    nine o'clock were in the roads of Galle and could see the ships
    at anchor. Tom did not like to venture further in the dark
    without a pilot, and accordingly told the signal-man to make
    signals for one, but being impatient he sent up a rocket,
    besides burning blue lights, a mistake which had the effect of
    bringing the first officer of the P. and O. steamship 'Poonah'
    on board, who thought perhaps we had got aground or were in
    trouble of some sort. He also informed us that pilots never
    came off after dark, and kindly offered to show us a good
    anchorage for the night.<span class="pagenum">Page
    427<a name="Page_427"
       id="Page_427"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Thursday, March 29th</i>.&mdash;The pilot came off early,
    and soon after six we dropped anchor in Galle harbour. The
    entrance is fine, and the bay one of the most beautiful in the
    world. The picturesque town, with its old buildings, and the
    white surf dashing in among the splendid cocoa-trees which grow
    down to the water's edge, combined to make up a charming
    picture. We went on board the 'Poonah' to breakfast as
    arranged, and afterwards all over the ship, which is in
    splendid order. Thence we went ashore to the Oriental Company's
    Hotel, a most comfortable building, with a large, shady
    verandah, which to-day was crowded by passengers from the
    'Poonah.' At tiffin there was a great crowd, and we met some
    old friends. At three o'clock we returned to the yacht, to show
    her to the captain of the 'Poonah' and some of his friends, and
    an hour later we started in two carriages for a drive to
    Wockwalla, a hill commanding a splendid view. The drive was
    delightful, and the vegetation more beautiful than any we have
    seen since leaving Tahiti, but it would have been more
    enjoyable if we had not been so pestered by boys selling
    flowers and bunches of mace in various stages of development.
    It certainly is very pretty when the peach-like fruit is half
    open and shows the network of scarlet mace surrounding the
    brown nutmeg within. From Wockwalla the view is lovely, over
    paddy-fields, jungle, and virgin forest, up to the hills close
    by and to the mountains beyond. There is a small
    refreshment-room at the top of the hill, kept by a nice little
    mulatto woman and her husband. Here we drank lemonade, ate
    mangoes, and watched the sun gradually declining, but we were
    obliged to leave before it had set, as we wanted to visit the
    cinnamon gardens on our way back. The prettiest thing in the
    whole scene was the river running through the middle of the
    landscape, and the white-winged, scarlet-bodied cranes,
    disporting themselves along the banks among the dark green
    foliage and light green shoots of the crimson-tipped
    cinnamon-trees. We had a <span class="pagenum">Page
    428<a name="Page_428"
       id="Page_428"></a></span>glorious drive home along the
       sea-shore under cocoa-nut trees, amongst which the fireflies
       flitted, and through which we could see the red and purple
       afterglow of the sunset. Ceylon is, as every one knows,
       celebrated for its real gems, and almost as much for the
       wonderful imitations offered for sale by the natives. Some
       are made in Birmingham and exported, but many are made here
       and in India, and are far better in appearance than ours, or
       even those of Paris. More than once in the course of our
       drive, half-naked Indians produced from their waist-cloths
       rubies, sapphires, and emeralds for which they asked from
       one to four thousand rupees, and gratefully took fourpence,
       after a long run with the carriage, and much vociferation
       and gesticulation. After <i>table-d'h&ocirc;te</i> dinner at
       the hotel we went off to the yacht in a pilot boat; the
       buoys were all illuminated, and boats with four or five men
       in them, provided with torches, were in readiness to show us
       the right way out. By ten o'clock we were outside the
       harbour and on our way to Colombo.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, March 30th</i>.&mdash;It rained heavily during
    the night, and we were obliged to sleep in the deck-house
    instead of on deck. At daylight all was again bright and
    beautiful, and the cocoanut-clad coast of Ceylon looked most
    fascinating in the early morning light. About ten o'clock we
    dropped our anchor in the harbour at Colombo, which was crowded
    with shipping. 175,000 coolies have been landed here within the
    last two or three months; consequently labour is very cheap
    this year in the coffee plantations.</p>

    <p>The instant we anchored we were of course surrounded by
    boats selling every possible commodity and curiosity, carved
    ebony, ivory, sandal-wood, and models of the curious boats in
    use here. These boats are very long and narrow, with an
    enormous outrigger and large sail, and when it is very rough,
    nearly the whole of the crew of the boat go out one by one, and
    sit on the outrigger to keep it in the water, from which
    springs the Cingalese saying, 'One man, two men, four men
    breeze.' The heat was intense, though there
    <span class="pagenum">Page 429<a name="Page_429"
       id="Page_429"></a></span>was a pleasant breeze under the
       awning on deck; we therefore amused ourselves by looking
       over the side and bargaining with the natives, until our
       letters, which we had sent for, arrived. About one o'clock
       we went ashore, encountering on our way some exceedingly
       dreadful smells, wafted from ships laden with guano, bones,
       and other odoriferous cargoes. The inner boat harbour is
       unsavoury and unwholesome to the last degree, and is just
       now crowded with many natives of various castes from the
       south of India.</p>

    <p>Colombo is rather a European-looking town, with fine
    buildings and many open green spaces, where there were actually
    soldiers playing cricket, with great energy, under the fierce
    rays of the midday sun. We went at once to an hotel and rested;
    loitering after tiffin in the verandah, which was as usual
    crowded with sellers of all sorts of Indian things. Most of the
    day was spent in driving about, and having made our
    arrangements for an early start to-morrow, we then walked down
    to the harbour, getting drenched on our way by a tremendous
    thunderstorm.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, March 31st</i>.&mdash;Up early, and after
    rather a scramble we went ashore at seven o'clock, just in time
    to start by the first train to Kandy. There was not much time
    to spare, and we therefore had to pay sovereigns for our
    tickets instead of changing them for rupees, thereby receiving
    only ten instead of eleven and a half, the current rate of
    exchange that day. It seemed rather sharp practice on the part
    of the railway company (<i>alias</i> the Government) to take
    sovereigns in at the window at ten rupees, and sell them at the
    door for eleven and a half, to speculators waiting ready and
    eager to clutch and sell them again at an infinitesimally small
    profit.</p>

    <p>The line to Kandy is always described as one of the most
    beautiful railways in the world, and it certainly deserves the
    character. The first part of the journey is across jungle and
    through plains; then one goes climbing up and up, looking down
    on all the beauties of tropical vegetation,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 430<a name="Page_430"
       id="Page_430"></a></span>to distant mountains shimmering in
       the glare and haze of the burning sun. The carriages were
       well ventilated and provided with double roofs, and were
       really tolerably cool.</p>

    <p>About nine o'clock we reached Ambepussa, and the scenery
    increased in beauty from this point. A couple of hours later we
    reached Peradeniya, the junction for Gampola. Here most of the
    passengers got out, bound for Neuera-ellia, the sanatorium of
    Ceylon, 7,000 feet above the sea. Soon after leaving the
    station, we passed the Satinwood Bridge. Here we had a glimpse
    of the botanical garden at Kandy, and soon afterwards reached
    the station. We were at once rushed at by two telegraph boys,
    each with a telegram of hospitable invitation, whilst a third
    friend met us with his carriage, and asked us to go at once to
    his house, a few miles out of Kandy. We hesitated to avail
    ourselves of his kind offer, as we were such a large party; but
    he insisted, and at once set off to make things ready for us,
    whilst we went to breakfast and rest at a noisy, dirty, and
    uncomfortable hotel. It was too hot to do anything except to
    sit in the verandah and watch planter after planter come in for
    an iced drink at the bar. The town is quite full for Easter,
    partly for the amusements and partly for the Church services;
    for on many of the coffee estates there is no church within a
    reasonable distance.</p>

    <p>About four o'clock the carriage came round for us, and
    having despatched the luggage in a gharry, we drove round the
    lovely lake, and so out to Peradeniya, where our friend lives,
    close to the Botanic Gardens. Many of the huts and cottages by
    the roadside have 'small-pox' written upon them in large
    letters, in three languages, English, Sanscrit, and Cingalese,
    a very sensible precaution, for the natives are seldom
    vaccinated, and this terrible disease is a real scourge amongst
    them. Having reached the charming bungalow, it was a real
    luxury to lounge in a comfortable easy chair in a deep cool
    verandah, and to <span class="pagenum">Page
    431<a name="Page_431"
       id="Page_431"></a></span>inhale the fragrance of the
       flowers, whilst lazily watching the setting of the sun.
       Directly it dipped below the horizon, glowworms and
       fireflies came out, bright and numerous as though the stars
       had come down to tread, or rather fly, a fairy dance among
       the branches of the tall palm-trees high overhead. Our rooms
       were most comfortable, and the baths delicious. After dinner
       we all adjourned once more to the verandah to watch the
       dancing fireflies, the lightning, and the heavy
       thunderclouds, and enjoy the cool evening breeze. You in
       England who have never been in the tropics cannot appreciate
       the intense delight of that sensation. Then we went to bed,
       and passed a most luxurious night of cool and comfortable
       sleep, not tossing restlessly about, as we had been doing
       for some time past.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, April 1st</i>.&mdash;I awoke before daylight. Our
    bed faced the windows, which were wide open, without blinds,
    curtains, or shutters, and I lay and watched the light
    gradually creeping over the trees, landscape, and garden, and
    the sun rising glorious from behind the distant mountains,
    shining brightly into the garden, drawing out a thousand fresh
    fragrances from every leaf and flower.</p>

    <p>By seven o'clock we found ourselves enjoying an early tea
    within the pretty bungalow in the centre of the Botanic
    Gardens, and thoroughly appreciating delicious fresh butter and
    cream, the first we have tasted for ages. We went for the most
    delightful stroll afterwards, and saw for the first time many
    botanical curiosities, and several familiar old friends growing
    in greater luxuriance than our eyes are even yet accustomed to.
    The groups of palms were most beautiful. I never saw anything
    finer than the tallipot-palm, and the areca, with the
    beetle-vine climbing round it; besides splendid specimens of
    the kitool or jaggery-palm. Then there was the palmyra, which
    to the inhabitant of the North of Ceylon is what the cocoa-nut
    is to the inhabitant of the South&mdash;food, clothing, and
    lodging. The pitcher-plants and the rare scarlet amherstia
    looked lovely, as did also the <span class="pagenum">Page
    432<a name="Page_432"
       id="Page_432"></a></span>great groups of yellow and green
       stemmed bamboos. There were magnolias, shaddocks, hibiscus,
       the almost too fragrant yellow-flowered champac, sacred to
       Hindoo mythology; nutmeg and cinnamon trees, tea and coffee,
       and every other conceivable plant and tree, growing in the
       wildest luxuriance. Through the centre of the gardens flows
       the river Ambang Ganga, and the whole 140 acres are laid out
       so like an English park that, were it not for the unfamiliar
       foliage, you might fancy yourself at home.</p>

    <p>We drove back to our host's to breakfast, and directly
    afterwards started in two carriages to go to church at Kandy.
    The church is a fine large building, lofty, and cool, and well
    ventilated. This being Easter Sunday, the building was lavishly
    decorated with palms and flowers. The service was well
    performed, and the singing was excellent. The sparrows flew in
    and out by the open doors and windows. One of the birds was
    building a nest in a corner, and during the service she added
    to it a marabout feather, a scrap of lace, and an end of pink
    riband. It will be a curious nest when finished, if she adds at
    this rate to her miscellaneous collection.</p>

    <p>After church we walked to the Government House. Sir William
    Gregory is, unfortunately for us, away in Australia, and will
    not return till just after our departure. The entrance to it
    was gay with gorgeous scarlet lilies, brought over by some
    former Governor from South America. It is a very fine house,
    but unfinished. We wandered through the 'banquet halls
    deserted,' and then sat a little while in the broad cool airy
    verandah looking into the beautiful garden and on to the
    mountain beyond.</p>

    <p>At half-past eleven it was time to leave this delightfully
    cool retired spot, and to drive to a very pleasant luncheon,
    served on a polished round walnut-wood table, without any
    tablecloth, a novel and pretty plan in so hot a climate. As
    soon as it became sufficiently cool we went on round the upper
    lake and to the hills above, whence we
    <span class="pagenum">Page 433<a name="Page_433"
       id="Page_433"></a></span>looked down upon Kandy, one of the
       most charmingly placed cities in the world. As we came back
       we stopped for a few minutes at the Court, a very fair
       specimen of florid Hindoo architecture, where the judges
       sit, and justice of all kinds is administered, and where the
       Prince of Wales held the installation of the Order of St.
       Michael and St. George during his visit. We also looked in
       at some of the bazaars, to examine the brass chatties and
       straw-work. Then came another delicious rest in the verandah
       among the flowers until it was time for dinner. Such flowers
       as they are! The Cape jessamines are in full beauty just
       now, and our host breaks off for us great branches laden
       with the fragrant bloom.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, April 2nd</i>.&mdash;Before breakfast I took a
    stroll all round the place, with our host, to look at his
    numerous pets, which include spotted deer, monkeys, and all
    sorts of other creatures. We also went to the stables, and saw
    first the horses, and the horsekeepers with their pretty Indian
    wives and children. Then we wandered down to the bamboo-fringed
    shores of the river, which rises in the mountains here, and
    flows right through the island to Trincomalee.</p>

    <p>At eleven o'clock Tom and I said 'good-bye' to the rest of
    the party, and went by train to Gampola, to take the coach to
    Neuera-ellia, where we were to stay with an old friend. We went
    only a dozen miles in the train, and then were turned out into
    what is called a coach, but is really a very small rough
    wagonnette, capable of holding six people with tolerable
    comfort, but into which seven, eight, and even nine were
    crammed. By the time the vehicle was fully laden, we found
    there was positively no room for even the one box into which
    Tom's things and my own had all been packed; so we had to take
    out indispensable necessaries, and tie them up in a bundle like
    true sailors out for a holiday, leaving our box behind, in
    charge of the station-master, until our return. The first part
    of <span class="pagenum">Page 434<a name="Page_434"
       id="Page_434"></a></span> the drive was not very
       interesting, the road passing only through paddy-fields and
       endless tea and coffee plantations. We reached Pusillawa
       about two o'clock, where we found a rough and ready sort of
       breakfast awaiting us. Thence we had a steep climb through
       some of the finest coffee estates in Ceylon, belonging to
       the Rothschilds, until we reached Rangbodde. Here there was
       another delay of half an hour; but although we were anxious
       to get on, to arrive in time for dinner, it was impossible
       to regret stopping amidst this lovely scenery. The house
       which serves as a resting-place is a wretched affair, but
       the view from the verandah in front is superb. A large river
       falls headlong over the steep wall of rock, forming three
       splendid waterfalls, which, uniting and rushing under a fine
       one-arched bridge, complete this scene of beauty and
       grandeur.</p>

    <p>We were due at Neuera-ellia at six, but we had only one pair
    of horses to drag our heavy load up the steep mountain road,
    and the poor creatures jibbed, kicked over the traces, broke
    them three times, and more than once were so near going over
    the edge of the precipice that I jumped out, and the other
    passengers, all gentlemen, walked the whole of that stage. The
    next was no better, the fresh pair of horses jibbing and
    kicking worse than ever. At last one kicked himself free of all
    the harness, and fell on his back in a deep ditch. If it had
    not been so tiresome, it really would have been very laughable,
    especially as everybody was more or less afraid of the poor
    horse's heels, and did not in the least know how to extricate
    him.</p>

    <p>In this dilemma our hunting experiences came in usefully,
    for with the aid of a trace, instead of a stirrup leather,
    passed round his neck, half-a-dozen men managed to haul the
    horse on to his legs again; but the pitchy darkness rendered
    the repair of damages an exceedingly difficult task. The
    horses, moreover, even when once more in their proper position,
    declined to move, but the gentlemen pushed and the drivers
    flogged and shouted, <span class="pagenum">Page
    435<a name="Page_435"
       id="Page_435"></a></span>and very slowly and with many stops
       we ultimately reached the end of that stage. Here we found a
       young horse, who had no idea at all of harness; so after a
       vain attempt to utilise his services, another was sent for,
       thus causing further delay.</p>

    <p>It was now nine o'clock, and we were all utterly exhausted.
    We managed to procure from a cottage some new-laid eggs and
    cold spring water, and these eaten raw, with a little brandy
    from a hunting-flask, seemed to refresh us all. There was again
    a difficulty in starting, but, once fairly under way, the road
    was not so steep and the horses went better. I was now so
    tired, and had grown so accustomed to hairbreadth escapes,
    that, however near we went to the edge of the precipice, I did
    not feel capable of jumping out, but sat still and watched
    listlessly, wondering whether we should really go over or not.
    After many delays we reached Head-quarter House, where the
    warmth of the welcome our old friend gave us soon made us
    forget how tired we were. They had waited dinner until
    half-past seven, and had then given us up. There were blazing
    wood fires both in the drawing-room and in our bedroom, and in
    five minutes a most welcome dinner was put before us.
    Afterwards we could have stayed and chatted till midnight, but
    we were promptly sent off to bed, and desired to reserve the
    rest of our news until morning.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, April 3rd</i>.&mdash;A ten o'clock breakfast
    afforded us ample opportunity for a delicious rest and
    letter-writing beforehand. Afterwards we strolled round the
    garden, full of English flowers, roses, carnations, mignonette,
    and sweet peas. Tom and the gentlemen went for a walk, whilst
    we ladies rested and chatted and wrote letters.</p>

    <p>After lunch we all started&mdash;a large party&mdash;to go
    to the athletic sports on the racecourse, where an impromptu
    sort of grand stand had been erected&mdash;literally a stand,
    for there were no seats. There were a great many people, and
    the regimental band played very well. To us it appeared a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 436<a name="Page_436"
       id="Page_436"></a></span>warm damp day, although the weather
       was much cooler than any we have felt lately. This is
       <i>the</i> week of the year, and everybody is here from all
       parts of the island. People who have been long resident in
       the tropics seem to find it very cold; for the men wore
       great-coats and ulsters, and many of the ladies velvet and
       sables, or sealskin jackets. On the way back from the sports
       we drove round to see something of the settlement; it cannot
       be called a town, for though there are a good many people
       and houses, no two are within half a mile of one another.
       There are two packs of hounds kept here, one to hunt the big
       elk, the other a pack of harriers. The land-leeches, which
       abound in this neighbourhood, are a great plague to horses,
       men, and hounds. It rained last night, and I was specially
       cautioned not to go on the grass or to pick flowers, as
       these horrid creatures fix on one's ankle or arm without the
       slightest warning. I have only seen one, I am thankful to
       say, and have escaped a bite; but everybody seems to dread
       and dislike them.</p>

    <p>After dinner we went to a very pleasant ball, given by the
    Jinkhana Club, at the barracks. The room was prettily decorated
    with the racing jackets and caps of the riders in the races,
    and with scarlet wreaths of geranium and hibiscus mingled with
    lycopodium ferns and selaginella. We did not remain very late
    at the ball, as we had to make an early start next morning; but
    the drive home in the moonlight was almost as pleasant as any
    part of the entertainment.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 4th</i>.&mdash;We were called at four
    o'clock, and breakfasted at five, everybody appearing either in
    dressing-gowns or in habits to see us set off. They all tried
    to persuade us to stay for the meet of the hounds at the house
    to-day. Another ball to-night, and more races, and another ball
    to-morrow; but we are homeward bound, and must hurry on. It was
    a lovely morning, and we waited with great patience at the
    post-house for at least an <span class="pagenum">Page
    437<a name="Page_437"
       id="Page_437"></a></span>hour and a half, and watched the
       hounds come out, meet, find, and hunt a hare up and down,
       and across the valley, with merry ringing notes that made us
       long to be on horseback.</p>

    <p>We saw all the racehorses returning from their morning
    gallop, and were enlightened by the syces as to their names and
    respective owners. There were several people, a great deal of
    luggage, and, though last not least, Her Majesty's mails, all
    waiting, like us, for the coach. About a quarter to seven a
    message arrived, to the effect that the horses would <i>not</i>
    come up the hill, they had been jibbing for more than an hour,
    so would we kindly go down to the coach. A swarm of coolies
    immediately appeared from some mysterious hiding-place, and
    conveyed us all, bag and baggage, down the hill, and packed us
    into the coach. Even this concession on our part did not induce
    the horses to make up their minds to move for at least another
    quarter of an hour. Then we had to stop at the hotel to pick up
    somebody else; but at last we had fairly started, eleven people
    in all, some inside and some perched on a box behind. The
    horses were worse than ever, tired to death, poor things; and
    as one lady passenger was very nervous and insisted on walking
    up all the acclivities, we were obliged to make up our pace
    down the hills. The Pass looked lovely by daylight, and the
    wild flowers were splendid, especially the white datura and
    scarlet rhododendron trees, which were literally covered with
    bloom.</p>

    <p>By daylight, the appearance of the horses was really
    pitiable in the extreme&mdash;worn-out, half-starved wretches,
    covered with wounds and sores from collars and harness, and
    with traces of injuries they inflict on themselves in their
    struggles to get free. When once we had seen their shoulders,
    we no longer wondered at their reluctance to start; it really
    made one quite sick to think even of the state they were
    in.<span class="pagenum">Page 438<a name="Page_438"
       id="Page_438"></a></span></p>

    <p>If some of the permanent officials were to devote a portion
    of their time to endeavours to introduce American coaches, and
    to ameliorate the condition of the horses on this road, they
    would indeed confer a boon on their countrymen. The coachman,
    who was as black as jet, and who wore very little clothing, was
    a curious specimen of his class, and appeared by no means
    skilled in his craft. He drove the whole way down the steep
    zigzag road with a loose rein; at every turn the horses went
    close to the precipice, but were turned in the very nick of
    time by a little black boy who jumped down from behind and
    pulled them round by their traces without touching the bridle.
    We stopped at Rangbodde to breakfast, and again at Pusillawa.
    This seemed a bad arrangement, for we were already late; it
    resulted in the poor horses having to be unmercifully flogged
    in order to enable us to catch the train at Gampola, failing
    which, the coach proprietors would have had to pay a very heavy
    penalty.</p>

    <p>From Gampola we soon arrived at Peradeniya, where we met Mr.
    Freer, who was going down to Colombo. Tom had decided
    previously to go straight on, so as to have the yacht quite
    ready for an early start to-morrow. I in the meantime went to
    our former hosts for one night to pick up Mabelle and the waifs
    and strays of luggage.</p>

    <p>On my way from the station to the house, going over the
    Satinwood Bridge, from which there is a lovely view of the
    Peacock Mountain, I saw an Englishman whom we had observed
    before, washing stones in the bed of the river for gems. He has
    obtained some rubies and sapphires, though only of small size,
    and I suppose he will go on washing for ever, hoping to find
    something larger and more valuable. On one part of the coast of
    the island near Managgan the sands on the side of one of the
    rivers are formed of rubies, sapphires, garnets, and other
    precious stones washed down by the current, but they are all
    ground to pieces in the process, not one being left as big
    <span class="pagenum">Page 439<a name="Page_439"
       id="Page_439"></a></span>as a pin's head. The effect in the
       sunlight, when this sand is wet with the waves, is something
       dazzling, and proves that the accounts of my favourite
       Sindbad are not so fabulous as we prosaic mortals try to
       make out. The island must be rich in gems, for they seem to
       be picked up with hardly any trouble. At Neuera-ellia it is
       a favourite amusement for picnic parties to go out
       gem-hunting, and frequently they meet with very large and
       valuable stones by the riverside or near deserted pits,
       large garnets, cinnamon-stone, splendid cat's-eyes,
       amethysts, matura diamonds, moonstone, aquamarine,
       tourmaline rubies, and sapphires.</p>

    <p>On my arrival at the house I found that Mabelle had just
    returned with some friends, who had kindly taken charge of her
    during our absence, and that a very old friend had arrived
    almost directly we left on Monday, and had departed early this
    morning to climb Adam's Peak, the ascent of which is a long and
    tedious affair, but it cannot be difficult, as thousands of
    aged and infirm pilgrims go every year to worship at the
    Buddhist or Mohammedan temples at the summit. The giant
    footprint has been reverenced alike by both religions from the
    earliest ages. Its existence is differently accounted for,
    however, by the two sects. The Buddhists say it is the
    footprint of Buddha, and that an account of its origin was
    written 300 or 400 years B.C. The Mohammedans say that it is
    the first step Adam took when driven out of Paradise. They do
    not quarrel about it, however, but live very happily close
    beside one another in their respective temples on the very
    small summit of the mountain. The iron chains, still used by
    the pilgrims and visitors to assist them up the last weary
    flight of steps, are said to have been placed there in the time
    of Alexander the Great, and are mentioned by successive
    historians.</p>

    <p>After lunch I went to rest, thoroughly tired out with the
    hard work of the last two days, whilst the gentlemen went into
    Kandy, to see Buddha's tooth and a Brahmin temple.</p>

    <p>Just before sunset we went to have a last look at those
    lovely Botanical Gardens. They were more beautiful than ever in
    the afternoon light, and I saw many things which had escaped my
    notice before. I have made acquaintance with the taste of all
    sorts of new fruits while here, more than in our former
    journey; but this is to be explained by the proximity of the
    Botanical Gardens. I expected to revel in fruit all through the
    tropics, but, except at Tahiti, we have not done so at all.
    There is one great merit in tropical fruit, which is, that
    however hot the sun may be, when plucked from the tree it is
    always icy cold; if left for <span class="pagenum">Page
    441<a name="Page_441"
       id="Page_441"></a></span>a few minutes, however, it becomes
       as hot as the surrounding atmosphere, and the charm is
       gone.</p>

    <p>On my return, when I went to dress for dinner, I found on my
    table a nasty-looking black beast about six inches long. It
    looked very formidable in the half-light, like a scorpion or
    centipede. It turned out, however, to be quite harmless, and a
    sort of millipede, and rather handsome, with jet-black rings,
    and hundreds of orange-coloured legs. There are a great many
    venomous snakes in Ceylon, but they always get out of the way
    as fast as they can, and never bite Europeans. All the roofs of
    the thatched bungalows swarm with rats, and in every house is
    kept a rat-snake, which kills and eats these rats. I more than
    once heard a great scuffle going on over my bedroom, which
    generally ended in a little squeak, indicating that the snake
    had killed, and was about to eat, his prey. One of the snakes
    came out one day in front of my window, and hung down two or
    three feet from the roof. If I had not been previously assured
    that he was perfectly harmless, it would have been rather an
    alarming apparition in the dark, and, even as it was, I must
    confess that for a moment I did feel rather frightened as I
    watched him spying about, darting his forked tongue in and out,
    and looking quite ready for a spring at my face.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, April 5th</i>.&mdash;Another early start by the
    seven o'clock train to Colombo. We were very sorry to say
    good-bye to our kind host, and when we took our departure, we
    were quite laden with flowers, good wishes, and messages for
    mutual friends in England. It was rather a hot journey down,
    and the train seemed full, but the scenery was lovely. As we
    approached Colombo the heat became greater, and in the town
    itself it was almost insupportable.</p>

    <p>We breakfasted at the hotel in the fort, where we were
    joined by Tom. There is one very curious thing about the hotels
    here. The sitting-rooms are all two stories high, with pointed
    raftered roofs. The bedrooms are only
    <span class="pagenum">Page 442<a name="Page_442"
       id="Page_442"></a></span>screened off from each other, and
       from the central room, by partitions eight or ten feet high,
       so that you can hear everything going on from end to end of
       the building. I am not at all sure that the larger amount of
       ventilation secured by this plan compensates for the extra
       amount of noise and want of privacy, especially when, as was
       the case to-day, there is a crying baby who refuses to be
       pacified in one of the rooms, a poor little girl ill with
       whooping cough in another, and some very noisy people, who
       are making themselves both unhappy and cross over some lost
       keys, in a third.</p>

    <p>While we were at breakfast the crows were most amusing and
    impertinent. Every door and window was open, and they were
    perched on the top of the punkah, or on the iron crossbars
    supporting the roof, watching their opportunity to pounce down
    and carry off the bits left on our plates. They did not seem to
    mind the waiters a bit, and, with their heads cocked on one
    side, looked as droll and saucy as possible. People tell you
    all sorts of funny stories about them; but though they are very
    entertaining to watch, and apparently perfectly tame, it
    appears to be impossible to capture one alive.</p>

    <p>By the time breakfast was over, we found that the 'Sunbeam'
    was already under way, and steaming about the anchorage; so it
    was not long before we were once more on board. Going out of
    harbour we passed a large steamer whose passengers and crew
    cheered us and waved their handkerchiefs until we were out of
    sight, and with that pleasant homely sound ringing in our ears
    we bade a last farewell to Colombo, and started on another
    stage of our homeward voyage. The heat was intense, and there
    was a roll outside which at once made me feel very
    uncomfortable. There was no wind all the afternoon, and the sun
    sank into the sea, glorious and golden, as we took our last
    look at the lovely island of Ceylon, the land of spice and
    fragrance and beauty.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, April 6th</i>.&mdash;Our visit to Ceylon has been
    so delightful that I wish it could have been prolonged for a
    month, instead of lasting only a week; but in that case I
    should have preferred to select a cooler season of the year,
    when travelling is more practicable. A most interesting journey
    could be made through the centre of the island to see the
    ancient cities, temples, and tanks, over the road from Matelle
    to Nalandi Senadoora, to the curious rock temple at Dambool,
    near which is the fortified rock of Sigiri, and a few miles
    further are the vast ruins of Topari, or Ponamira, the
    medi&aelig;val capital of Ceylon. It is full of wonderful
    ruins, some of them among the oldest in the world. The Ranhol
    Dagoba, the Jayti Wana Rama, and the Galle Wihara and rock
    temple, carved out of the living rock, are alone worth a long
    journey to see. Then think of visiting Anajapoora, the city of
    rubies, the sacred capital of the kingdom of ruins, on whose
    splendours even the Chinese travellers of the early ages used
    to expatiate with fervour. From this point it would be easy to
    reach the peninsula of Jaffna, which has been peopled with
    Tammils for more than two thousand years. It is the country
    <i>par excellence</i> of gardens exquisitely kept, and
    skilfully irrigated on the <span class="pagenum">Page
    444<a name="Page_444"
       id="Page_444"></a></span>old Moorish system. Here are grown
       all the ingredients for the making of curry, which are sent
       to all parts of this island and to Southern India. The most
       important crop of all, however, is tobacco, whose excellence
       is famed throughout India, and of which the Rajah of
       Travancore holds the monopoly.</p>

    <p>Then one might go southward from Jaffna, past Aripo, and the
    Gulf of Calpentyn, until the curious reef of Adam's Bridge was
    reached, which almost connects Ceylon with India. People say it
    has been separated by some convulsion of nature in former days,
    and that the passage is gradually deepening; but recent
    examinations have shown that instead of being a remnant of the
    original rock by which Ceylon is supposed to have been once
    connected with the Indian continent, it is in reality a
    comparatively recent ridge of conglomerate and ironstone,
    covered with alluvial deposits carried by the current and
    heaped up at this particular point; whilst the gradual rising
    of the coast has contributed to give the reef its present
    altitude.</p>

    <p>Balchus tells a most improbable story of fifteen Portuguese
    frigates escaping through the passage of Panupam, when pursued
    by some Dutch cruisers in 1557. Formerly the Straits were only
    thirty-five yards wide, with a maximum depth of six feet of
    water, but lately they have been widened and deepened by ten
    feet, and a little Government steamer frequently passes through
    on a tour round the island. At present a sailing ship going
    from Bombay to Madras has to make a curve of five thousand
    miles in order to weather the Maldives and Ceylon. It seems a
    long course for any vessel drawing over ten feet of water to be
    obliged to take.</p>

    <p>In the centre of the channel there is a little island where
    a Dutch establishment for horse-breeding formerly stood, the
    original stud having been imported from Arabia. The horses were
    all turned into corrals and caught by means of lassos, and then
    conquered by domidores, exactly as they are at the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 445<a name="Page_445"
       id="Page_445"></a></span>present day in South America. Now
       the stud is dispersed, the buildings are in ruins, and all
       that remains is the Indian pagoda, where religious
       ceremonies, curious processions, and dances of nautch-girls
       occasionally take place and are attended by great crowds. To
       the southward again of Adam's Bridge is the celebrated Gulf
       of Manaar, from which the best pearls come.</p>

    <p>This is an exceptionally good year for pearls, and the price
    of the shells went up many rupees per thousand in the first
    week. The pearl fishery can be reached in about eight hours by
    steam from Colombo, and it would have been delightful to have
    visited it, had time permitted. We were shown an oyster with
    some beautiful pearls in it, all found in the one shell. When a
    boat with pearls reaches the shore, the shells are divided into
    equal heaps, one-fourth going to the boat's crew, and
    three-fourths to the Government Inspector. They keep whichever
    heap he chooses to kick; so that, being uncertain which they
    will get for themselves, the boat's crew are sure to make a
    fair division. These heaps are then divided and sold by auction
    in thousands, and then subdivided again and again. Of course it
    is always a matter of speculation as to whether you get good
    pearls, bad pearls, or no pearls at all, though this last
    misfortune seldom happens.</p>

    <p>The love of gambling is inherent in every Oriental mind, and
    the merest beggar with but a few pice in his wallet to buy his
    daily food will invest them in a small number of oyster-shells,
    hoping to find a pearl of great value; and, should he fail to
    do so, he contents himself with eating the oyster and hoping
    for better luck next time. The shells are generally left on the
    sand in carefully guarded heaps till they die and open, when
    the pearls are extracted, and the fish left to decay. Some of
    the oysters are taken in sealed-up sacks to Colombo, Kandy, and
    other inland places, in order to enable people to indulge their
    love of gambling and speculation, without the trouble of a
    journey <span class="pagenum">Page 446<a name="Page_446"
       id="Page_446"></a></span>to Manaar. Though called oysters,
       they are not the proper oyster, but a sort of avicula
       (<i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i> being the name given by
       Samarik), very different from the large mother-of-pearl
       shells in which the South Sea pearls are found.</p>

    <p>I have not been able to keep my mind from running
    incessantly on Sir Emerson Tennent's delightful book on Ceylon,
    which describes places we have not ourselves visited, but which
    I wanted very much to see, and I have been so interested
    reading about them that I cannot help thinking other people
    will share my feelings. It seems wonderful that so much which
    is strange, beautiful, and interesting should be so easy of
    access from England, and yet that so few English travellers
    know comparatively anything of Ceylon, except Galle and
    Colombo, and perhaps Kandy and Trincomalee.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, April 7th</i>.&mdash;To-day we passed close to
    the island of Minnikoy, between the groups of islands called
    the Laccadives and Maldives, some of which we saw dotting the
    horizon; and still further to the south stretches the Chagos
    Archipelago. It was very hot all day, with hardly a breath of
    air, and we have all returned to our former light and airy
    costumes: the gentlemen to their shirts and trousers, the
    children to their pinafores and nothing else, and I to my
    beloved Tahitian dresses.</p>

    <p>Before we left England we could not make ourselves believe
    what we were told about heat in the tropics; so we started with
    very few windsails and without any punkahs or double awnings.
    It was all very well in the Atlantic or Pacific, but between
    Hongkong and Singapore the state of things became simply
    unbearable. The carpenter has rigged up a punkah, and the men
    have improvised some double awnings. At Colombo they made some
    windsails, so we are now better off than on our last hot
    voyage. It has been really hotter than ever to-day, but a
    pleasant breeze sprang up in the afternoon.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 447<a name="Page_447"
       id="Page_447"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Sunday, April 8th</i>.&mdash;A delightful fresh morning
    after a cool night. Everybody looks quite different, and we
    begin to hope we shall carry the north-east monsoon right
    across, which would be an exceptional piece of good fortune. We
    had service in the saloon at eleven o'clock and at four, and
    though there was an unusually full attendance it was cool and
    pleasant even without the punkah. The thermometer registers
    nearly the same as it did on Friday, when we were all dead with
    the heat. The apparently nice cool breeze that refreshes our
    heated bodies does not produce any corresponding effect on the
    glassy surface of the ocean; for we find to-day, as on previous
    occasions, that the temperature, both of the water and of the
    air, registered by the thermometer, does not by any means
    correspond with the effect on the human frame.</p>

    <p>The two Chinese servants we shipped at Hongkong are a great
    success, as every one on board agrees. Even the old sailing
    master is obliged to confess that the two 'heathen Chinee' keep
    the mess rooms, ships' officers' and servants' berths much
    cleaner and more comfortable than his own sailors ever
    succeeded in doing. At Galle we shipped three black firemen,
    two from Bombay and one from Mozambique, a regular nigger, with
    his black woolly hair clipped into the shape of Prince of Wales
    feathers. Their names are Mahomet, Abraham, and Tom Dollar.
    They live in a little tent we have had pitched for them on
    deck, cook their own food, and do their work in the engine-room
    exceedingly well. In the intervals they are highly amused with
    the children's picture books. The picture of the durbar at
    Delhi delighted them, especially as they recognised the
    figures, and learned a little English through them. They can
    say a few words already, and have told me all about their wives
    and children at Mozambique and Bombay, and have shown me the
    presents they are taking home to them. They have been nearly a
    year on board the P. and O. steamship 'Poonah,' and appear to
    <span class="pagenum">Page 448<a name="Page_448"
       id="Page_448"></a></span>have saved nearly all their
       earnings. I do not suppose our own men could have stood the
       fearful heat below in the engine-room for many days
       together, so it was fortunate we met with these amiable
       salamanders.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, April, 9th</i>.&mdash;No wind. We passed through
    a large shoal of porpoises, and at dusk we saw the light of a
    distant ship. At all the places we have recently visited we
    have found excellent ice-making machines, and have been able to
    get a sufficient supply to last us from port to port, which has
    been a great comfort. The machine at Colombo unfortunately
    broke down the day before we left, so that in the very hottest
    part of our voyage we have had to do without our accustomed
    luxury; and very much we miss it, not only for cooling our
    drinks, but for keeping provisions, &amp;c. As it is, a sheep
    killed overnight is not good for dinner next day; butter is
    just like oil, and to-day in opening a drawer my fingers
    touched a sticky mess; I looked and discovered six sticks of
    sealing wax running slowly about in a state resembling
    treacle.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 11th</i>.&mdash;Hotter than ever. We
    could see a steamer in the far distance. About sunset we passed
    through a shoal of flying-fish; the night was intensely hot,
    and everybody slept on deck.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, April 13th</i>.&mdash;At 6 a.m. we made the
    island of Sokotra, and about seven o'clock saw 'The Brothers,'
    two islands where large quantities of turtle and ambergris are
    found. Though generally uninhabited, they are sometimes visited
    by the natives for the purpose of collecting articles of
    commerce.</p>

    <p>One of our large pigs took it into his head to jump
    overboard to-day. The helm was put round as quickly as
    possible, but the most anxious spying could not discover any
    trace of poor piggy's whereabouts; so we proceeded on our
    original course for a few minutes, when suddenly, to our great
    astonishment, we saw him alongside, having been nearly run
    down, but still gallantly swimming along. The dingy
    <span class="pagenum">Page 449<a name="Page_449"
       id="Page_449"></a></span>was lowered and two men sent in
       pursuit. They had, however, no easy task before them, for as
       soon as they approached, piggy swam away faster than they
       could row, and bit and fought most furiously when they tried
       to get him into the boat. It was a good half-hour's work
       before he was secured, yet when he arrived he did not appear
       to be in the least exhausted by his long swim, but bit and
       barked at everybody so furiously that he was condemned to
       death, to prevent the possibility of further accidents. It
       is quite clear from the foregoing incident that some pigs
       can swim, and swim very well too, without cutting their own
       throats in the process.</p>

    <p>All the afternoon a large steamer had been gradually gaining
    on us. We exchanged signals and made out that she was the
    'Calypso' (?) of Glasgow. About half-past five she altered her
    course and came alongside to speak us. The fore-deck was
    crowded with the crew. On the bridge were many of the officers;
    and sitting bolt upright on a stool, 'looking out forward' in
    the most amusing manner, was the captain's little Skye terrier.
    The stern was crowded with passengers, of every shade of
    colour. To our surprise a voice from among them shouted out
    'Three cheers for Mr. Brassey!' which was responded to by
    ringing shouts from all on board, and taken up again by some of
    our own men. It was a very pleasant and unexpected greeting to
    hear in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The ship soon drew
    ahead again, but handkerchiefs and caps were waved till their
    owners faded away into the distance. Meeting and passing
    thousands of people as you at home do daily, you can hardly
    understand the excitement a little incident like this causes on
    board ship, where even a distant sail in these lonely oceans
    makes everybody leave his occupation and crowd to look at her.
    Soon after sunset we saw the island of Abd-al-Kuri, with its
    fantastic peaks, melting into orange, gold, and purple tints,
    beneath the gorgeous Arabian afterglow.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 450<a name="Page_450"
       id="Page_450"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Saturday, April 14th</i>.&mdash;We made Cape Rasalhir,
    formerly called Guardafui, about nine o'clock yesterday
    evening, and passing it during the night entered the Gulf of
    Aden<a name="FNanchor_21_21"
       id="FNanchor_21_21">.</a> <a href="#Footnote_21_21"
       class="fnanchor">[21]</a> All to-day we have been going
       along the Soumali coast. There is a good deal of trade
       carried on in native boats. Passing all these strange and
       comparatively unknown and little-visited islands and coasts,
       from which all sorts of things in daily use at home are
       brought, one dimly realises what commerce means and how
       necessary one part of the world is to the other.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_21_21"
           id="Footnote_21_21"></a>
           <a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a>
           We found considerable difficulty in making the light,
           and since our return there have been several wrecks, and
           many lives lost, on this dangerous point.</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Sunday, April 15th</i>.&mdash;Still intensely hot. The
    usual services were held on deck at eleven and four o'clock.
    The land, both in Arabia and in Africa, could be seen the whole
    day, with precipitous mountains. In the afternoon we could make
    out the rock of Aden, and at sunset it stood grandly forth,
    looming in purple darkness against the crimson and blood-red
    sky, which gradually faded to tenderest tints of yellow and
    green, before it finally blazed forth into a radiant afterglow.
    At half-past eight a gun from the fort at Aden summoned us to
    show our colours, or rather lights. At nine o'clock we dropped
    our anchor in the roads; a boat came off with a bag of
    newspapers and to ask for orders in the morning. It was sent by
    the great Parsee merchants here, who undertake to supply us
    with coals, provisions, water, and everything we want, and
    spare us all trouble. For the last three or four days we have
    had a nice little breeze astern, and if we had not been in a
    hurry to cross the Indian Ocean before the south-west monsoon
    set in, we should certainly have been contented with four or
    five knots an hour under sail instead of eight and a half under
    steam. We have averaged over 200 miles a day under steam alone,
    ever since we left Penang, and have burnt only four tons of
    coal for every fifty miles.<span class="pagenum">Page
    451<a name="Page_451"
       id="Page_451"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Monday, April 16th</i>.&mdash;At 1.30 a.m. I heard the
    signal gun fired, and shortly afterwards a great splash of
    boats and oars, and a vast chattering and shouting of tongues
    announced the arrival of a P. and O. steamer. She dropped her
    anchor just outside us, so we had the benefit of the noise all
    night. I got up at daylight and found the pilot just coming
    off. He took us to a buoy, a little closer in, and soon the
    business of coaling and watering commenced.</p>

    <p>We reached the shore about 7.30, and, landing at the pier,
    had our first near view of the natives, who are most
    curious-looking creatures. They have very black complexions,
    and long woolly hair, setting out like a mop all round, and
    generally dyed bright red, or yellow by the application of
    lime. Mr. Cowajee had sent his own private carriage to meet us.
    It was a comfortable open barouche, with a pair of nice horses,
    and two servants in Eastern liveries, green vests and full
    trousers, and red and orange turbans. We went first to his
    store, which seemed to be an emporium for every conceivable
    article. There was carved sandal-wood, and embroidered shawls
    from China, Surat, and Gujerat, work from India, English
    medicines, French lamps, Swiss clocks, German toys, Russian
    caviare, Greek lace, Havannah cigars, American hides and canned
    fruits, besides many other things. The feathers did not look
    very tempting; there was a great deal of feather and very
    little stem about most of them, and only a few were white, the
    majority being a pretty sort of brown and drab. But this
    general store is <span class="pagenum">Page
    452<a name="Page_452"
       id="Page_452"></a></span>only a very small part of their
       business, for about 60,000 tons of coal pass through their
       hands every year.</p>

    <p>We went on to the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe, which was by no
    means in first-rate order, but allowances must be made for a
    new house. A delightful breeze was blowing in through the open
    windows, and although the thermometer registered 85&deg; in the
    dining-room, it did not seem at all hot. The view over the bay
    is very pretty, and the scene on shore thoroughly Arabian, with
    the donkeys and camels patiently carrying their heavy loads,
    guided by the true Bedaween of the desert, and people of all
    tinges of complexion, from jet black to pale copper colour. A
    pair of tame ostriches, at least seven feet high, were
    strolling about the roadway, and a gazelle, some monkeys,
    parrots, and birds lived happily together beneath a broad
    verandah. After a little while we went for a drive to see the
    camp and town of Aden, which is four or five miles from the
    Point where everybody lands. On the way we met trains of
    heavily laden camels bringing in wood, water, grain, and
    fodder, for garrison consumption, and coffee and spices for
    exportation. After driving for about four miles we reached a
    gallery pierced through the rock, which admits you into the
    precincts of the fort. The entrance is very narrow, the sides
    precipitous, and the place apparently impregnable. We went all
    through the town, or rather towns, past the Arab village, the
    Sepoy barracks, and the European barracks, to the water tanks,
    stupendous works carved out of the solid rock, but until lately
    comparatively neglected, the residents depending entirely on
    distillation for their supply of water. There is a pretty
    little garden at the foot of the lowest tank, but the heat was
    intense in the bottom of the deep valley amongst the rocks,
    where every sun-ray seemed to be collected and reflected from
    the white glaring limestone, and every breath of air to be
    excluded. We saw a little more of the town and the market
    crowded with camels, the shops full of lion, leopard, and
    hy&aelig;na skins. We went to the officers' mess-house, visited
    the <span class="pagenum">Page 453<a name="Page_453"

       churches and the Mohammedan mosque, and then passing through
       two long tunnels, bored and blasted in the solid rock, we
       looked over the fortifications. Finally, we returned to the
       Point again by way of the Isthmus, and went to Government
       House, which gets a fresh breeze from every quarter. They
       say that to-day is hotter than usual, but it is never really
       very oppressive here unless there is an exceptionally hot
       wind blowing from the desert, but even that is partially
       cooled before it arrives. To us it appears delightful after
       our sultry voyage and the heat at Penang and Singapore.</p>

    <p>We are all agreeably disappointed with Aden, and find that
    it is by no means the oven we expected; it is prettier too than
    I thought, the mountains and rocks are so peaked and pointed,
    and although the general effect is one of barrenness, still, if
    you look closely, every crack and crevice is full of something
    green. The soil, being of volcanic origin, is readily
    fertilised by moisture, and at once produces some kind of
    vegetation. This adds of course greatly to the effect of
    colour, which in the rocks themselves is extremely beautiful,
    especially at sunrise and sunset. The sea, too, is delightfully
    blue on one side of the peninsula, and pale green on the other,
    according to the wind, and the white surf curls and breaks on
    the sandy shore beyond the crisp waves.</p>

    <p>We went back to the hotel a little before one, and found
    many friends had called during our absence. After
    superintending the children's dinner, I went with Tom to
    luncheon at Government House. It was very pleasant; General and
    Mrs. Schneider were more than kind, and the house felt
    deliciously cool and airy.</p>

    <p>We are told that thirty miles inland the country is
    sometimes very beautiful. There are exquisitely green valleys,
    with a stream running through them, amongst peaks, and rocky
    mountains, which one rarely sees in the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 454<a name="Page_454"
       id="Page_454"></a></span>desert. Here the natives cultivate
       their crops of corn&mdash;such corn as it is too, reaching
       six feet above a man's head! All sorts of useful vegetables
       grow abundantly, besides roses, fruits, and fragrant
       flowers, large supplies of which are brought daily into
       Aden. About ten miles from the town there are acres of the
       most fertile garden ground, which is cultivated to supply
       the garrison with vegetables. Sometimes a party of seventy
       or eighty men, and ten or twenty Arab guides, goes out for
       three weeks or a month at a time surveying. The natives are
       much more friendly than they used to be a few years ago,
       when people were afraid even to ride outside the town. Now
       pleasant excursions lasting a few days may be made,
       especially as there is very fair shooting to be got. After
       luncheon I was shown some lovely feathers. The contrast
       between these and the steamer-feathers is ludicrous; the
       price, too, is proportionately cheaper, for the feathers are
       infinitely better. Long, white, full, and curly feathers can
       be bought for much less than you give for them in England.
       We drove down to the town, finished our business
       transactions, and then went in the 'Vestal's' steam launch
       on board the 'Gamma,' one of the new Chinese gunboats on her
       way out to China.</p>

    <p>After afternoon tea we all adjourned to the 'Sunbeam,' where
    we found many other friends already arrived or arriving. We had
    only just time to look round before the sun set, and the short
    twilight was succeeded by the swift tropical darkness. All too
    soon good-bye had to be said; the anchor was raised, and we
    were actually drifting slowly along under our head canvas
    before our friends took their departure. It was a lovely
    evening, with a light fair breeze, and although there appeared
    hardly any wind, it was wonderful how swiftly we crept out of
    the harbour, and, as sail after sail was spread, how rapidly we
    glided past the land.</p>

    <p>Our visit to Aden has been short but very agreeable; it is
    not by any means such a dreadful place as we had
    <span class="pagenum">Page 455<a name="Page_455"
       id="Page_455"></a></span>always fancied. Most of the people
       we have seen to-day seem rather to like it; there is good
       boating, excellent sea fishing, moderate shooting, and many
       rides and excursions. A vehicle of some sort is an absolute
       necessity, however, if you want to see anything of your
       friends, for the three divisions of the settlement are at
       least four miles apart, and the heat is far too great for
       driving or riding in the middle of the day, except on
       business. I cannot say, however, that we ourselves found it
       intolerably hot to-day.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, April 17th</i>.&mdash;The breeze still continued
    and freshened, and we sailed along pleasantly before it,
    finding it a great relief to be rid of the thud and beat of the
    engine. There is no vibration, but the noise is unpleasant.
    About eleven o'clock we passed the island of Perim, a most
    desolate-looking place. I do not wonder that officers so much
    dislike being quartered there. It is an important position
    though, and is shortly to be strengthened, when water-tanks
    will be built, and attempts made to cultivate the soil. At
    present there does not appear to be a blade of vegetation, and
    on the side we passed, between the island and the coast of
    Arabia, nothing is to be seen but the little white lighthouse
    and the path leading up to it. On the southern side there is a
    very fair harbour and a moderate town. On the shore all round
    the island turtles are caught at the season when they land to
    deposit their eggs. To pass the island of Perim we sailed
    through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, or 'Gate of Tears,' thus
    called on account of the numerous wrecks which took place there
    in former years. Once through the straits, we were fairly in
    the Red Sea. The colour of the Red Sea is certainly the bluest
    of ultramarines. In the afternoon the town of Mocha Yamen,
    celebrated alike for its breed of Arab horses and its
    <span class="pagenum">Page 457<a name="Page_457"
       id="Page_457"></a></span>coffee, was visible from the
       masthead. It is a large white town, full of cupolas and
       minarets, surrounded with green as far as irrigation
       extends, and looking like a pearl set in emeralds on the
       margin of the deep blue sea against a background of red and
       yellow sand-mountains. Later in the afternoon we passed
       Great and Little Hamish, where the P. and O. boat, 'Alma,'
       was wrecked some fifteen years ago, and during the night
       sailed by Jebel Zibayar and Tukar.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 18th</i>.&mdash;In the morning, at
    daylight, we were off Jebel Teir, Mussawa Island, Annesley Bay
    lying 60 miles to the west. Our position was about 60 miles to
    the south-west of Mussawa Zoulia, where the expedition under
    Lord Napier of Magdala landed in 1867. At noon we had sailed
    221 miles, a most unexpected run in the Red Sea. In the
    afternoon it fell calm, but the wind freshened again, and we
    went on sailing until after midnight.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, April 19th</i>.&mdash;We commenced steaming at
    1 a.m., stopped, however, at 5 a.m., and sailed all day.
    Yesterday we were surrounded by some beautiful blue birds, who
    hovered about us and settled at intervals on the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 458<a name="Page_458"
       id="Page_458"></a></span>masts and yards. During the night
       two were caught napping by the men, and in the course of
       to-day two more, hotly pursued by a hawk, took refuge on
       board and were also captured. One was given to me. It
       appears to be a very beautiful kind of jay, with feathers of
       the most brilliant shades of blue. The men have killed their
       birds for the sake of the skins, but I mean to try and keep
       mine alive. At Colombo several birds and two curiously
       starred tortoises were added to our collection; and we took
       on board at Aden a gazelle, a black cockatoo, and a green
       monkey.</p>

    <p>We passed Souakim to-day, the port of Nubia. It is about 275
    miles, or 25 days' camel-journey, from thence to Berber on the
    Nile. The road passes through Korib, and among fine red granite
    and black basalt mountains, 4,000 feet high. We left one of the
    firemen, Tom Dollar, behind at Aden by mistake, and only found
    out yesterday that we had done so. It appears that he has a
    brother living there, whom he was most anxious to go and see
    directly the anchor was let go, in the morning. Unfortunately,
    he did not speak to us on the subject. He had never been in
    anything but a regular steamer before, and could not believe it
    possible that the 'Sunbeam' could spread her wings and be off
    without any preliminary 'fire-worshipping,' I am very sorry for
    the poor man, as he has left all his clothes and the wages he
    had earned on board the P. and O. steamer behind him. We must
    send them back from Suez, and telegraph to some one to look out
    for him. The heat is intense, and we all sleep on deck at
    night; the sunrises and sunsets are magnificent.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, April 20th</i>.&mdash;A little hotter still;
    there is no wind at all, and we are obliged to steam. In the
    morning we passed to the southward of Jeddo, the port of Mecca.
    Unfortunately it was so hazy that we could not distinguish
    anything whatever of the town or country, only a line of
    mountains rearing their heads above the clouds. We had
    <span class="pagenum">Page 459<a name="Page_459"
       id="Page_459"></a></span>hoped to be at Suez early on
       Sunday, but now I fear we shall not arrive until Monday.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, April 21st</i>.&mdash;Hotter and still hotter
    every day, says the thermometer, and so we say also. Everybody
    told us these would be our two hottest days, and certainly the
    prediction has been verified. We did not see a single ship all
    day, but in the afternoon passed Zambo, the port of Medina. A
    little before midnight we made the light on the D&aelig;dalus
    shoal on the starboard bow.</p>

    <p>This being Muriel's fifth birthday, Mabelle and the doctor
    and the men have been arranging a surprise for her all day, and
    none of us were allowed to go on the port side of the deck, but
    after dinner we were taken to a hastily fitted-up theatre, very
    prettily decorated with flags and Japanese lanterns. On a
    throne covered with the Union Jack, Muriel was seated, the two
    pugs being on footstools on either side of her to represent
    lions <i>couchant</i>. Some of the men had blackened their
    faces, and gave us a really very excellent Christy Minstrel
    entertainment, in which undreamed-of talent came to light. It
    is very odd and interesting how one is perpetually finding out
    something new about the men. Some of the crew we thought the
    most unpromising when we started, have turned out among our
    best men, always ready and willing for everything, while
    others, who at first appeared the best, have not proved so
    good. Many we knew well beforehand. On the whole, however, we
    have very little cause to complain of our crew; all pull well
    together when they are kept up to their work and have plenty to
    do.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, April 22nd</i>.&mdash;Clouds veiled the sunrise
    this morning, which was a welcome relief; still it was too hot
    for service in the saloon, and it was therefore held on deck. A
    light breeze sprang up ahead during its performance, which
    cooled and refreshed us immensely. About twelve o'clock we
    passed another pair of 'Brothers,' a couple of odd-looking
    rocks or islands, like tables, rising straight out of the sea;
    <span class="pagenum">Page 460<a name="Page_460"
       id="Page_460"></a></span>there is a beacon on the
       northernmost one. While we were at lunch, the breeze
       freshened so much that we were all glad to add some wraps to
       our light and airy costumes. A little later, a summer gale
       was blowing ahead, making some of us feel very uncomfortable
       and long for the halcyon days of the past, even with the
       accompaniment of the inevitable heat. Such is mankind, and
       womankind too for that matter, 'never blessed but always to
       be blessed.' The gale freshened, the screw was raised, the
       yacht pitched and rolled, and we were obliged to put her off
       her course and under sail before night fell. The spray came
       over the decks, and there was a strong wind dead ahead. We
       all felt cold and miserable, though the thermometer still
       registered 75&deg;. The poor monkeys and parrots looked most
       wretched and unhappy, and had to be packed away as speedily
       as possible. Nine monkeys in an empty wine case seemed very
       happy and cuddled together for warmth, but the two larger
       and more aristocratic members of the party required a box to
       themselves. The gazelle had a little tent pitched for him
       specially in a sheltered corner, and the birds were all
       stowed away and battened over in the smoking fiddle. Dinner
       was rather a lame pretence, and it was not long before we
       all retired, and certainly no one wished to take his or her
       mattress on deck to-night. It is the first night I have
       slept in a bed on board the yacht for many weeks, and a very
       disturbed night it was, for the waves ran high, and we have
       lately been sailing so steadily over smooth seas, that we
       did not know what to make of this.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, April 23rd</i>.&mdash;The gale blew as hard as
    ever, and quite as dead ahead. About noon we made the island of
    Shaduan, or isle of Seals, so named by the ancients, when the
    sea and gulf abounded with seals. There are still a few
    occasionally to be seen to the northward by the fishermen, and
    their skins are brought to Suez for sale. We are making tacks
    backwards and forwards across the narrow sea, an exciting
    amusement for a yachtsman, as <span class="pagenum">Page
    461<a name="Page_461"
       id="Page_461"></a></span>it requires constant attention. The
       sailing directions say that this sea is ill surveyed, except
       in the direct channel. There are many coral reefs and sunken
       rocks, and on whichever side you may happen to be wrecked,
       the natives are ready to rob, ill-treat, and kill you, or
       sell you as slaves in the interior. It was on two projecting
       coral reefs from the island of Shaduan, that the 'Carnatic'
       was wrecked in 1869. She ran ashore at four o'clock in the
       morning of the 13th of September, soon after having made the
       light on Rhas Garril. We were at Suez in October of the same
       year, and everybody was then full of the sad particulars of
       the wreck, the soldiers being especially useful in bringing
       in the passengers' luggage, which had been recovered from
       the Arabs. One of our firemen, Abraham, was on board the
       'Carnatic' at the time of the disaster, and lost all his
       worldly goods (not many, I should think, judging by what he
       has brought on board here).</p>

    <p>The sea was very rough and disagreeable all day. To us the
    temperature appears quite cool, indeed cold, though the
    thermometer still remains at 75&deg;. Our friends at Aden, who
    prophesied that I should want my sealskin jacket before leaving
    the Gulf of Suez, were not so far wrong in their
    prognostications as I imagined at the time.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, April 24th</i>.&mdash;We are still beating to
    windward against a head gale, and by noon had made sixty-five
    miles to the good, right in the wind's eye&mdash;not a bad
    performance, considering that the gale was blowing with a force
    of nine or ten. It has the merit of novelty too, for I suppose
    that for years no sailing ships have been seen in the Gulf of
    Suez. The winds blow so steadily for months together, that for
    six months in the year you cannot get into the Red Sea, and for
    the other six months you cannot get out of it.</p>

    <p>We passed the island of Rhas Garril, and soon afterwards a
    steamer went by, altering her course a good deal to inspect us.
    She evidently thought we were a broken-down
    <span class="pagenum">Page 462<a name="Page_462"
       id="Page_462"></a></span>steamer, and intended to come to
       our rescue. All yesterday and to-day we have been making
       flannel coats for the monkey, and covers for birdcages, and
       improvising shelters and snug corners for our pets. At night
       especially the wind is quite crisp. If this gale continues,
       it will be Thursday or Friday before we reach Suez; but it
       may possibly change to-night, and it looks now as if it were
       breaking.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, April 25th</i>.&mdash;At last the gale
    <i>has</i> broken. There was not much wind when I went on deck
    at 4 a.m., and by seven o'clock it was so nearly calm, that the
    funnel could be raised and fires lighted, and we were soon
    steaming straight for our destination. We could not see Mount
    Sinai on account of the mist, but made out the place where the
    Israelites are said to have crossed the Red Sea, and by four
    o'clock the town of Suez lay right ahead. The shores are very
    barren, not a blade of grass nor a scrap of vegetation being
    visible. Nothing is to be seen save mountain peaks, rocks,
    stones, and sand. But even this barren scene has a special
    beauty of its own, particularly at sunrise and sunset. The
    shapes of mountain and rock are alike striking, the sharp
    shadows are lovely, and the contrast of reds, yellows, and
    browns, with the bright blue sea and crisp white waves,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 463<a name="Page_463"
       id="Page_463"></a></span>is very beautiful. Even when the
       sun has set, and the rich tints have faded away, the full
       moon adds another charm to the landscape.</p>

    <p>This afternoon, as we were steaming up towards Suez, I had a
    chat with Mahomet, one of our Indian firemen, who was fringing
    a piece of muslin for a turban. I asked him if it was English.
    'No, Missy; no English&mdash;Switzerland; English no good; all
    gum and sticky stuff; make fingers dirty; all wash out; leave
    nothing.' In the South Sea and Sandwich Islands, and in the
    Malay Peninsula, the natives make the same complaints as to the
    Manchester cottons. At Hongkong some of the large shops had
    fifty expensive English ships' compasses on hand; they were all
    quite unsaleable owing to the liquid having gone bad, in
    consequence of its not having been properly prepared. Some
    American compasses of the same quality were in good order and
    not in the least affected by the climate. It will be a bad day
    when the confidence in England's honesty as a nation throughout
    the world, and consequently her well-earned supremacy in
    commerce, have passed away. The burden, unfortunately, will not
    fall on the heads of the offenders alone, but, as usual, the
    innocent will suffer with and for the guilty.</p>

    <p>After four o'clock we came near two steamers lying at
    anchor, and were shortly afterwards boarded by the captain of
    the port, the health officer, and sundry other functionaries.
    After a short delay we dropped anchor, and just as the sun was
    setting in 'purple and gold' behind the mountains of Arabia, we
    went ashore in the steam launch. We landed at the Canal
    Company's Office, in front of which there is a bust of
    Lieutenant Waghorn, the inaugurator of the overland route.</p>

    <p>At the office, the 'Sunbeam' was entered on the Company's
    books, and arrangements were made with the chief pilot for
    to-morrow, while the children amused themselves by riding a
    pony up and down, and jumping over the
    <span class="pagenum">Page 464<a name="Page_464"
       id="Page_464"></a></span>little brooks, and I strolled about
       admiring the enormous growth of the vegetation since we were
       here last in 1869. We next steamed five miles further on to
       the town of Suez, and landed opposite the big hotel, which
       is more uncomfortable than ever. The rooms are dirty, and
       the cooking execrable.</p>

    <p>There is nothing to see at Suez, but still we went for a
    ramble to see that nothing. We cleared our boxes and our
    letters, and then went on ankle deep in sand to the one
    European house, the railway station, the Arab quarter and the
    bazaars, where it is occasionally possible to pick up rather
    interesting little curiosities brought by the pilgrims from
    Mecca and Medina.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, April 26th</i>.&mdash;Such a sunrise as this
    morning's you could only see in Arabia or Egypt. There is a
    peculiarity about desert colouring at sunrise and sunset that
    can never be seen anywhere else. We had sundry visitors during
    the early morning, and before ten o'clock we were in the Canal
    and steaming on at regulation speed. As the sun rose the heat
    became intense, 96&deg; in the shade under double awnings. So
    far from there being a cool breeze to temper it, a hot wind
    blew from the desert, like the blast from a furnace. I stood on
    the bridge as long as I could bear the heat, to look at the
    strange desert view, which could be seen to great advantage in
    going through at the top of high water. Sand, sand everywhere;
    here a train of camels, there a few Arab tents, now a whole
    party shifting their place of abode; a group of women washing,
    or a drove of buffaloes in a small tributary stream. After
    going about eight miles we stopped at a <i>gare</i> (as the
    stopping-places are called) to allow three vessels to pass. One
    was a fine steamer belonging to the Ducal Line; the others were
    a Dutch and a German boat (one, the Friesland, has been since
    wrecked off Cape Finisterre, in December 1877). The cleanliness
    and general smartness of the former presented a great contrast
    to her companions, on which the <span class="pagenum">Page
    465<a name="Page_465"
       id="Page_465"></a></span>passengers looked very hot and
       uncomfortable. The centre part of each vessel was crowded
       with a large number of Dutch or German boys, going out as
       soldiers to Acheen, who certainly did not appear to be
       enjoying their voyage.</p>

    <p>We passed Chaloux and reached Ismailia just at nine o'clock,
    not without considerable effort on the part of the pilot. A
    steam launch came off from the shore, and we (children and all)
    landed at once; and, after a moonlight donkey ride, dined at
    the excellent H&ocirc;tel de Paris, kept by an old Frenchman.
    <i>Table-d'h&ocirc;te</i> was over, but they gave us a capital
    little dinner by ourselves. The children and I, and some of the
    gentlemen, start to-morrow, overland <i>vi&acirc;</i> Cairo, to
    join the yacht at Alexandria, in order that they may see the
    Pyramids. It was a glorious night as we rowed off to the yacht
    under the bright beams of the full moon, and the air, too, was
    quite fresh and cool&mdash;a most refreshing change from the
    noontide heat.</p>

    <p>The traffic on the Canal has increased during the last few
    years, and especially during the last few months; on an average
    four or five ships passed through every day. To-day they took
    6,000<i>l</i>. at the Suez Office alone. They have an excellent
    plan of the Canal there, and little models of ships, which are
    arranged according to the telegrams constantly received, so
    that the chief officers at each end of the Canal know exactly
    where every ship is. Instant information is of course sent of
    any stoppage or any accident, but these occur comparatively
    seldom. Some time ago M. Lesseps bought a small canal partially
    stopped up leading from the Nile at Cairo to Ismailia. It has
    been widened and deepened, and was opened a few weeks ago with
    great ceremony and grand doings. Now any vessel not drawing
    more than fourteen feet can go direct from Suez or Port Said to
    Cairo. If we had had time, we might have done it in the yacht,
    and lain at anchor almost under the shadow of the Pyramids of
    Cheops. The special object of the new canal is to make Cairo
    and Ismailia Egyptian <span class="pagenum">Page
    466<a name="Page_466"
       id="Page_466"></a></span> ports as well as Alexandria,
       thereby saving much land carriage and labour of shifting.
       Already several ships laden with grain, from Upper Egypt,
       have availed themselves of this new means of
       communication.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, April 27th</i>.&mdash;Another glorious sunrise.
    The pilot was on board at 5 a.m., and the Dhebash with fish,
    strawberries, and fresh vegetables. This is a beautiful
    climate, though there is scarcely any rain; only one very
    slight shower has occurred during the last three years at Suez,
    but the soil of the desert after the Nile overflow brings forth
    tenfold.</p>

    <p>The 'Sunbeam' was to start at eight o'clock, as soon as a
    large vessel had passed up from Port Said. There are only
    certain places in the Canal where vessels can pass one another,
    so one ship is always obliged to wait for another. We landed at
    half-past seven. The sun was already blazing with a burning
    fury, and we found it very hot riding up to the hotel on
    donkeys. We had an excellent breakfast at the same comfortable
    hotel, paid a very moderate bill, and left by the eleven
    o'clock train for Cairo. We stopped at Zag-&agrave;-zig for an
    hour for luncheon in a nice cool dark room, and started again
    about three o'clock. The change in the face of the country
    since we were here eight years ago is something extraordinary.
    A vast desert of sand has been transformed into one large oasis
    of undulating fields of waving corn, where there used to be
    nothing but whirlwinds of sand. All this has been effected by
    irrigation. The wealth of Egypt ought greatly to increase. How
    the people managed to live before is a mystery. Now every field
    is full of labourers reaping and stacking the corn, women
    gleaning, and in some places the patient, ugly black buffaloes
    ploughing the stubble for fresh crops.</p>

    <p>At half-past six we reached Cairo, and were conveyed in a
    large <i>char-&agrave;-bancs</i> to what was formerly
    Shepherd's Hotel, now partly rebuilt and much altered for the
    better. Even in that short drive we could see that the face of
    the <span class="pagenum">Page 467<a name="Page_467"
       id="Page_467"></a></span>capital of Egypt had altered as
       much as the country, though I am not sure that it is so
       greatly improved. After a refreshing dip in cool marble
       baths and a change of garments, we went down to the large
       <i>table-d'h&ocirc;te</i>. Then we sat in the verandah
       looking on the street until we became tired of doing
       nothing, after which we started for a stroll in the Ezkebieh
       gardens close by. They are beautifully laid out for evening
       promenade; but although the flowers are lovely, and the
       turf, thanks to constant waterings, is deliciously green,
       all the large trees have been cut down. There is no
       seclusion, no shade, which seems a pity in a country where
       the greatest desire of life is shelter from the noonday
       heat. To-night both Arab and French bands were playing
       within the enclosure, and it was pleasant enough listening
       to Offenbach's music under the beams of the full moonlight.
       Few people appeared to appreciate it, however, for the
       gardens were nearly empty; but then the season is over, and
       every one has fled before the coming heat.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, April 28th</i>.&mdash;We had settled to start
    at six o'clock this morning to visit the Pyramids, an excursion
    which had been for some little time eagerly looked forward to
    and talked about by the younger members of our party. The
    morning was cold and grey, a strong northerly wind was blowing,
    and the change from the weather which had prevailed but a few
    hours previously was altogether most striking and unexpected.
    We drove rapidly through the streets and the outskirts of the
    town, where old houses are being pulled down and new ones
    rapidly built up, and where a general air of new bricks and old
    rubbish pervades the scene. Then we crossed the Nile by a
    handsome iron bridge, and saw the Palace of Gezireh, where the
    Prince of Wales and his suite were lodged. We passed the
    railway extension works, and, to the great delight of the
    children, saw two elephants busily employed, one of which was
    being made to lie down to enable his mahout to dismount. Soon
    the little ones gave a shout of 'The Pyramids!' and there
    <span class="pagenum">Page 468<a name="Page_468"
       id="Page_468"></a></span>before us stood those grand
       monuments of a nameless founder, which for centuries have
       stood out in the sands of the desert, while the burning
       African sun and the glorious African moon have risen and set
       on their heavenward-pointing summits for countless days and
       nights. Even the earth has changed her position so much
       since they were erected that the pole star no longer sheds
       its light in a direct line through the central passages, as
       it did when first they were designed.</p>

    <p>We drove along under avenues of now leafless trees to the
    foot of the hill on which the Pyramids are situated. Here
    everybody was turned out to walk except Muriel and me, and a
    tremendous tug the horses had to drag even us two up to the
    real foot of the Pyramids. On arriving we were at once
    surrounded by a crowd of Arabs. They are certainly a
    fine-looking lot of men, rather clamorous for backshish, and
    anxious to sell their curiosities, real or imitation. They
    were, however, good-natured, civil, and obliging, and amused me
    much during the hour I spent alone with them while the rest of
    the party were ascending and descending the Pyramids. Many
    could speak several languages quite fluently, and almost all of
    them took a good deal of interest in the war, and the prospects
    of success on either side; while many had a fair knowledge of
    the geography of Europe. While all the rest were on the top of
    the one large Pyramid, a man ran down from the summit and up to
    the top of the next smaller one (which is, however, more
    difficult to ascend) in 'eight minutes for a franc' This feat
    was repeated several times by different men, but it really
    occupied nearer ten minutes.</p>

    <p>We ate some bread and wine, bought a few curiosities, and
    then drove back to the city, feeling very cold and shivery and
    regretting the wraps we had left behind. We reached the hotel
    just in time for twelve o'clock <i>table-d'h&ocirc;te</i>
    breakfast, and, after an acceptable rest, sallied forth again,
    this time on donkeys, to see the bazaars and the sunset from
    the <span class="pagenum">Page 469<a name="Page_469"
       id="Page_469"></a></span>citadel. We went across squares and
       gardens and through wide streets, for, alas! Cairo is being
       rapidly Haussmannised. For the capitalist or resident, Cairo
       may be improved, but for the traveller, the artist, the
       lover of the picturesque, the quaint, and the beautiful, the
       place is ruined. Cairo as a beautiful and ancient oriental
       city has ceased to exist, and is being rapidly transformed
       into a bad imitation of modern Paris, only with bluer skies,
       a more brilliant sun, and a more serene climate than it is
       possible to find in Europe. Only a few narrow streets and
       old houses are still left, with carved wooden lattices,
       where you can yet dream that the 'Arabian Nights' are
       true.</p>

    <p>We went to the gold and silver bazaar, and bought some
    quaint silver jewellery from Assouan, Soudan, and Abyssinia;
    then through the Turkish bazaar, the saddlery bazaars, past
    mosques and old houses, till at length we emerged into new
    squares and new streets, before climbing the hill to the
    citadel, the Viceroy's palace, and the splendid Mosque of
    Mehemet Ali, built of Egyptian alabaster. The view from the
    terrace is superb, over city, desert, river, palm-trees, and
    Pyramids. The sunset this evening was a disappointment; yellow,
    cold, and watery, a strong north wind bringing up all the sand
    from the desert. We returned to the hotel for dinner, and were
    all glad to go early to bed.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, April 29th</i>.&mdash;The children and I went to
    the English church, a semi-Gothic building, without a single
    window which could open. Though the church was nearly empty,
    the air felt like that of an exhausted receiver, and made one
    gasp. In the cool of the afternoon we drove through Roulai,
    where the museum stands, in a beautiful garden close by the
    riverside, amid flowers in full bloom.</p>

    <p>After an early meal (hardly to be called dinner) we went to
    the station, just as all the people were going for a drive to
    Shoubrah in the smartest carriages and the prettiest
    toilets.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum">Page 470<a name="Page_470"
       id="Page_470"></a></span>Our journey to Alexandria in the
       evening was cool and pleasant. A huge break met us, and we
       drove to Abbat's Hotel&mdash;considerably improved since our
       last visit in 1869.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, April 30th</i>.&mdash;Got up at 5 a.m. After a
    deliciously soft but very muddy bath, I went for a donkey ride
    before breakfast with Mabelle. Tom arrived from the yacht in
    time for twelve o'clock breakfast, and announced the voyage
    from Port Said to have been rough and unpleasant.</p>

    <p>We called on the Consul, the Vice-Consul, and our old
    friend, Consul Burton of Trieste, Haj Abdullah. He has just
    returned from a journey through the ancient land of Midian,
    undertaken at the special request of the Viceroy. He describes
    the expedition as having been most successful; the climate is
    almost perfect from September to May; the land is well watered
    by little streams flowing through fertile valleys, and full of
    fragrant flowers and luscious fruits. The corn reaches above
    the camel-men's heads, which means a height of fourteen or
    fifteen feet. But the mineral wealth of the country is its most
    extraordinary feature. He found traces of gold in the sand of
    the river-beds, in spots pointed out to him by his
    fellow-pilgrims on the way to Mecca twenty years ago, to say
    nothing of tin, iron, &amp;c. Perhaps the most interesting part
    of his discovery was the remains of eight ruined cities with
    traces in the dry river-beds of stone-crushing and gold-seeking
    apparatus, which must have been used centuries ago. He is
    writing a book on the subject, which you may perhaps see before
    you read this.</p>

    <p>The Consul kindly sent a janissary with us to show us the
    Sultan's palace. It is large and bare of furniture; and the
    general style of decoration is like that of the palaces at
    Cherniga and Dolma Batscher. Thence we went to see Pompey's
    Pillar and Cleopatra's Needle, the dahabeas ready to go up the
    Nile, &amp;c.; and returned to the hotel in time for dinner and
    a chat afterwards in the cool courtyard.
    <span class="pagenum">Page 471<a name="Page_471"
       id="Page_471"></a></span></p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 1st</i>.&mdash;I wrote from 3 a.m. to 6.30
    a.m., in order to send letters off by the French mail, and at
    seven Mabelle and I sallied forth on donkeys to visit the
    market. There was not much to see, however, everything being so
    crowded and jammed up, meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit, all
    close together. The crowd was amusing, as all the European
    householders had negroes or Arabs following them, laden with
    their purchases. We found some lovely flowers in a street near
    the market, and then we went on to the big gold and silver
    bazaar, and to the Turkish and Syrian bazaars, where we saw all
    the specialities of Constantinople, and Broussa, Damascus, and
    Jerusalem laid out before us. After breakfast, the antics of
    two enormous apes, who came round on a donkey, accompanied by a
    showman and a boy, amused the children much. They were
    hideously ugly, but the cleverest monkeys I ever saw. They went
    through a regular little play, quarrelled with one another; the
    man and the boy rode the ape, and made him kick; at last the
    ape was hurt, and lay fainting in the man's arms, limp and
    languid, just able to sip a little water; then he died, and
    dropped down stiff, with his eyes shut. His tail was pulled,
    his lips and eyelids were forced open, but he never winked an
    eyelid or moved a hair of his whiskers. He was thrown about
    from side to side, remaining perfectly motionless till, at a
    sign from his master, he jumped up as well as ever, shouldered
    his gun, and mounted his ass to take his departure. He was
    promptly ordered to dismount and ask for backshish, which he
    did, cap in hand. Some of the crowd round about not
    contributing to his master's satisfaction, the ape took a nasty
    venomous-looking little snake out of a bag which he carried
    over his shoulder, and threw it among the bystanders, to their
    great consternation.</p>

    <p>At two o'clock we went to lunch with the Consul, and what a
    pleasant lunch it was, prepared by a French cook, and eaten in
    a cool, airy, and shady room free from flies,
    <span class="pagenum">Page 472<a name="Page_472"
       id="Page_472"></a></span>which were kept out by fine wire
       gauze placed in front of each well-shaded door and window!
       The table was one mass of the roses for which Alexandria is
       so famous. Everybody had wandered about the world more or
       less, everybody was in good spirits, and we laughed and
       chatted and talked sense or nonsense as the fancy took us,
       till it was time to go on board the yacht <i>en masse</i>,
       and receive some visitors at tea. A few had arrived before
       us, but the children and some others of the party were on
       board and had been doing the honours and showing them round.
       About 5.30 p.m. our last guests departed, and all was ready
       for a start; but, alas! we had to wait for an absent
       steward, who had gone in search of the always late linen,
       that plague of the poor yachtsman's life when he has a large
       party on board. The sun was sinking fast, the wind was
       blowing fresh and fair, and if we did not start soon it
       would be impossible to do so at all, and a night's work of
       more than 120 miles would be lost. At last the welcome boat
       was seen coming from the shore; we unmoored, and went ahead
       for about an hour. But the light gradually faded away; it
       became impossible to distinguish the beacon; the sand banks
       are numerous, and there are no lights. It was only
       endangering the ship and the lives of all on board to
       proceed; so the order was reluctantly given, 'Hard a-port.'
       Round she went in her own length almost, and very soon we
       let go the anchor just outside our old moorings, and spent
       the night, after all, in the harbour of Alexandria.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, May 2nd</i>.&mdash;Steam was up at five
    o'clock, the wind being still fair but light. Soon it dropped
    to a calm, and then went round and blew with great force
    exactly in the opposite direction, dead ahead. The fires had to
    be put out, for it was so rough we could do no good steaming
    against the gale. The screw kept racing round and shaking the
    vessel terribly. Of course I was very ill; but the maids did
    not mind, and the children rather enjoyed the tumbling about
    and the water on deck. We continued scudding along through the
    water, but not making much progress on our course.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, May 3rd</i>.&mdash;The wind kept on increasing,
    and at last blew quite a gale. We have gone a long way out
    <span class="pagenum">Page 474<a name="Page_474"
       id="Page_474"></a></span>of our course to the northward,
       ready for a favourable change, but we can scarcely make any
       way to the westward.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p><i>Saturday, May 5th</i>.&mdash;A lull at last, and we are
    able to have the fires lighted and to steam on our course. We
    made the Island of Scarpanto in the morning. All the afternoon
    and evening we have been steaming along ten miles to the
    southward of Crete. Its outline was very beautiful, surmounted
    by the snow-capped mountains. I was up on deck just in time to
    behold the most lovely sunset, with exquisite rosy, purple, and
    crimson tints on sea and sky.</p>

    <p>I have not quite got over my attack in Cairo yet, and for
    the last three days have been completely laid up with a various
    mixture of land illness and sea sickness. We stopped steaming
    late in the day, but fires were lighted again in the middle of
    the night, as the wind was still ahead. There was a discussion
    whether or not to go round the north side of the Island of
    Kandia, so as to have a glimpse of the British Fleet at anchor
    in Suda Bay, if they have already arrived there.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, May 6th, and Monday, May 7th</i>.&mdash;Early in
    the morning the snowy mountains of Crete were still in sight.
    Service was held as usual at eleven, but it was too rough in
    the afternoon for it to be repeated.</p>

    <p>Sail and steam, wind and calm, alternated with one another
    all day. Tom is anxious to sail every mile he can, and yet not
    to lose any unnecessary time, and finds it exceedingly
    difficult to combine these two objects.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 8th</i>.&mdash;A fine morning, with a cold
    strong head breeze. At noon we rejoiced to think that Malta was
    not more than a few miles ahead, or we should assuredly have
    failed to reach our port before nightfall. About three
    <span class="pagenum">Page 475<a name="Page_475"
       id="Page_475"></a></span>we closed in with the land about
       Marsa Scirocco and Delamara Point, and, after one or two
       tacks, rounded the Point of Ricasole, and leaving Port St.
       Elmo on our right, we swiftly glided into the grand harbour
       of Valetta. We have been here so often that it feels quite
       like reaching home. We soon found ourselves in our old
       quarters in the Dockyard Creek, and had scarcely moored
       before one of the officers came on board with the usual
       complimentary offers of assistance, whilst directly
       afterwards came an invitation to a farewell ball at the
       Palace, given to the Duke of Edinburgh. Our old boatman,
       Bubbly Joe, took us ashore to dinner, and we found
       everything looking as bright and cheerful and steep as it
       always does and always will do; not the least bit altered or
       modernised. The landlord of the H&ocirc;tel d'Angleterre was
       delighted to see us again, and so were his servants, who
       came flocking from all parts of the house, nearly pulling
       the children to pieces, and plying our own servants with
       questions in their anxiety to know all about us.</p>

    return for the ball, by which time I was so thoroughly tired,
    and had so bad a headache, that I could not enjoy it much,
    pleasant as it was. Very soon after supper we came away and had
    a charming row across the harbour to our snug quarters on board
    the 'Sunbeam.' These sudden <span class="pagenum">Page
    476<a name="Page_476"
       id="Page_476"></a></span> bursts of dissipation on shore are
       a delightful change after days and weeks at sea.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, May 9th</i>.&mdash;I was up soon after sunrise
    and admired this often-abused creek as much as I always do. The
    stone houses, the carved and coloured verandahs of bright
    flowers, the water lapping the very door-steps, the gaily
    painted boats with their high prows at either end, the women in
    their black dresses and faldettas, and black-robed priests, all
    helped to carry the imagination over the Mediterranean and up
    the Adriatic to lovely Venice. At this hour in the morning
    there were not many English soldiers or sailors to spoil the
    illusion.</p>

    <p>Malta is essentially a border-land&mdash;African by
    geographical configuration, European politically, and assuredly
    Asiatic in its language, its buildings, and in the manners and
    customs of the natives. We gave everybody on board a holiday,
    and the chance of a run ashore to-day to stretch their legs
    after their long sea voyage. Tom went on board the 'Sultan' to
    see the Duke of Edinburgh and his splendid ship. Whilst at
    breakfast I received an intimation that the Duke of Edinburgh
    wished to come and examine the yacht. His Royal Highness
    arrived soon afterwards, quite unattended, in a beautiful
    ten-oared barge, and paid us a long, visit, inspecting the
    yacht minutely and looking at all the pets. He took a great
    interest in our voyage and courses, as well as in the numerous
    curiosities, knowing at once from what place each had been
    procured. The Duke, who had taken very nearly the same cruise
    himself in the 'Galatea' a few years ago, inquired very kindly
    after all his old friends at Tahiti, Hilo, Honolulu, and many
    other places. The Duke is very kind to everybody here. He is
    much liked by his brother officers in the squadron, and both
    H.R.H. and the Duchess seem to have made themselves most
    popular here during the winter. The officers of the 'Sultan,'
    several of whom are old friends of ours, appear to think
    themselves fortunate indeed in having
    <span class="pagenum">Page 477<a name="Page_477"
       id="Page_477"></a></span>such a commanding officer, whilst
       on shore his approaching departure is universally regretted.
       Everybody seems full of their Royal Highnesses' winter ball,
       which must have been a most brilliant affair.</p>

    <p>After the Duke's departure we went ashore again, called on
    various friends before luncheon, and went over the palace and
    through the armoury. Then we took a walk down the Strada Reale,
    the shopping street of Valetta, until it was time to go on
    board to receive some friends to tea. The shops are full of
    coral, lace, gold and silver filigree work, and a new sort of
    lace they make in Gozo, of white silk, in beautiful patterns.
    It has been manufactured only during the last few years, and
    varies much in quality and design. Some forty or fifty friends
    came on board and amused themselves looking at our curiosities
    and photographs until long past the dinner hour. We had to
    hurry on shore to dine, and go afterwards to the Opera Manoel.
    The new Grand Opera House is not to be opened until next
    October. It had been blowing fresh and
    <span class="pagenum">Page 478<a name="Page_478"
       id="Page_478"></a></span>strong from the westward all day,
       but to-night, as we rowed across the harbour, the breeze had
       dropped to a flat calm, and Tom is most anxious to be off at
       daybreak.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, May 10th</i>.&mdash;I was up before sunrise. A
    fresh fair wind was blowing, and as soon as the children could
    be got ready we all went ashore to the market, which was
    crowded with people, and full of fish, meat, and all spring
    vegetables and fruit. We were to start at 6.30, so there was no
    time to lose, and laden with lovely bouquets of flowers we
    hastened on board; but it was nine o'clock, after all our
    haste, before we were fairly off, through some mistake about
    the bill of health.</p>

    <p>Malta is certainly the most delightful place for yachting
    winter quarters, with its fine healthy harbour, charming
    society, very cheap living, and abundance of everything good.
    It is in proximity to many pleasant places, and most
    interesting excursions can easily be made to Sicily and Italy,
    or the coast of Africa. To-day we glided along the coast, past
    the strongly fortified little island of Consino, standing
    boldly out in mid-channel between Malta and Gozo. The
    Mediterranean appears to us a highway after the lonely oceans
    and seas we have been sailing over. Within one hour this
    morning, we saw more ships than in the whole of our passage
    from Valparaiso to Tahiti and Yokohama. Towards the evening we
    could see the island of Pantellaria in the distance. We retain
    a lively remembrance of it from having been becalmed just off
    it in the 'Albatross' for three weary days and nights. It was
    after this and a long series of other vexations and delays that
    Tom and I registered a vow never to go a long voyage again in a
    yacht without at least auxiliary steam power.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, May 11th</i>.&mdash;At 2.30 a.m. Pantellaria was
    abeam. At five the homeward-bound P. and O. steamer passed us
    quite close, and at six we met the outward-bound P. and O.
    steamer. At eight we passed Cape Bon and sailed across the
    mouth of the Bay of Tunis, in the centre of which
    <span class="pagenum">Page 479<a name="Page_479"
       id="Page_479"></a></span>is Goletta, the port of Tunis, the
       site of the ancient city of Carthage. Once we anchored close
       by that place for two or three days, and on that occasion I
       collected enough varieties of marble and mosaic from the old
       palaces to make some beautiful tables when we got home. In
       the afternoon and evening we made the Fratelli and the
       Sorelle Rocks, and still later the little Island of Galita.
       There were many steamers going in all directions, and it
       struck one very forcibly how much this little islet in
       mid-channel stands in need of a light.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, May 13th</i>.&mdash;The wind was dead ahead, and
    the sea of that remarkably confused character for which the
    Mediterranean is famous. It seemed as if the wind of yesterday,
    the wind of to-morrow, and the wind of to-day, had all met and
    were bent on making a night of it. We had service at eleven and
    four. The chart, now a good old friend, for it has been used by
    us on so many Mediterranean voyages, showed that this is the
    fourth noontide we have spent within a radius of thirty miles
    of this particular spot; within a radius of sixty miles we have
    spent at least three weeks of our lives at various periods.
    This does not of course include voyages in steamers which are
    not recorded in the chart.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, May 14th</i>.&mdash;About breakfast time to-day
    we crossed the meridian of Greenwich; and this virtually
    completed our voyage round the world, our original point of
    departure having really been Rochester, which is a few minutes
    to the east of Greenwich. The wind changed in the middle of the
    day, and we passed through a large fleet of merchantmen hove-to
    under shelter of Cape de Gat, where they had collected, I
    suppose, from various ports in Spain and Italy.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 15th</i>.&mdash;This was a somewhat sad day,
    many of our pets dying from the effects of the cold wind or
    from accidents. The steward's mocking-bird from Siam, which
    talked like a Christian and followed him about like a
    <span class="pagenum">Page 480<a name="Page_480"
       id="Page_480"></a></span>dog, died of acute bronchitis early
       this morning; and his monkey, the most weird little
       creature, with the affectionate ways of a human friend, died
       in the afternoon, of inflammation and congestion of the
       lungs. Two other monkeys and several birds also expired in
       the course of the day.</p>

    <p>This evening 'Beau Brummel,' the little pig I brought from
    Bow Island, in the South Pacific, died of a broken spine, as
    the doctor, who made a post-mortem examination in each case,
    discovered. A spar must have dropped upon poor piggy
    accidentally whilst he was running about on deck, though of
    course no one knew anything about it. I am very sorry; for
    though I must confess he was somewhat greedy and pig-like in
    his habits, he was extremely amusing in his ways. He ran about
    and went to sleep with the pugs, just like one of themselves.
    Besides, I do not think any one else in England could have
    boasted of a pig given to them by a South-Sea-Island chief.
    Probably 'Beau Brummel' was a lineal descendant of the pigs
    Captain Cook took out in the 'Endeavour.'</p>

    <p>The bodies were all placed together in a neat little box and
    committed to the deep at sunset, a few tears being shed over
    the departed pets, especially by the children.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 15th</i>.&mdash;Cape de Gat was abeam early
    this morning. The wind fell light, but Tom hoped it would
    freshen again; otherwise, with steam we might easily have got
    into Gibraltar to-night. As it was, fires were not lighted
    until ten o'clock.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, May 16th</i>.&mdash;At 3 a.m. I was called to
    see the light on Europa Point, and stayed on deck to watch the
    day dawn and the rising of the sun. It was not, however, a very
    agreeable morning; the Levanter was blowing, the signal station
    was enveloped in mist, the tops of the mountains of Africa were
    scarcely discernible above the clouds, and Ceuta and Ape's Hill
    were invisible. Algeciras and San Roque gleamed white on the
    opposite shore of the bay, while the dear old Rock itself
    looked <span class="pagenum">Page 481<a name="Page_481"
       id="Page_481"></a></span>fresher and cleaner than usual,
       exhaling a most delicious perfume of flowers. As the sun
       rose, the twitterings of the birds in the Alameda sounded
       most homelike and delightful.</p>

    <p>We had dropped our anchor inside the New Mole about 4.30,
    and before six the familiar sounds of English martial music
    could be heard from all the different barracks, as the
    regiments came marching down the hill and along the Alameda to
    the north front with all their baggage, military trains, tents,
    and ambulances, for a day's camping out. We were anxious to get
    on shore to see about coals, water, and provisions, but no
    health-boat came near us. About seven o'clock we started in
    despair, first to hail a policeman on shore (at a most
    respectful distance), to inquire where we could get
    <i>pratique</i>; then we procured it, and sent word back to the
    'Sunbeam' that she was out of quarantine, and might hoist the
    yellow flag. We landed, went to the market, bought some lovely
    carnations stuck in a prickly-pear leaf to keep them fresh, and
    then went to the H&ocirc;tel Royal&mdash;kept by the landlord
    of the old Club House Hotel, where we had so often
    stayed&mdash;to order breakfast. Our old friends the servants
    greeted us at every step from the house-door to the
    coffee-room, and we were taken special care of by a waiter who
    remembered us. After breakfast we went to pay some visits. We
    thought we ought to go and look at the galleries and Signal
    Station, as one or two of our party had never been here before;
    so we started, some on foot and some on donkeys. All the way up
    the steep streets to the Moorish castle, girls met us, selling
    lovely scarlet carnations and yellow roses. The galleries have
    not changed in the least since our last visit, but our
    soldier-guide told us they were daily expecting some big guns
    to come out, and he gave us a minute explanation how they were
    to be mounted. It was a pleasant ride, neither too hot nor too
    cold. Every crevice and interstice between the rocks was full
    of wild flowers, looking bright <span class="pagenum">Page
    482<a name="Page_482"
       id="Page_482"></a></span>and pretty, though somewhat
       insignificant after the gorgeous tropical blossoms our eyes
       have been lately accustomed to. The fog had cleared off, and
       the view was beautiful; ships lay in the bay below us from
       all parts, including a Portuguese gunboat. We saw also one
       of the two old eagles sitting near her nest in the
       accustomed place; this year she has only one young one. We
       did not see the monkeys, on account of the Levanter, but
       their number has increased to twenty-four, so that there is
       no immediate fear of their becoming extinct.</p>

    <p>At half-past six p.m. we weighed anchor and steamed out of
    the anchorage inside the New Mole. In the straits the wind was
    fair, so the funnel was soon lowered, and the screw feathered,
    and we were racing along under sail alone. Off Tarifa we found
    quite a gale blowing, and the wind continued fresh and fair
    throughout the night.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, May 17th</i>.&mdash;The strong fair wind
    dropped, and then came dead ahead, and off Cadiz we had to get
    up steam. There was a strong wind off the mountains near Cape
    Sagres, and while Tom was below and the men were busy reefing
    the sails, we nearly ran ashore. Luckily I noticed our
    <span class="pagenum">Page 483<a name="Page_483"
       id="Page_483"></a></span>danger and called Tom, who came up
       just in time to alter the helm, when the yacht went round
       like a top, though the shore was too close to be pleasant.
       It only shows how easily an accident may occur. Both our
       fishermen-mates could not bear to be idle, and always
       considered looking out an insignificant occupation, and so
       neglected that important duty to assist with the sails.</p>

    <p>Off Cape St. Vincent it blew so hard that we were afraid we
    should be obliged to bring up in the bay of Sagres; but we
    found that it was only a land breeze, and that it was much
    smoother outside than we had expected.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, May 18th</i>.&mdash;Fresh breeze. We met many
    steamers going down the coast with all sail set. After passing
    Cape Espichel the wind increased to a northerly gale, against
    which it was impossible to proceed. We therefore put into
    Lisbon. The mountains at the mouth of the Tagus, the tower and
    church of Belem, and the noble river itself looked even more
    beautiful in the sunset than my recollection led me to expect.
    We soon landed and had an excellent dinner at the Hotel
    Braganza, where we had stayed before, and where we were at once
    recognised and cordially received by the same landlord and
    landlady we remembered in 1861.</p>

    <p>After dinner we went for a walk. One of the things we saw
    during our stroll was the fine statue of Luiz de Camoens,
    specially interesting to us, as we had so recently seen the
    place where he passed many of the weary years of his exile.
    Rolling Motion Square was as giddy as ever. It was a curious
    fancy to pave it in such a way as to make it look like the
    waves of the sea, perpetually moving; and it must be a severe
    trial to the peripatetic powers of those who have not quite
    recovered their sea legs.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, May 19th</i>.&mdash;We were off early; it was a
    lovely day, and we had a pleasant drive to Cintra. On our
    arrival we mounted donkeys and went to Pe&ntilde;a, the
    beautiful palace of the ex-King Ferdinand, situated at
    <span class="pagenum">Page 484<a name="Page_484"
       id="Page_484"></a></span>the top of the mountains. It is an
       extraordinary-looking place, the different parts being built
       in every imaginable style of architecture, with exquisite
       carving and old tiles that would delight the heart of a
       connoisseur. One of the most prominent objects near the
       Palace of Pe&ntilde;a is the statue of Vasco da Gama, nobly
       placed on a pedestal of natural rocks, piled on the summit
       of a mountain peak, and worthy of the adventurous traveller
       it is erected to commemorate. The gardens are full of
       camellias, roses, bougainvillea, &amp;c. We lunched at the
       excellent hotel, and came to the conclusion that Cintra is
       the place, not only 'to spend a happy day,' but many happy
       months. It is always pleasant to revisit places of which you
       have <span class="pagenum">Page 485<a name="Page_485"
       id="Page_485"></a></span>agreeable reminiscences, and to
       find your expectations surpassed instead of
       disappointed.</p>

    <p>We had a hot drive back to Lisbon, and then went by tram to
    Belem, where we spent some time in the church and in wandering
    through its exquisite cloisters. The first stone was laid in
    1500, and the name changed from Bairro de Restello to Belem or
    Bethlehem by Prince Henry of Portugal, the great promoter of
    maritime discovery in that century. It was built specially to
    commemorate the successful voyage of Vasco da Gama, who
    returned from the discovery of India in 1499.</p>

    <p>Tom met us with the yacht, and, we went on board with the
    intention of proceeding straight to sea. But after passing
    through the Canal del Norte a heavy gale obliged us to anchor
    in Cascaes Bay for the night, not far from a small schooner
    yacht with three ladies on board. It was
    <span class="pagenum">Page 486<a name="Page_486"
       id="Page_486"></a></span>rather rough, and we were very
       tired, or I think we should have ventured to pay them a
       visit, even at that late hour. It is absurd to stand upon
       ceremony when travelling; but I scarcely know what the
       strict etiquette would be on such an occasion&mdash;whether
       they, as first anchored in the bay, should call on us, or we
       on them, as probably the greater travellers and out longer
       at sea.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday, May 20th</i>.&mdash;Weighed at 5 a.m. There was a
    dense fog off Cape del Roca, and the steam-whistle, foghorns,
    and bell were constantly kept going, with lugubrious effect. We
    had service at eleven and 4.30. Passed the Burlings at 1.30.
    Heavy swell all day.</p>

    <p><i>Monday, May 21st</i>.&mdash;Rough and disagreeable. Off
    Viana at noon. Passed Oporto and Vigo in the course of the
    afternoon.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 22nd</i>.&mdash;If yesterday was bad, to-day
    was worse. We hove to for some time under the shelter of Cape
    Finisterre, then went on again for a short distance; but at
    1.30 a.m. on the 23rd we were obliged to put round and wait for
    daylight.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, 23rd, and Thursday, 24th</i>.&mdash;In the
    course of the day the weather mended, though the sea still
    continued rough, and our course was really in the direction of
    America rather than England. In the evening of the 24th we were
    able to light fires, and, with the assistance of steam, to keep
    nearly on our proper course.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, May 26th</i>.&mdash;Saw the first English land,
    the Start, at 2.30 a.m. Wind continued fresh and fair, but at
    noon dropped calm, and we had to steam through the Needles
    instead of sailing, as we had done on our way out. We reached
    Cowes about 3 p.m., and were immediately welcomed by several
    yachts, who dipped their ensigns and fired their guns. We
    landed, and were warmly greeted by many friends, and, after
    sending off telegrams and letters, re-embarked and proceeded
    towards Hastings. We were anxious to land by daylight, but this
    was not to be. So it <span class="pagenum">Page
    487<a name="Page_487"
       id="Page_487"></a></span>turned out to be midnight before we
       reached Beachy Head and could discern the lights of Hastings
       shining in the distance. As we drew near to our anchorage we
       could see two boats coming swiftly towards us from the
       shore. The crews were members of the Royal Naval Artillery
       Volunteers, and as they came alongside they raised a shout
       of welcome. Hastings had been expecting us all the
       afternoon, and late as was the hour, 1.30 a.m., we were
       immediately surrounded by a fleet of boats, and many willing
       hands seized our heterogeneous cargo and multitudinous
       packages, and before daylight all had been safely landed on
       the pier. We committed ourselves to the care of the
       R.N.A.V., and landed in their boats, and at 4.30, proceeding
       to the Queen's Hotel, we had a joyous meeting with T.A.B.
       and Maud.</p>

    <p>How can I describe the warm greetings that met us
    everywhere, or the crowd that surrounded us, not only when we
    landed, but as we came out of church; how, along the whole ten
    miles from Hastings to Battle, people were standing by the
    roadside and at their cottage doors to welcome us; how the
    Battle bell-ringers never stopped ringing except during service
    time; or how the warmest of welcomes ended our delightful year
    of travel and made us <span class="pagenum">Page
    488<a name="Page_488"
       id="Page_488"></a></span>feel we were home at last, with
       thankful hearts for the providential care which had watched
       over us whithersoever we roamed?</p>

    <p class="iheading">LETTER</p>

    <p class="ctr">(From the <i>Times</i> of June 2, 1877).</p>

    <p>To the Editor of the 'Times.'&mdash;Sir,&mdash;Believing it
    possible that some interest may attach to the voyage completed
    on May 27 by the arrival of the 'Sunbeam' at Cowes, I venture
    to offer to your readers a short narrative of our proceedings.
    The expedition is in some respects unprecedented; a
    circumnavigation of 35,400 miles has never before been made in
    the short period of 46 weeks, from which must be deducted 112
    days of well-earned repose in harbour. We had, it is true, the
    advantage of steam, without which such a performance would have
    been an impossibility; but we travelled 20,517 miles under sail
    alone, and the consumption of coal has not exceeded 350 tons.
    The 'Sunbeam' sailed from Cowes on July 6, called at Torbay,
    Madeira, Teneriffe, and the Cape Verde, crossed the Line on
    August 8, and, carrying a favourable breeze in the south-east
    trades, without even a momentary lull, a distance of 2,500
    miles, arrived at Rio Janeiro on August 17. Following the
    coasts of South America, we visited Montevideo, Buenos Ayres,
    and Ensenada, steamed through the Straits of Magellan and
    Smyth's Channel, and reached Valparaiso on October 21.</p>

    <p>While on the coast of Patagonia it was our privilege to
    rescue a crew of 15 hands from the bark 'Monkshaven,' laden
    with an inflammable cargo of smelting coals, which had been on
    fire six days when we most providentially descried her signals
    of distress.</p>

    <p>On October 30 we commenced our long and lonely voyage of
    12,330 miles across the Pacific. We touched at Bow Island in
    the Low Archipelago, Maitea and Tahiti in the Society Islands,
    and Hawaii and Oahu in the Sandwich group. On January 21 we
    sighted Assumption in the Ladrones, and on the 29th arrived at
    Yokohama. While in Japan we were present at the opening of
    <span class="pagenum">Page 506<a name="Page_506"
       id="Page_506"></a></span>the railway from Osaka to Kioto by
       the Mikado, and subsequently cruised in the Inland Sea in
       severe winterly weather. At Simonoseki we found the people
       much agitated by the recent outbreak of the Satsuma clan. On
       February 19 we bade a reluctant farewell to Japan, and
       following the most direct route to England, visited in
       succession Hongkong, Canton, Macao, Singapore, Johore,
       Malacca, Penang, Galle, Colombo, Aden, Alexandria, Malta,
       Gibraltar, and Lisbon.</p>

    will be most rapidly completed by entering our successive
    passages in a tabular statement:</p>

    Having sketched the voyage in outline, the following details
    may not be devoid of interest to readers with nautical
    tastes.</p>

    <p>Every yachtsman should be a lover of sailing. In the cruise
    of the 'Sunbeam,' although expedition was an essential
    consideration, steam has been used almost exclusively in calms
    or in narrow waters, or when, as it has often happened, we have
    sailed at sunset <span class="pagenum">Page
    507<a name="Page_507"
       id="Page_507"></a></span>after a hard day's work on board,
       intending to make an offing during the night and set sails
       in the morning.</p>

    <p>Of the total distance of 15,000 knots under steam, 12,000
    were traversed under those special circumstances which seem to
    justify even a yachtsman in availing himself of the unromantic
    but invaluable engine.</p>

    <p>The best run under steam alone was 230 knots, and the most
    successful continuous performance was on the passage from
    Penang to Galle, in the week ending April 15, when the
    'Sunbeam' steamed 1,451 knots, with a daily consumption of
    4-&frac14; tons of coal.</p>

    <p>The best runs under sail from noon to noon were 298 and 299
    knots respectively. The first was on the passage from Honolulu
    to Yokohama, sailing along the 16th parallel of north latitude,
    and between 163 deg. and 168 deg. 15 min. east. The second was
    in the Formosa Channel.</p>

    <p>The highest speed ever attained under sail was 15 knots in a
    squall in the North Pacific.</p>

    <p>On 28 days the distance under sail alone has exceeded, and
    often considerably exceeded, 200 knots.</p>

    <p>The best consecutive runs under sail only were:&mdash;</p>

    <p>I. Week ending August 13, South Atlantic. In the south-east
    trades, wind a-beam, force 5&mdash;1,456 knots.</p>

    <p>II. Week ending November 19, South Pacific, south-east
    trades, wind aft, force 5&mdash;1,360 knots.</p>

    <p>III. Four days, January 15 to 18, North Pacific, north-east
    trades, wind on the quarter, force 5 to 9&mdash;1,027 knots.
    The average speed in this case was 107 knots an hour.</p>

    <p>The following were the average speeds of the longer
    passages:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;<br />
    The vessel which has carried us so rapidly and safely round the
    globe claims a brief description. She was designed by Mr. St.
    Clare Byrne, of Liverpool, and may be technically defined as a
    composite three-masted topsail-yard screw schooner. The
    engines, by Messrs. Laird, are of 70 nominal or 350 indicated
    horse-power, and developed a speed of 10.13 knots on the
    measured mile. The bunkers contain 80 tons of coal. The average
    daily consumption is four tons, and the speed eight knots in
    fine weather. The principal dimensions of the hull
    are;&mdash;Length for tonnage, 157 ft.; beam, extreme, 27 ft. 6
    in.; displacement tonnage, 531 tons; area of midship section,
    202 square feet.</p>

    <p>With an addition of 20 ft. to the length, and more engine
    power, the 'Sunbeam' presents a type which might be found
    efficient for naval services in distant waters, where good
    sailing qualities are essential, and large ships are not
    required.</p>

    <p>On looking back, and contrasting the anticipated
    difficulties with the actual experiences of the voyage, the
    ease and certainty with which every passage has been made are
    truly surprising. Our track has been for the most part within
    the Tropics. The storms off the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn
    have been avoided in the inland passages of the Straits of
    Magellan and the Suez Canal. We have encountered no continuous
    stormy weather, except during the four days preceding our
    arrival at Yokohama. We have suffered discomfort from heat and
    detention in calms, but storms have disturbed us seldom, and
    they have not lasted long.</p>

    <p>Our experience of gales include a north-east gale off Cape
    Finisterre, on the outward voyage; a northerly gale between Rio
    and the River Plate, a westerly gale off the east coast of
    Patagonia, short but severe gales on each of the four days
    preceding our arrival at Yokohama, a severe gale from the
    north-west in the Inland Sea, a north-east gale in the Formosa
    Channel, a northerly gale in the Straits of Jubal, a westerly
    gale off Port Said, and an easterly gale on the south coast of
    Candia. On the passage homewards from Gibraltar we met strong
    northerly winds on the coast of Portugal, and a north-east gale
    off Cape Finisterre.</p>

    <p>The navigation has presented few difficulties. All the
    coasts <span class="pagenum">Page 509<a name="Page_509"
       id="Page_509"></a></span>that we have visited have been
       surveyed. Lighthouses are now as numerous and efficient on
       the coasts of China and Japan as on the shores of Europe.
       Such is the perfection of the modern chronometer, that lunar
       observations, the only difficult work in ocean navigation,
       are no longer necessary; and the wind charts published by
       the Admiralty supply to the amateur navigator accumulated
       information and valuable hints for every stage of his
       voyage.</p>

    <p>How infinitely easy is the task of the modern
    circumnavigator compared with the hazardous explorations of
    Magelhaens and Captain Cook, when the chronometer was an
    instrument of rude and untrustworthy quality, when there were
    no charts, and the roaring of the breakers in the dead of night
    was the mariner's first warning that a coral reef was near!</p>

    <p>Our comprehensive and varied cruise has strengthened my
    former convictions that the disasters due to negligence bear a
    large proportion to the number of inevitable losses. Every
    coast is dangerous to the careless commander; but there are no
    frequented seas where, with the exercise of caution and
    reasonable skill, the dangers cannot be avoided. These remarks
    do not, of course, apply to cases of disaster from stress of
    weather. In fogs there must be delay, though not necessarily
    danger.</p>

    <p>In these days of lamentation over the degeneracy of the
    British seaman, my experience may be accepted as a contribution
    to the mass of evidence on this vexed question. I have not been
    surrounded by such smart seamen as can only be found on a
    man-of-war, but I have no ground for general or serious
    complaint. Many of my crew have done their duty most
    faithfully. In emergencies everybody has risen to the occasion,
    and has done best when his skill or endurance was most severely
    tried&mdash;</p>

            <span>'My mariners,<br /></span> <span>Souls that have

    <p>It is always in stormy weather that the good qualities of
    the British seaman are displayed to the greatest advantage. The
    <span class="pagenum">Page 510<a name="Page_510"
       id="Page_510"></a></span>difficulty is to keep up his
       interest and energies in long intervals of fine weather,
       when nothing occurs to rouse him to an effort, and the
       faculties of the seaman before the mast, no less than those
       of his officer, are benumbed by the monotony and isolation
       from mankind, which are the gravest drawbacks of a sailor's
       life. It is in these dull moments that men are tempted to
       drink and quarrel, that officers become tyrannical, and
       their crews insubordinate, or even mutinous. Lest it should
       be thought that my impressions of the average sailor are
       derived from an exceptional crew or picked men, I have only
       to add that the manning of the 'Sunbeam' was a family job.
       The sailing master was related by blood or marriage to the
       majority of his subordinates&mdash;fishermen from the coast
       of Essex, who had received their early training among the
       banks and shoals at the mouth of the Thames.</p>

    <p>In this connection I tender my sincere tribute of praise to
    the officers of the Navy for their success in maintaining the
    efficiency and spirit of their crews through long commissions
    on foreign stations, much time being necessarily spent in
    harbour, in many cases in the most enervating climates. The
    discipline of the service seems to be admirable, and the seamen
    are reconciled to it by tradition, by early training, and
    perhaps by an instinctive perception of its necessity.</p>

    <p>I am equally bound to commend the efficiency of our consular
    service in the remotest outposts of civilisation which we have
    visited; and evidences of good colonial administration are
    abundantly manifest in Hongkong, Singapore, Penang, Ceylon, and
    Aden, in the prosperity and contentment of the people.</p>

    <p>It is scarcely necessary to observe, in conclusion, that
    experiences may be gathered in a voyage of circumnavigation
    which are not to be gleaned from Blue-books or from shorter
    cruises in European waters. A more vivid impression is formed
    of the sailor's daily life, of his privations at sea, and his
    temptations on shore. The services required of the Navy are
    more clearly appreciated after a visit to distant foreign
    stations.</p>

    <p>Such a voyage is, indeed, a serious effort. It demands many
    <span class="pagenum">Page 511<a name="Page_511"
       id="Page_511"></a></span> laborious days and anxious nights
       of watching. For my safe return to 'those pale, those
       white-faced shores,' so welcome to the homeward-bound,
       accompanied, happily, by the adventurous little family who
       have taken part in the expedition, I am truly thankful.</p>

    <p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
