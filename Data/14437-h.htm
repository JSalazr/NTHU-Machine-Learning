    <h3>
      PREFACE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The present work is founded on an essay, which appeared in the
      Biblical Repository for April and July, 1834, then conducted by
      the undersigned. The essay was received with favour by the
      public; and awakened an interest in many minds, as laying open a
      new field of information, hitherto almost inaccessible to the
      English reader. A few copies were printed separately for private
      distribution. Some of these were sent to literary men in Europe;
      and several scholars of high name among those acquainted with
      Slavic literature, expressed their approval of the work. Since
      that time, and even of late, inquiries have repeatedly been made,
      by scholars and by public libraries in Europe, for copies of that
      little treatise; which, of course, it was impossible to satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      These circumstances, together with the fact, that in these years
      public attention has been more prominently directed to the
      character and prospects of the Slavic nations, have induced the
      author to recast the work; and to lay it anew before the public,
      corrected, enlarged, and continued to the present time; as a
      brief contribution to our knowledge of the intellectual character
      and condition of those nations, in the middle of the nineteenth
      century.
    </p><span class="newpage"><a name="page_vi" id=
    "page_vi">[pg.vi]</a></span>
    <p>
      In its present shape, the work may be said to supply, in a
      certain degree, a deficiency in English literature. It is true,
      that the literature of the Russians, Poles, Bohemians, and some
      others, is treated of under the appropriate heads in the
      <i>Encyclopædia Americana</i>, in articles translated from the
      German <i>Conversations-Lexicon</i>, though not in their latest
      form. The Foreign Quarterly Review also contains articles of
      value on the like topics, scattered throughout its volumes. Dr.
      Bowring, in the prefaces to some of his Specimens of Slavic
      Poetry, has given short notices of a similar kind. The Biblical
      literature of the Old Slavic and Russian has been well exhibited
      by Dr. Henderson<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
      "FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>;
      while an outline of Russian literature in general is presented in
      the work of Otto<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
      "FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
      Valuable information respecting the South-western Slavi is
      contained in the recent work of Sir J.G. Wilkinson.<a name=
      "FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But beyond this meagre
      enumeration, the English reader will find few sources of
      information at his command upon these topics. All these, too, are
      only sketches of separate <i>parts</i> of one great whole; of
      which in its full extent, both as a whole and in the intimate
      relation of its parts, no general view is known to exist in the
      English language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the subject in itself is not without a high interest and
      importance; relating, as it does, to the languages and literature
      of a population amounting to nearly or quite seventy millions, or
      more than three times as great as that of the United States.
      These topics embrace, of course, the history of mental
      cultivation among the Slavic nations from its earliest dawn;
      their intellectual development; the progress of man among them as
      a thinking, sentient, social being, acting and acted upon in his
      various relations to other minds. <span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_vii" id="page_vii">[pg.vi]</a></span> They relate, indeed,
      to the history of intellectual culture in one of its largest
      geographical and ethnological divisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this connection it is a matter of no small interest, to mark
      the influence which Christianity has exercised upon the language
      and literature of these various nations. It is to the
      introduction and progress of Christianity, that they owe their
      written language; and to the versions of the Scriptures into
      their own dialects are they indebted, not only for their moral
      and religious culture, but also for the cultivation and, in a
      great degree, the existence of their national literature. The
      same influence Christianity is even now exerting upon the
      hitherto unwritten languages of the American forest, of the
      islands of the Pacific, of the burning coasts of Africa, of the
      mountains of Kurdistan; and with the prospect of results still
      wider and more propitious. Indeed, wherever we learn the fact,
      whether in earlier or more recent times, that a language,
      previously regarded as barbarous, and existing only as oral, has
      been reclaimed and reduced to writing, and made the vehicle of
      communicating fixed thought and permanent instruction, there it
      has ever been <i>Christianity</i> and <i>Missionary
      Enterprise</i> which have produced these results. It is greatly
      to the honour of Protestant Missions, that their efforts have
      always been directed to introduce the Scriptures and the worship
      of God to the masses of the people in their own native tongue. In
      this way they have every where contributed to awaken the
      intellectual, as well as the moral life of nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present work has been prepared with great care; and with the
      aid of the latest and best sources of information, so far as they
      were accessible. The author, however, would be the last to
      desire, that any one should regard the volume as comprising a
      full or <span class="newpage"><a name="page_viii" id=
      "page_viii">[pg.viii]</a></span> complete history of the
      literature of the seven or eight Slavic nations. Scholars
      familiar with the subject, and especially intelligent Russian,
      Polish, or Bohemian readers, will doubtless discover in it
      deficiencies and errors. Limited to the resources of a private
      library,&mdash;for the public libraries of the United States and
      of Great Britain have as yet accumulated little or nothing in the
      Slavic department,&mdash;and without the privilege of personal
      intercourse with others acquainted with Slavic literary matters,
      the author desires to be distinctly understood, as aiming only to
      present a <i>sketch</i>, an <i>outline</i>,&mdash;a work which
      may fill its appropriate place, until it shall be supplanted by
      something more perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preceding remarks have reference especially to the first
      <i>three</i> Parts of the volume. In the <i>fourth</i> Part,
      containing a Sketch of the Popular Poetry of the Slavic nations,
      the author is perhaps still more at home; and the reader, it may
      be hoped, will receive gratification from the views and specimens
      there presented. Similar views, and a few of the same specimens,
      were given in an article from the same pen, in the North American
      Review for July, 1836.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, it may not be inappropriate to remark, that
      circumstances have combined to secure to the author some
      qualifications for the preparation of a work of this kind, which
      are not common to writers in the English language. A residence of
      several years in early life in Russia, first in the southern
      provinces, and afterwards at St. Petersburg, presented
      opportunity for a personal acquaintance with the language and
      literature of that country. At a later period, this gave occasion
      and afforded aid for an extensive study of the Servian dialect
      and its budding literature; the results of which were given to
      the public in a German translation of the very remarkable popular
      songs and ballads of that country<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id=
      "FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_ix" id=
      "page_ix">[pg.ix]</a></span> The field was new: but certainly
      that can be regarded as no barren soil, nor that as a fruitless
      labour, which at once drew the attention, and secured to the
      translator the friendship and correspondence, of scholars like
      Goethe, von Humboldt; J. Grimm, Savigny, G. Ritter, Kopitar, and
      others. Similar researches were subsequently extended into the
      popular poetry of the Teutonic and other nations; a portion of
      the results of which have likewise been given to the
      public<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may venture to commend this volume to the good will and kind
      forbearance of the reader, in view of the difficulties which must
      ever press upon the writer of such a work. The enterprising
      publisher has done his part well; and I would join him in the
      hope, that the book may prove an acceptable offering to the
      public.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The earliest history of the Slavic nations is involved in a
      darkness, which all the investigations of diligent and sagacious
      modern historians and philologians have not been able to clear
      up. The analogy between their language and the Sanscrit, seems to
      indicate their origin from India; but to ascertain the time at
      which they first entered Europe, is now no longer possible.
      Probably this event took place seven or eight centuries before
      the Christian era, on account of the over-population of the
      regions on the Ganges.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id=
      "FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
      Herodotus mentions a people which he called Krovyzi, who lived on
      the Ister. There is even <span class="newpage"><a name="page_2"
      id="page_2">[pg.2]</a></span> now a tribe in Russia, whose name
      at least is almost the same.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=
      "FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
      Strabo, Pomponius Mela, Pliny, Tacitus, and several other
      classical and a few oriental writers, allude to the Slavic
      nations occasionally. But the first distinct intelligence we have
      of them, is not older than the middle of the sixth
      century.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> At this period we see them
      traversing the Danube in large multitudes, and settling on both
      the banks of that river. From that time they appear frequently in
      the accounts of the Byzantine historians, under the different
      appellations of the Slavi, Sarmatae,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id=
      "FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
      Antae, Vandales, Veneti, and Vendes, mostly as involved in the
      wars of the two Roman empires, sometimes as allies, sometimes as
      conquerors; oftener, notwithstanding their acknowledged valour
      and courage, as vassals; but chiefly as emigrants and colonists,
      thrust out of their own countries by the pressing forward of the
      more warlike German or Teutonic tribes. Only the first of the
      above mentioned names is decidedly of Slavic origin;<a name=
      "FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_10_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> <span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">[pg.3]</a></span> the
      second is ambiguous; and the last four are later and purely
      geographical, having been transferred to Slavic nations from
      those who had previously occupied the territory where the Romans
      first became acquainted with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It results from the very nature of this information, that we
      cannot expect to get from it any satisfactory knowledge of their
      political state or the degree of their civilization. In general,
      they appear as a peaceful, industrious, hospitable people,
      obedient to their chiefs, and religious in their habits. Wherever
      they established themselves, they began to cultivate the earth,
      and to trade in the productions of the country. There are also
      early traces of their fondness for music and poetry; and some
      circumstances, of which we shall speak in the sequel, seem to
      justify the supposition of a very early cultivation of the
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the knowledge we have respecting the ancient history of the
      Slavic race, as we have seen, is gathered from foreign authors;
      the earliest of their own historians did not write
      before<span class="newpage"><a name="page_4" id=
      "page_4">[pg.4]</a></span> the second half of the eleventh
      century.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_11_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> At this time the Slavic
      nations were already in possession, partly as masters, partly as
      servants, of the whole vast extent of territory, which they now
      occupy; and if we assume that at the present time about seventy
      or eighty millions speak the Slavic language in its different
      dialects, we must calculate that at the above mentioned period,
      and in the course of the next following centuries, before the
      Slavic was by degrees supplanted in the German-Slavic provinces
      by the German idiom, the number of those who called that language
      their mother tongue was at least the fifth part greater. Schlözer
      observes, that, with the exception of the Arabians, no nation on
      the globe had extended themselves so far. In the South, the
      Adriatic, the range of the Balkan, and the Euxine, are their
      frontiers; the coasts of the Icy Ocean are their limits in the
      North; their still greater extent in an Eastern and Western
      direction reaches from Kamtschatka and the Russian islands of the
      Pacific, where many of their vestiges are to be found among
      scattered tribes, as far as to the Baltic and along the banks of
      the rivers Elbe, Muhr, and Raab, again to the Adriatic. It is
      this immense extent, which adds greatly to the difficulties of a
      general survey of the different relations and connections of
      nations, broken up into so many parts. The <i>history of the
      language</i> is our object, not the history of the people; we
      therefore give of statistic and political notices only so much,
      as seems to be requisite for the illustration of our subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest data for the history of the civilization of the
      Slavic race, we find in their mythology; and here their
      oriental<span class="newpage"><a name="page_5" id=
      "page_5">[pg.5]</a></span> origin again appears. The antithesis
      of a good and evil principle is met with among most of their
      tribes; and as even at the present time in some Slavic dialects
      every thing good, beautiful, praiseworthy, is to them synonymous
      with the purity of the white colour, they call the good Spirit
      <i>Bielo Bòg</i>, the white god; the evil Spirit <i>Tcherno
      Bôg</i>, the black god. The <i>Div</i> of the old Russians seem
      to be likewise akin to the <i>Dev</i> of the Hindoo; the goddess
      of life, <i>Shiva</i>, of the Polabae, to the Indian
      <i>Shiva</i>; as the names of the Slavic personification of
      death, <i>Morjana</i>, <i>Morena</i>, <i>Marzana</i>, evidently
      stand in connection with the Indian word for death,
      <i>Marana</i>. Strabo describes some of the idols of the Rugians,
      in which we meet again the whole significant symbolization of the
      East. The custom prevalent among many Slavic nations, of females
      burning themselves with the corpses of their husbands, seems also
      to have been brought from India to Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are, however, other features of their mythology which
      belong to them exclusively, and which remind us rather of the
      sprightly and poetical imagination of the Greeks. We allude to
      their mode of attributing life to the inanimate objects of
      nature, rocks, brooks and trees; of peopling with supernatural
      beings the woods which surrounded them, the mountains between
      which they lived. The <i>Rusalki</i> of the Russians, the
      <i>Vila</i> of the southern Slavic nations, the <i>Leshie</i> of
      several other tribes, nymphs, naiads, and satyrs, are still to be
      found in many popular tales and songs. If, however, we have
      compared them to the poetical gods of the Greeks, we must not
      forget to add, that their character has less resemblance to these
      gods, (who indeed appear only as ordinary men with higher powers,
      more violent passions, and less limited lives.) than it has to
      the northern Elf; and the German Nix and mountain
      Spirit&mdash;without heart and soul themselves, but always
      intermeddling with intrusive curiosity in human affairs, however
      void of real interest in them;<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_6" id="page_6">[pg.6]</a></span> revengeful towards the
      most trifling offence or the least neglect; and beneficent only
      to favourites arbitrarily chosen.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=

      "#Footnote_12_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest historians mention the Slavi as divided into several
      tribes and as speaking different dialects. There are no very
      ancient remains of their language, except those words or phrases,
      which we find scattered through the works of foreign writers; and
      these mostly perverted by their want of knowledge. Besides these
      we have the names of places, of festivals, partly still existing,
      and of some dignitaries, <i>Knes</i>, <i>Zupan</i>, etc. There
      are, indeed, among the popular songs of the Bohemians, Servians,
      Russians, and several other tribes, many which are evidently
      derived from the pagan period; but as they have been preserved
      only by tradition, we must of course assume, that their diction,
      has been changed almost in the same proportion as the language of
      common life. Hence, national songs, before they have been fixed
      by letters, are always to be considered as much safer proofs for
      the genius than for the language of a people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, however, probable that at least <i>one</i> Slavic idiom
      was cultivated to a certain degree in very ancient times; for
      from the single circumstance, that Cyril's translation of the
      Bible, written in the middle of the ninth century, bears the
      stamp of uncommon perfection in its forms, and of great
      copiousness, it is sufficiently evident, that the language must
      have been the means of expression for thinking men several
      centuries before. There is, indeed, no doubt that the state of
      the language, as it appears in that translation, required no
      short interval of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_7" id=
      "page_7">[pg.7]</a></span>The first attempts to convert portions
      of the Slavic race to Christianity were probably made before the
      seventh century; but it was only at the beginning of the ninth
      that their partial success became of importance to their language
      and literature. It is true, that by the last investigations of
      the late great Slavist, B. Kopitar, the fact has been
      ascertained, that a portion of the Slavic race was already in
      possession of an alphabet <i>before</i> Cyril;<a name=
      "FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_13_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> but as this fact appears to
      have had no further result, we must still consider the ninth
      century and Cyril's translation of the Gospels as the beginning
      of their literary history, the dawn at least of a brighter day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we enter upon our examination of the different branches,
      we must not neglect to direct the attention of the reader to the
      whole great trunk, which in the most ancient times appears to
      have ramified into two principal stems.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boundless confusion indeed reigns in the classification of the
      Slavic nations among the earlier historians and philologists. It
      was the learned Dobrovsky of Prague, who first brought light into
      this chaos, and established a classification, founded on a deep
      and thorough examination of all the different dialects, and
      acknowledged by the equally great authority of Kopitar. Adelung,
      in his Mithridates,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
      "FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_14_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> has adopted it. The
      specific names, however, Antes and Slavi, which Adelung applies
      to the great divisions, and which were first used by Jornandes,
      are arbitrary, and less distinct than those adopted by Dobrovsky,
      Kopitar, and Schaffarik; who divide all Slavic nations, according
      to certain philological affinities and differences, into the
      <i>North-Western</i> and <i>South-Eastern</i> Stems.<a name=
      "FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_15_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_8" id=
      "page_8">[pg.8]</a></span>Far better would have been the terms
      'Northern <i>and</i> Western,' 'Southern <i>and</i> Eastern,'
      divisions; which indeed can be the only proper meaning of those
      appellations. The Slovaks in Hungary, for instance, who belong to
      the first division, can in no way be called a
      <i>North</i>-Western people; and the Russians, who belong to the
      second, still less a <i>South</i>-Eastern nation. The
      <i>origin</i> from the South is common to all the Slavic tribes;
      hence the appellation of Northern and Southern can be applied to
      them only in a relative sense; and that portion of the Slavic
      race, which inhabits Russia, is not known to have ever lived in a
      more southern region than their Bohemian brethren. We adopt,
      therefore, the division of the Slavi into EASTERN and WESTERN
      Stems; which seems indeed to be the only strictly proper
      one.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_16_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following enumeration of the still existing distinct nations
      of the Slavic race, may serve to give a clearer view of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. EASTERN STEM.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I. RUSSIAN BRANCH.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      1. RUSSIANS. The Russians of Slavic origin form the bulk of the
      population of the European part of Russia. All the middle
      provinces of this vast empire are occupied almost exclusively by
      a people of purely Slavic extraction. The numerous Slavi who are
      scattered through Asiatic Russia, are of the same <span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">[pg.9]</a></span>race.
      They belong to the Greek Church. To ascertain the exact numbers
      of the different races of one and the same nation, is exceedingly
      difficult. The statistical tables of the government afford little
      help; since it is the policy of the latter to annihilate as much
      as possible the difference of races. Schaffarik, in his Slavic
      Ethnography, gives the number of the Russians proper at
      38,400,000. We follow him, as the most diligent and most
      consistent investigator of this matter; but we also feel bound to
      remark, that his statistical assertions have occasioned surprise,
      and met with contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. RUSSNIAKS or RUTHENIANS, also called <i>Russinians</i> and
      <i>Malo-Russians</i>. These are found in Malo-Russia, the South
      of Poland, Galicia, Ludomeria or Red Russia, the Bukovina, also
      in the north-eastern part of Hungary, and scattered over Walachia
      and Moldavia. The Kozaks, especially the Zaporogueans, belong
      chiefly to this race; while the Kozaks of the Don are more mixed
      with pure Russians. Their number is given at more than thirteen
      millions. They all belong to the Oriental Church; though a
      portion of them are Greek-Catholics, or adherents of the United
      Church.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>
      II. ILLYRICO-SERVIAN BRANCH.
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      1. The ILLYRICO-SERVIANS proper, frequently called
      <i>Rascians</i> or <i>Raitzi</i>, comprising five subdivisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      a) The SERVIANS in Servia, lying between the rivers Timock,
      Drina, Save, the Danube, and the Balkan mountains; and, as a
      Turkish province, called Serf Vilayeti. Their number is at least
      a million. In earlier times, and especially at the end of the
      seventeenth century, many of them emigrated to Hungary; where
      even now between three and four hundred thousand of them are
      settled; exclusive of their near relatives, the Slavonians, in
      the kingdom of Slavonia so called.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_10" id=
      "page_10">[pg.10]</a></span>b) BOSNIANS, between Dalmatia, the
      Balkan mountains, and the rivers Drina, Verbas, and Save; from
      four to five hundred thousand in number. Most of them belong,
      like their brethren the Servians, to the Greek Church; about
      100,000 are Roman Catholics. There are of late many Muhammedans
      among them, who still retain their language and most of their
      Slavic customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      c) MONTENEGRINS (Czernogortzi). The national name of the
      Montenegrins, here given as <i>Czernogortzi</i>, is better
      written <i>Tzernogortzi</i>; see p. 119, n. 17. Their number is
      given by Sir J.G. Wilkinson at 80,000, or more. These are the
      Slavic inhabitants of the Turkish province Albania, among the
      mountains of Montenegro. They have spread themselves from Bosnia
      to the sea-coast as far as Antivari. This remarkable people the
      Turks never have been able to subjugate completely. They enjoy a
      sort of military-republican freedom: their head chief being a
      Bishop with very limited power. They amount to nearly 60,000
      souls, belonging to the Eastern Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      d) SLAVONIANS. These are the inhabitants of the Austrian kingdom
      of Slavonia and the duchy of Syrmia, between Hungary on the north
      and Bosnia in the south, about half a million in number. A small
      majority belongs to the Romish Church; the rest to the Greek
      Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      e) DALMATIANS. The country along the Adriatic, between Croatia
      and Albania, together with the adjacent islands, is called the
      kingdom of Dalmatia, and belongs likewise to the Austrian empire.
      It has, together with the Istrian shore north of it, towards
      600,000 inhabitants; of whom 500,000 belong to the Slavo-Servian
      race. They are all Roman Catholics; with the exception of about
      80,000 who belong to the Greek Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Austrian kingdom of CROATIA in our time, between Styria,
      Hungary, Slavonia, Bosnia, Dalmatia, and the Adriatic, is not the
      ancient Croatia of Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Together with the
      Croatian colonists in Hungary, and the inhabitants of the Turkish
      Sandshak Banialouka, it contains about 800,000 souls. Of these
      less than 200,000 belong to the Greek Church; the great majority
      are Catholics. We shall see further <span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">[pg.11]</a></span>on
      that the Croats are divided in respect to their language into two
      parts: one of them having affinity with the Servians and
      Dalmatians, the other with the Slovenzi of Carniola and
      Carinthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. SLOVENZI or VINDES. These names comprise the Slavic
      inhabitants of the duchies of Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola,
      (the two latter forming the kingdom of Illyria,) and also those
      of the banks of the rivers Raab and Muhr in Hungary. Their number
      is over one million. With the exception of a few Protestants,
      they are all Catholics. They call themselves <i>Slovenzi</i>; but
      are known by foreign writers under the name of <i>Vindes</i>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      III. BULGARIAN BRANCH
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The BULGARIANS occupy the Turkish province Sofia Vilayeti,
      between the Danube, the Euxine, the Balkan, and Servia; they are
      about three and a half millions in number, the remnant of a great
      nation. About 80,000 more are scattered through Bessarabia and
      the other provinces of South Russia. Schaffarik enumerates seven
      thousand as Austrian subjects, living in that great receptacle of
      nations, Hungary. Most of them belong to the Greek Church.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      B. WESTERN STEM.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I. CZEKHO-SLOVAKIAN BRANCH.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      1. BOHEMIANS and MORAVIANS (Czekhes). These are the Slavic
      inhabitants of the kingdom of Bohemia and the Margravate of
      Moravia, both belonging to the Austrian empire. They are
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_12" id=
      "page_12">[pg.12]</a></span>about four and a half millions in
      number; of whom 100,000 are Protestants, the rest Catholics.
      Schaffarik includes also 44,000 of the Slavic inhabitants of
      Prussian Silesia in this race.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. SLOVAKS. Almost all the northern part of Hungary is inhabited
      by Slovaks: besides this they are scattered through the whole of
      that country, and speak different dialects. They are reckoned at
      between two and three millions.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      II. POLISH OR LEKHIAN BRANCH.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This comprises the inhabitants of the present kingdom of Poland;
      of a part of what are called since 1772 the Russian-Polish
      provinces; of the duchy of Posen; and of Galicia and Ludomeria.
      The bulk of the people in this latter country are Russniaks or
      Ruthenians. In the Russian provinces, which were formerly called
      White Russia, Black Russia, and Red Russia, and were conquered by
      the Poles in former times, the peasantry are Russians and
      Russniaks; in Lithuania, they are Lithuanians or Lettones, a race
      of a different family of nations. In all these countries, only
      the nobility and inhabitants of the cities are really Poles, or
      Slavi of the Leckian race. To the same race belongs also the
      Polish population of Silesia, and an isolated tribe in the
      Prussian province of Pomerania, called the Kassubes. The Slavi of
      the Leckian race hardly amount to the number of ten millions; all
      Catholics, with the exception of about half a million of
      Protestants.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      II. SORABIAN-VENDISH BRANCH.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      There are remnants of the old Sorabæ; and several other Slavic
      races in Lusatia and some parts of Brandenburg. Their<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">[pg.13]</a></span>
      number is less than 2,000,000; divided between Protestants and
      Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt, that besides the races here enumerated, there
      are Slavic tribes scattered through Germany, Transylvania,
      Moldavia, and Walachia, nay, through the whole of Turkey. Thus,
      for instance, the Tchaconic dialect, spoken in the eastern part
      of ancient Sparta and unintelligible to the other Greeks, has
      been proved by one of the most distinguished philologists to have
      been of Slavic origin.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id=
      "FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_17_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> But to ascertain their
      number, at any rate very small, would be a matter of
      impossibility, and in every respect of little consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We thus distinguish among the nations of the Slavic race two
      great families, the connection of whose members among each other
      is entirely independent of their present geographical situation;
      and this division rests upon a marked distinction in the Slavic
      language. To specify the marks, by which the philologist
      recognizes to which of these families each nation belongs, seems
      to be here out of place. The reader, without knowing the language
      itself, would hardly be able to comprehend them sufficiently; and
      he who understands it, will find better sources of information in
      philological works. All that concerns us here, is the general
      character, the genius of the language. For this purpose we will
      try to give in a few words a general outline of its grammar;
      exhibiting principally those features, which, as being common to
      all or most of its different dialects, seem to be the best
      adapted to express its general character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The analogy between the Slavic and the Sanscrit languages
      consists indeed only in the similar sound of a great many
      words;<span class="newpage"><a name="page_14" id=
      "page_14">[pg.14]</a></span> the construction of the former is
      purely European, and it has in this respect a nearer relation to
      the Greek, Latin, and German; with which idioms it has evidently
      been derived from the same source.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id=
      "FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_18_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The Slavic has three
      genders. Like the Latin, it knows no article; at least not the
      genuine Slavic; for those dialects which have lost their national
      character, like the Bulgarian, or those which have been corrupted
      by the influence of the German,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
      "FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_19_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> employ the demonstrative
      pronoun as an article; and the Bulgarian has borrowed the
      Albanian mode of suffixing one to<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_15" id="page_15">[pg.15]</a></span> the noun. For this very
      reason the declensions are more perfect in Slavic than in German
      and Greek; for the different cases, as in Latin, are
      distinguished by suffixed syllables or endings. The Singular has
      seven cases; the Plural only six, the vocative having always the
      form of the nominative. As for the Dual, a form which the Slavic
      languages do not all possess, the nominative and accusative, the
      genitive and local; the dative and instrumental cases, are always
      alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the declensions of adjectives the Slavic has two principal
      forms, according as they are <i>definite</i> or
      <i>indefinite</i>. The Old or Church Slavonic knows only two
      degrees of comparison, the positive and comparative; it has no
      superlative, or rather it has the same form for the comparative
      and superlative. This is regularly made by the suffix <i>ii</i>.
      mostly united with one of those numerous sibilants, for which the
      English language has hardly letters or signs, <i>sh, tsh, sht,
      shtsh</i>, etc. In the more modern dialects this deficiency has
      been supplied; in most of them a superlative form is made by
      prefixing the particle <i>naï</i>; e.g. in Servian, <i>mudar</i>,
      wise, <i>mudrii</i> wiser, <i>naïmudrii</i>, the wisest. The
      Russian, besides this and several other superlative forms, has
      one that is more perfect, as proceeding from the adjective
      itself: <i>doroghii</i> dear, <i>doroshe</i> dearer,
      <i>doroshaïshii</i>, dearest. Equally rich is this language in
      augmentative and diminutive forms not only of the substantive but
      also of the adjective, a perfection in which even the Italian can
      hardly be compared to it; of which however all the Slavic
      dialects possess more or less. Almost all the Russian
      substantives have two augmentatives and three diminutives; some
      have even more. We abstain with some difficulty from adducing
      examples; but we are afraid of going beyond our limits. It
      deserves to be mentioned as a peculiarity, that the Slavi
      consider only the first four ordinal numbers as adjectives, and
      all the following ones as substantives. For this reason, the
      governed word must stand in the genitive instead of<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">[pg.16]</a></span> the
      accusative: <i>osm sot</i> (nom. <i>sto</i>), eight hundred. In
      all negative phrases they employ likewise the genitive instead of
      the accusative. A double negation occurs in Slavic frequently,
      without indicating an affirmation; for even if another negation
      has already taken place, they are accustomed to prefix to the
      verb the negative particle <i>ne</i> or <i>nje</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In respect to the verb, it is difficult to give a general idea of
      its character; for it is in the forms of this part of speech,
      that there reigns the greatest variety in the numerous dialects
      of the Slavic language. The same termination which in Old
      Slavonic and in Russian indicates invariably the first person of
      the present, <i>u</i> or <i>gu</i>, is in Servian that of the
      third person Plural of the present and imperfect; and the general
      termination of the Servian and the Polish for the first person of
      the present, <i>am, em</i> or <i>im</i>, is in Old Slavonic and
      Russian used for the Plural, <i>em</i> and <i>im</i>. There is
      however one fundamental form through all the Slavic dialects for
      the second person of the present, a termination in <i>ash,
      esh</i> or <i>ish</i>; and this is consequently the person, by
      which it is to be recognized to what conjugation a verb belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The division of the verbs adopted in all other European languages
      into <i>Active</i> and <i>Passive</i>, seems to be useless in
      Slavic; for their being active or passive has no influence upon
      their flexion; and the forms of the Latin Passive and Deponent
      must in Slavic be expressed by a circumlocution. A division of
      more importance and springing from the peculiarity of the
      language itself, is that into verbs <i>Perfect</i> and
      <i>Imperfect</i>. Neither the Greek, nor the Latin, nor the
      German, nor any of the languages derived from them, admits of a
      similar distinction. It seems therefore difficult for persons not
      perfectly acquainted with any Slavic dialect, to form to
      themselves a clear idea of it. It is however one of their most
      striking features, which adds very considerably to their general
      richness and power. The relation in<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_17" id="page_17">[pg.17]</a></span> which the perfect and
      imperfect verbs stand to each other, is about the same as that of
      the perfect and imperfect tenses in the conjugation of the Latin
      verb. Perfect verbs express that an action takes place a single
      time, and therefore is entirely completed and past; from their
      very nature it results, that they have no imperfect tense, and
      their conjugation must be in general incomplete. Imperfect verbs
      express that the same action continues. Both have in most cases
      the same radical syllable, and may be formed with a certain
      degree of freedom; thus in Servian, <i>viknuti</i>, to cry once,
      <i>vikati</i>, to be crying; <i>umriyeti</i>, to die,
      <i>umirati</i>, to be dying. There are however others, which
      stand in the same relation to each other without issuing from the
      same verbal stock; e.g. in Servian, <i>tchuti</i> and
      <i>sluskati</i>, to hear; <i>retji</i> and <i>govoriti</i>, to
      speak, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Polish language, which is remarkably rich in every kind of
      flexion, has a still simpler and more regular way of forming also
      a frequentative out of almost every verb; e.g. <i>czytam</i>, I
      read, <i>czytivam</i>, I read often; <i>biore</i>, take,
      <i>bieram</i>, I take often, etc. In Bohemian, which in respect
      to grammar is by far the most cultivated of the Slavic languages,
      there is a refinement in the tenses, of which even the most
      perfect knowledge of the classical languages gives hardly any
      idea, and the right use of which is seldom, if ever, acquired by
      foreigners. Duration, decision, repetition, all the different
      shades of time and purpose, which other languages have to
      circumscribe in long phrases, the Bohemian expresses by a slight
      alteration of one or two syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not less rich in these variations of the verb is the Russian.
      Besides a vast treasure of original, genuine <i>indefinite</i>
      verbs, as they call all those, which have the general character
      of the verb of other languages, without any allusion to the
      duration or continuance of the action, they have verbs <i>simple,
      frequentative</i> and <i>perfect</i>. A single example will
      illustrate the fact:<span class="newpage"><a name="page_18" id=
      "page_18">[pg.18]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>

      "#Footnote_20_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verb simple, <i>dvinut'</i>, to move a single time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verb frequentative, <i>dvigivat'</i>, to move repeatedly.<a name=
      "FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_21_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Verb perfect, <i>sdvigat'</i>, to move completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader may judge for himself, of what precision, compactness,
      and energy, a language is capable, which has so little need of
      circumlocution. It must be mentioned, however, that not all these
      verbs are complete; as indeed it is obvious from their very
      nature, that in many of them, various tenses must be wanting. It
      is probably for this reason, that some of the most distinguished
      grammarians do not acknowledge this division of the verb itself;
      but put all its variations under the conjugation of a single
      verb, as different tenses,&mdash;a proceeding which contributes
      much to make the Slavic grammar a horror to all foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this short and meagre sketch is hardly sufficient to give the
      reader an idea of the richness, precision, and general
      perfectibility of the Slavic languages, it will be still more
      difficult to reconcile his mind to their <i>sound</i>; against
      which the most decided prejudices exist among all foreigners. The
      old Slavic alphabet has forty-six letters; and from this variety
      it can justly be concluded, that the language had originally at
      least nearly as many different sounds, although a great part of
      them are no longer to be found in the modern Slavic languages. It
      is true, that all the dialects are comparatively poor in vowels,
      and, like<span class="newpage"><a name="page_19" id=
      "page_19">[pg.19]</a></span> the oriental languages; utterly
      deficient in diphthongs.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id=
      "FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_22_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> They have neither the
      <i>oe</i> nor <i>ue</i>, which the Germans consider as the best
      sounds of their idiom: nor the Greek,[Greek: ei], [Greek: ui],
      [Greek: au], [Greek: eu], and the like; still less the variety of
      pronunciation of one and the same vowel, peculiar to the English.
      The Poles, Russians, and Bohemians, possess however a twofold
      <i>i</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id=
      "FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
      a finer and a coarser one; the latter of which is not to be found
      in any other European language, and is unpleasant to the ear of
      foreigners. The Poles, besides this, have <i>nasal vowels</i>, as
      other languages have nasal consonants.<a name="FNanchor_24_24"
      id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_24_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a striking peculiarity, that Slavic words very seldom
      <i>begin</i> with a pure <i>a</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id=
      "FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_25_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> hardly ever with
      <i>e</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id=
      "FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
      There are in the whole Russian language, only two words of Slavic
      origin, which have an initial <i>e</i>, and about twenty foreign
      ones in which this letter has been preserved in its purity; in
      all the rest the <i>e</i> is introduced by <i>y</i>; e.g.
      <i>Yelisaveta</i>, Elizabeth; <i>yest</i>', Lat. <i>est</i>, it
      is; <i>Yepiscop, episcopus</i>, bishop; <i>yeress</i>, heresy,
      etc. The initial <i>a</i> is more frequent, and is especially
      preserved in most foreign proper names, e.g. Alexander, Anna; or
      in other foreign words, where they omit the <i>H</i>, as
      <i>Ad</i>, Hades, Hell, <i>Alleluya</i>, Hallelujah. But the
      natural tendency of the language is to introduce it likewise by
      <i>y</i>; thus they say <i>yagnya</i>, in preference to
      <i>agnya</i>, Lat. <i>agnus</i>, although this last also is to be
      found in the old church books: <i>yasti</i>, to eat, <i>yakor</i>
      anchor, <i>yavor</i>, maple, German <i>ahorn</i>.<a name=
      "FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_27_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> The <i>o</i> in the
      beginning of words is pure in<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_20" id="page_20">[pg.20]</a></span> most Slavic dialects,
      i.e. without a preceding consonant. In Russian it sounds
      frequently more like an <i>a</i> than an <i>o</i>; e.g.
      <i>adin</i>, one, instead of <i>odin; atiotz</i>, father, instead
      of <i>otetz</i>. But the Vendes of Lusatia pronounce it
      <i>vo</i>; as also the Bohemians in the language of common life;
      although in higher style they have a pure initial <i>o</i>. The
      Croats, on the other hand, have no pure initial <i>u</i>; they
      say <i>vuho</i> ear, instead <i>uho</i> or <i>ucho</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to consonants, there is a great variety in the Slavic
      languages. There is however no <i>f</i> to be found in any
      genuine Slavic word; and even in words adopted from foreign
      languages, this letter has frequently changed its sound. So the
      Bohemian has made <i>barwa</i> from the German <i>farbe</i>,
      color. In respect to the connection of the Slavic with the Latin,
      it is interesting to compare <i>bob</i> with <i>feba, bodu</i>
      with <i>fodio, vru</i> with <i>ferveo, peru</i> with <i>ferio,
      plamen</i>, with <i>flamma, pishozala</i> with <i>fistula</i>,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest variety among the Slavic letters exists in the
      sibilants. Of these there are seven, perfectly distinct from each
      other; some of which it would be difficult to denote by English
      characters<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id=
      "FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_28_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>. They are the favourite
      sounds of the language. Not only the guttural sounds, <i>g,
      ch,</i> and <i>k</i>, but also <i>d</i> and <i>t</i>, are changed
      in many cases into analogous sibilants, according to fixed and
      very simple rules. On the other hand, the Slavic nations have a
      way of softening the harshness of the consonants, peculiar in
      that extent to them alone. The Frenchman has his <i>l
      mouillé,</i> the Spaniard his <i>elle doblado</i> and <i>ñ</i>.
      the Portuguese his <i>lh</i> and <i>nh</i>; the Slavic nations
      possess the same softening sound for almost all their consonants.
      Such is the usual termination of the Russian verb in <i>at'</i>
      or <i>it'</i>, etc. where other Slavic nations say <i>ati</i> or
      <i>iti</i> or those of the western branch <i>acz</i> or
      <i>ecz</i>. In the same<span class="newpage"><a name="page_21"
      id="page_21">[pg.21]</a></span> manner it occurs after initial
      consonants; thus <i>mjaso</i>, meat; <i>bjel</i>, white;
      <i>ljbov</i>, love, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> have in all Slavic languages
      the value of vowels; words like <i>twrdy</i>, <i>wjtr</i>, which
      judging from their appearance a foreigner would despair of ever
      being able to pronounce, are always in metre used as words of two
      syllables. Thus <i>Wlk</i>, <i>Srp</i>, are not harsher than
      <i>Wolk</i> and <i>Serp</i>. We feel however that these examples
      cannot serve to refute the existing prejudices against the
      euphony of the Slavic languages. Instead of ourselves, let one of
      their most eloquent and warmest advocates defend them against the
      reproach of roughness and harshness.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id=
      "FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_29_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> "Euphony and feminine
      softness of a language are two very different things. It is true
      that in most of the Slavic dialects, with the exception of the
      Servian, the consonants are predominant; but if we consider a
      language in a philosophical point of view, the consonants, as
      being the signs of ideas, and the vowels, as being mere bearers
      in the service of the consonants, appear in a quite different
      light. The more consonants, the richer is a language in ideas.
      <i>Exempla sunt in promtu</i>. The euphony of single syllables is
      only partial and relative; but the harmony of a whole language
      depends on the euphonic sound of periods, words, syllables, and
      single letters. What language possesses these four elements of
      harmony in equal measure? Too many vowels sound just as
      unpleasantly as too many consonants; a suitable number and
      interchange of both is requisite to produce true harmony. Even
      harsh syllables belong to the necessary qualities of a language;
      for nature herself has harsh sounds, which the poet would be
      unable to paint without harsh sounding tones. The roughness of
      the Slavic idioms, of which foreigners have complained so
      frequently, is therefore exclusively to be ascribed to the
      awkwardness of inexperienced or tasteless writers;<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">[pg.22]</a></span>
      <br />
      or they are ridiculous mistakes of the reader, who, unacquainted
      with the language, receives the sounds with his eyes instead of
      his ears."&mdash;"The pure and distinct vocalization, which does
      not leave it to the arbitrary choice of the speaker to pronounce
      certain vowels or to pass them over, as is the case in German.
      French, and English, gives at the same time to the Slavic
      languages the advantage of a regular quantity of their syllables,
      as in Greek; which makes them better adapted than any other for
      imitating the old classic metres. We must confess, however, that
      this matter has been hitherto neglected in most of them, or has
      been treated with little intelligence. We mean to say: Each
      Slavic syllable is by its very nature either short or long; since
      each Slavic vowel has a twofold duration, both short and long.
      This natural shortening and lengthening of a syllable is, as with
      the Greeks, entirely independent of the grammatical stress or
      falling of the voice upon them, or in other words, of the
      <i>prosodic tone</i>; the <i>quantity</i> being founded on the
      nature of the pronunciation, on the longer or shorter duration of
      the vowel itself, and not on the grammatical accent. This latter
      may lie just as well on syllables prosodically short, as on those
      which are long."
    </p>
    <p>
      From these introductory remarks, we turn again to the historical
      part of our essay, referring the reader back to our division of
      the whole Slavic race into Eastern and Western Stems. We have,
      first of all, that most remarkable Old or Church Slavonic, the
      language of their Bible, now no longer a living tongue, but still
      the inexhaustible source of the sublimest and holiest expressions
      for its younger sisters. Then follow the <i>four</i> languages,
      perfectly distinct from each other, spoken by the Eastern Slavic
      nations, viz. the Russian, Illyrico-Servian, Vindish, and
      Bulgarian. Three of them possess a literature of their own; and
      one of them, the Illyrico-Servian, even a double literature; for
      political circumstances and the influence of the early
      division<span class="newpage"><a name="page_23" id=
      "page_23">[pg.23]</a></span> of the oriental and occidental
      churches, having unfortunately split the nation into two parts,
      caused them also to adopt two different methods of writing one
      and the same language, as we shall show in the sequel. And
      lastly, among the Slavic nations of the Western stem, we find
      either <i>three</i> or <i>four</i> different languages, according
      as we regard the Czekhish and Slovakian idioms as essentially the
      same or distinct, viz. the Bohemian, [Slovakian,] Polish, and
      Sorabic in Lusatia. Of these, the first and third have each an
      extensive literature of its own.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id=

    <h3>
      HISTORY OF THE OLD OR CHURCH SLAVIC (COMMONLY CALLED SLAVONIC)
      LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      It can hardly be doubted that in very ancient times the whole
      Slavic race spoke only one language. This seems however very
      early to have been broken up into several dialects; and such
      indeed must have been the natural result of the wide extension of
      the people. Eginhard, the secretary and historian of Charlemagne,
      (ob. 839.) calls the Slavic nations, whom his hero subjugated,
      Veletabæ, Sorabæ, Obotrites, and Bohemians; and mentions
      expressly that they did not all speak the same, but a very
      similar language. It would be difficult to decide what portion of
      the still existing Slavic tongue has kept itself the purest; the
      Old Slavic has its Græcisms, the Servian its Turcisms, the Polish
      and Bohemian their Germanisms, the Russian its Tartarisms,
      Germanisms, and Gallicisms. No language in the world will ever
      resist the influence of the languages of its neighbours; and even
      the lofty Chinese wall cannot protect the inhabitants of that
      vast empire from corruptions in their language. It was formerly
      the general view, that the ecclesiastical Slavonic was to be
      considered as the <i>mother</i> of all the living Slavic
      dialects; and there are indeed even now a few philologians and
      historians who still adhere to that opinion. The deeper
      investigations<span class="newpage"><a name="page_26" id=
      "page_26">[pg.26]</a></span> of modern times, wherever an equal
      share of profound erudition and love of truth has happened to be
      united in the same persons, have sufficiently proved, that the
      church Slavonic is to be considered, not as the mother of all the
      other Slavic languages, but as standing to them only in the
      relation of an elder sister,&mdash;a <i>dialect</i> like them,
      but earlier developed and cultivated. The original mother-tongue,
      from which they were all derived, must have perished many
      centuries ago. But <i>where</i> the Old Slavic was once spoken,
      and which of the still living dialects has been developed
      <i>immediately</i> out of it,&mdash;an honour to which all the
      nations of the eastern stem, and one of the western,
      aspire,&mdash;is a question which all the investigations and
      conclusions of able historians and philologians have not hitherto
      been able to answer in a satisfactory manner. The highest
      authorities in Slavic matters are divided on this point. The
      disputes relating to it have been conducted with a degree of
      zeal, little proportioned to its intrinsic importance; nay,
      recently, with a passion bordering upon fierceness; and what is
      still more to be regretted, without that regard to truth and
      candour, which ought to be the foundation of all historical
      researches. The great political questions which in the East of
      Europe have already disturbed the peace of nations&mdash;the idea
      of Panslavism, the disputed preponderance of Austria or Russia,
      the jealousy of the Slavic races against the Germans and among
      each other&mdash;have been allowed to exert a decided influence
      even on this purely historical question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The claims of the Russians in this matter have long since been
      given up as easily refuted; being indeed destitute of any
      historical foundation. The circumstance, however, that the
      language of the Slavic Bible was, in Russia, until the reign of
      Peter the Great, exclusively the language of books, confirmed the
      natives for a long time in the belief, that the old Russian and
      the church Slavic were one and the same language; and
      that<span class="newpage"><a name="page_27" id=
      "page_27">[pg.27]</a></span> the modern Russian was the immediate
      descendant of the latter; until modern criticism has better
      illustrated the whole subject.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id=

      The great similarity of the <i>Slovakish</i> language with the
      Old Slavic, especially of the national dialect spoken by those
      Slovaks who live scattered through Hungary; and the
      correspondence of their grammatical forms and flexion, to a
      degree not found in any other Slavic language; seemed to decide
      for the Slovaks. An historical basis is likewise not wanting to
      this hypothesis; for the Slovaks belonged formerly to the great
      kingdom of Moravia; where, according to all the ancient
      historians, Cyril and Methodius lived and taught the
      longest.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href=

      On the other side, the venerable Bohemian Abbot Dobrovsky, who
      has examined the opinions of his predecessors with more exactness
      and erudition, and investigated the nature of the different
      Slavic dialects more deeply than any philologist before him,
      decides for the <i>Servians</i>. According to him, the Old Slavic
      was, in the time of Cyril and Methodius, the
      Servian-Bulgarian-Macedonian dialect, the language of the Slavi
      in Thessalonica, the birthplace of these two Slavic
      apostles.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id=

      His grounds seemed indeed incontestable, until Kopitar, a name of
      equally high authority and importance in Slavic matters, who
      formerly agreed with him,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id=

      arguments of no less weight, that the true home of the language
      of the Slavic Bible was to be sought among the <i>Pannonic</i> or
      <i>Carantano-Slavi</i>, the <i>Slovenzi</i> or <i>Vindes</i> of
      the present times.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id=

      neighbourhood and German influence. These Pannonian Slavi were
      Methodius' own diocesans; for their instruction the Scriptures

      later period, to the Bulgarians and Moravians, who easily

      Kopitar's arguments have hitherto failed to convince other
      eminent Slavic scholars, especially those of the Bohemian school;
      who still accept it as a fact, that the language of the Slavic
      Bible was, in the ninth century, the Servian-Bulgarian dialect;
      and Bulgaria its home. Schaffarik, another great name in Slavic
      philological researches, seemed in an earlier work to adopt the
      opinion of Kopitar; but, after continuing his investigations
      further, he too came to the result, that Bulgaria was the home of
      the Old Slavic; and that the language still spoken in that
      province, corrupted indeed by foreign influences more than any
      other Slavic dialect, is its direct descendant.<a name=

    <p>
      Be this as it may, the Old Slavic has long since become

      "pageXX" id="pageXX">[XX]</a></span> the common property of all
      the Slavic nations, and its treasures are for all of them an
      inexhaustible mine. Dobrovsky counted in it 1605 radical
      syllables.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id=

      in its present state, but has in itself the inestimable power of
      augmenting its richness, the faculty of creating new forms of
      expression for new ideas. But its great perfection does not
      consist alone in this multiplicity of words. Schlözer, the great
      historian and linguist, justly observes: "Among all modern
      languages the Slavonic (Old Slavic) is one of those which are
      most fully developed. With its richness and other perfections I
      have here no concern. How it became so, the history of its
      cultivation sufficiently explains. Its model was the Greek
      language, in those days the most cultivated in the world;
      although Cedrenus no longer wrote like Xenophon. No idiom was
      more capable than the Slavonic of adopting the beauties of the
      Greek. The translators, intending a literal version, and not like
      Cædmon the Anglo-Saxon, or Otfried the German, a mere <i>poetic
      metaphrase</i>, were in a certain measure compelled to
      <i>subdue</i> their own language, to make it flexible, to invent
      new turns, in order faithfully to imitate the original." <a name=

    </p>
    <p>
      After having ceased for centuries to be a language of common
      life, the Old Slavic has of course lost that kind of pliancy and
      facility, which only a living language, employed to express all
      the daily wants of men, can possibly acquire. But for this same
      reason it has gained infinitely in solemnity and dignity.
      Imposing by its very sound, exciting in the minds of millions
      sanctifying religious associations, it seems to have grown almost
      unfit for any vulgar use, and to have become exclusively devoted
      to holy, or at least to serious and dignified
      subjects.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_30" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      There are, as we have mentioned above, many circumstances, which
      seem to justify the opinion, that the Slavi were very early in
      possession of a degree of cultivation, which would make it indeed
      difficult to believe, that they should not have known how to read
      and write before the ninth century. Ditmar of Merseburg, the
      German, speaks of the inscriptions with which the pagan
      Obotrites, the Slavic inhabitants of Mecklenburg, used to cover
      their idols. The southern Slavi had much greater advantages.
      Neighbours of the Greeks, and in constant intercourse with them;
      both as a nation, by war and traffic, and through individuals who
      lived at the court of Constantinople; it can hardly be supposed,
      that no earlier attempt should have been made to adapt the Greek
      alphabet to the Slavic language, or to invent a new one founded
      on that basis. There was however not a single <i>satisfactory</i>
      proof, that this was ever done with any degree of success before
      that time; notwithstanding all the grounds by which some modern
      writers, zealous and eloquent advocates of this opinion,
      endeavoured to support it.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id=
      "FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_40_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> It is only since Kopitar's
      discovery of some Glagolitic manuscripts <i>at least</i>
      cotemporary with the most ancient Cyrillic documents known, that
      this question has taken another aspect. But whether there existed
      already a Slavic alphabet or not, it is very doubtful whether
      Cyril knew it; since the Slavic tribes among whom he and
      Methodius lived, were not acquainted with it; for all the legends
      and early historical annals agree in calling Cyril the inventor
      of the Slavic alphabet.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_31"
      id="page_31">[pg.31]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This alphabet, as arranged by Cyril, is founded on the Greek. In
      adjusting it, Cyril employed all the Greek characters; although a
      few of them have so much altered their shape in the course of
      time, as hardly to be recognized in their present form, e.g. the
      <i>Z</i> and the <i>H</i> of the Greeks. The first has the
      English, not the Greek pronunciation of that letter; the latter
      in its altered shape is the common <i>I</i> of the Slavic
      language, and thus corresponds with the pronunciation of the
      modern Greeks. The <i>H</i> or <i>Eta</i> in an unaltered form,
      on the other hand, is the <i>N</i> of the Slavic alphabet. The
      Greek <i>B</i>, ß, went over into the still softer sound of
      <i>V</i>, <i>v</i>;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id=
      "FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_41_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and another sign was
      selected for Buki or <i>B</i>. This and all the characters to
      denote Slavic sounds, which he did not find in the Greek
      alphabet, Cyril took from other oriental languages, wherever he
      could find similar sounds; and thus very judiciously avoided that
      accumulation of letters to mark a single sound, which occur so
      often in all the systems of writing derived from the Latin. In
      this manner he extended his alphabet to forty-six characters or
      signs; some of them indeed merely signs for expressing shades of
      pronunciation, which in other languages are denoted by marks and
      points. Some others are not pronounced at all, and seem, at least
      according to the present state of the Slavic languages, utterly
      superfluous. Hence the Russians and Servians have diminished the
      number of their letters considerably; although the Russian has
      still some which could be amalgamated with others, or entirely
      omitted. Whether the Old Slavic actually had, at the time of
      Cyril's invention, so many different shades of sound, it would be
      difficult to decide at present, after that language has existed
      for so many centuries as a mere language of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, or, according to his baptismal name, Constantine, and
      Methodius his brother, must be reckoned among the
      benefactors<span class="newpage"><a name="page_32" id=
      "page_32">[pg.32]</a></span> of mankind; for it was they who
      procured for the Slavic nations, so early as the ninth century,
      the inestimable privilege of reading the Holy Scriptures in a
      language familiar to their ears and minds; whilst the sacred
      volume yet remained, for centuries after, inaccessible to all the
      other European Christians, the exclusive property of the
      priesthood. They were born in Thessalonica, in the early part of
      the ninth century, of a noble family; it does not appear whether
      of Greek or of Slavic extraction. Macedonia, of which province
      Thessalonica was in the times of the Romans the capital, was
      inhabited by many Slavi at a very early period. Constantine, who
      obtained by his learning and abilities the surname of the
      Philosopher, could have learned Slavic here, even without
      belonging to the Slavic nation. As a flourishing commercial city,
      this place was peculiarly favourable for learning languages; and
      it was probably here too, that Constantine learned Armenian; for
      the introduction of several Armenian letters into the Slavic
      alphabet seems to prove, that this language was not unknown to
      him. When grown up, his parents sent him to Byzantium, where he
      entered the clerical profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is reported that there came ambassadors from the Khazares, a
      Hunnic-Tartaric tribe, to the emperor Michael, to ask for a
      teacher in Christianity. On the recommendation of Ignatius,
      Constantine was chosen for this mission, as being particularly
      qualified by his eloquence and piety. On the road he stopped for
      some time in Cherson on the Dnieper, where he learned the
      Khazaric language. The empire of the Khazares extended from the
      Volga and the Caspian Sea, across the Caucasian isthmus and the
      peninsula of Taurida, as far as to Moldavia and Walachia. Several
      Slavic tribes were tributary to them; but about the middle of the
      ninth century, at the time of Cyril's mission, their power began
      to decline; their vassals became their enemies, and gradually
      their conquerors; until towards the end of the tenth and at the
      beginning of the eleventh<span class="newpage"><a name="page_33"
      id="page_33">[pg.33]</a></span> century, their empire became
      entirely extinct.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id=
      "FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_42_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Constantine converted and
      baptized their Khan, whose example was followed by a great part
      of the nation. It was probably after he had returned from this
      mission, that Cyril went to convert the Bulgarians. At this time,
      or just before, according to Dobrovsky's opinion, he invented the
      Slavic letters, and translated the Gospels, during his stay in
      Byzantium. This however is nothing more than an hypothesis,
      against which other hypotheses have been started by other
      scholars. Between A.D. 861 and 863, there came another embassy to
      the emperor from the Moravian prince Rostislav, who asked for a
      teacher, not only to instruct his subjects in Christianity more
      perfectly than it had been done before, but also to teach them
      <i>to read</i>. Most of the Moravians were already baptized.
      Constantine, accompanied by his brother Methodius, was sent to
      Moravia, where the people received them with expressions of joy.
      They introduced here the Slavic liturgy, and preached in the
      Slavic language.
    </p>
    <p>
      One peculiar circumstance served to give to their persons a more
      than common sanctity. Constantine had been so fortunate as to
      discover in Cherson the bones of the holy Clement, relics which
      he every where carried with him. After three or four years, the
      pope invited the two brethren to Rome, where the possession of
      these relics procured them great honour and distinction. The pope
      Adrian, followed by the clergy and people, met them and their
      treasure before the gates of the city. Both the brothers were
      consecrated as bishops; those of their Moravian disciples who had
      accompanied them to Rome, were made priests and deacons.
      Constantine received the consecration, but did not accept the
      diocese allotted to him. With the permission of the pope, he
      adopted the name of Cyril, and died forty days
      afterwards,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_34" id=
      "page_34">[pg.34]</a></span> Feb. 13, A.D. 868. His remembrance
      is cherished as holy by the Slavic nations; and even as early as
      A.D. 1056, we find, in the calendar of the <i>Evangelium of
      Ostromir</i>, the fourteenth of February set down for the
      celebration of his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodius returned to Moravia the same year, A.D. 868. He was
      what was called an <i>episcopus regionarius</i>, and had
      therefore no fixed residence. In the letters of pope John VIII,
      he is called bishop of Moravia and Pannonia. The first of these
      countries was at this period the theatre of bloody wars; the
      Slavic inhabitants of the other had been already converted to
      Christianity by German priests, as early as A.D. 798. In
      consequence of this, Methodius found the Latin worship
      established here, and the Latin language in use. The innovation
      made by him, however, was of course greatly favoured by the
      people; who for the first time heard the gospel read to them in a
      language they understood. But he met with the more opposition
      from the priests. The whole jealousy of the Romish church seems
      to have been awakened by Methodius' proceedings. He found however
      a protector in the pope himself; who feared perhaps an entire
      alienation of the Slavic population, and their transition to the
      Oriental church; but was at the same time desirous to preserve
      the whole authority of the Latin language. In a letter to the
      Moravian prince Svatopluk, he enjoins expressly, "that in all the
      Moravian churches the gospel, for the sake of the greater
      dignity, should be read first in Latin, and afterwards translated
      into Slavic for the people ignorant of the Latin."
    </p>
    <p>
      The question, what part of the Scriptures was translated by Cyril
      himself, what by his brother, and what supplements were made by
      their immediate successors, can now hardly be answered in a
      satisfactory manner. The honour of the invention of the alphabet
      appears to belong exclusively to Cyril; but in the sacred work of
      translation, Methodius was not less active;<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">[pg.35]</a></span> and
      his merits in respect to the conversion and instruction of the
      Slavi, were more favoured by a longer life. According to John,
      exarch of Bulgaria, Cyril translated only <i>selections</i> from
      the Gospels and the <i>Apostle</i>, as the book of Acts and the
      apostolic epistles are together called in Slavic; i.e. a
      <i>Lectionarium</i>, or extracts from those parts of the
      Scriptures, arranged in such a way as to serve as a lesson for
      every sacred day through the whole year. The Russians call such a
      collection <i>Aprakoss</i>, the Greeks [Greek: evangelia,
      eklogadia]. A work of this description is the above mentioned
      Evangelium of Ostromir, of the year 1056, written out expressly
      for the domestic use of Ostromir. <i>posadnik</i><a name=
      "FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_43_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> of Novogorod, a near
      relation of the grand-duke of Izjaslav. It is however held to be
      more probable, that Cyril translated at first the whole of the
      Gospels, as still contained in a Codes of A.D. 1144, in the
      library of the Synod of Moscow. The Presbyter of Dioclea, who
      wrote about A.D. 1161, ascribes to Cyril not only the translation
      of the Gospels, but also of the Psalter;<a name="FNanchor_44_44"
      id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_44_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> and at a later period that
      of the whole Old and New Testaments, as well as of the
      <i>Massa</i>, i.e. the Greek liturgy of Basilius and Chrysostom.
      This opinion has since been generally received. In respect to the
      Old Testament, however, it is much to be doubted; since no
      ancient Codex of it exists, or has ever been proved to have
      existed. As to the New Testament, the Apocalypse must at any rate
      be excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      What part of the translation was performed by Methodius does not
      appear. John, exarch of Bulgaria, who lived in the same century,
      translated the books of Johannes Damascenus into Slavic. In the
      course of the tenth and eleventh centuries, the Russian and
      Servian princes called into their empires many learned Greeks,
      versed in the Slavic language, that they might<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">[pg.36]</a></span>
      continue the holy work of translation. From the historian Nestor
      it appears, that the Proverbs of Solomon existed in the twelfth
      century in Slavic. The book of Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, the
      Prophets, and Job, were translated in Servia in the thirteenth or
      fourteenth century; the Pentateuch in Russia or Poland A.D. 1400,
      or about that time. It is certain, that towards the close of the
      fifteenth century, the whole Bible was already translated into
      Old Slavic. According to Dobrovsky, the different parts of it
      were not collected until after A.D. 1488, when the Bohemian Bible
      of Prague was printed. This latter served as a model for the
      arrangement of the Slavonic Bible; what was wanting was at that
      time supplied, and those books of the Old Testament which had
      been translated from the Greek, were reviewed and corrected
      according to the Vulgate. The Codex of Moscow of A.D. 1499, the
      most ancient <i>existing</i> copy of the whole Bible in the Old
      Slavic, is probably at the same time the first which was ever
      wholly completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domains of the Old Slavic language, which seemed at first to
      be of very great extent, were soon, by the well known jealousy of
      the Romish church, limited to Russia and Servia. In Bohemia,
      which owed its conversion to German priests, the Slavic liturgy
      seems never to have been generally introduced; and the old Slavic
      church language has therefore exerted only an inconsiderable
      influence on the Bohemian. In Poland too, the Slavic liturgy was
      only <i>tolerated</i>, although the first books with Cyrillic
      types were printed there. In Moravia, Pannonia, and Illyria, the
      Slavonic worship was, after some struggle, supplanted by the
      Latin; in the two latter countries, however, the language was
      retained, and the occidental church service conducted in the
      Slavic language; i.e. in a language which at that time was
      perfectly intelligible to the Illyrians.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that the priests of this part of the country had never
      adopted the alphabet, which Cyril invented for the
      benefit<span class="newpage"><a name="page_37" id=
      "page_37">[pg.37]</a></span> of their brethren in Pannonia or
      Bulgaria;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id=
      "FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
      who, less advanced in civilization than the tribes bordering on
      Italy, could as yet neither write nor read; while the latter were
      already in possession of an alphabet of an ancient and mysterious
      origin. For the first appearance of the Glagolitic letters,
      (<i>glagol</i> signifies in Slavic <i>word</i>, or rather
      <i>verb</i>,) is still buried in perfect darkness. An almost
      fabulous antiquity has been ascribed to this alphabet by various
      old writers. According to some it was derived from the Goths or
      Getæ; according to others, from the Phrygians and Thracians; and
      a very common tradition made St. Jerome, who was a native of
      Dalmatia, the inventor of it. The sounder criticism of our age
      seems at last to have proved that all these opinions were
      untenable. The oldest Glagolitic manuscript known before 1830 was
      a Psalter of A.D. 1220; i.e. more than three and a half centuries
      younger than the Cyrillic alphabet, and evidently copied from a
      known manuscript written in this latter. This, in connection with
      some other circumstances, induced the learned Dobrovsky to
      declare the whole alphabet to be the result of a pious fraud. It
      seems surprising that this view should have been generally
      adopted,&mdash;at least for a certain time. It was explained by
      Dobrovsky in the following way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a Synod held at Spalatro in Dalmatia, in A.D. 1060, Methodius,
      notwithstanding he had been patronized by several popes, was
      declared a heretic, nearly two hundred years after his death; and
      it was resolved that henceforth no mass should be read except in
      the Latin or Greek language. From the decrees of that Synod, it
      appears that they took the Gothic and Slavonic<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">[pg.38]</a></span> for
      the same idiom. A great part of the inhabitants of Illyria
      remained nevertheless faithful to their language, and to a
      worship familiar to their minds through that language. A singular
      means, Dobrovsky asserts, was found by some of the shrewder
      priests, to reconcile their inclinations with the jealous
      despotism of Rome. A new alphabet was invented, or rather the
      Cyrillic letters were altered and transformed in such a way, as
      to approach in a certain measure to the Coptic characters. To
      give some authority to the new invention, it was ascribed to St.
      Jerome. This, it was maintained, is the Glagolitic alphabet, so
      called, used by the Slavic priests of Dalmatia and Croatia until
      the present time. Cyril's translation of the Bible and the
      liturgic books were copied in these characters, with a very few
      deviations in the language; which probably had their foundation
      in the difference of the Dalmatian dialect, or were the result of
      the progress of time; for this event took place at least 360
      years after the invention of the Cyrillic alphabet. With this
      modification, the priests succeeded in satisfying both the people
      and the chair of Rome. It <i>sounded</i> the same to the people,
      and <i>looked</i> different to the pope. The people submitted
      easily to the ceremonies of the Romish worship, if only their
      beloved language was preserved; and the pope, fearing justly the
      transition of the whole Slavic population of those provinces to
      the Greek church, permitted the mass to be read in Slavonic, in
      order to preserve his influence in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hypothesis had come to be pretty generally received; when in
      the year 1830, some Glagolitic manuscripts, which bore very
      decided evidence of being at least as old as the middle of the
      eleventh century, were discovered by Kopitar in the library of
      Count Clotz in Tyrol. The existence of the calumniated alphabet
      at a period cotemporary with the oldest Cyrillic manuscript known
      (the Evangelium of Ostromir), was a death-blow to the above
      singular narrative. Kopitar published the newly
      discovered<span class="newpage"><a name="page_39" id=
      "page_39">[pg.39]</a></span> Codex, accompanied by a thundering
      philippic against the defenders of the former theory, and in
      favour of the antiquity of the Glagolitic alphabet, and of the
      Pannonian origin of the Slavic liturgy.<a name="FNanchor_46_46"
      id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_46_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> But here the matter rested.
      Nothing has since been discovered, (so far as we are informed,)
      to throw light on the first invention or introduction of this
      alphabet; no connecting link to explain its relation to the
      Cyrillic forms of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Vostokof, a Russian scholar of great learning, and
      one of the principal names in Old Slavic literature,<a name=
      "FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_47_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> the history of the Old
      Slavic or Church language and its literary cultivation, may be
      divided into three periods:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. From Cyril, or from the ninth century, to the thirteenth
      century. This is the <i>ancient</i> genuine Slavonic; as appears
      from the manuscripts of that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth century. This is the
      <i>middle</i> age of the Slavonic, as altered gradually by
      Russian copyists, and full of Russisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. From the sixteenth century to the present time. This comprises
      the <i>modern</i> Slavonic of the church books printed in Russia
      and Poland; especially after the <i>Improvement</i> of those
      writings, so called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most ancient documents of the Old Slavic language, are not
      older than the middle of the eleventh century. There has been
      indeed recently discovered a manuscript of the translation of
      John of Damascus, written by John, exarch of Bulgaria, in the
      ninth century. Vostokof however proves on philological grounds,
      that it cannot be the original, but is a later copy. The
      above-mentioned Evangelium of Ostromir (1056) is the earliest
      monument of the language, as to the age of which no
      doubt<span class="newpage"><a name="page_40" id=
      "page_40">[pg.40]</a></span> exists. It is preserved in the
      imperial library at St. Petersburg.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id=
      "FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_48_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> According to Vostokof, this
      is the third, or perhaps the fourth, copy of Cyril's own
      translation. This latter is irretrievably lost, as well as the
      copy which was made for Vladimir the Great, a hundred years
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few years younger is a <i>Sbornik</i>, A.D. 1073, or a
      collection of ecclesiastical writings, discovered in the year
      1817, and a similar <i>Sbornik</i> of 1076; the former in a
      convent near Moscow, the other now in the library of the imperial
      Hermitage of St. Petersburg. Further, the <i>Evangelium of
      Mistislav</i>, written before the year 1225, for the prince
      Mistislav Vladimirowitch; and another <i>Evangelium</i> of the
      year 1143, both at present in ecclesiastical libraries at Moscow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these venerable documents, there are several inscriptions
      on stones, crosses, and monuments, of equal antiquity; and a
      whole series of political documents, contracts, ordinances, and
      similar writings; among which one of the most remarkable is the
      oldest manuscript of the <i>Pravda Russkaya</i><a name=
      "FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_49_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> a collection of the laws of
      Jaroslav, A.D. 1280. The libraries of the Russian convents
      possess a large number of manuscripts; some of which proved to be
      of great value, when examined about twenty years since by a
      Commission of scholars, appointed expressly for that purpose by
      the Academy of Sciences.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id=
      "FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_50_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> The spirit of
      critical-historical<span class="newpage"><a name="page_41" id=
      "page_41">[pg.41]</a></span> investigation, which took its rise
      in Germany within our own century, has penetrated also the
      Russian scholars; and their zeal is favoured by their government
      in a manner at once honourable and liberal. The task was not
      small. The Synodal library of Moscow alone has a treasure of 700
      Old Slavic Codices; the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg
      possesses likewise numerous Slavic manuscripts. Among the
      libraries of other countries, there is hardly one of any
      importance, which has not like Codices of more or less value to
      exhibit. Those of Vienna and the Vatican are in this department
      especially rich. These two were thoroughly searched by a like
      Commission.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id=
      "FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_51_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Of the great activity, and
      the critical spirit which the Russian historians of our day have
      shown in respect to their own past, more will be said in our
      sketch of the Russian literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of the monuments of the Old Slavic increases
      considerably in the <i>second</i> period; and we find ourselves
      the more obliged to be satisfied with mentioning only the most
      important among them. At the head of these, stands the
      <i>Laurentian Codex</i>, the oldest existing copy of Nestor's
      Annals, A.D. 1377, now in the imperial library at St. Petersburg.
      Nestor, a monk in a convent near Kief, born A.D. 1096, was the
      father of Russian history. He wrote Annals in the Old Slavic
      language, which form the basis of Slavic history, and are not
      without importance for the whole history of the middle ages. They
      were first printed in A.D. 1767, and subsequently in four
      editions, the last in 1796. Schlözer, the great German historian,
      who published them anew in 1802-9, with a translation, added
      considerably to their intrinsic value by a critical and
      historical commentary upon them. But even his edition could not
      satisfy<span class="newpage"><a name="page_42" id=
      "page_42">[pg.42]</a></span> the more critical spirit of our
      days. A new one has been published in the course of the last
      seven years; for which, not less than fifty-three manuscripts
      were carefully compared. The merit of it belongs to the
      Archæographical Commission of the Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>third</i> period begins with the sixteenth century. In the
      course of time, and after passing through the hands of so many
      ignorant copyists, the holy books had of course undergone a
      change; nay, were in some parts grown unintelligible. The
      necessity of a revision was therefore very strongly felt. In A.D.
      1512, the Patriarch of Constantinople, at the request of the Tzar
      Basilius Ivanovitch, sent a learned Greek (a monk of Mount Athos)
      to Moscow, to revise the church books, and to correct them
      according to the Greek originals. As this person some years
      afterwards fell into disgrace and could not accomplish the work,
      it was taken up repeatedly in the course of the same and the
      following century, until the revision of the liturgical books was
      pronounced to be finished in A.D. 1667; but that of the Bible not
      before A.D. 1751. The principles on which this revision, or, as
      it was called, <i>Improvement</i>, was made, were in direct
      conflict with the reverence due to the genius of the Slavic
      language. The revisers, in their unphilosophical mode of
      proceeding, tried only to imitate the Greek original, and to
      assimilate the grammatical part of the language, as much as
      possible, to the Russian of their own times. They all acted in
      the conviction, that the language of the Bible and liturgical
      books was merely <i>obsolete Russian</i>. Even the latest
      revisers of the Bible, in 1751, knew nothing of Cyril or
      Methodius; and had no doubt, that the first translation was made
      in Russia under Vladimir the Great, A.D. 988, in the language
      which was then spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such other works in Old Slavic, as were the productions of this
      period, seem rather to belong to the history of the Russian and
      Servian literature. We have seen from the preceding,
      that<span class="newpage"><a name="page_43" id=
      "page_43">[pg.43]</a></span> the Old Slavic had altered
      considerably; nay, was in a certain measure amalgamated with
      those dialects. We shall see in the sequel, how it was gradually
      supplanted by them.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id=
      "FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_52_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The printing of works in the Old Slavic, at the present day, is
      almost exclusively limited to the Bible and to what is in
      immediate connection with it. The first printed Slavonic work was
      set in Glagolitic letters. This was a missal of A.D.
      1483.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_53_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> The earliest Cyrillic
      printing office was founded about A.D. 1490, at Kracow, by
      Svaipold Feol. Nearly at the same time, 1492, they began in
      Servia and Herzegovina to print with Cyrillic types. In A.D.
      1518, a Cyrillic-Slavonic printing office was established at
      Venice; and about the same time, a part of the Old Testament in
      the White-Russian dialect, printed with Cyrillic letters, was
      published at Prague in Bohemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Russia, now the principal seat of the eastern Slavic
      literature, printing was not introduced until after the middle of
      the sixteenth century. The first work was published in Moscow
      A.D. 1564, an edition of the <i>Apostle</i>, executed by the
      united skill of two printers. It would seem, however, that they
      did not succeed in Russia; for a few years after we find one of
      them in <span class="newpage"><a name="page_44" id=
      "page_44">[pg.44]</a></span>Lemberg, occupied in printing the
      same book; and the other at Wilna, in printing the Gospels. In
      Russia, the Gospels were printed for the first time in A.D. 1606.
      The first complete Slavonic Bible was published at Ostrog in
      Volhynia (Poland) A.D. 1581, fol. printed after the manuscript of
      1499, which also was the first that comprehended the whole
      Bible.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_54_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> The second edition of the
      whole Slavonic Bible was printed eighty-two years later, at
      Moscow, A.D. 1663. An enumeration of all the subsequent editions,
      is given in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id=
      "FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_55_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The philological part of the church Slavonic language was not
      cultivated so early as would have been desirable. There exists
      however a grammar by Zizania, published A.D. 1596 in Warsaw.
      Twenty years afterwards another by M. Smotrisky appeared, Wilna
      1618. This work, written like Zizania's grammar in the
      White-Russian dialect,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id=
      "FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_56_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> was for a long time
      considered as of good authority; it reappeared in several
      editions, and served as the basis of most of the grammars written
      during the 17th and 18th centuries. M. Stroyeff found in the
      Paris library the manuscript of an Old Slavic grammar, written
      in<span class="newpage"><a name="page_45" id=
      "page_45">[pg.45]</a></span> Latin by John Uzewicz, a Student of
      Theology at the University of Paris in 1643. In the year 1822,
      Dobrovsky published his <i>Institutiones Linguæ Slavicæ dialecti
      vcteris</i>, a grammatical work which, like all the productions
      of this distinguished scholar, throws a new light upon the
      subject, and renders all former works of a similar character
      useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lexical part of this literature is more defective. Most of
      the existing dictionaries are merely short and unsatisfactory
      vocabularies. The most ancient is the work of P. Berynda, <i>Lex.
      Slaveno-Russicum</i>, Kief 1627. More in use at present are the
      <i>Kratkoi Slowar Slavjanskoi</i>, or 'Short Slavic Dictionary,'
      by Eugenius, St. Petersb. 1784; and the larger 'Church
      Dictionary' by Alexejef, 4th ed. St. Pet. 1817-19. A dictionary
      of this dialect for the special use of foreigners, does not yet
      exist.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href=

    <p>
      In modern times considerable attention has been devoted to the
      examination of the Old Slavic language and its relation to its
      kindred dialects. Antiquarian and paleographical researches have
      been happily combined with philological investigations; and the
      eminent names which are found among these diligent and
      philosophical inquirers, insure the best prospects to their
      cause.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href=

    <h3>
      HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The name of <i>Russia</i> and the <i>Russians</i> is not older
      than the ninth or tenth century. The northern part of that vast
      empire, however, was long before inhabited by Slavic nations, who
      seem to have been divided into small states under chiefs chosen
      by themselves; to have been peaceable in their character, and
      most of them tributary to more powerful neighbours. About the
      middle of the ninth century, civil dissensions arose among the
      Slavi of Novogorod, at the election of a new head or
      <i>posadnik</i>. Troubled at the same time from without, by the
      conquering and enterprising spirit of the Varegians, a
      Scandinavian tribe, they no longer felt able to make resistance
      against them; and therefore, A.D. 862, they chose Rurik, the
      chief of the Varegians, for their own head. These Scandinavians
      were by the Finns called <i>Ruotzi</i>, an appellation which in
      their language signifies <i>strangers</i>. This name, in a
      somewhat altered form, passed over to the inhabitants of the
      acquired territory, with whom the conquerors<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">[pg.48]</a></span> soon
      amalgamated. Rurik founded thus the first Slavo-Russian state;
      and his followers, long accustomed to a warlike nomadic mode of
      life, settled down among the Slavic inhabitants of the country.
      The nationality of the <i>strangers</i>, comparatively few in
      number, was merged in that of the natives; but still, in one
      respect, it exercised a strong influence upon the latter, by
      infusing into them the warlike spirit of the former. It is only
      since that time, that we find the Slavi as conquerors. Their
      empire rapidly extended in the course of the following hundred
      and fifty years, and their power and external influence also
      rose; while at the same time the ancient civil institutions of
      the native Slavi were respected and improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning of the eleventh century, Jaroslav, the son of
      Vladimir the Great, imitating his father's example, divided on
      his death-bed his empire among his sons, and thus sowed the seeds
      of dissension, anarchy, and bloody wars; a case repeated so often
      in ancient history, that it seems to be one of the few from which
      modern princes have derived a serious lesson. The Mongols broke
      into the country; easily subdued the Russians thus torn by
      internal dissensions; succeeded, A.D. 1237, in making them
      tributary; and kept them for two hundred years in the most
      dishonourable bondage. During this long period, every germ of
      literary cultivation perished. In the middle of the fifteenth
      century, Ivan Vasilievitch III,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id=
      "FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_59_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> delivered his country from
      the Asiatic barbarians, then weakened by domestic dissensions;
      conquered his Russian rivals; and united Novogorod with his own
      princedom of Moscow. From that period the power and physical
      welfare of Russia have increased without interruption to the
      present time. The literary cultivation of its inhabitants has
      likewise advanced; at first indeed with stops hardly proportioned
      to the <span class="newpage"><a name="page_49" id=
      "page_49">[pg.49]</a></span>external progress of the empire; but
      now for more than a century, in consequence of the despotic
      activity of their sovereigns, with a wonderful rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Russian literature has five distinct periods. The
      <i>first</i> period comprises an interval of more than nine
      centuries, from the date of our first knowledge of the Russian
      Slavi, to the coming of age of Peter the Great. A.D. 1689. This
      period would easily admit of several subdivisions; and did we
      pretend in these pages to give the reader more than a
      <i>sketch</i> of literary history, we should perhaps find it
      advisable to adopt them. This long period, however, both in a
      comparative and an absolute sense, is so very poor, that, limited
      as we are, a few words will suffice to give a general survey of
      it; and so much the more, because the productions of this period
      are closely connected with the history of the Old Slavic
      language, and have mostly been already mentioned under that head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>second</i> period extends from the coming of age of Peter
      the Great to the accession of Elizabeth his daughter, A.D. 1741,
      which was the commencement of Lomonosof's influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>third</i> period extends from Lomonosof, the creator of
      Russian prose, to Karamzin, the reformer of it, who was born in
      1765.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fourth</i> period covers the interval from Karamzin to the
      accession of the emperor Nicholas in 1825.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fifth</i> period begins with the accession of Nicholas in
      1825, and continues to the present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before however we begin our historical notices, a few words
      relating to the characteristic features of the Russian language,
      may find a place here. Three principal dialects are to be
      distinguished, viz.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The <i>Russian proper</i>, the true literary language of the
      whole Russian nation, and <i>spoken</i> in Moscow and all the
      central and northern part of the European Russian empire. And
      here we <span class="newpage"><a name="page_50" id=
      "page_50">[pg.50]</a></span>will mention the remarkable fact,
      that the peasant on the Wolga, on the Oka, and on the Moskwa,
      speaks the same pure Russian which is heard in the parlour and
      from the pulpit. Vulgar and corrupted branches of this dialect,
      are those of Suzdal and Olonetzk, the last of which is mixed with
      Finnish words.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The <i>Malo-Russian</i>, the language of the south of Russia,
      especially towards the east. The principal difference between
      this dialect and the Russian proper, consists partly in the
      pronunciation of several letters; e.g. in that of the consonant
      [Cyrillic: character ghe], which sounds in the latter like
      <i>g</i> hard, but in the former like <i>h</i>, as
      <i>hospodin</i> instead of <i>gospodin</i>, master, lord; partly
      in many obsolete forms of expression, which seem to give to the
      Malo-Russian a nearer relationship to the Old Slavic, in which
      similar idioms are to be found. The influence of the Poles, who
      for nearly two centuries were rulers of this part of the country,
      is also still perceptible in the language, This dialect is
      especially rich in national songs. Many of them are of peculiar
      beauty, touching <i>naiveté</i>; and a poetical truth which far
      outshines all artificial decorations. The greater part of these
      songs have an elegiac character; as is the case indeed with most
      productions of the common people.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id=
      "FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_60_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> The dialect itself,
      however, is far from being less adapted to the expression of the
      comic. There exists in it a travesty of the AEneid, written by J.
      Kotliarevski, a Kozak, which has found great favour throughout
      all Russia, although a foreigner is less able to appreciate its
      peculiarities and beauties; since indeed all poetic excellence of
      a comic description can be felt only by those who are familiar
      not only with the poetic language, but also with all those minute
      local and historical circumstances, the allusions to which
      contribute so frequently to augment the ludicrous.<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">[pg.51]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Essentially the same with the Malo-Russian is the idiom of the
      <i>Russniaks</i> in Red Russia, in the eastern part of Galicia,
      and the north-eastern districts of Hungary; and the few
      variations which occur in it have not yet been sufficiently
      investigated. Comparatively little attention has been paid to
      this branch of the Slavic race; and their beautiful national
      songs, scattered among a widely extended people, have only
      recently become the object of curiosity and examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The <i>White-Russian</i> is the dialect spoken in Lithuania
      and a portion of White Russia, especially Volhynia. The situation
      of these provinces sufficiently accounts for its being full of
      Polisms. All the historical documents of Lithuania are written in
      this dialect; and several Russian writers in the sixteenth and
      seventeenth centuries employed it in preference to the Old
      Slavonic. The first Russian translation of the Bible was written
      in it. It is the youngest of the Russian dialects.
    </p>
    <p>
      What first strikes us in considering the Russian language as a
      whole, is its immense copiousness. The <i>early</i> influence of
      foreign nations appears here as a decided advantage. The German,
      in the highest degree susceptible for foreign <i>ideas</i> and
      forms of <i>thought</i>, repels nevertheless all foreign
      <i>words</i> and forms of <i>expression</i> as unnatural
      excrescences. It is evidently disfigured by the adoption of
      foreign words, and can preserve its beauty only by adhering to
      its own national and inexhaustible sources. The Russian, having
      been in early times successively subjected to the influence of
      the Scandinavian, Mongolian, Tartar, and Polish languages, is in
      this respect to be compared, in a certain measure, with the
      English, in which the ancient British, the Latin, the Saxon, the
      Danish, and the French, amalgamated in the same proportion as the
      ideas of these different nations were adopted. Hence nothing that
      ever contributed to the singular composition of this rich
      language, appears to be borrowed; but all belongs to it as its
      lawful property. But the great<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_52" id="page_52">[pg.52]</a></span> pre-eminence of the
      Russian appears in the <i>use</i> which it made of these adopted
      treasures. Its greater flexibility made it capable of employing
      foreign words merely as <i>roots</i>, from which it raised stems
      and branches by means of its own native resources. It is this
      copiousness and variety of <i>radical</i> syllables, which gives
      to the Russian in certain respects a claim over all other Slavic
      languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another excellence is the great freedom of construction which it
      allows, without any danger of becoming unintelligible or even
      ambiguous. It resembles in this point the classic languages; from
      which however its small number of conjunctions decidedly
      distinguishes it. This want of conjunctions has been objected to
      the language as a defect; it seems however to be one of the
      causes, why it is so remarkably clear and distinct; since it can
      only admit of comparatively short phrases. In spite of this
      clearness, its adaptedness for poetry is undeniable; and in this
      branch the incomparable national songs extant in it would afford
      a most noble foundation even in respect to forms, if nature could
      ever obtain a complete victory over the perverted taste of
      fashion. Whether this language is really capable of entirely
      imitating the classic metres, is still a matter of dispute among
      distinguished Slavic philologians.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id=
      "FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_61_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> As to its euphony, what has
      been said above in respect to the Slavic languages in general,
      may be applied particularly to the Russian. Here however the ear
      of the unprejudiced listener alone can decide.

      FIRST PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>To the coming of age of Peter the Great</i>, 1689.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the Varegians in respect to the language,
      appears to have been inconsiderable; their own idiom on
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_53" id=
      "page_53">[pg.53]</a></span> contrary being soon absorbed by that
      of the natives. Rurik's grandsons had already Slavic
      names.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_62_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> The principal event in
      those ancient times, and one which manifested its beneficent
      consequences in respect to civilization here, as every where, was
      the introduction of Christianity, towards the end of the tenth
      century. Vladimir the Great, the first Christian monarch, founded
      the first schools; Greek artists were called from Constantinople
      to embellish the newly erected churches at Kief; and poetry found
      a patron and at the same time her hero in Vladimir. Vladimir and
      his knights are the Russian Charlemagne and his peers, king
      Arthur and his Round table. Their deeds and exploits have proved
      a rich source for the popular tales and songs of posterity; and
      serve even now to give to the earlier age of Russian history a
      tinge of that romantic charm, of which the history of the middle
      ages is in general so utterly void. The establishment of
      Christianity was followed by the introduction of Cyril's
      translation of the Scriptures and the liturgical books. The
      kindred language of these writings was intelligible to them; but
      was still distinct enough from the old Russian to permit them to
      exist side by side as two different languages; the one fixed and
      immovable, the voice of the Scriptures, the priests, and the
      laws; the other varying, advancing, extending, adapting itself to
      the progress of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this latter, the genuine old Russian, had its poets, was,
      until the close of the last century, only known by historical
      tradition; no monument of them seemed to be left. But at that
      time, A.D. 1794, a Russian nobleman, Count Mussin-Pushkin,
      discovered the manuscript of an epic poem, 'Igor's Expedition
      against the Polovtzi,' apparently not older than the twelfth
      century. It is a piece of national poetry of no common beauty,
      united with an equal share of power and gracefulness. But what
      strikes us even more than this, is, that we find in it no trace
      of that rudeness, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_54" id=
      "page_54">[pg.54]</a></span> which would naturally be expected in
      the production of a period when darkness still covered all
      eastern Europe, and of a poet belonging to a nation, which we
      have hardly longer than a century ceased to consider as
      barbarians! There hovers a spirit of meekness over the whole,
      which sometimes even seems to endanger the energy of the
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The genuineness of this poem has, so far as we know, never been
      questioned; but it is indeed a very surprising feature, that
      during the recent diligent search through all the libraries in
      the country after old manuscripts, not a single production has
      been discovered, which could in any way be compared with it. This
      remarkable poem stands in the history of ancient Russian
      literature perfectly isolated; and hence exhibits one of the most
      inexplicable riddles in literary history.<a name="FNanchor_63_63"
      id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_63_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, the Russians enjoyed at this early period as much
      mental cultivation as any other part of Northern Europe. There
      were several writers even among their princes. Jaroslav, the son
      of Vladimir the Great, was not less active than his father had
      been in advancing the cause of Christianity, and all that stands
      in connection with religion. He sent priests throughout the whole
      country to instruct the people, and founded in Novogorod a
      theological seminary for three hundred students. He took care
      that the translation of the church books was continued; but the
      most remarkable monument of his reign, as well in an historical
      as in a philological respect, is the <i>Pravda Russka</i>, a
      collection of laws.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id=
      "FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href=

      1125, wrote 'Instructions for his Children;' one of his
      successors, Constantine Vsevolodovitch, a hundred years later,
      produced a history of the Russian princes, which is now lost. The
      clergy, safe in their cells from the tempests of war, were busy
      in translating from the Greek; Nestor wrote his valuable
      annals;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_65_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> another priest, Basilius,
      described the cotemporary events in the south of Russia;
      Sylvester, bishop of Perejaslavl, ob. 1124, and several others of
      the clergy, continued Nestor's annals;<a name="FNanchor_66_66"
      id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_66_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> while Hegumen Daniel wrote
      his travels to Palestine in the beginning of the twelfth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theological productions of the early portion of this period,
      are of less value than the historical. It was however this field,
      that was cultivated most diligently. There are several sermons,
      or rather synodal <i>oraisons</i>, still extant; some of which,
      by another Cyril, metropolitan of Kief, A.D. 1281. are said to be
      not without real eloquence. Most of the productions of this early
      period, which belong indeed more to the history of the Slavonic
      than of the Russian literature, perished in the devastations and
      conflagrations of the Mongols.
    </p>
    <p>
      From A.D. 1238 to 1462, the Russian princes, as we have seen,
      were vassals of the Mongol Tartars, or the <i>Golden
      Horde</i>.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id=
      "FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_67_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> In the course of these two
      centuries, nearly every<span class="newpage"><a name="page_56"
      id="page_56">[pg.56]</a></span> trace of cultivation perished. No
      school existed during this whole time throughout all Russia. The
      Mongols set fire to the cities; sought out and destroyed what
      written documents they could find; and purposely demolished all
      monuments of national culture. The convents alone found in their
      policy a sort of protection. Science therefore became more than
      ever the exclusive possession of the monks. Among these, however,
      no trace of classical learning, and hardly a show of scholastic
      wisdom, was to be found. Fortunately they improved their time as
      well in respect to posterity by writing annals, as for their own
      personal benefit by accumulating wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The re-establishment of Russian independence in the middle of the
      fifteenth century, had a reviving influence on national science
      and literature. The nation however had been too long kept back,
      ever to be able to overtake their western neighbours. From this
      point a new division of this period begins. Some of the Russian
      princes were men of powerful and active minds; they invited
      artists and physicians from Greece, Italy, and Germany, into
      their country, and rewarded them liberally. Ivan IV,<a name=
      "FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_68_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> A.D. 1538-84, ordered
      schools to be founded in all the cities of his empire; under his
      reign the first printing-office was established in Moscow in
      1564. Soon afterwards a theological academy was founded at Kief.
      Boris Godunof, 1598-1605, sent eighteen noble youths to study at
      foreign universities. The princes of the house of Romanof showed
      themselves not less active. Alexei and Fedor, the father and
      brother of Peter the Great, opened the way for that bold
      reformer, and appear as his worthy predecessors; indeed the merit
      of several improvements, which have been generally ascribed to
      Peter, belongs to them. During<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_57" id="page_57">[pg.57]</a></span> this whole later
      period, the Polish language and literature exerted a decided
      influence on the Russian; and some writers began to use the
      dialect of White Russia, an impure mixture of the two,<a name=
      "FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_69_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> while the pure Russian was
      despised as merely fit for vulgar use. The Malo-Russian also, or
      Ruthenian dialect, was, by the influence of the Polish language,
      cultivated before the pure Russian; which last began, only in the
      latter half of the seventeenth century, to shake off these chains
      and acquire for itself an independent form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first germs of dramatic art were likewise carried from Poland
      to Russia. In Kief, the theological students performed
      ecclesiastical dramas; and travelled about during the holidays,
      to exhibit their skill in other cities. The scenes which they had
      to repeat most frequently, were the three Children in the fiery
      furnace, and Haman's execution. The tragedies of Simeon of
      Polotzk, in the Old Slavic language, had great success in the
      middle of the seventeenth century. Their renown penetrated from
      the convents to the court; where they were performed before Tzar
      Fedor, the predecessor of Peter.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id=
      "FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_70_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> His minister, Matveyef, the
      Slavic Mecaenas of his time, and himself a writer, invited the
      first stage-players to Russia; and at his instigation, the first
      secular drama, a translation of Molière's "Médecin malgré lui,"
      was played before the gratified princesses and their enraptured
      maids of honour. The sister of the two Tzars, the Tzarevna
      Sophia, was a great patroness of the dramatic art: and was
      herself the author of several tragedies and comedies, which were
      acted before her by her ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter portion of the first period, poor as it is, has
      nevertheless<span class="newpage"><a name="page_58" id=
      "page_58">[pg.58]</a></span> several books of travels to exhibit.
      A merchant of Tver, Athanasius Nikitin, travelled in the year
      1470 to India, visited the Dekkan and Golconda, and gave on his
      return a description of those countries. Two other merchants of
      Moscow, Korobeinikof and Grekof, described a century later their
      travels through Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Fedor Baïkof, Russian
      envoy to China, published likewise a book of travels in that
      remarkable country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the department of history, this portion of the first period
      was surprisingly productive. Not only were the Annals of the
      venerable Nestor, the basis of all Slavic history, continued by
      the monks with fidelity and zeal; but a whole series of other
      annals, biographies of single princes, and chronographies, were
      produced; and even some foreign nations received their share of
      attention.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id=
      "FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_71_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> The reader however must not
      expect to find a vestige of philosophical genius, nor a
      philosophical representation of the events. Entirely unacquainted
      with classical literature, the Greek writers of the Byzantine age
      were their only models. The best that can be expected is a dry
      and faithful narrative of facts.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id=
      "FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_72_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The weakest part of the literature of this later portion of the
      period, is the theological branch; a sketch of which however may
      not be inappropriate here. It is true, that the
      <i>Improvement</i> of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_59" id=
      "page_59">[pg.59]</a></span> the old church books was executed
      with much zeal; but in what spirit this was done, in a
      philological respect, we have mentioned above in the history of
      the Old Slavonic literature, to which the labours of the
      translators properly belong. Nikon, patriarch of Russia, ob.
      1681, carried on this work with the greatest activity; and
      besides this set on foot a collection of historical
      annals.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_73_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> The light of the
      Reformation, which at that time spread its beneficent beams over
      all Europe, and exerted particularly such a strong influence on
      Poland, did not penetrate into the night of the Russian church;
      the gloom of which, however, had always been mitigated by a
      spirit of meekness and Christian charity. Still, we notice among
      the pulpit productions of this time somewhat of the polemic
      genius of the age. It was not, however, against the bold
      innovations of Lutherans or Calvinists, that the clergy found
      occasion to turn their weapons, but against the <i>Jewish</i>
      heresy!<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_74_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> A translation of the Psalms
      of David, Moscow 1680, deserves to be distinguished among similar
      productions. The writer was the monk Simeon of Polotzk, author of
      the above-mentioned spiritual dramas, and instructor of the Tzar
      Fedor. Still more remarkable is the first attempt to translate
      the Bible into the Russian language. Francis Skorina, the
      translator, likewise a native of Polotzk, where the Polish
      influence was stronger<span class="newpage"><a name="page_60" id=
      "page_60">[pg.60]</a></span> than in any other quarter, was a
      doctor of medicine; but the time had now come when it began to be
      felt over all Europe, that the holy volume did not belong
      exclusively to the clergy. Some parts only of his translation
      have been printed.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id=
      "FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_75_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the sixteenth century, several printing offices
      had been established in Russia, almost exclusively for the
      benefit of theological works. Nearly all the historical writings
      were preserved in manuscript; and have been first printed in
      modern times. The awkward appearance of Cyril's alphabet seemed
      to add an unnecessary difficulty to the diffusion of the
      knowledge of reading. Towards the end of the seventeenth century
      Elias Kopiovitch made some improvement in the appearance of the
      Slavic letters; it was however reserved to Peter's reforming
      hand, to give to them a fixed and permanent shape.

    <h4>
      SECOND PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      <i>From the majority of Peter the Great, A.D. 1689, to Lomonosof,
      A.D. 1741.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the genuine Russian literature begins only with
      the adoption of the language of the people for all civil
      writings. It was Peter the Great, who raised this language to be
      the language of public business, in which all transactions of the
      courts of justice henceforth were to be held, and all ordinances
      to be issued. Ere this energetical man was able to establish a
      Russian printing office in his own empire, in order not to
      lose<span class="newpage"><a name="page_61" id=
      "page_61">[pg.61]</a></span> time, he gave a privilege for
      fifteen years to the Dutch printer Tessing for Russian works. It
      was in Amsterdam, in 1699, that the first Russian book was
      printed. About the year 1704, Peter himself invented some
      alterations in the Slavic letters, principally so as to make them
      more similar to the Latin. He caused a fount of these new types
      to be cast by Dutch artists; and the first Russian newspaper was
      printed with them at St. Petersburg in 1705. These letters, with
      some additional alterations during the course of the following
      ten years, were generally adopted for the Russian language, and
      are in use at the present time. The same letters, with a few
      slight variations, are also used by that portion of the Servians
      who belong to the eastern church; the other portion making use of
      the Latin alphabet. In all theological writings, however, the
      ancient forms of the letters are preserved. This is the
      difference between the <i>grashdanskii</i> and
      <i>tzerkvennii</i>, or the civil and church alphabet.<a name=
      "FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_76_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The energy with which this emperor, <i>a real autocrat</i>,
      proceeded, caused his people to overleap a whole century. If
      there is something revolting to a liberal mind, in the despotic
      haste with which he deprived a great nation at once of a part of
      their nationality, through his arbitrary decision in all that he
      deemed best for them; still it serves greatly to allay this
      feeling, to observe that the resistance which he experienced did
      not proceed from the people, but almost exclusively from the
      obstinate pride of a spoiled nobility, and the narrow-minded
      policy of an ignorant and jealous priesthood. The Russian nation
      itself is indeed, more than any other people, susceptible of deep
      impressions. Hence they are in general not averse to innovations;
      and were in Peter's time, as now, willing to be conducted by a
      hand<span class="newpage"><a name="page_62" id=
      "page_62">[pg.62]</a></span> acknowledged as that of a superior.
      In consequence of these very national qualities, good or bad,
      they are capable of being readily moulded into any new form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the rapidity, nay, vehemence of the Tzar's improvements
      were a real benefit to the nation, this is not the place to
      examine; but for the free development of the language and
      literature, it is evident, that his proceedings were injurious,
      notwithstanding their apparently wonderful effect. Although the
      language possesses all the elements of completeness, and
      notwithstanding the not inconsiderable mass of talent which has
      developed itself in the course of time, the Russian literature
      has perhaps not yet produced a single work of great and decided
      <i>original</i> value. The best works which they have, are
      imitations; and he is the most distinguished writer whose
      discernment leads him to choose the best model. No doubt, the
      present standing of the Russian literature <i>in general</i>
      would have been much lower, and its extent especially would have
      been much smaller, than it now is, had the Russian genius been
      permitted to break its own way through the darkness; but there is
      still less doubt, that in this case it would have preserved its
      original peculiarity, that wonderful blending of the East and the
      West, of Asiatic suppleness and European energy, of which their
      popular songs give such affecting, and in some cases powerful
      specimens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter, without delay, caused many books to be translated into
      Russian, from the German, French, English, and Dutch languages.
      The haste however with which this was performed, and the greater
      attention of the Tzar to the <i>matter</i> than to the
      <i>form</i>, had the natural consequence, that most of these
      translations were miserable productions, executed without the
      least regard for the language itself. Peter's only object was to
      enable his subjects to become a <i>reading</i> people, and to
      communicate to them useful knowledge through the medium of books.
      Beauties of style, and even mere purity of language, belong in a
      certain<span class="newpage"><a name="page_63" id=
      "page_63">[pg.63]</a></span> measure to the luxuries of
      literature; the Tzar thought only of utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      These innovations in literature found of course a great many
      opponents among the clergy; but there were some enlightened
      priests, among those who held the highest standing in the church,
      who favoured in general the Tzar's plan. The field of theology
      became somewhat more cultivated during this period. Theophan
      Prokovitch, archbishop of Novogorod, ob. 1736, alone wrote sixty
      works, of which however only about half were printed. He was
      Peter's faithful assistant; and not only his learning and mental
      gifts, but his high moral character, gained him a decided
      influence. He was styled the Russian Chrysostom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metropolitan of Rostof, called the holy Demetrius, ob. 1709,
      was likewise a very productive theological writer. He was
      considered by his contemporaries as a true pattern of
      Christianity; and was equally distinguished for his learning. The
      metropolitan Stephen Javorsky, ob. 1722, was celebrated for his
      eloquence in the pulpit. Gabriel Bushinsky, bishop of Rjazan and
      Murom, ob. 1731, was not only a theological writer, but
      translated also works on history. A remarkable example in this
      period, is Elias Kopiyevsky,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id=
      "FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_77_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> ob. 1701, who studied
      theology in Holland, and became a protestant, and afterwards a
      pastor at Amsterdam. He aided zealously in Peter's great work of
      translations. Several historical and philological works
      translated by him, were published by Tessing. Luther's Catechism
      was translated about the same time by the pastor Glück of
      Livonia, who had been made a prisoner by the Russians and carried
      to Moscow. It was in his house that Catharine, the future empress
      of Russia, was brought up.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id=

      "#Footnote_78_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a><span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">[pg.64]</a></span> Among
      the secular writers of this period, prince Antiochus Kantemir,
      ob. 1745, must above all be mentioned. Of Greek extraction and
      born in Constantinople, with all the advantages of an
      accomplished education, and in full possession of several highly
      cultivated languages, he nevertheless chose the Russian idiom for
      his poetical productions. These are mostly satires, and evidently
      bear the stamp of a thorough knowledge of the classics. Besides
      these he wrote on different subjects of natural philosophy; and
      translated a selection from the Epistles of Horace, and
      Fontenelle's work on the plurality of worlds. About the same
      time, Leont. Magnitzky wrote the first Russian Arithmetic with
      Arabic numerals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the lyric poets two Kozaks, Cyril Danilof and Semen
      Klimofsky, are named with some distinction. The first of the two,
      better known under the diminutive of his name, <i>Kirsha</i>
      Danilof, deserves particular attention. The Russians have their
      cyclus of heroic legends, as well as the occidental nations.
      Vladimir and his Boyars are to them what Arthur and his Round
      table, Charlemagne and his twelve peers, are to Britons, Franks,
      and Germans. These traditions lived still among the people in
      Kirsha Danilof's time; and yet live to some extent as nursery
      tales. Kirsha versified them; and, we fear, changed them
      according to the spirit of his time. They have only been printed
      and published in the present century, at least seventy-five years
      after they were written; for Kirsha was a cotemporary of Peter I.
      It is no doubt to him, that we owe their preservation through an
      age of a false and pedantic taste, which could only have despised
      these relics of barbarism, and during which they were forgotten
      by the Frenchified literati.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id=

      "#Footnote_79_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a><span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">[pg.65]</a></span> In
      historical contributions this period is not wholly poor; but as
      the writers paid not the slightest attention to style, or did not
      know from what principles to begin, the language remained
      entirely uncultivated. There was as yet no thought of a Russian
      <i>Grammar</i>. In poetry the system of rhymed verses, in which
      the syllables were not measured, but counted, in imitation of the
      Poles, reigned exclusively. Meanwhile the popular songs held
      faithfully to the old Russian irregular but highly musical
      numbers, consulting only the ear. Trediakofsky, born 1703, was
      the first who examined more closely the nature of the language,
      and advised the adoption of the classical metres founded on
      quantity. He applied on this point merely the principles which
      Zizania and Smotrisky, nearly a century before, had established
      for the Old Slavic idiom, and with equal propriety. But, as the
      talent for illustrating his rules by good examples was wanting in
      him, he made very little impression; and his name and endeavours
      were soon forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id=

    <h4>
      THIRD PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>From Lomonosof to Karamzin, A.D.</i>1741&mdash;1796.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We have now reached the epoch from which the temple of Russian
      literature, as it appears at present, must be dated.
      It<span class="newpage"><a name="page_66" id=
      "page_66">[pg.66]</a></span> was Peter's hand that laid the
      corner-stone; it was Lomonosof who raised it above the ground;
      whilst the fortunate turns of Elizabeth's and Catharine's vanity
      caused it to be filled with more worshippers than would otherwise
      ever have sought the way thither. Academies were founded for the
      sciences and arts; numerous institutions for the education of all
      classes and ages were created and endowed with true imperial
      magnificence. In the year 1758 the university of Moscow was
      founded; while other scientific institutions of all descriptions
      were established by Catharine's unbounded liberality. In the year
      1783 the free establishment of printing offices was permitted; of
      course not without reserving to the government the privilege of a
      strict censorship. A seminary for educating teachers for popular
      schools was erected, with the intention of founding Gymnasia all
      over the country. These measures, no doubt, had an essential and
      beneficial influence on the general civilization of the nation.
      But the common people, the peasantry, remained entirely
      neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was however in a family of the lowest standing, that Michael
      Lomonosof was born, A.D. 1711. His father was a fisherman in the
      government of Archangel. During the long winters, when his
      father's trade was interrupted, Lomonosof learned to read of one
      of the church servants. The beauties of the Bible, and the
      singing of the Psalms during the church service, in the rhymed
      translation of Simeon of Polotzk, first awakened his own poetical
      faculties. An ardent desire for an education caused him to leave
      home privately and seek his way to Moscow, where, he was told,
      was an institution, in which foreign languages were taught.
      Circumstances proved fortunate; he found liberal patrons; was
      educated afterwards in Kief and St. Petersburg, and obtained
      means to go to Germany. Here he connected philosophy with the
      mathematical studies which he had hitherto chiefly pursued;
      devoted a part of his time to<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_67" id="page_67">[pg.67]</a></span> the science of mining,
      at the celebrated school in Freiburg; and sat in Marburg at the
      feet of the philosopher Wolf. In passing through Brunswick, he
      escaped with difficulty the horrors of the Prussian military
      system. He succeeded in reaching Holland, and thence returned to
      his own country; where he was well received and honourably
      employed by the government. He died A.D. 1765, in the enjoyment
      of high general esteem, but not that degree of reputation which
      has been allotted to him by a more judicious posterity. He first
      ventured to draw a distinct boundary line between the Old Slavic
      and the Russian languages; which hitherto had been confounded in
      a most intolerable manner. In his Russian Grammar, he first laid
      down principles and fixed rules for the general compass of the
      language; without however checking the influence of the Church
      Slavonic more than was necessary, in order to preserve the
      identity of the former. He wrote a sketch of Russian History, a
      long and tedious epic poem called the <i>Petreide</i>, speeches,
      odes, tragedies, and several works on chemistry and mineralogy.
      None of his productions are without merit; but he was more a man
      of sagacity and strong talent, than of poetical genius. His poems
      are all cold and artificial; excepting perhaps his version of a
      few chapters of the book of Job, where the beauties of the
      original appear to have inspired him. His speeches and odes are
      written in the same style of panegyric, which then reigned, and
      which reigns still, in all the creations of Russian poetry or
      prose having the least reference to the imperial family; and
      which, in connection with the boastful style of all productions
      purporting to describe national deeds, is a real blemish upon the
      Russian literature, fitted to render it disgusting to all
      foreigners.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id=
      "FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_81_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The two most celebrated writers among Lomonosof's
      cotemporaries,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_68" id=
      "page_68">[pg.68]</a></span> though somewhat younger than he,
      were Alexander Sumarokof, ob. 1777, and Michael Kheraskof, born
      1733, ob. 1807. Both were very productive writers in prose and
      poetry, overwhelming the reading public with tragedies and
      comedies, odes and epistles; and the latter also with two long
      epic poems, one in twelve, and the other in eighteen cantos! Both
      were highly admired, and the overflowings of their pens were
      devoured with avidity. Kheraskof was called the Russian Homer.
      The childhood, in which Russian literature then was, is not the
      age of criticism; sounder judges of later times have allotted to
      those productions a place hardly above mediocrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Russian theatre was instituted in Jaroslav. A.D. 1746.
      The permission, which the actors obtained A.D. 1754, to establish
      themselves in St. Petersburg, and still more the foundation of a
      national stage in Moscow in 1759, served much to awaken the
      decided dramatic talent of the Russians; a faculty in which they
      are perhaps incomparable, and certainly are not surpassed by any
      other nation. Several gifted literary men employed themselves in
      writing for the stage. Such were J. Knjashnin, ob. 1791, an
      imitator of the French, but not without talent of his own; Von
      Wisin, ob. 1792, the author of two comedies, full of genuine
      comic power; Maïkof, Nicolef, Klushin, etc. The distinguished
      productions of Von Wisin alone have continued to hold possession
      of the stage.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id=
      "FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_82_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the most prominent poets of a miscellaneous character the
      following may be mentioned: Hippolit Bagdanovitch, born 1743, ob.
      1805, author of a tale in verse, <span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_69" id="page_69">[pg.69]</a></span> <i>Dushenka</i>,
      Psyche, not without gracefulness and <i>naiveté</i>; Chemnitzer,
      ob. 1784, the writer of the best Russian fables; Gabriel
      Dershavin, born 1743, ob. 1816, the most celebrated Russian poet
      of his time. The glory of Catharine II, and of the Russian army,
      was his favourite theme; but even the panegyrical style of his
      odes, the most dangerous enemy not only of moral, but likewise of
      poetical truth, cannot destroy the power of his truly poetical
      genius. His ode <i>To God</i> has obtained the distinction of
      being translated not only into several European languages, but
      also into Chinese, and hung up in the emperor's palace, printed
      with golden letters on white satin.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id=
      "FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_83_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> Further, Vasilii Kapnist,
      born 1756, ob. 1823, who as a lyrical poet stands next to
      Dershavin; Bobrof, familiarly acquainted with English literature,
      which he endeavoured to imitate, full of imagination, but
      bombastic and obscure; Prince Dolgoruky. distinguished by a
      philosophical vein; Neledinsky-Meletzky, whose songs are known
      even by the lower classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period also the field of translation was not less
      cultivated. Kostrof translated the Iliad in rhymed verses, A.D.
      1787, and also Macpherson's Ossian from the French. Petrof gave a
      version of the Æneid in 1793. Bulgakof first made the Russian
      public acquainted with Ariosto; Popovsky with Pope and Locke,
      etc.&mdash;As a writer of general and favourable influence on
      literature, we must not forget to name N. Novikof, editor of
      several periodical journals, author of the first Russian
      bibliographical work, and a man of that general literary
      activity, which, even without productiveness of its own, induces
      others to exercise theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_70" id=
      "page_70">[pg.70]</a></span>The patriotism which caused the
      Russians ever to pay a certain degree of attention to their
      national history, deserves the highest praise. During all periods
      of their literature, this branch has been attended to with
      diligence. It is however especially the laborious collection and
      faithful preservation of materials, for which posterity is
      indebted to them; since there is little of a philosophical spirit
      to be found in their arrangement of these materials; and in
      regard to the language in which they are presented, it is
      striking to observe how the Russian prose was always far behind
      the Russian poetry. G.F. Müller, ob. 1783, a German by birth, but
      who devoted all his life to Russian literature, published the
      first Russian periodical, dedicated chiefly to historical
      objects.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_84_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> He also caused several old
      manuscripts to be printed; and added greatly to their value by
      his investigations and commentaries. Prince Shtsherbatof wrote
      fifteen volumes of Russian history, besides several smaller
      works,&mdash;a mere collection of facts, but rendered more
      important by a review and criticism upon them by Boltin, ob.
      1792, a distinguished historian. Tchulkof wrote a history of
      commerce; Jemin, Rytchkof, Golikof, and others, wrote on
      particular portions of Russian history.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the philological studies of the language, the foundation of
      the Russian Academy. A.D. 1783, was of great importance. A
      standard grammar and etymological dictionary were published by it
      in 1787-90, founded on a plan perfectly new, and in the merit of
      which the empress Catharine had no small personal<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">[pg.71]</a></span>
      share. Her example awakened not a few Mecænases among the
      <i>magnates</i> of the country; and it became a point of high
      ambition to favour literature and literary men.<a name=
      "FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_85_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As for theological and biblical science, scarcely any thing
      interesting, certainly nothing gratifying, meets our eye in this
      vast deserted field. Except a few didactic works on dogmatics and
      rhetoric, several catechisms and similar productions, this
      department is limited exclusively to sermons, or rather synodal
      discourses. There is not always a want of talent, and sometimes
      even a rich share of natural power; but the language, though
      first developed in similar productions, is here so full of
      bombastic, tasteless, and mere rhetorical ornaments, that the
      <i>thought</i> seems to be entirely drowned in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demetrius Sjetchinof, metropolitan of Novogorod, ob. 1767, and
      the archbishop of White Russia, Konissky, oh. 1795, are
      considered as not being without eloquence. Platon Levshin,
      metropolitan of Moscow, was the most productive of the
      ecclesiastical writers. He died in 1812, and continued to write
      until the end of his life; his productions consequently, in
      respect to time, belong partly to the next period of Russian
      literature.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id=

      ascribed to an arch-priest of Kief, Ivan Levanda, ob. 1814. Here
      our catalogue terminates. All the remaining ecclesiastical

    <h4>
      FOURTH PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>From Karamzin, A.D.</i> 1796, <i>to the commencement of the
      reign of the emperor Nicholas in</i> 1825.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The number of Russian writers increases during this period so
      considerably, that we feel more than ever obliged to limit
      ourselves to the most distinguished; thus, no doubt, passing over
      in silence many a name more deserving to be mentioned than others
      of the preceding periods, which borrowed a comparative lustre
      only from the poverty of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emperor Alexander, during the first years of his reign,
      showed a zeal for the mental cultivation and enlightenment of his
      subjects, which presented him to the eyes of admiring Europe in
      the light of one of the great benefactors of mankind. Whoever
      will take the trouble to follow the career of this prince
      closely, and contrast the shouts of acclamation with which the
      world hailed him at first, with the disesteem into which the same
      individual a few years afterwards shrunk, as a weak and
      insignificant being,&mdash;and then again compare the enthusiasm
      with which during the time of his better fortunes he was received
      anew as the deliverer of Europe, with the part which was
      afterwards assigned him in the system of <i>obscurantismus</i>
      supposed to be adopted by the united sovereigns of
      Europe,&mdash;whoever considers all this, cannot but be struck
      with the small portion of discernment and discrimination which is
      manifested in the world. A sober and keen-sighted observer might
      have seen even in the beginning, glorious as it was, that not all
      is gold that glitters. All that was done, was accompanied with a
      noise and boasting<span class="newpage"><a name="page_73" id=
      "page_73">[pg.73]</a></span> which strangely imposed upon
      foreigners. Universities, on the plan of the venerable
      institutions of learning in Germany, were founded, where all the
      preparation necessary in order to profit by them was wanting; and
      the profoundest sciences were professedly taught to pupils, who
      were still deficient even in elementary knowledge. We do not
      however mean to say, that much real good was not done; and even
      if some of the new institutions were not propitious in their
      immediate results, still the time has come, or will come, when
      all of them are or will be at least in a measure useful. The
      establishment of numerous common schools of a less elevated
      character throughout the whole empire, deserves unqualified
      praise. More than fifty higher schools, called gymnasia or
      governmental schools, and twice as many lower or provincial
      schools, were established under Alexander's reign alone.<a name=
      "FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_87_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the universities, eight in all, of which Alexander
      founded five, there are a considerable number of professional
      schools; among which are four theological academies. In the year
      1823, an Institution for the study of oriental languages was
      founded at St. Petersburg; and in 1829 a similar one at Odessa, a
      city which has by its location more natural advantages for the
      learning of Asiatic languages than any other, and where for most
      of them native teachers may be readily obtained. On the other
      hand, the Asiatic Museum, attached to the school at St.
      Petersburg, contains all the means and aids for those studies to
      be met with at a more remote place. Richly endowed by the
      munificence of the emperor Alexander, who caused scientific
      treasures of every kind to be liberally purchased, it was also
      greatly augmented during the late war with Persia; where by order
      of the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_74" id=
      "page_74">[pg.74]</a></span> emperor all conquered cities were
      deprived of their libraries, whether public or private; while, by
      a stipulation in the treaty of peace, the Persian government was
      compelled to deliver to Russia towards four hundred manuscripts,
      a list of which was drawn up by the orientalists Frähn and
      Senkofsky. Among these were the geography of Ptolemy, and several
      Arabic translations of Greek and Latin works, lost in the
      original languages. Although the object of the oriental schools
      in Russia was originally to educate translators for diplomatic
      missions, they have proved themselves very useful to oriental
      philology in general; especially through the many gifted Germans
      in the Russian service, who avail themselves gladly of
      opportunities for those studies which their own country cannot
      give. It will however be seen in the sequel, that several learned
      Russians also have paid an honourable attention to this branch,
      especially within the last twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian Bible Society, founded A.D. 1813. was at first
      patronized by the emperor. Under its auspices, and at the
      instigation of the emperor himself, there was prepared a version
      of the Scriptures in the Russian dialect. In the year 1820, not
      less than 50,000 copies of the Gospels and the Acts were issued
      from the press; in 1823 the whole New Testament was finished, and
      in the course of eight months 20,000 copies were distributed. For
      this translation the peasantry, to whom the Old Slavic church
      Bible was only half intelligible, showed such an eagerness, as
      soon to excite trouble among the clergy. In some of the
      governments, remote from the capital, the readers of this version
      of the Bible had to encounter serious persecution. In respect to
      translations into foreign languages, a kind of rivalship arose
      between the parent society in England and the daughter in St.
      Petersburg. Besides the preparation by the latter of translations
      into <i>thirty-one</i> different languages and dialects within
      the limits of the Russian empire, she likewise took care of
      several<span class="newpage"><a name="page_75" id=
      "page_75">[pg.75]</a></span> Asiatic nations, and founded
      auxiliaries in the deserts of Siberia, and also in the midst of
      the Kozaks of the Don and the Circassian provinces. In A.D. 1820,
      this society had fifty-three sections and 145 auxiliaries; and
      the number of copies of whole Bibles and of New Testaments
      distributed, exceeded 430,000. But in 1822, the society held its
      last aniversary; and three years later, some of the more
      important Russian clergy succeeded in closing the series of
      annual reports. In April 1826, the activity of the society was
      ultimately terminated, or, as it was expressed, <i>was
      suspended</i>, by the Ukase of the emperor Nicholas, at the
      instigation of the metropolitans Eugene and Seraphim. Since that
      time, only the sale of the copies already printed has been
      permitted.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id=

      The Russian Bible Society stood of course in connection with
      societies for Foreign Missions; but was active in this respect
      chiefly through the agency of the United or Moravian Brethren. In
      1823 the Moravians of Sarepta sent, with the express consent of
      the minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs, two missionaries to the
      Kalmuks; into whose language the Gospels had been translated at
      St. Petersburg by Schmidt. In the same degree that they found the
      people susceptible for divine truth, did they meet with
      opposition from the priesthood. The Khans, yielding to the
      influence of the priests, threatened to emigrate; and the Russian
      government found it advisable to withdraw the mission. An
      interesting report of this mission was published in 1824, in the
      Journal of St. Petersburg. In the year 1824, a mission of the
      Greek church, at the instigation of the bishop of Archangel, was
      sent to the Samoyedes. This was the first attempt ever made
      to<span class="newpage"><a name="page_76" id=

      Christianity; of the results we are not informed.

      The compass of Russian literature extended itself during the
      course of Alexander's reign, or rather from A.D. 1800 to 1822,
      with a most remarkable rapidity. In the year 1787 the number of
      books written in the Old Slavonic and Russian dialects, did not
      exceed 4000;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id=
      "FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_89_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> before 1820 twice that
      number was counted; the year 1820 alone produced 3400 works, 800
      of them translations from the French, 483 from the German, and
      more than 100 from the English. Sopikof, in his bibliographical
      essay, enumerates the titles of 13,240 Russian and Slavonic
      books, printed in Russia from A.D. 1552 to 1823. But at this time
      literature seems to have reached its height in respect to
      productiveness; and sunk again with a still greater rapidity,
      probably in consequence of the political measures of the
      government. The year 1824 produced only 264 Russian works. The
      yearly average of literary productions, original and translated,
      from 1800 to that time, is about 300 to 400. This number perhaps
      will not strike the reader as so very small, if he is informed
      that in the whole eighteenth century only 1000 works were
      printed. Three hundred and fifty living authors were enumerated
      in the year 1822; mostly belonging to the nobility, and only one
      eighth part to the clergy. Their literary activity towards the
      end of this period, and at the commencement of the next, was in a
      great measure confined to works of fiction; especially novels end
      lyrical poetry. But at this time a deeper interest in their
      national history began to be awakened. This department indeed had
      never been entirely neglected; and more than 10,000 manuscripts,
      unopened and unexamined, lay scattered throughout the imperial
      and monastic libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Karamzin, from the commencement of whose
      influence<span class="newpage"><a name="page_77" id=
      "page_77">[pg.77]</a></span> this period of Russian literature is
      in general dated, was born A.D. 1765. He was educated in the
      house of a German professor at Moscow. In spite of the early
      development of his literary propensities, he entered the military
      service, which was then considered as the most honourable in
      Russia. After two years spent in travelling through Europe, he
      opened his literary career with the publication of a periodical
      work called the Moscow Journal, which exercised a decidedly
      favourable influence on Russian literature; although those
      productions of Karamzin himself, which first appeared in this
      journal, evidently bear the stamp of the author's youth. Both in
      his prose writings and in his scattered lyrical poems, at this
      period, there is a certain dulcet sentimentality, behind which we
      look in vain for energetic or true poetic thoughts. He showed
      more maturity in his second periodical, called the European
      Messenger; where political and moral subjects occupied his pen.
      But his principal reputation rests upon his History of the
      Russian Empire. In composing this work, he was greatly favoured
      by the government; all the archives were opened to him; all
      documents delivered into his hands; and when it was completed,
      rewards and gratuities of every description were heaped upon the
      author with imperial munificence, and continued to his widow and
      children after his decease in 1826. <a name="FNanchor_90_90" id=
      "FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_90_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauties of Karamzin's style are so entirely
      <i>idiomatic,</i> that no one, who is not perfectly and
      thoroughly acquainted with the language, is able to appreciate in
      what the charm of his<span class="newpage"><a name="page_78" id=
      "page_78">[pg.78]</a></span> writings consists. To foreigners of
      sound critical taste, on the contrary, the productions of his
      early life exhibit an affectation, a pretension to feeling, and
      an emptiness of original thought, sometimes quite intolerable.
      And as to the more condensed and exact style of his great
      historical work, even the highest beauties of diction, and the
      acknowledged diligence and accuracy of the writer's examination
      of facts, could never reconcile us to that <i>want of truth</i>,
      which, without wresting the fact itself, impresses upon it a
      false character by the whole colouring and mode of
      representation. Over the characteristic barbarism of ancient
      times his dexterous hand throws a veil of embellishment, and
      lends a spirit of chivalry and romantic charm to historical
      persons and deeds, where all the circumstances of place and time
      stand in absolute contradiction to it. Not seldom do we seem to
      be perusing a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this mode of proceeding he of course flattered the national
      feelings of his countrymen; and thus gained their approbation and
      applause, in the same measure that he disgusted all other
      nations. His History of Russia will nevertheless remain a
      standard work in Slavic literature, partly on account of the
      copiousness of its sources, partly because of the great learning
      and research displayed by its author.
    </p>
    <p>
      In respect to Karamzin's innovations on the language, his
      influence was early counterbalanced. He considered the French or
      English mode of construction as better adapted to the present
      state of the Russian language, than that imitation of the
      classical structure, which had hitherto given to the Russian
      prose writings so stiff and awkward an air. He himself adopted
      with ease and gracefulness the peculiarities of these modern
      languages; but a portion of his followers thought to reach the
      same object by introducing Gallicisms. Just at the proper time an
      opposition was formed; the head of which, Admiral Shishkof,
      insisted upon preserving the influence of the Church Slavonic
      upon the Russian language; and reproached Karamzin with having
      injured <span class="newpage"><a name="page_79" id=
      "page_79">[pg.79]</a></span> the purity of the latter by the
      introduction of foreign forms. These two parties, which still
      divide the Russian literature in some measure, are called the
      <i>Russian</i> and <i>Slavonic</i>, or also the Moscow and St.
      Petersburg parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not much less influence than Karamzin on the Russian prose, has
      Ivan Dmitrief, born 1760, exercised on poetry. He had more taste
      and purity than any of his predecessors; and was the first to
      prove by a great many poetical tales, fables, odes, etc. that
      imagination and correctness of language are not incompatible. The
      most successful of his followers are the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilii Shukofsky, born 1784, a poet of true and deep feeling,
      without affectation, possessing more of what the Germans call
      <i>subjectivity</i>, than any other Russian writer. He took the
      Germans for his models, and partly imitated and partly translated
      them with success. Ivan Koslof, interesting by his personal
      character and trying misfortunes, must be mentioned as one of the
      most happy translators from the English and German. His literary
      talents were awakened only when he had lost the power of enjoying
      the world. Early in life he was deprived by sickness of the use
      of his limbs; and of his eyes, some years after. He bore this
      great affliction with the most amiable philosophy; devoted
      himself entirely to literature; and studied and imitated the
      English poets, chiefly Byron. Another successful translator of
      this great poet, who excited as much interest in Russia as in any
      other country, was Baron Rosen. Further, as lyrical poets, are
      also esteemed: Prince Vjazemsky, Vostokof distinguished as an Old
      Slavic philologist, Chwostof, Batjushkof,<a name="FNanchor_91_91"
      id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_91_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> Rileyef,<a name=
      "FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_92_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> Baron Delwig, Glinka,
      etc.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_80" id=
      "page_80">[pg.80]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the Russian poets stands, almost without a rival,
      Alexander Pushkin, born 1798, ob. 1835; but as his principal
      productions belong to the next period, and his influence is
      chiefly perceptible among the more recent poets, we defer for the
      present a fuller notice of his writings and his fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russians are particularly fond of fables. Besides Chemnitzer,
      mentioned above, who is flat and prosy, Ivan Krylof, born 1768,
      is celebrated in this department. He may be truly called the
      favourite of the nation. His fables, equally popular among all
      classes and conditions of life, are the first book that a Russian
      child reads. A considerable portion of them has been translated
      into French and Italian; partly by Count Orlof at Paris, and
      partly by friends of the latter, ladies and gentlemen of the most
      fashionable society in that capital, among whom that nobleman
      distributed the labour of translation. He then published them,
      with the original, in the year 1825. The perfect harmlessness and
      <i>naiveté</i> of this author has made him also a favourite of
      the government; and when, twelve years ago, he celebrated his
      seventieth birthday, honours and distinctions of all kinds were
      accumulated on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As dramatic poets, Shakhofskoi, Chmelnitzky, Gribojedof,<a name=
      "FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_93_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> and Ozerof, must be
      mentioned; the first three chiefly as writers of comedies; the
      last as the author of a very popular drama entitled <i>Gore ot
      Uma</i>, Miseries of Intellect. While it cannot be doubted that
      the Russians have a decided talent for the comic, both as writers
      and as actors, it is still a fact that they have never produced a
      single tragedy of great power. Ozerof, who wrote quite a number
      of them, belongs more in spirit to the preceding period; during
      which the French was the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_81"
      id="page_81">[pg.81]</a></span> only acknowledged model. The
      success he met with can be explained only by the want of
      competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      No form of poetry has found more favour in Russia than the
      historical novel. It was cultivated to some extent at this time;
      but the flower of this branch falls more properly within the
      following period. A voluminous novel, entitled <i>Bursak</i> by
      B. Nareshnoi, belonged to another species. It was written with a
      good deal of harmless humour, somewhat in the style of Le Sage's
      Gil Blas. It narrated the history of a <i>Bursarian</i>, or
      scholar of one of the monastic seminaries in Malo-Russia; and is
      full of adventures, lively descriptions of manners, and amusing
      incidents.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id=
      "FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_94_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The literature of translations continued to occupy very many
      pens. Here must be mentioned: Gnjeditch's version of the Iliad;
      Merzljakof's translation of Tasso's Jerusalem; Wojeikof's Æneid;
      Martynof's translation of several ancient classics, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      To foreigners, the travels of the Russians by sea and land offer
      the most interesting and instructive part of their literature.
      The most distinguished of their well known expeditions have
      indeed been conducted by Germans, as Krusenstern, Kotzebue,
      Bellinghausen, Wrangel; some however by Russians, as Golovnin,
      Lazaref, and others; and the results of all of them contribute to
      the honour of Russia, and are laid up in the temple of her
      literature. The regions of Malo-Russia, the Caucasus, and
      Taurida, of which comparatively little was known, were explored
      by Muraviev-Apostol, Glinka, Bronefsky, and others; and described
      by them in valuable volumes. An account of China by Timkofsky,
      was translated in 1827 into the English language. The works of
      the monk Hyacinth Bitchourin, head of the Russian
      ecclesiastical<span class="newpage"><a name="page_82" id=
      "page_82">[pg.82]</a></span> mission at Pekin, published in
      1828-32, are of great importance for the knowledge of China,
      Thibet, and the country of the Mongols.<a name="FNanchor_95_95"
      id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_95_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> The great patriot and
      protector of science, Romyanzof, whose name is known throughout
      the civilized world, caused Abalghasi's <i>Historia Mongolorum et
      Tartarorum</i> to be printed in 1825, under the special care of
      the distinguished German oriental scholar Frahn. The publication
      of the Mongol work. <i>History of the Eastern Mongols and their
      Princes</i>, written by Ssanang Ssetzen, with a German
      translation and illustrations and remarks by J.J. Schmidt,
      although no Russian work, may be mentioned here; as it was only
      made possible by Russian means, and the support of the emperor.
      The same author, known to the literary world by his learned
      Researches in Eastern Asia, translated also the Gospels into the
      Mongol and Kalmuk<span class="newpage"><a name="page_83" id=
      "page_83">[pg.83]</a></span> languages for the Russian Bible
      Society. A Mongol Grammar was prepared by him in 1828, and the
      Mongol-German-Russian Dictionary was announced in 1834. A
      Mongol-Russian Dictionary had been previously published by
      Igumnof of Irkutzk. Volkof composed a Tartar Dictionary, an
      earlier one having been written by Giganof in 1804. For the study
      of the Armenian, numerous opportunities are presented; the
      Armenian archimandrite Seraphim published in 1819 an Armenian
      elementary Encyclopedia, and in 1822 a Russian Armenian
      Dictionary. But the oriental studies of the Russians are not
      limited to the languages of the Russian empire. A Hebrew Grammar
      has been published by Pavsky, the learned author of the Russian
      version of the Old Testament; and in the year 1821 there were,
      according to Henderson, not less than forty of his pupils
      employed as teachers in the different academies and seminaries
      throughout the country. An Arabic Grammar has been published by
      Boldryef, and also a Persian Chrestomathy in 1826. Senkofsky
      translated the <i>Derbent-Nahmeh</i>; and also edited with
      considerable additions the French-Arabic dictionary, originally
      written by the Swede Berggren, a work of great utility to the
      Arabic scholar; not a mere vocabulary, but full of geographical
      notices and general information; in short a work which, according
      to the prospectus written by the learned Frähn, "contains every
      thing that can be useful to the traveller, diplomatic agent,
      missionary, physician or merchant." The editor among other things
      has added in Roman characters the vulgar pronunciation of the
      Arabic, which differs materially from that given by the
      grammarians.

      Among the ecclesiastical writers of this period, Ambrosius
      Protasof archbishop of Kazan and Simbirsk, and Philaret Drozdof
      archbishop of Moscow, are considered as the most eloquent. The
      last is the author of several works on church history. Other
      theological writers are the following: Eugene<span class=

      metropolitan of Novogorod, and Michael Dosnitzky metropolitan of
      St. Petersburg. Stanislas Bogush, a Roman Catholic priest,
      published a history of Taurida and several other historical works
      in the Russian language. The branch of <i>Memoires</i> in the
      French sense of the word, has recently been much cultivated. The
      publications of Count Munich, in 1818; of Prince Shakhofsky,
      1821; of General Danilevsky. 1830; and of Admiral Shishkof, 1832;
      are valuable contributions to the history of our time. The two
      latter, although belonging to the next period in respect to the
      years of publication, are nevertheless productions of the period
      now under review, and refer chiefly to it.

      The national feeling of the Russians has led them, during the
      period of their literary history, to examine the nature of their
      language; and all philosophical investigations, or antiquarian
      researches, which could throw additional light upon the past,
      have been favoured by persons of distinction and influence; as
      for example, by Admiral Shishkef, himself a writer on various
      subjects. With this view he caused a new edition of the
      Dictionary of the Russian Academy to be published; and set on
      foot the preparation of another more perfect work of that kind,
      founded on an improved plan.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id=
      "FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_97_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> To this class of
      philological antiquarians belong the names of Vostokof already
      cited in these pages, Sokolof, Kalaïdovitch, and Stroyef; the two
      latter learned and judicious commentators on old manuscripts
      which they first published, and which but for them would still
      lie mouldering in dust<span class="newpage"><a name="page_85" id=

      literary history and bibliography, we find as writers of merit,
      P. Köppen, author of the well-written article "Kunst mid
      Alterthum in Russland" in the Vienna <i>Jahrbücher</i>, and of
      various valuable paleographic and other essays in the Russian
      language; also Gretsch, Sopikof, Anastasevitch, the metropolitan
      Eugene above mentioned, Pletuef, Mussin-Pushkin, Korshavin,
      Katchenofsky, etc. etc. The principal activity and success of
      this school falls within the next period.

    <h4>
      FIFTH PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>From A.D. 1825 to the present time.</i>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The reign of the emperor Nicholas opened with a bloody tragedy,
      which concerns us here only so far, as the dissatisfied,
      effervescing, unhealthy spirit of the literary youth of Russia
      was in a very striking manner exhibited in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several poets and men of some literary fame were among the
      conspirators. Rileyef, Bestushef, and others, became the victims
      of their imprudence. An analogous spirit had some years before
      banished young Pushkin from the capital. It was evident, that the
      Russian muse was no longer the good old gossiping lady in French
      court-dress and hoops, who was ready to drop a humble courtesy to
      every person of rank and influence; she was no longer the
      shepherdess who had inspired Dmitrief with his sweet yet tame
      verses; she had been by the example and the pernicious influence
      of the modern philosophical schools gradually metamarphosed into
      a wild romantic girl, burning with desire to drink freely, and
      without being watched by police agents, from the true source of
      poetry open to all nations; to rove about in the world of
      imagination free from fetters and restraint. The means which the
      emperor chose to cure her from these eccentricities;<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">[pg.86]</a></span> to
      chain her at home by endearing it to her; in short, to
      <i>Russify</i> her again; were certainly <i>judicious</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen that the spirit of historical and archaeological
      researches, as well as the interest for the study of the Slavic
      languages, was already awakened in the preceding period. The
      government did every thing to favour it, and to nurse that truly
      patriotic zeal which tries to penetrate the past in order to
      search for those links which connect it with the present. All
      influence from without was as much as possible checked; the
      professorships of philosophy were abolished at all the
      universities (1827); the scissors of censorship were directed to
      cut sharper; the catalogue of forbidden books was made longer;
      the permission to travel was often denied, and the term of lawful
      absence for a Russian subject confined to five years. But in the
      interior, within the safe inclosure of the Chinese walls of
      protection against the epidemic fever of the age, the most
      energetic measures were taken to promote national education, and
      to cultivate those fields of science where no political tares
      could be sown among the grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all political ideas, one at least was favoured; and this was
      the great idea of <i>Panslavism</i>, that is, of the close
      connection or union of all the Slavic races among themselves. Of
      this great family, some of whose members after a short period of
      flourishing life are withering fast away, if not supported by the
      whole, Russia is the natural head, the great animating soul, into
      which the other parts all must naturally be absorbed at last.
      This idea, first scientifically wrought out by Bohemian scholars,
      and cherished by their pride, which was justly offended by the
      oppressions and undisguised contempt experienced from the
      Germans, was well received by the Russian literati; and even by
      many of those who naturally loved the Poles, and did not approve
      of the harsh measures of the Russian government. There was even
      in Poland itself a school which adopted this view; nay,
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_87" id=
      "page_87">[pg.87]</a></span>some distinguished Polish scholars
      claim it as their own original idea. According to them, the
      Austrians and Prussians alone were the real usurpers; in being
      absorbed by Russia as a member of the great Slavic empire, Poland
      yielded only to its fate, and could hope for a more glorious
      <i>Panslavic</i> resurrection, i.e. a resurrection as a member of
      the great whole.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id=

      In reference to the critical researches, which were made through
      all branches of history, the period now under review may be
      appropriately called the <i>historical</i> period. The
      investigations of the Archæological Commission, have been
      mentioned above. It was first appointed in 1834; and considerably
      enlarged in 1837. The examination of manuscripts was not confined
      to the libraries of the empire; Stroyef was sent to Paris,
      Newerof to Germany, Solovyef to Denmark and Sweden, Wenelin to
      Bulgaria; and Nadeshdin travelled among the despised Russian
      tribes of Northern Hungary. In 1844, five volumes of Russian
      annals were printed; besides a series of historical and juridical
      documents which had preceded them. The Moscow Historical and
      Geographical Society, an older institution, and also the St.
      Petersburg Historical Society founded in 1846, have contributed
      their share of information; and a general interest has been
      awakened among the higher classes of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new critical spirit of the times was first perceptible in the
      bold attitude assumed by the editor of a periodical work, called
      the <i>Telegraph</i>. Polevoi was a self-made man, a merchant
      without classical education, without deep learning, and indeed
      without depth in any thing. He had however by an uncommon share
      of sagacity, by a rare energy of thought, and a restless
      activity, gained more influence over his countrymen <span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">[pg.88]</a></span> than
      any previous writer; and succeeded In giving to his very popular
      periodical an important voice in all matters of literature. In
      the year 1829 he announced a new History of Russia, in twelve
      volumes; and at the same time expressed the opinion, that
      Karamzin's work was to be called neither practical nor
      philosophical, and was no longer worthy of the present standing
      of Russian literature. His own publication, which followed soon
      afterwards, and was executed with the rapidity which was
      characteristic of the man, proved that it is easier to point out
      the deficiencies of others, than to avoid them ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young historical school found another champion in Sergei
      Skromnenko, who attacked the authority of Nestor, or at least the
      age ascribed to this first Russian annalist; essaying to prove
      that he did not write before the beginning of the fourteenth, or
      perhaps towards the end of the thirteenth century.<a name=
      "FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_99_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> Another young historian, J.
      Bodianski, defended this opinion. W. Perewostschikof examined it
      in a separate work.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id=
      "FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_100_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> Pogodin, a name of more
      weight, refuted it in his <i>Studies on Nestor</i>; and it seems
      since to have been given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another production of some importance was an "Essay towards a
      Geography of the Old Russian World," by Nadeshdin; in which the
      author attempted with ability and success to trace the old seats
      of the Slavic nations. Several monographs and histories of
      particular regions or periods appeared in the interval between
      1830 and 1842. Such were the histories, e.g. of the unfortunate
      Prince Ivan and his relatives, by Polenof; of Catharine II. by
      Lefort; of Tzar Boris Godunof, by Krayefski;<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">[pg.89]</a></span> of
      Peter II, by Arsenief. Also a History of the time of troubles (as
      the period between Boris Godunof and the reign of the house of
      Romanof is called) by Buturlin; the biographies of the first
      three Tzars of the house of Romanof, by Berg; the histories of
      Kief by Samailof, of Pskow by Pogodin, of Siberia by Slowzof; of
      the fair of Nishni Novogorod, which goes back to the fourteenth
      century, by Zubof; of the Zaporoguean Kozaks by Sreznefski. This
      latter valuable work is especially rich in historical popular
      songs, never before printed. Further, the History of the
      insurrection of Pugatschef, by the poet Pushkin; the Historical
      and statistical survey of Russia, by T. Bulgarin; and the Memoirs
      for Russian History by Svinyin (ob. 1839); must be here
      mentioned. The two latter had hitherto been more known as writers
      of novels than as historians; and the rosy light which the first
      of the two tries to throw over his subject, seems still to
      testify more to his talent for romance than to his historical
      truthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was however the spirit in which the government wished its
      historians to write. A work of decided importance appeared in
      1839, a History of Russia, in which the principles of
      <i>Panslavism</i> were developed in a striking manner. The
      author, Professor Oustrialof, who had made himself favourably
      known by several monographs relating to Russian History, has
      displayed in the above-mentioned work not only considerable
      acuteness, but also a great deal of research, consistency, and
      thoroughness.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id=
      "FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_101_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> His principal tendency
      is to represent Russia as the natural central point of the Slavic
      race. The immediate result of the appearance of this work was,
      that Oustrialof was commissioned by the government to write a
      compendium or guide for historical instruction in all the schools
      of the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this view may be called the most popular in<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">[pg.90]</a></span>
      Russia, it appears from the decided predilection with which
      Russian writers of history devote their pens to subjects anterior
      to the reign of Peter I, that they consider the comparatively
      greater liberty which is allowed them in their researches into
      the history of this earlier period as a decided advantage.
      Karamzin had proved by the picture he drew of Ivan the Terrible,
      that, at this remote period at least, justice was free. It may
      thus be explained, why Boris Godunof, the friend of the people,
      the promoter of liberal ideas and modern improvements, is a
      favourite subject of the young historical school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treatment of modern history has in Russia its own
      difficulties, which may easily be comprehended; and nothing is
      permitted to appear without the approval of the government.
      General Michailovski-Danilevski, who wrote a history of the war
      of 1812-14, may be considered as its true representative. He
      ascribes all the merits of the final victory of the Allies to the
      Russians alone. Among several works of that time written in an
      analogous spirit, the "Description of the campaigns of 1812 and
      1814" must be noticed; because the author is a lady by the name
      of Dorof, who served in the army as a common soldier, and
      describes only what she saw. An anonymous work, written by an
      eye-witness, gives an account of the Turkish war in 1828-29. The
      work entitled "Biographies of the Russian Admirals" (1834), gives
      a history of the Russian navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no department has Russian Literature remained more behind its
      age, than in the treatment of foreign history, and especially
      European history. The series of publications which have appeared
      relating to it, consist almost exclusively of defective
      translations, or weak imitations. For the Russian scholar this
      defect was less essential than for the public in general, as all
      of them read foreign languages. Pogodin has recently begun to
      give more attention to this subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      In respect to several Asiatic nations we are almost
      entirely<span class="newpage"><a name="page_91" id=
      "page_91">[pg.91]</a></span> dependent on Russian writers. The
      priest Hyacinth, honourably mentioned in connection with this
      branch, continues his useful activity. Chopin on the provinces of
      the Caucasus (1840); Nefedyef on the Wolga-Kalmuks (1835);
      several articles in the Siberian Mercury, a periodical; a History
      of the Mongols, from the Persian, by Grigoryef; the Kirgises of
      the inner Horde, by Khanikof; and several publications of the
      Geographical Society of St. Petersburg; deserve to be noticed
      here. The works of two foreigners, one by Haguemaster on the
      Commerce with Persia and Turkey, the other by Chaudoir on the
      Numismatics of China, Japan, and Korea, may also be included; as
      they appeared simultaneously in the Russian and French languages,
      and were both of them occasioned by the Russian government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest of the Russians for Law as a science has only
      recently been excited. Prince Peter of Oldenburg, a cousin of the
      emperor, founded a Law School in 1832. Since that time the
      nobility have endowed several professorships of law in the
      universities; and the names of N. Krylof and Manoshkin have
      become favourably known in this department.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Statistics the name of Arsenyef is an authority. Many valuable
      contributions are to be found in Stepanof's Description of the
      Government of Yennissci, and in various Russian periodicals;
      especially in the annals of several Bureaus, which are from time
      to time published by the government, and the Statistical Annuals
      edited by the Academy.

      The literature of Travels cannot well be very rich at the present
      day, in a country where travelling to foreign lands meets with so
      many difficulties; and where even travels in the interior are at
      least not made very easy. To the most valuable productions in the
      first department belong: Norof's Journey to the Holy Land, St.
      Pet. 1838; Davidof's to Greece and Italy; Demidof's to Moldavia
      and Wallachia; Korf's to Persia; Wcewolodski<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">[pg.92]</a></span> to
      the East and through Europe; Gretsch to the Western countries of
      Europe, etc. Two collections of <i>old</i> travels, viz. one
      containing those made by Russians to foreign countries, among
      which is the description of a journey to the Holy Land in the
      twelfth century; another comprising the accounts of foreigners
      who travelled in Russia in olden times; have also recently been
      published.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern works of travels in Russia have been written by A.
      Demidof, Baer, Böthlingk, Glagolyef, Kavelin, and others. Most of
      these journeys were made for certain scientific purposes.
      Mouravyef's Pilgrimage to the holy places of Russia must be
      classified rather as a work of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here a short survey of this latter branch of Russian
      literature may naturally be subjoined. To it belong the other
      works of the writer just mentioned; who is attached to his own
      church with an almost fanatical enthusiasm. They are, first, a
      History of the Greek Church; secondly, Letters on the Greek
      Church Service. An elaborate History of the Russian Patriarchate,
      published a few years ago, is ascribed to the bishop Philarete, a
      clergyman who is said to have shown an immoderate zeal in making
      proselytes in the Baltic provinces. A biographical History of the
      Russian Saints, by Yeristof, belongs also here. Of theological
      <i>science</i> there can hardly be a trace, in a country where
      all free investigation in exegetical matters is cut off.
      Theological literature is entirely confined to synodal orations
      and some ascetic writings. The spirit of the present age in
      Russia is strictly orthodox; and the monocracy of the Greek
      Church is the great object for which clergy and laity exert
      themselves; especially in the Baltic provinces. Among sermons,
      those of Innocenz, vicar of the metropolitan of Kief, are much
      admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Literary history has recently been a favourite branch. Polevoi,
      Gretsch, Schevyrof, Maximovitch, Nadeshdin,
      Nikitenko;<span class="newpage"><a name="page_93" id=
      "page_93">[pg.93]</a></span> and, in respect to languages and
      antiquities, Kalaidovitch, Vostokof and Koppen, the latter of
      German extraction, and mentioned in the preceding period; are the
      names which have most weight in these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have at last come back to <i>belles lettres</i>, the
      department of literature by which the genius of a nation is most
      distinctly characterized. The tendencies which in Russia prevail
      in the other branches, viz. a revival of interest for all that is
      native, Slavic, or relating to the past; the reaction from a
      period of fondness for all that was foreign and outlandish; is
      very clearly perceptible also in this portion of literature. Yet
      the Russians, once forcibly thrust into the way of
      <i>imitation</i> by their great Tzar, appear here even now only
      as imitators; and are still far from having found the path back
      to their simple popular poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this remark it cannot surprise us, that towards the close
      of the last, and especially at the beginning of the present
      period, the historical novel was cultivated with particular
      fondness; and was almost exclusively devoted to <i>Russian</i>
      history. T. Bulgarin, P. Svinyin, Sagoskin, Massalski, wrote the
      most approved works of that kind. More recently the novelists
      have rather returned to the description of morals and manners, as
      their more appropriate province. Pawlof, Prince Odoyeski,
      Lermontof, Gogol, Laschetnikof, Weltmann, Dahl, who writes under
      the name of Kozak Luganski, are the most popular writers of
      tales. Karamzin and Shukofski are still considered as models in
      this department.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must not forget to mention here the unhappy youth Alexander
      Bestushef; who, as lieutenant in one of the Petersburg regiments,
      was, like his friend Rileyef, implicated in the conspiracy of
      1825. He was deprived of his nobility and illustrious name, and
      sent to the mines of Siberia; afterwards, as a species of pardon,
      he was placed as a common soldier in the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">[pg.94]</a></span> army
      of the Caucasus, where he rose to the rank of an officer and fell
      soon after by the balls of the Therkesses. He had been well known
      to his countrymen as the editor of a favourite Annual, entitled
      the <i>Polar Star</i>; and as the author of a very spirited and
      clear survey of Russian literature, distinguished by
      characteristic sketches of some of their principal poets. The
      name of Bestushef was buried; but its bearer succeeded a second
      time in acquiring a literary reputation under the name of
      Alexander Marlinski. His Sketches of the Caucasus and of Siberia,
      his tales entitled Amulat Beg and Mullah Nur, are animated and
      spirited pictures of scenes quite novel and fresh. He has been
      compared to the German novelist Spindler; but, although this
      latter has the advantage in respect to invention, we think
      Marlinsky <i>far</i> superior to him in a poetical respect. There
      is a vigour, a freshness, an originality, in some of his
      descriptions, which would class him among true poets, even when
      stripped of the novelty of the scenery among which they are laid,
      and which gives them indeed a peculiar attraction. Nothing was
      more natural nor even more honourable to the Russian public, than
      that, as an unavoidable effect of the pity and interest felt for
      this young writer, his real talent should have been for a short
      time overrated. But even after his death, it seems that the
      government regarded this enthusiasm with suspicion; for in a
      literary collection in which the unprinted works of one hundred
      writers are promised,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id=
      "FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_102_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> accompanied by their
      portraits, Marlinsky's portrait was not permitted to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attention of the Russian literati has been for some time
      directed mainly by the Germans to their own treasures of popular
      poetry. They are particularly rich in nursery tales, for which
      the nation indeed has always had a great fondness; but which,
      during an age of a false pedantic taste, were after all
      not<span class="newpage"><a name="page_95" id=
      "page_95">[pg.95]</a></span> thought worthy of literary
      preservation until of late. In close connection with this subject
      is the cultivation of popular dialects. Grebenko and Kwitka, the
      latter under the name of Osnovianenko, wrote their charming
      novels in the Malo-Russian or Ruthenian dialect. Several writers
      of talent, natives of Malo-Russia, endeavoured to establish their
      language as a literary language in opposition to the Great
      Russian. The judiciousness of these proceedings, especially as
      the Russian literature has hardly passed from childhood to youth,
      would seem very questionable, even if their practicability was
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to poetry, the reader will be surprised to hear, that Russian
      critics themselves think the short-lived flower of the Russian
      soil already in danger of fading; the productiveness of their
      poets being already apparently on the decline. No genius has
      risen as a rival to Pushkin. Alexander Pushkin, born 1799, showed
      his uncommon talents early; he was educated at one of the
      imperial Institutes, and was in the service of the government;
      when an Ode to Liberty, written in too bold a spirit, induced the
      emperor Alexander to banish him from St. Petersburg. He obtained
      however employment in the southern provinces of Russia; and life
      in these wild and poetical regions was more favourable to the
      development of his genius, than that of the capital ever could
      have been. All his poetry bears strong testimony to Byron's
      influence; but he would be wrongly judged if taken as a mere
      imitator of that great poet. His poetical tales, <i>Ruslan and
      Ludmilla</i>, from the heroic times of Russia; <i>The Prisoner of
      the Mountains</i>, a Caucasian scene (1823): and the <i>Fountain
      of Baktshiserai,</i> a Tartar Story (1824); have each great
      beauties. The emperor Nicholas, when at Moscow on the occasion of
      his coronation, recalled him, and showed himself his patron. He
      made him one of the historiographers of the empire: and the
      archives were opened to him. The effect on the whole was not
      favourable to the poet's genius. The first production after
      his<span class="newpage"><a name="page_96" id=
      "page_96">[pg.96]</a></span> return to fashionable life was
      'Eugene Onegin,' a novel in verse, the life of <i>un homme
      blasé</i>. Of this Byronic tendency, his Prisoner, and a great
      many of his small poems likewise, bear strong evidence. And it is
      this feature chiefly, which, in turn, Pushkin's followers and
      imitators have seized upon; for instance, Lermontof. It is
      painful to see, how, instead of the freshness, the vigour, the
      joyfulness, which we ought to meet in the representatives of a
      young and rising literature, resting on the foundation of a rich,
      uncorrrupted, original language, we find in them the ennui, the
      dissatisfaction, and the indifference of a set of <i>roués</i>
      disgusted with life. It seems as if after having emptied the cup
      of the vanities of the world to the very dregs, this world, which
      has nothing left for their enjoyment, is despised by them;
      unfortunately, however, without having educated their minds for a
      better one. In his later productions, especially in his <i>Boris
      Godunof</i>, a drama, which may be rather called a tragical
      historical picture than a regular tragedy, Pushkin showed a more
      elevated mind, and a more objective way of viewing things. His
      last work, we believe, was his <i>Istorija Bunta</i>, History of
      the Insurrection of Pugatshef; no noble struggle for liberty, but
      a mere mutiny. He died in St. Petersburg in 1835, a short time
      after a marriage of choice and inclination; in a duel occasioned
      by a fit of jealousy, maliciously provoked by some of the
      courtiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other successful lyrical poets of this period are, Chomiakof,
      Baratinski, N. Jazikof, A. Timofeyef, Benedictof, Sokolovski, A.
      Podolinski, Lucian Jakubovitch, A. Ilitshevski, etc. Several
      ladies also have recently mounted the Pegasus. A Princess
      Volkonski, a Countess Rostoptshin, a Miss Teplef, are favourably
      mentioned; as are also Anna Bunin and a Mrs. Pawlof, the latter
      as a happy translator. A Mrs. Helene Han, who writes under the
      name of Zeneide B., is compared to George Sand. Nor must we
      forget two natural poets so called, that is, men from<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">[pg.97]</a></span> the
      people, who write verses; one named Alipanof, born a serf, and
      the other Kolzof. The lyric poets enumerated in the last period
      are all mostly still alive and continue to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very limited productiveness of the Russian poets is however a
      very striking and discouraging feature. While in the animated
      forest of German poetry, even during the most trying struggles of
      the times, a full chorus of songs and ballads resounds from every
      branch, we hear from Russian groves only solitary voices, and
      these voices seem to be exhausted almost as soon as they are
      heard. A volume of twenty sheets is in general considered in
      Russia as quite a respectable collection. Pushkin is almost the
      only one of their poets, whose very thoughts were verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more exuberant, however, do we find the productiveness of
      some of their dramatic writers. Polevoi, whom we have mentioned
      as the editor of the "Telegraph," and as a keen critic who
      exerted great influence, poured out a whole flood of tragedies
      and comedies. To judge from the applause with which they were
      received on the stage, the writer was more successful in this
      branch, than in his historical enterprises. Besides him, Lenski,
      Koni, Feodorof, and others, as well as numerous translators,
      furnished provision for the stage. The most respectable talent
      was shown by Kukolnik; of whom his countrymen have a very high
      idea, but to whom foreign critics assign rather a lyric than a
      dramatic genius. The reverential attachment of Russians to their
      monarch is exhibited in the very titles chosen by several
      dramatic poets. One of Kukolnik's dramas bears the rather prolix
      name, "The hand of the Almighty shelters the Tzar." A piece of
      Glinka is called, "Our Life for the Tzar," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular poetry which is scattered over all Slavic countries,
      has at last received the attention due to it. That of Russia is
      not so early as that of some other branches of the same family;
      with the exception however of certain songs for harvest,
      weddings,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_98" id=
      "page_98">[pg.98]</a></span> festivals, funerals, and some other
      like verses, sung or recited on certain stated occasions. There
      are among them some, which in their most essential portions are
      derived from pagan times. The Ukraine, and indeed Malo-Russia in
      general, and all the regions where Ruthenian tribes have settled,
      are particularly rich in popular poetry. Valuable miscellaneous
      collections have been made by Prince Tzertelef, Maximovitch,
      Sacharof, by the Polish literati Bielowski and Siemienski,
      Bodianski, etc.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id=

      To the philological works enumerated on page 84, we may add the
      following productions of the present period: Brosset, on the
      Literature and Language of Armenia and Georgia;<a name=
      "FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_104_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> also the Dictionaries of
      these languages by Chodubashef and Tschubinof, the latter
      (Georgian or Grusinian) the first which was ever published; a
      Chinese grammar by the priest Hyacinth, who prepared likewise a
      history of China some years ago, which we must suppose has been
      published. A new Turkish dictionary was published in 1830 by
      Rhasis. Prince Alexander Handsheri prepared another of French,
      Arabic, Turkish, and Persian; in aid of which the Sultan
      subscribed for 200 copies. Sjogren, an academician, known by his
      Studies on the Finnish Language and Literature, devoted himself
      in connection with the latter to the Caucasian idioms, and
      published the results in the Transactions of the Academy. A
      Turco-Tartar grammar was written by Kasembeg, a Tartar by birth,
      but educated in European Russia, and professor of those languages
      at the university of Kazan.

      In the different departments of natural science, although the
      Russians may be still called beginners, their progress has
      recently been immense. This has resulted in a great measure from
      the judicious plan of the government, in sending out annually a
      certain<span class="newpage"><a name="page_99" id=
      "page_99">[pg.99]</a></span> number of young men to study at
      German universities. Philosophy as a science was formerly
      despised, and considered as the exclusive property of German
      pedants and bookworms;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id=
      "FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_105_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> but since German
      philosophy has seemed to take a more practical turn, it has begun
      to excite more interest. The government, which in the first
      affright after the conspiracy of 1825, had abolished all the
      professorships of philosophy, began to relax; and went even so
      far as to send young men to Germany for these studies, and to
      re-establish the chairs in several of the Russian universities.
      It was, however, still regarded as a <i>dangerous</i> science;
      and the learning which some young clergymen acquired in
      it&mdash;Golubinski, Gabriel, and above all Sidonski&mdash;was
      carefully watched, and proved of little value to the public.
    </p>

      In regard to periodical literature, the number of
      <i>political</i> journals is of course very small. That which
      most highly extols the merits and exploits of the Russians is
      always considered as the best, and is most patronized by the
      government and the nation. In Russia the <i>praise</i> of one's
      country and <i>love</i> for it are regarded as synonymous ideas.
      The literary journals, most of which are of a miscellaneous
      character, are more in number, and are generally conducted with
      some critical talent. Those of a purely scientific character are
      rarely sustained longer than a few years; for instance, the very
      valuable Bibliographical Journal, edited by P. Köppen in 1825-26.
      The ephemeral race of <i>Annuals</i>, those vehicles of
      superficial taste and knowledge, early took broad possession of
      the Russian Parnassus. In the year 1839, eight hundred and eighty
      different works were published in Russia; of which seventy-three
      only were translations. The<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_100" id="page_100">[pg.100]</a></span> number of journals
      and periodicals, which in general are quite thick pamphlets,
      amounted only to fifty-three. In 1842 those latter had increased
      to one hundred and thirty-nine; nearly three times as many as in
      the former year. Of these 98 were in the Russian language, 22 in
      German, 8 in French, 1 in Italian, 3 in Polish, and 3 in
      Lettonian.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      In a recent work on Russian literature, by F. Otto,<a name=
      "FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_107_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> the Lexicon of authors
      subjoined comprises about 250 names; and the English translator
      speaks of having seen a list of nearly <i>twelve hundred</i> more
      in the author's hands. We are compelled to regard this last
      statement with some distrust; especially when we perceive, that
      among the names printed in the Lexicon, at least <i>thirty</i>
      are Germans and Poles who wrote <i>on</i> Russian matters, but
      not <i>in</i> Russian. It is also singular to find among Russian
      <i>authors</i>, not only the Grand-duke Constantine of Kief,
      because he was a <i>patron</i> of science, and first caused the
      Old Slavonic Bible to be printed; but also even the old
      traditional bard Bojan, mentioned in the ancient epic of
      Igor!<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id=

      The recent movements in Europe have of course built up still
      higher the Chinese wall which surrounds the Russian empire. Even
      in anticipation of them, the government had been seized with a
      new shock of fear; and attempted to shut out the intrusive new
      lights. This was indicated by several strong and very unpopular
      measures; among which we may here mention, that travellers in
      foreign countries were called home, and the number of students at
      each university was suddenly limited to <i>three hundred</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the place to enlarge on the distinguished merits
      which foreigners, and especially Germans, have acquired in
      relation to Russian history, statistics, etc. But their labours
      in relation to the language, form a part of the literature to
      which they were devoted; and cannot of course be separated from
      the works of native writers. The most distinguished names in this
      department are again Germans, viz. Heym, Vater, Tappe, Puchmayer,
      etc. The catalogue of elementary works upon the Russian language,
      is too long to be inserted here; we limit ourselves therefore to
      those only which are written in English, and the best in German
      and French. The English grammars and dictionaries of the Russian,
      are indeed so few, that an American or Englishman would hardly
      succeed in acquiring a full knowledge of the language, except
      through the medium of the German and French. The first Russian
      Grammar, however, that was ever printed, was published at Oxford.
      We give the titles of this and of the other principal grammars
      and lexicons of the Russian language, in the note below.<a name=

    <h4>
      LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF THE ILLYRICO-SERVIANS PROPER.
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      The literature of the western Slavo-Servians has hitherto been
      altogether separated from that of their brethren of the oriental
      church, and treated as a distinct branch.<a name=
      "FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_110_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> Their
      language,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_104" id=
      "page_104">[pg.104]</a></span> however, being essentially the
      same, we do not see why the rather accidental circumstance, that
      the former use the Roman letters, while the latter adhere to the
      Cyrillic alphabet, should be a sufficient reason for such a
      separation. The literature of neither of them has as yet
      treasures enough, to renounce willingly the claims which their
      mutual and naturally rich though uncultivated language gives to
      the one upon the productions of the other. We now proceed, in a
      short historical introduction, to show the origin of this
      separation; after making a few preliminary remarks on the
      character of the language as a whole, unaffected by its division
      into different dialects, not more distinct indeed from each other
      than is the case in almost every other living idiom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Servian language is spoken by about five millions of people.
      It extends, with some slight variations of dialect, over the
      Turkish and Austrian provinces of Servia, Bosnia, Herzegovina,
      Montenegro, and Dalmatia; over Slavonia and the eastern part of
      Croatia. It is further the property of several thousands, who
      emigrated from their own country on account of the Turkish
      oppression, and are now settled as colonists along the
      south-western bank of the Danube, from Semlin to St. André near
      Buda. The southern sky, and the beauties of natural scenery
      existing throughout nearly all these regions, so favourable in
      general to the development of poetical genius, appear also to
      have exerted a happy influence on the language. While it yields
      to none of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_105" id=
      "page_105">[pg.105]</a></span> the other Slavic dialects in
      richness, clearness, and precision, it far surpasses all of them
      in euphony. The Servian has often been called the <i>Italian</i>
      among the other Slavic idioms. Comparisons of this sort are
      always superficial, and tend to give a false view of the
      character of an object. Be this as it may, the Servian is
      decidedly the most melodious of the Slavic languages, rich in
      vowels, and abounding alike in soft and powerful accents. The
      accumulation of consonants, with which the other dialects are so
      often reproached, is rarely, if ever, to be met with in Servian.
      The reader may compare the Servian <i>wetar</i> with <i>wjtr</i>,
      <i>krilo</i> with <i>krzydlo</i> or <i>skrzydlo, pao</i> with
      <i>padl</i>, etc. Those who ascribe this mildness of the Servian
      language to the Italian neighbourhood of Dalmatia, forget that
      the eastern Servians are remote from Italy. It is true that the
      dialects of these latter are at the same time full of Turcisms;
      but these are mere excrescences, which may easily be removed
      without touching the essential structure of the language. The
      Turkish words adopted into the Servian, are mostly nouns, and
      verbs derived from them; and may naturally be explained by their
      political relation to the Turks during so many centuries. If we
      may confide in a remark of the profound philologist J. Grimm,
      <i>some</i> foreign ingredients are useful and even necessary to
      languages. They act as a cement, and fill up gaps; nay, they not
      seldom serve to give to the expression colouring and pliancy. The
      attention of the civilized world, although directed at the
      beginning of the present century to the Servians and their heroic
      struggles, has only recently been excited in respect to their
      language; and this through the efforts of a single individual. We
      shall have more to say on this point in the section devoted to
      the literature of the Servians of the eastern church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient Illyricum comprised all the countries situated
      between the Adriatic and the Black Sea, and along the
      Danube<span class="newpage"><a name="page_106" id=
      "page_106">[pg.106]</a></span> and Save.<a name=
      "FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_111_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> Towards the middle of
      the seventh century, we find this vast country mostly occupied by
      a Slavic people of one and the same race, alternately called
      Bulgarians, Croatians, and Servians. We find also six kingdoms
      gradually established by them: Bulgaria, Servia, Bosnia (Rama),
      Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia; some of them powerful and of
      great influence in their time, but now and long since sunk into
      ruin, and existing only as Turkish or Austrian provinces. An
      impenetrable night rests on the early history of these regions;
      and if the judicious criticism of modern philologists has thrown
      comparatively some light on this general topic, still, their
      investigations have been of little consequence for the history of
      the language. All that it concerns us to note here, is, that as
      early as the seventh century a part of these nations were already
      Christians, converted by Romish priests. Among the remainder,
      Christianity as taught by Greek missionaries found a welcome
      reception in the eighth and ninth centuries, and soon was fully
      established. The oriental Servians had the chief seat of their
      power in the present Turkish province of Serf-Vilayeti; and
      governed by princes called <i>Shupans</i>, we see them in a
      constant war of resistance against the Greek emperors, and during
      several centuries also against the powerful Khans of Bulgaria;
      now conquered, subjugated, destroyed almost to annihilation, but
      recovering with effort and rising again in power, with such
      energy as to enable them under the great Tzar, Stephan Dushan,
      not only to hold all their neighbours in awe, but to take a
      menacing position towards Byzantium itself, and dictate
      conditions of peace to the imploring envoys of that proud
      imperial court. But this brilliant point of Servian glory, which
      even now after five hundred years still lives in the hearts of
      the people, and is the subject of a thousand legends and songs,
      was only a meteor. It vanished in almost<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">[pg.107]</a></span>
      the same moment that it appeared. Stephan's immediate successors,
      enfeebled by their domestic dissensions, sunk under the superior
      forces of the Turks, who had broken into Europe thirty-four years
      earlier. They soon became the conquerors of the Servians, though
      not without fierce and bloody struggles; and they still remain
      their masters and oppressors.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id=
      "FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_112_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The western Servians were early divided into small states, some
      of which adopted an aristocratic republican form of constitution.
      Among these, only the republic of Ragusa requires to be mentioned
      here, as the cradle of the Dalmatian branch of Servian
      literature. The local situation of these western states made them
      dependent on Hungary; and thus Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia,
      sometimes under the title of kingdoms, and now as dukedoms,
      became at length mere provinces of that larger kingdom, and
      ultimately of the Austrian empire. Bosnia and Herzegovina, which
      form the boundary between the Servians of the East and West, were
      subject to the influence of both; and are to the present day
      divided in religion and in language.

      Church</i>.

    <br />
    <p>
      However small the circuit of country, properly called Servia, is
      in proportion to the whole extent over which the southern Slavi
      are spread, the name of Servians nevertheless appears
      to<span class="newpage"><a name="page_108" id=
      "page_108">[pg.108]</a></span> modern philologists as the best
      adapted for being employed as the common name of them all.
      Dobrovsky thinks it even appropriate to become the general
      appellation for all Slavic nations. Although of obscure
      derivation, it is at least sufficiently ascertained that it is of
      pure Slavic origin; glorious associations are attached to it; it
      is moreover still a living name, while the learned appellation of
      <i>Illyrians</i>, formerly more in use, is dead; and that of
      <i>Bosnians</i>, preferred by some Dalmatian writers, rests upon
      no satisfactory grounds. The name of Servians, however, was
      never, till recently, applied to the Dalmatians. It is indeed
      still rejected by themselves; and they continue to call
      themselves <i>Illyrians</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the present head, besides the Servians proper, of whom
      great numbers have emigrated in early times to Hungary, are also
      strictly comprised the Bosnians, the greater portion of the
      inhabitants of Herzegovina, the Montenegrins or Czernogortzi, and
      the Slavonians of the Greek Church. These all use the same
      language and alphabet; but the four latter have no distinct
      literature, except some collections of popular poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The literature of the eastern Servians, the result of their
      intellectual life as a nation, does not yet date back a hundred
      years; nay, if regarded from another point of view, it is not yet
      forty years old. Up to that time, all the Servians belonging to
      the Greek Church, notwithstanding the honourable example of
      Russia to the contrary, had written in the Old or Church
      Slavonic; or, in more modern times, in a language mixed up from
      this latter and several other dialects. Schaffarik remarks, that
      out of about 400 Servian books printed between the years 1742, or
      more properly 1761, and 1826, about one eighth part are written
      in Old Slavic; another eighth in the common dialect of the
      people; while all the rest vary between these two in innumerable
      shades and degrees.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id=
      "FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_113_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> This eighth part written
      in ordinary Servian,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_109" id=
      "page_109">[pg.109]</a></span> and essentially the same language
      which the Dalmatians and the greater part of the Croats speak,
      are all of very recent date. Indeed, with the exception of a
      single writer, Obradovitch, who found no immediate followers, the
      dialect of the people was in general despised by the clergy and
      those who laid claim to education, as being wholly unfit for
      books, and (as Vuk Stephanovitch strongly expresses himself) only
      proper for "cowherds and swineherds." How the once flourishing
      literature of Ragusa could ever have sunk into oblivion to such a
      degree, is hardly to be conceived; as indeed, in general, the
      division so sharply drawn in respect to literature between those
      two branches of the same people, while they were still bound
      together by the strong ties of one and the same language of
      common life and in part also of the same government, belongs
      among the most remarkable facts in literary history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most ancient document of the Servian Old Slavic language, is
      out of the middle of the thirteenth century, viz. the Hexaemeron
      of Basilius, with a preface by John, exarch of Bulgaria. Then
      follow the "Acts of the Apostles," written by the hieromonach
      Damian, A.D. 1324. Of higher historical importance are some
      secular writings from the end of the thirteenth to the middle of
      the fourteenth century, viz. a genealogical register of the
      Servian princes and the events of their reigns, called
      <i>Radoslov</i>, written by archbishop Daniel; a similar work
      called the <i>Tzarostavnick</i>; and above all the statutes of
      Tzar Dushan the Powerful, A.D. 1336-56. These statutes, dated
      from the year 6837, or A.D. 1349, not only afford us a good
      survey of the constitution of the Servian kingdom, but are a
      remarkable contribution to the history of its moral state at that
      early period, The philanthropist cannot but perceive, with
      satisfaction, the rare union that reigns in these laws of stern
      justice and true Christian benevolence, attempting to alleviate
      those evils which it was not in the power of an individual to
      abolish,&mdash; the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_110" id=
      "page_110">[pg.110]</a></span> hardships of slavery, the
      insecurity of property peculiar to those barbarous times, and
      those rash and bloody acts of self-protection, which are
      preferred by the powerful all over the world to the slower steps
      of avenging justice. It is indeed remarkable to observe, how
      these statutes not only counteracted the grosser vices and
      crimes, (which for the most part is the only object of laws,) but
      also favoured the characteristic virtues of the times, for
      instance hospitality. One statute ordains, that when a traveller
      asked for night-quarters at the dwelling of a landed proprietor
      and was not admitted, he had the right to take lodgings in his
      village wherever he pleased; and did he lose any thing, not his
      host, but the proprietor who had refused to harbour him, was
      bound to remunerate the loss.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id=

      The monks of this and the following centuries must have written a
      great deal; as is proved by the many manuscripts that still lie
      accumulated in the numerous Servian and Macedonian
      monasteries,&mdash;the mere remnant of those which perished in
      the long tempests of bloody wars and desolating conflagrations.
      About fifty years after the invention of printing, some of the
      church books from time to time were published in Servia and
      Syrmia. The earliest Servian print extant is from the year 1493,
      viz. an Octateuch, published at Zenta in Herzegovina. In Russia
      they did not begin to print until sixty years later. In 1552 the
      Gospels were printed in Belgrade; in 1562 another edition in
      Negromont. But these faint signs of life soon became extinct; and
      we hear no longer of the least trace of literature among the
      Servians of the Turkish empire. Among the Austrian Servians also,
      literature seems to have been equally dead; with the exception of
      a History of Servia, written and left in manuscript <span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">[pg.111]</a></span> by
      George Brankovitch, the last despot of that country, towards the
      close of the seventeenth century. A genealogical work published
      by Dshefarovitch at Vienna in 1742, had to be engraved, for the
      want of proper types. In the year 1755, under the reign of Maria
      Theresa, when some attention began to be paid to the schools of
      her Illyrian provinces, the archbishop of Carlovitz was compelled

      because no Slavic types were to be found in the whole Austrian
      empire. Some years afterwards, A.D. 1758, a private Slavic press
      was founded at Venice. In Austria, Cyrillic-Slavonic books could
      not be printed earlier than A.D. 1771, when a printing office was
      established at Vienna; the monopoly of which for all
      Slavo-Servian scientific works throughout the empire, was given
      to the university of Buda. From this one point, therefore, the
      whole literary cultivation of the Servians of the oriental church
      in the Austrian empire, could alone proceed.<a name=

      After the partial revival of Servian literature in 1758, a
      considerable number of works were composed; and there are among
      them not a few, which, notwithstanding the mixed and unsettled
      idiom in which they are written, attest the general capacity of
      the nation, and may serve as imperfect specimens of the mass of
      talent buried there. Among the historical writers, we must name
      above all J. Raitch. He wrote on many different subjects; and
      also left behind him a whole library of theological manuscripts.
      His 'History of the Slavic Nations'<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id=

      him a lasting reputation. Other historical writers of some merit,
      are, Kengelatz, Magarashevitch, Julinatz, Solaritch.<a name=
      "FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href=

      subjects of natural philosophy and medicine, are, Orphelin,
      Stoïkovitch, Beritch, Jankovitch, P. Hadshitch, etc. On
      statistics and geography the above-mentioned Solaritch, Vuitch,
      Bulitch, Popovitch, and others. In the department of theology, we
      hardly meet with a single book of a doctrinal character; but
      there are quite a number on ethics. The principal writers of the
      language, therefore, may perhaps be more properly arranged under
      the heads of philosophy (comprehending logic), rhetoric, ethics,
      etc. as Obradovitch, Raitch, Terlaitch, Lazarevitch, Vuitch,
      Davidovitch, Masovitch, etc.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id=

      Poetry and belles-lettres being more dependent on the state of
      the language than purely scientific works, we can proceed no
      further, without first making our readers acquainted with the
      recent innovations of a few patriotic individuals.

      It was Dositheï Obradovitch, born A.D. 1739 in the Banat of
      Temeswar, who first among the eastern Servians ventured to write
      books in the despised language of the country. The fortunes of
      this person are, in several respects, of uncommon interest.
      Brought up in a monastic school, he became monk when he was only
      fourteen years old. After several years of severe struggles, he
      fled. For twenty-five years he travelled over all<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">[pg.113]</a></span>
      Europe; and then returned to his comparatively barbarous native
      land, where he died in 1811, as inspector of the schools, and the
      instructor of the children of the celebrated Kara George. He left
      several works.
    </p>
    <p>
      A far greater influence, however, has been exerted on Servian
      literature by Dem. Davidovitch and Vuk Stephanovitch Karadshitch,
      who have not only followed the same literary course, but were the
      first to defend both theoretically and practically the principle,
      that the Servians ought to <i>write</i> as they <i>speak</i>.
      Their boldness met with strong and decided opposition from the
      old school; and the contest and rivalry which have been the
      consequence, although tending for a time to prevent the progress
      of the good cause, cannot but have, ere long, beneficial results,
      by exciting the minds of the people to a higher activity than
      they have had until then occasion to exert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davidovitch published from 1814 to 1822 a Servian newspaper in
      Vienna, not exclusively of a political character, by which he
      intended to diffuse information on various subjects; the first
      undertaking of the kind in his language. His influence however is
      not confined to the language alone; as secretary of Prince
      Milosh, then at the head of the Servians, his influence on the
      general cultivation of his countrymen was very decided.

      Vuk Stephanovitch Karadshitch, born 1786 in Turkish Servia, is
      the author of the first Oriental-Servian grammar and dictionary;
      and in the arrangement of the former has manifested the true
      spirit of a genuine grammarian. Besides these he has written
      several works of value, a biography of Prince Milosh, a series of
      annuals, a volume on the Proverbs, and idiomatic phrases of the
      Servians, etc.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id=
      "FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_120_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> But the best proof which
      he could give of the beauty, richness, and perfectibility of
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_114" id=
      "page_114">[pg.114]</a></span> vulgar Servian dialect, is his
      Collection of the Servian popular Songs, in four volumes,
      comprising nevertheless only about the fourth or fifth part of
      the similar treasures hidden among the mountains of his country.
      In making this collection, he very judiciously wrote down only
      those songs which he had himself caught from the lips of the
      Servian peasantry. There had already been a rumour among the
      literati of Europe, for more than fifty years, of the beauty and
      singularity of the Illyrian national songs, founded mostly on the
      communications of Italian travellers and the citations of
      Dalmatian dictionaries. Herder, in his valuable Collection of
      popular Poetry, gave two historical fragments from the work of a
      Dalmatian clergyman, A. Cacich.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id=
      "FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_121_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> Goethe also has a
      beautiful tale, taken from Abbate Fortis' Travels among the
      Morlachians. Both translated by means of the French; and although
      this double translation could not possibly do justice to the
      originals, they were sufficiently admired. But when Vuk's
      collection appeared, and a part of its contents was made
      intelligible to the civilized world by a translation attempted by
      the author of this work, imperfect and deficient as any
      translation of popular poetry must necessarily ever be, the
      public and the critics were nevertheless alike struck with the
      strong expression of the high and incomparable beauties of
      nature. All that the other Slavic nations, or the Germans, the
      Scotch, and the Spaniards, possess of popular poetry, can at the
      utmost be compared with the lyrical part of the Servian songs,
      called by them <i>female</i> songs, because they are sung only by
      females and youths; but the long epic extemporized compositions,
      by which a peasant bard, sitting in a large circle of other
      peasants, in unpremeditated but perfectly regular and harmonious
      verse, celebrates the heroic deeds of their ancestors<span class=

      attempts<span class="newpage"><a name="page_116" id=
      "page_116">[pg.116]</a></span> to reduce a language, which
      hitherto had been merely an unwritten dialect of the common
      people, to certain general rules and principles, had, besides the
      more philosophical part of the work, also to adapt the Slavonic
      alphabet to his purpose. The mixed and unregulated language,
      which up to his time had been employed, had been written
      alternately with the Old Slavonic and the Russian letters. To the
      Russian language, with its multitude of sounds, the latter is
      perfectly suitable; in Servian, however, several letters could be
      easily spared; while others had to be added. Some change of the
      alphabet seemed therefore necessary. As those Servians among whom
      Vuk was born, and among whom chiefly he had gathered the
      treasures of remarkable poetry, which serve as so beautiful a
      base to their young literature, all belonged to the Greek or
      Oriental Church, he seems never to have thought of the
      possibility of adopting the Latin alphabet, which had already
      served for several centuries for the once flourishing literature
      of their Catholic brethren, who spoke essentially the same
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are ready to acknowledge that the Slavic alphabet, as arranged
      by Vuk, is better adapted to express the sounds of the Slavic
      languages, than the Latin; it is at once simpler and richer. But
      we nevertheless cannot help regretting, that he did not yield to
      the various reasons, which on the other side spoke in favour of
      the Latin alphabet. It was already used by some millions for the
      same language, and had been so for centuries. It would have given
      a <i>history</i> to the young Servian Literature built on the
      solid foundation of that of Ragusa. It had been, with the
      exception of the Russians, adopted by all the other Slavic
      nations. It would have indeed estranged him, seemingly, from his
      nearer countrymen, who made the most passionate objections
      against his innovations, even as they were; but as they, at any
      rate, had to go to Austria for a literary education, this
      opposition would probably not have lasted longer than it will
      last now. There was some fear, that, with the Roman<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">[pg.117]</a></span>
      alphabet, the Roman chair would try to get possession of their
      church; but those were not the times of Rome's power; and the
      Turkish patronage seemed to secure them against such arrogance.
      One thing is certain. Instead of strengthening for ever the
      artificial wall of separation between the two classes of
      Illyrico-Servians, it would have undermined that which already
      existed; and Vuk, by his strong philosophical-grammatical talent,
      would soon have gained influence enough on the Illyrico-Dalmatian
      literature to mend the imperfections of their orthography, and to
      induce the Croats and Servians to give up their capricious
      varieties. The many detached parts of the products of
      Illyrico-Servian intellect would have grown into one great whole;
      and would have become at least accessible to foreigners; who,
      puzzled by all these varieties of letters and forms of writing,
      lose the courage to penetrate into a structure where they meet so
      much confusion at the very door. Indeed, whether they turn to the
      eastern or to the western branch of the Southern Slavi, they find
      equal individual and provincial anarchy; a state of things which
      the latter at least have taken great pains to amend.

      Vuk published at Vienna, in 1824, the Gospel of St. Luke, as a
      'Specimen of a translation of the New Testament into Servian.'
      What part he had in the version printed at Leipsic by the British
      and Foreign Bible Society, and now circulated among the Servians,
      we are unable to say.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id=

      Modern educated Servian poets, upon whose writings the very
      general interest which the national popular poetry has excited,
      and no doubt also their own consciousness of its power, have
      had<span class="newpage"><a name="page_119" id=

      following: Lucian Mushitzky, bishop of Karlstadt, a writer in
      many departments, and the author of odes and other lyrical
      pieces, all of them highly esteemed by his countrymen; Milovan
      Vidakovitch, Mich. Vitkovitch, J. Popovitch, G. Kovatzevitch,

      More generally known is Simeo Milutinovitch, the author of
      several small volumes of poetry, and of a larger epic poem
      entitled <i>Serbianka</i>, which describes the Servian war of
      1812. In 1837 he published an historical work on Servia during
      the years 1813-15. Both these latter narratives are valuable, as
      he himself had been an eye-witness of many of the events
      described; had acted as secretary to Czerny George, who could
      neither write nor read; and was afterwards also employed by
      Prince Milosh.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id=

      Two interesting collections of the popular poetry extant among
      the inhabitants of Montenegro and Herzegovina were published in
      the course of a few years by Tshubar Tshoikovitch; one of them
      edited by J. Milowuk, himself a modern Servian writer of
      praiseworthy activity; the other by the collector
      himself.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id=

      Last, although not least, the present Vladika or bishop of
      Montenegro, must be named among the modern Servian poets. The
      constitution of this little mountain state, half warlike, half
      patriarchal, is an anomaly in the system of European state
      governments in general. They form a community of about
      20,000<span class="newpage"><a name="page_120" id=
      "page_120">[pg.120]</a></span> families, pressed into the valleys
      and scattered along the slopes of the dark mountain ranges
      between Cattaro, Herzegovina, Bosnia, and Albania; covering a
      surface of 80 or 90 geographical square leagues. Hitherto they
      have been permitted to enjoy a perfect independence in respect to
      both their great neighbours, Austria and Turkey. They look up
      only to the emperor of Russia as a kind of liege lord; but more
      in his quality of Head of the Slavic-Greek Church, than in that
      of a powerful sovereign. They stand under the rule of a Vladika
      or bishop; who, besides being their spiritual guide, is their
      chief judge and their leader in war; as also, since 1832,
      exclusively their executive magistrate. Up to that time they were
      accustomed to elect a <i>governor</i>; but he assumed too much
      power; and the post had become hereditary in the family of
      Radonich. They therefore dismissed him; and his functions were
      likewise intrusted to the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the office of the Vladika had been formerly purely
      elective; yet towards the close of the seventeenth century,
      through the influence of Vladika Daniel Petrovitch of Niegosh, it
      became hereditary in his own family; a member of which since that
      time has always been appointed by the Russian emperor. As the
      Greek bishops belong to the monastic clergy, who of course are
      not permitted to marry,&mdash;while the secular clergy are
      <i>required</i> to do so,&mdash;the succession goes in a
      collateral line. The present Vladika, Peter Petrovitch Niegosh, a
      man of uncommon size, handsome features, considerable talent, and
      a highly respected character, was partly educated in Russia. When
      his predecessor died,&mdash;a powerful man who had ruled for
      fifty-three years, during which time he had led his flock to many
      a bloody battle, and who was canonized as a saint by the present
      bishop,&mdash;this latter was appointed by the emperor Nicholas.
      But as he was then only fifteen years old, Montenegro was
      governed by a sort of guardian; and the Vladika did not enter
      upon his office until he had completed his eighteenth year. The
      wisdom, the energy, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_121" id=
      "page_121">[pg.121]</a></span> the consistency in his
      improvements, which, he has displayed since that time, constitute
      him, in connection with his youth, one of the most remarkable
      personages of our time. His chief aim seems to be to make
      Montenegro a member of the great civilized family of Europe,
      without depriving her of her freedom and independence; and the
      firmness with which he proceeds further and further in a course,
      where he meets with difficulties at every step, deserves praise
      and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first circumstance which directed the attention of literary
      Europe to this remote corner, was a visit of the present king of
      Saxony, who in 1838 made a botanical excursion into those "black
      mountains."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id=
      "FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_127_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> Since then, the
      celebrated Egyptian scholar, Wilkinson, has visited it; and this
      country is no longer closed against travelling artists. The
      Vladika has naturally the manners of a gentleman; he is said to
      speak French, and to understand German, Italian, and of course
      Russian. That he is considered as one of the best riflemen and
      horsemen in his country, we cannot esteem as of much importance
      in a bishop; but he studies also the classics and translates the
      Iliad for his own pleasure. His Servian poems seem mostly to have
      been written on particular occasions. He addressed an ode to the
      king of Saxony after his return to Dresden, which unfortunately
      not a person of the whole court could understand; and the author
      of this volume, who happened then to be at the "German Athens,"
      was applied to for a translation.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id=
      "FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href=

      "newpage"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">[pg.122]</a></span> In
      their own productions, all these educated writers imitate the
      modern literature of other nations further advanced in
      civilization, especially the Germans. Milutinovitch has even a
      tinge of their philosophy. There is no want of talent; but there
      is no nationality in them. Nothing of that wonderful amalgamation
      of the East and the West; of mountaineer wildness and Christian
      principles; of barbarism and civilization; nothing of that
      interesting blending of Asia and Europe, which we feel entitled
      to expect from the poetry of <i>Servians</i>, who stand on the
      border between Muhammedanism and Christendom. Nothing which these
      educated writers have hitherto produced, can be compared with the
      effusions of their old blind men, and of their peasant lads and
      girls, that is, their popular poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vuk's grammar, printed at Vienna 1818, before his dictionary, has
      since been rendered accessible to other European nations by
      Grimm's translation. Another Servian grammar has been published
      in German, by Schaffarik. Vuk's judicious alphabetical
      arrangement and orthography, we are sorry to say, have not been
      generally adopted; and the Russian alphabet is still partly in
      use, with a number of letters superfluous for the Servian
      language, which has not the shades of sound they are meant to
      denote.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political movements in Servia, during the last twelve years,
      have of course been exceedingly injurious to the development of
      its infant literature. While it seemed, under the energetic
      administration of prince Milosh, in a fair way of progress, the
      confused cries of war and insurrection since his abdication have
      drowned the modest voice of the young muse. Of late, indeed,
      intelligence from that country has been so rare, that we are
      unable to give a picture of the present state of
      things.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_123" id=

      2. <i>Literature of the Dalmatians or Illyrico-Servians of the
      Romish Church</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      a) GLAGOLITIC LITERATURE.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not without some hesitation that we approach a region, into
      which we cannot penetrate without stepping through a border of
      perfect darkness. We allude to the introduction of the Glagolitic
      alphabet; the great antiquity of which, supported by numerous
      traditions and legends, as well as by its venerable and almost
      hieroglyphic look, Kopitar's recent investigations and
      discoveries have again made probable; without, however, throwing
      any more light upon its origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Christianity was first introduced into Dalmatia by Romish
      priests, the Latin language was of course adopted for religious
      purposes. But so soon as the people became acquainted with the
      liturgy of Methodius in a language intelligible to them, this
      innovation met with such a general and heartfelt welcome, that
      all the severe decrees of synods, nay, of the holy chair of Rome
      itself, were unable to stop its progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more than a hundred and fifty years afterwards, when
      Methodius was solemnly declared by pope Nicolas II. a heretic,
      and the Romish mass again introduced, the attachment to their own
      language was too deeply rooted to be taken away at once. Hence
      the Old Slavic idiom, with the pope's reluctant permission,
      continued to be the language of the Church service. It appears,
      however, that the alphabet which their priests employed for
      writing their ecclesiastic documents, was not the same with that
      used by other Slavi of the oriental church: but was of a
      different character, and evidently <i>not</i> derived from the
      Greek, with the exception of a few letters. It was called the
      <i>Glagolitic.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Glagol</i> signifies in Old Slavic <i>the word</i> or rather
      <i>the verb</i>;<span class="newpage"><a name="page_124" id=
      "page_124">[pg.124]</a></span> but the reason of the application
      of this term to the Illyrico-Servians of the catholic communion
      <i>(Glagolitæ)</i>, and to the language of their sacred writings
      (<i>Glagolic</i> or <i>Glagolitic</i>), has not yet been
      ascertained; all that has as yet been asserted by Slavic
      philologians being mere hypothesis. The oldest monument known up
      to 1830. in which these letters were extant, was a Psalter of
      A.D. 1220. This Psalter was by tradition ascribed to St. Jerome
      himself, who was in general called the inventor of the Slavic,
      that is the <i>Glagolitic</i> alphabet. According to a popular
      legend of the Dalmatians, this father, who was a native of
      Illyria, also translated the whole Bible into the Slavic; but it
      has been since clearly proved, that while (as is well known) he
      corrected the old Latin version of the Bible, he yet never wrote
      a single line of Slavic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery, in which the origin of the Glagolitic was and still
      is buried, gave birth to the singular hypothesis already above
      mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id=
      "FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_129_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> The discovery however of
      several very ancient Glagolitic manuscripts, and especially of
      one which could be proved to be older than the Council of
      Spalatro<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id=
      "FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_130_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> destroyed it at once;
      but unfortunately, without clearing up the mystery either of its
      invention or of its introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Glagolitic manuscript of some interest may be mentioned
      here. It was generally known, that the kings of France were
      accustomed, at their coronation at Kheiras, to take the oath on a
      large book, called <i>Texte du Sacre</i>, bound in gold or
      gilding, and covered with unwrought precious stones, which
      contained the Gospels written in some unknown hieroglyphic
      language. When in 1717 Tzar Peter I. visited Rheims, this book
      was shown to him among other curiosities, and he exclaimed at
      once: "This is my own Slavonic!" This view was soon
      spread<span class="newpage"><a name="page_125" id=
      "page_125">[pg.125]</a></span> among Slavic scholars. But the
      precious parchment was written in two columns, and in two
      languages. What idiom could the other be? The French, it is said,
      took it for Greek: more probably for Coptic. In 1789, a learned
      English traveller, Thomas Ford Hill, was shown some Glagolitic
      manuscripts in the imperial library at Vienna; whereupon he
      declared without hesitation, that this was the mysterious writing
      of the Rheims manuscript. Before the Vienna scholars, Dobner and
      Alter, then at the head of Slavic matters, had time to
      investigate the matter further, the revolution broke out, and the
      precious document disappeared. No trace was left of it; and for
      half a century the patriotic Slavic scholars supposed they had
      cause to lament the loss of a document of the very highest
      antiquity. It was conjectured that the book had originally been
      brought to France by some Slavic princess; for instance, by a
      princess of Kief, who is said to have been sent for by Henry I.,
      son of Hugh Capet and king of France in the beginning of the
      eleventh century. Application was made on the subject to
      Sylvestre de Sacy; whose report gave some hope, that the precious
      relic might still be preserved. Search was made by Kopitar in
      Italy and at Paris, but all in vain. At last it was again found
      at Rheims by the Russian scholar Stroyef;<a name=
      "FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_131_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> who, however, seems not
      to have been acquainted with the Glagolitic writing, and
      therefore laid little stress on it. The volume was stripped of
      its costly ornaments, and had therefore been the more easily
      recovered during the reign of Napoleon; who endeavoured, as much
      as was in his power, to restore the spoils of the revolution,
      while he himself filled Paris with the spoils of all other
      nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The librarian at Rheims, in order best to meet the numerous
      inquiries of Slavic scholars, caused a <i>fac simile</i> of it to
      be taken; audit was finally committed to the learned Kopitar's
      care. It was now discovered, that this long deplored document
      contained two<span class="newpage"><a name="page_126" id=
      "page_126">[pg.126]</a></span> unconnected portions of the
      Gospels; one in Cyrillic letters, the other, considerably longer,
      in Glagolitic; and both executed with remarkable calligraphic
      skill. The Glagolitic portion was marked with the date 1395. It
      was written at Prague, and presented by the emperor Charles IV.
      to the Abbot of Emaus; with the injunction, that these
      <i>Evangelia</i> should be chanted at mass; and the remark was
      added, that the accompanying Cyrillic portion was written by St.
      Procopius with his own hand. Procopius was one of the patron
      saints of Bohemia, who died in 1053. How this valuable manuscript
      was finally removed to France, is still unexplained. At Rheims
      nothing further was known, than that it had been presented by the
      Cardinal of Lorraine in A.D. 1554. A rumour ascribed to the
      Cyrillic portion a Greek origin; the Glagolitic part was
      generally considered as a relic from St. Jerome's own library.
      This supposed immediate connection with two saints, may well
      account for the reverence with which the book was treated in
      France.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id=

      "#Footnote_132_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> A splendid edition of

      Although the use of the Slavic language was in a certain measure
      authorized by the pope, yet the clergy of Dalmatia preferred
      unanimously the Latin for their theological and ecclesiastical
      writings. The Glagolitic literature was therefore almost
      exclusively limited to copies of the productions of their
      Cyrillic brethren. The Glagolitic letters had, however, the
      precedence of the Cyrillic alphabet, in respect to printing. The
      first printed Glagolitic missal, is of the year 1483; whilst the
      earliest work<span class="newpage"><a name="page_127" id=
      "page_127">[pg.127]</a></span> printed in the Cyrillic letters is
      not older than A.D. 1491. In the sixteenth century books were
      printed at Zengh (Segna), at Fiume, at Venice, and at Tubingen,
      with Glagolitie letters. In the year 1621, the emperor Ferdinand
      II. presented the Propaganda with a font of Glagolitic types,
      which he obtained from Venice. Several improved breviaries and
      missals have since been printed at Rome. In our day, this city
      possesses the only Glagolitic printing office in existence. On
      the Dalmatian islands, books are still copied in manuscript, just
      as before the invention of printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the Dalmatian clergy, there were a few who united a real
      interest for the preservation of their language and for science
      in general. Raph. Levakovitch improved the breviary in 1648, in
      respect to language; the archbishop Vincenz Zmajevitch, ob. 1771,
      a great patron of the literature of his country, founded a
      hundred years later a theological seminary in Zara. Matthias
      Caraman, on occasion of a new edition of the missal by the
      Propaganda in 1741, undertook a fundamental revision and
      correction of it. The Propaganda also founded a Slavic
      professorship in the <i>Collegia Urbano</i>; and for the benefit
      of this Society a new translation of the whole Bible was resolved
      upon, which however has never been published. A notice of the
      exertions of the priest Rosa belongs rather to the history of
      Dalmatian secular literature.
    </p>

    <p>
      b) SECULAR LITERATURE.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not certain at what time, nor by whom, the Latin letters
      were first adopted for the Servian language. The earliest
      teachers of the occidental portion of that people having been
      Romish priests, they of course used their own letters for writing
      such Slavic words or names as occasion required. The Latin
      alphabet probably came into use without any particular
      pains,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_128" id=
      "page_128">[pg.128]</a></span> long before the introduction of
      the Glagolitic letters. These, in their awkward hieroglyphic
      form, were little adapted to supersede the Latin forms. The
      example of the Poles and Bohemians could only encourage the first
      Dalmatian writers to continue in the same course; although each
      of these nations follows a different system of pronouncing the
      same letters. The orthography of the Dalmatians remained,
      however, for a long time entirely unsettled: and is so still in
      some measure. A greater difficulty arose from the absurd practice
      of the Slavonians and Croatians, who, although speaking and
      writing the same language, yet write and print it each according
      to a different system of combination; thus limiting the perusal
      of their own scanty productions almost exclusively to the few
      readers of their small provinces respectively, whilst the
      remainder of their countrymen are hardly able to understand them.
      This division, however, compels us likewise to separate in our
      sketch the literature of the Dalmatians proper, and that of the
      catholic Slavonians.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <i>Literature of Dalmatia Proper</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbourhood of the Italians exercised in very early times a
      happy influence on the literature of the Dalmatians. The small
      republic of Ragusa, during the fourteenth and fifteenth
      centuries, was at the zenith of its splendour and welfare.
      Celebrated Italians were teachers in her schools; and the
      persecuted Greeks, Lascaris, Demetrius Chalcondylas, Emanuel
      Marulus, and several others, celebrated over all Europe for their
      learning, found an asylum within her walls. Thus the treasures of
      the classics and of the Italian middle ages became familiar to
      the noble youths of Ragusa, until, in the beginning of the
      sixteenth century, poetry began to appear in a national dress.
      The Italian influence remained strikingly visible. Blasius
      Darxich, Sigismund Menze, Mauro Vetranich, and Stephen Gozze
      (ob.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_129" id=
      "page_129">[pg.129]</a></span> 1576), are mentioned as the first
      Dalmatian poets. The latter wrote a comic epic, the
      <i>Dervishiade</i>, which met with great success. A poem of the
      same kind is <i>Jegyupka</i>, the Gipsy, by Andreas Giubronavich,
      printed at Venice 1559. Dominic Zlatarich (ob. 1608) translated
      Tasso and the Electra of Sophocles, and was himself a lyric poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annals of this period, towards the end of the sixteenth
      century, report likewise the name of a lady, Svietana Zuzerich,
      as an Illyrian poetess; called also Floria Zuzzeri, as an Italian
      poetess; for she wrote with success in both languages. Several
      other ladies followed the example, as Lucrezia Bogashinovich,
      Katharina Pozzo di Sorgo, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Ragusa enjoyed
      peace, and a degree of wealth and prosperity most favourable to
      high attainments in science and literature. The first Slavic
      theatre was founded here, and the dramatic art seems to have been
      considered so honourable, that even noblemen acted publicly; as
      is related of Junius Palmota, who died in 1657. The noble names
      of Palmota or Palmotich, Gondola or Gondolich, for they appear
      alternately both in the Slavic and Italian form, are very
      frequent in Ragusian literature. Junius Palmota wrote tragedies;
      selecting his subjects principally from Slavic history. But his
      most esteemed production is a Slavic version of a great Latin
      epic on Christ, by M.H. Vita, which may be considered as a kind
      of precursor to Klopstock's Messiah. John Gondola, a dramatic
      writer before him, translated Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered; and
      left many lyrical poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1667, a horrible earthquake in a few moments
      destroyed the prosperity of the state for whole centuries. It was
      as if the genius of the Ragusian literature had been crushed
      under the ruins. From that period we find all that relates to
      literature in a rapid decline. The catastrophe itself, however,
      furnished the poets with a new subject. In the same year,
      N.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_130" id=
      "page_130">[pg.130]</a></span> Bonus published a poem entitled,
      The city of Ragusa to her Rulers; and Jacob Palmota (ob. 1680)
      wrote an elegiac poem, The renovated Ragusa. But the most
      interesting production of this period is a collection of national
      songs, published by the Franciscan monk, And. Cacich
      Miossich.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id=
      "FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_134_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> This work, although
      executed with little critical taste or judgment, and disfigured
      by many interpolations, might have given to the literary world a
      foretaste of the treasures, which fifty years afterwards were to
      be discovered here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Slavic poetry found so many votaries among the Dalmatians,
      it is a remarkable fact, that all their historians wrote in Latin
      or Italian. They possess indeed a very old chronicle, of the date
      of A.D. 1161, written in the Slavic language by an anonymous
      Presbyter of Dioclea, and translated by himself into Latin; but
      in the more flourishing period of the Dalmatian literature, the
      love of their own language was overcome by the stronger desire of
      a more universal reputation than any works written in Slavic
      could procure for them. The names of N. Ragnini, Francisco
      Gondola, Razzi, and Caboga, must here be mentioned. The dialect
      of the country, however, found some advocates even among the
      clergy. For some theological works it was preferred to the Old
      Slavic; or at least the Latin letters were chosen for this
      language instead of the Glagolitic types. An Old Slavic
      translation of the Gospels and Epistles by Bernardin de Spalatro
      was printed with Latin letters, Venice 1495. At the same place
      appeared, in 1613, Bandulovich's translation of the same holy
      books in the common language. A Jesuit, Barth. Cassio, A.D. 1640,
      had translated both the Old and New Testaments; but the printing
      of it was prevented by the bishops. Anton Cacich wrote a work on
      moral theology, in<span class="newpage"><a name="page_131" id=
      "page_131">[pg.131]</a></span> the common dialect of the country:
      and several ecclesiastics of high standing published works for
      religious instruction in the same language. The period following
      the catastrophe of Ragusa was fertile in theological, or rather
      religious, productions. The works of the archidiaconus Albertus,
      as also of Gucetich and others, contain treatises for spiritual
      edification, devotional exercises, etc. Biankovitch, bishop of
      Makarska, wrote a treatise of Christian doctrine, Venice 1708, in
      the common Dalmatian dialect. But this dialect found its most
      ardent champion in a priest, Stephan Rosa, who exerted himself
      greatly to have the old church Slavonic entirely superseded by
      the Dalmatian-Servian language. He made a complete translation of
      the whole Bible, and sent it to the pope, requesting that it
      might be printed and introduced under his high authority instead
      of the Cyrillic Bible. At the same time, he proposed that the
      mass should be read in the Dalmatian dialect; dwelling especially
      on the circumstance, that the Cyrillic language was an ingredient
      of the Greek church, and consequently the use of it in sacred
      things a species of Greek heresy. The pope appointed a committee
      to examine the new translation; the result of which was, as may
      easily be supposed, the rejection of a measure which savoured so
      strongly of Protestantism. From the time of this decision in A.D.
      1754, nothing was done to provide the catholic inhabitants of
      Dalmatia, Bosnia and Slavonia with a version of the Bible, until
      at last a new translation, the first satisfactory one in the
      language, made by the Franciscan monk and professor Katanesich,
      was accepted and introduced in 1832 The merit of having procured
      it to be printed and published, belongs to the late primate of
      Hungary, cardinal Rudnay.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id=
      "FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_135_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The inconvenience of such an anarchical state of orthography, and
      likewise in part of the grammar itself, must of course have been
      felt very early; but it would seem that in this
      department<span class="newpage"><a name="page_132" id=
      "page_132">[pg.132]</a></span> also, the Dalmatian writers acted
      with more zeal and diligence, than success. The above-mentioned
      Barth. Cassio, and after him another Jesuit, J. Micalia,
      endeavoured in the first half of the seventeenth century to
      settle the orthography and subject it to fixed rules. Ardelio
      della Bella, a member of the same order, published in 1728 a
      dictionary and grammar, in which he abandoned the way opened by
      his predecessors, without however finding a better one. Jos.
      Voltiggi endeavoured to establish a third system of pronunciation
      and orthography; his dictionary and grammar appeared in the year
      1803. A few years later a useful grammar was published by
      Appendini; also the great dictionary of J. Stulli, a work of
      considerable merit, and far excelling all previous works of the
      same kind.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id=
      "FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_136_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      All the different systems and rules of orthography, exhibited and
      laid down in these works, had unfortunately no permanent result.
      The Dalmatians, the Slavonians, the Croats, and the Servians in
      Hungary, whenever they used Latin letters, all continued to write
      each in their own way. This continued until about twelve years
      ago; when new efforts began to be made to unite all the different
      branches of the Illyrico-Servians, and if possible also the
      Servians of the Greek Church, in the use of one general system of
      orthography. We have seen above the anarchy in respect to their
      literary language, which some years before the two Servians
      Davidovitch and Vuk Stephanovitch<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_133" id="page_133">[pg.133]</a></span> had found prevailing
      among their Cyrillic brethren; and what pains they took to
      introduce the pure dialect of the people (essentially the
      language of the Dalmatians) as the literary language of the whole
      race; as also the efforts made by Vuk to establish a new
      alphabetical system. It can hardly be doubted that these efforts;
      the interest they excited; and, above all, the claims preferred
      by some eminent scholars connected with them; roused the jealousy
      and just ambition of the Illyrico-Servians. They were far from
      being willing to give up the name of <i>Illyrians</i> for that of
      <i>Servians</i>; they felt themselves a part of a great whole,
      but they wanted to be acknowledged as the <i>principal</i> part.
      In order to become strong, they had above all to unite, A
      gentleman of uncommon energy and intelligence at Agram, Dr.
      Ludovic Gaj, the editor of a Croatian periodical, took the matter
      in hand. He prepared a new system of orthography for all the
      Illyrico-Servian dialects, founded on the Bohemian model, and
      greatly approved by the Bohemian scholars. He himself established
      a printing office in order to carry out his plan. At the same
      time he enlarged his paper, which now became "The Illyrian
      National Gazette;" and contrived to secure patrons of name and
      influence. Schaffarik declared himself decidedly in his favour.
      How far he has succeeded, and how far in general the few
      Illyrico-Servian literati have been able to keep up their budding
      literature during the recent tempests of the times, we are unable
      to say. We may say truly that we have wished for Dr. Gaj's system
      of union the very best success; and have expressed above, how
      desirable we deem it in every respect.<a name="FNanchor_137_137"

      The Slavonians of the Greek Church make use of the Cyrillic

      "#Footnote_138_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> We have seen above, that
      the catholic Slavonians also neither speak nor write a different
      dialect; but that only their mode of writing, the strange
      combination according to which they express the sounds of the
      same language, separates them from the Dalmatian
      Servians.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id=

    <p>
      The light of the Reformation penetrated at an early day into
      Slavonia, and gave birth to a kind of limited theological or
      ecclesiastical national literature. But the catholic clergy soon
      succeeded in extinguishing it; and in the same proportion, the
      Latin language continued to supersede the dialect of the people.
      In more modern days, the Latin has been preferred by nearly all
      catholic Slavonic writers; and their own literature is now almost
      exclusively limited to works for religious instruction,
      catechisms, prayer-books, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although their language was thus relinquished in a practical
      point of view, it remained nevertheless the object of
      investigation to some of their profoundest scholars. Thus the
      Latin works of Prof. Katancsich, are almost all of them devoted
      to Slavic philological inquiries, etc, The translation of the
      Bible mentioned above, was made by the same learned

      LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF THE CROATIANS.

    <br />
    <p>
      Schaffarik in his history of the Slavic Language and Literature
      enumerates, on Dobrovsky's authority, the Croatians or Croats as
      a distinct branch of the great Eastern Slavic stem. Later
      researches however have identified them, to a certain extent,
      with the other Southern Slavi or Illyrico-Servians, with whose
      language theirs is essentially the same. The recent political
      events, and their struggles against the Hungarians, have made the
      Croats in our days again the subject of some interest and
      curiosity, There is however such a confusion in the early history
      of this race; such a change of names, boundaries, and
      constitutions; such a contradiction between the accounts of
      ancient writers and the experience of modern times; that it would
      require a long historical exposition to give to the reader a
      clear view of their relation to each other and to their Slavic
      brethren. For such an exposition there is no room in these
      pages.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id=

      The subject becomes far simpler if we consider the Croats only in
      respect to their language, as it prevails among them at the
      present time. Here they do <i>not</i> appear as a distinct race;
      but still are divided into two portions. One, in Military
      Croatia, comprising the military districts of Carlstadt and
      Varasdin, and also the Banal Border, speak the Dalmatian-Servian
      dialect with very trifling variations; the other, in Provincial
      Croatia, i.e. the provincial counties of Agram, Kreutz, and
      Varasdin, approach nearer to the Slovenzi or Vindes, whose
      language will be the subject<span class="newpage"><a name=

      section.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id=

      "#Footnote_142_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> The dialect of this
      latter division of the Croatians forms indeed, in a certain
      measure, the transition and connecting link between the
      Dalmatian-Servian and the Vindish languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have mentioned above,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id=
      "FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_143_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> that the Croatians
      adopted a system of writing different from that of the
      Dalmatians. The earliest documents of their literature are of the
      sixteenth century, and all belong to the history of the
      Reformation. Here also the new doctrines found minds willing to
      receive them; and as several of the <i>magnates</i>, among whom
      is the illustrious name of Zriny, were also their supporters,
      there was no difficulty in establishing a press, in order to
      diffuse the new light with greater speed and certainty. In the
      course of the last half of the sixteenth and the beginning of the
      seventeenth centuries, a large number of Croatian books,
      catechisms, postillae, etc. were printed. One of the warmest
      champions of the Reformation was Michael Buchich, curate of the
      island Murakoz, who publicly adopted the Calvinistic confession,
      and endeavoured to spread abroad his own, convictions by sermons
      and writings. Persecuted by the bishops, condemned by synods, he
      and his followers found some protection in the Christian
      tolerance of the emperor Maximilian II. But the successors of
      this prince thought otherwise; and the most powerful of the
      Hungarian noblemen took arms for the defence of the Romish
      religion. At the diets held in 1607 and 1610, destruction was
      sworn to the new doctrines and to their adherents; and all steps
      were taken for the fulfilment of the oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the seventeenth century, all Croatia
      had<span class="newpage"><a name="page_137" id=
      "page_137">[pg.137]</a></span> reverted to Romanism. From that
      time onward, for more than fifty years, there was not a thought
      of cultivating the language of the people; all books were again
      written in Latin, and are so mostly even to the present day. The
      first who interested himself anew for the foundation of a
      national literature, was Paul Ritter, of Vitezovich, ob. 1713,
      who procured a printing office to be established by the estates,
      and himself wrote several books in the Croatian language. A few
      writers followed his example; but the activity of the press was,
      and is now, almost exclusively devoted to the printing of the
      ordinary catholic books for spiritual edification and religious
      instruction. The Gospels are extant in the Croatian dialect; but
      not the whole Bible. Most of the Croats, however, are able to
      read and understand the books of their Dalmatian
      neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id=
      "FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_144_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of a union among the Illyrico-Servians in respect to
      orthography and literature, was principally favoured by the
      Croatians, and indeed originated among them. Here Dr. Gaj and
      Count Janko Draskovich, who endeavoured to interest the Illyrian
      <i>ladies</i> in the subject, by a patriotic address, had their
      residence. The events of our own days have taught us, how in
      general the feeling of <i>Slavic nationality</i>, in opposition
      to the Magyar nationality, was roused among the Croatians; for
      although all the different Slavic tribes scattered throughout
      Hungary&mdash;Slovaks, Ruthenians, and
      Servians&mdash;participated in them, yet that feeling was
      strongest among the South western Slavi; who united, as is
      generally known, to elect Jellachich as their Bann.<span class=

      SECTION III.
    </h3>
    <h4>
      LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF THE VINDES OR SLOVENZI.
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Slavic inhabitants of the Austrian provinces Carinthia,
      Carniola, and Stiria, extending from thence in scattered villages
      into Udine once the territory of Venice, and of the Hungarian
      counties Eisenburg and Szala, about a million in number, call
      themselves <i>Slovenzi</i>. By foreign writers they have
      generally been called <i>Windes</i> or <i>Vindes</i>; a name,
      however, less definite and less correct; inasmuch as the term
      Vindes or Vendes served in ancient times among the Germans as a
      general name for <i>all</i> Slavic nations. The Slavic
      settlements in Carniola took place at a very early period,
      certainly not later than the fifth century. In the course of the
      following centuries their number was increased by new emigrations
      from the southeast; and they extended themselves into the lower
      parts of Stiria and Carinthia, and the western counties of
      Hungary.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id=
      "FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_145_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the language of this people, it was formerly
      considered a matter of certainty, that it had never been a
      written language before the time of the Reformation. But the
      investigations of modern philologians have proved, on the
      contrary, that this portion of the Slavic race was earlier
      acquainted with the art of writing than were any of the other
      branches; probably even before the time of Cyril; and since the
      discovery of several very old manuscripts in the library of
      Munich, every doubt of this fact has been silenced. According to
      Kopitar,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id=
      "FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_146_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> the true home of the Old
      Slavic Church language is to be found among<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">[pg.139]</a></span>
      the Pannonian and Carinthian Slavi; and it was for them that the
      Old Slavonic Bible was translated. The liturgy of Methodius was,
      however, soon supplanted by the Latin worship; which at any rate
      must have been earlier established in this part of the country;
      since Christianity appears to have been introduced about the
      middle of the eighth century, by German priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be this as it may, the definite history of the language begins
      only with the Reformation; and it is principally to the exertions
      of one distinguished individual, that it owes its introduction
      into the circle of literature. There is nothing more pleasing in
      the moral world, than to behold the whole life of a man devoted
      to one great cause, his thoughts all bent on one great object,
      his exertions all aiming at one great purpose; and so much the
      more, if that object has respect to the holiest interests of
      mankind. Such was the case with the <i>primus</i> Truber, who may
      be called the apostle of the Vindes and Croatians. The direct
      results of his labours long ago perished in the lapse of time;
      but this does not render them less deserving, although it
      diminishes his fame. Truber, born A.D. 1508, canon and curate at
      several places in Carniola and Carinthia, seems to have been
      early in life impressed with the truth of the new doctrines of
      the Reformation. His sound judgment taught him, that the surest
      way of enabling his flock, and the common people in general, to
      receive the new light in a proper spirit, would be the diffusion
      of useful knowledge among them. And as the German, which at the
      present day is almost exclusively the language of the cities of
      Stiria, Carniola, and Carinthia, was at that time far less
      generally understood, he ventured to commit to paper a dialect
      apparently never before written. In the second edition of his New
      Testament, A.D. 1582, he states expressly: "Thirty-four years
      ago, there was not a letter, not a register, still less a book,
      to be found in our language; people regarded the
      Vindish<span class="newpage"><a name="page_140" id=
      "page_140">[pg.140]</a></span> and Hungarian idioms as too coarse
      and barbarous to be written or read."
    </p>
    <p>
      Truber and his assistants in this great work of reformation and
      instruction, among whom we mention only Ungnad von Sonnegg and
      Dalmatin, met every where with opposition and persecution; but
      their activity and zeal conquered all obstacles, and succeeded in
      at least partially performing that at which they aimed. Meantime,
      Christopher, duke of Würtemburg, a truly evangelical prince, had
      opened in his dominions an asylum for all those who had to suffer
      elsewhere on account of their faith. The translation of the
      Scriptures every where into the language of the common people,
      was regarded by this prince as a holy duty; and this led him to
      cause even Slavic printing-offices to be established in his
      dominions, Thither Truber went; and after printing several books
      for religious instruction, he published the Gospel of Matthew in
      a Vindish translation, Tübingen 1555; and two years later the
      whole New Testament. As Truber did not understand the Greek
      original, his translation was made from the Latin, German, and
      Italian versions. At the same time a translation for the
      Dalmatic-Croatians was planned; and several works for their
      instruction printed and distributed. Truber, thus an exile from
      his own country, died in 1586 as curate in the duchy of
      Würtemburg, engaged in a translation of Luther's House-postillæ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two different systems of orthography had been adopted by Truber
      and Dalmatin. For this reason, when in 1580 the whole Vindish
      Bible was to be printed at Wittemberg, it seemed necessary to fix
      the orthography according to acknowledged rules. This led also to
      grammatical investigations. In the year 1584, a Vindish grammar
      was printed at Wittemberg, the author of which, A. Bohorizh of
      Laibach, was a pupil of Melancthon, and a scholar of that true
      philosophical spirit, without which no one should undertake to
      write a grammar, even where<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_141" id="page_141">[pg.141]</a></span> he has only to
      follow a beaten path; much less when he has to open for himself a
      new one. Thus the Vindish written language, almost in its birth,
      acquired a correctness and consistency, to which other languages
      hardly attain after centuries of experiments, innovations, and
      literary contests. According to the judgment of those who are
      best acquainted with it, the Vindish language has undergone no
      change since the time of Bohorizh,&mdash;a fact indeed scarcely
      credible; and the less so, because during that whole interval it
      has been maintained almost exclusively as a spoken language.
      About thirty years after the publication of this grammar, the
      Roman Catholics, sheltered by the despotic measures of the
      archduke Ferdinand, afterwards the emperor Ferdinand II, gained a
      complete victory. All evangelical preachers, and all Protestants
      who faithfully adhered to their religion, were exiled; their
      goods confiscated; and, more than all, their books <i>burned</i>,
      and their printing-office in Laibach destroyed.<a name=
      "FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_147_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> Fragments of the Gospels
      and of the Epistles were however printed at Grätz, in 1612, for
      the Slavic Catholics, in their own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whole century passed, and the Vindish language seemed to be
      entirely lost for literature and science. Towards the close of
      the seventeenth century, an academy was founded by some learned
      men of Carniola, on the plan of the Italian Academy; and some
      attention was again paid to the language of their forefathers. In
      A.D. 1715 a new edition of Bohorizh's work, with several
      alterations and without mentioning the true author, was printed
      by a capuchin, P. Hippolitus; who left also in manuscript a
      Vindish dictionary, the first in that language.<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">[pg.142]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty-three years later, another grammar was published by the
      monk Marcus Pochlin; a work in itself, according to the best
      authorities, utterly devoid of merit, but which from the
      necessity of the case, and for the want of a better, met with
      success, was reprinted in 1783, and remained in common use until
      the appearance of Kopitar's grammar. This last work,<a name=
      "FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_148_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> written by one of the
      most eminent Slavists of the age, made a decided epoch; not only
      in the history of the Vindish language, but also, by its learned
      preface and comments, in the Slavic literature at large. Several
      grammatical works, not without merit, and for the most part
      founded on Kopitar's grammar, have since been published;<a name=
      "FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_149_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> and since scholars like
      these are now occupied with the cultivation of the Vindish
      language, there exist for it and for its kindred dialects the
      happiest prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this Slavic branch, a mountain people, had its treasures of
      popular poetry, has always been supposed; and many single pieces,
      not without beauty, have been communicated to the public in
      German translations. A <i>collection</i> of these flowers, which
      fade rapidly away in this German neighbourhood, was ten years ago
      made by Achazel and Korytko.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id=
      "FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_150_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The literature of a people, among whom every individual of any
      education may call another highly cultivated language in the
      fullest sense his own,&mdash;as is the case with the Bohemians
      and Slovenzi in respect to the German,&mdash;cannot be very
      extensive. There have, however, in modern times, been published
      several works of poetry and prose in the Vindish language; among
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_143" id=
      "page_143">[pg.143]</a></span> writers of which we can mention
      only the most distinguished. Such are, V. Vodnik, author of some
      collections of poems; Kavnikar, author of a biblical history of
      the Old and New Testament, and several works for religious
      edification; Farnik, Kumerdcy, Popovich, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most important work, both in a philological and moral
      point of view, is the translation of the whole Bible, set on foot
      by G. Japel, and executed by a society of learned men. This
      version being intended for Catholics, was made from the Vulgate,
      and was published at Laibach 1800, in five volumes; the New
      Testament appeared also separately, in two volumes, Laib. 1804. A
      Slavic pulpit, which was established ten years ago at the same
      place, has also been of great service to the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inhabitants of the provincial counties Agram, Kreutz,
      Varasdin, and the neighbouring districts, called Provincial
      Croatia, who speak a somewhat different dialect of the Vindish
      language, but are able to read that version of the Bible, have
      nevertheless several translations in their own dialect, lying in
      manuscript, and only waiting for some Maecenas, or for some
      favourable conjuncture, in order to make their appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only portion of the Vindish race among whom the Protestant
      religion has been kept alive, are about 15,000 Slovenzi in
      Hungary. Their dialect approaches in a like measure to that of
      the Slovaks; and hence serves as the connecting link between the
      languages of the Eastern and Western Slavic stems. For them the
      New Testament exists in a translation by Stephen Kuznico; Halle
      1771; reprinted at St. Petersburg, 1818.<span class=

    <h3>
      LANGUAGE OF THE BULGARIANS.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      According to the opinion of the Russian, and especially of the
      Bohemian philologians, Bulgaria and the adjacent regions of
      Macedonia, are the real home of the Old Slavic language; which
      was here, as they suppose, the language of the people in the time
      of Cyril, who was born in Thessalonica.<a name="FNanchor_151_151"
      id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_151_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> No other Slavic dialect
      however, as Kopitar remarks, has been so much affected as the
      Bulgarian by the course of time and foreign influence, both in
      its grammatical structure and its whole character.<a name=
      "FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_152_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> It has an article,
      which, as if in order to show whence it was borrowed, is put
      <i>after</i> the word it qualifies, like that of the Walachians
      and Albanians. Of the seven Slavic cases, only the nominative and
      vocative remain to it; all the rest being supplied by means of
      prepositions. As Bulgaria has been for centuries the great
      thoroughfare of other nations, the Slavic natives have become
      mixed with Rumenians, Turco-Tartars, and perhaps Greeks, It is in
      this way, that the state of their language may be accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to 1392, when Bulgaria was an independent
      kingdom,&mdash;tributary to the Greek empire, until the decline
      of the latter<span class="newpage"><a name="page_145" id=
      "page_145">[pg.145]</a></span> encouraged them to break the weak
      tie of vassalage.&mdash;their writings were in the Old Slavic
      language; and many documents in it are still extant in monastic
      libraries. Venelin, a young Russian scholar, who by his
      researches on the Bulgarian, or, as he would fain call it, the
      <i>Bolgarian</i> language, had excited great hopes in the learned
      Slavic world, was sent in 1835 to Bulgaria, by the Russian
      Archaeographical Commission, to search, after historical
      documents and to examine the language. The publication of a
      "Bolgarian Grammar," and two volumes of a "History of the
      Bolgarians," were the result. While engaged in preparing a third
      volume, he died; less regretted by the literary world, it is
      said, than would have been anticipated some years before; since
      his productions had not justified the expectations raised by his
      zeal. He seems to have been one of those visionary etymologists,
      who found their conclusions on the analogy of sound and similar
      accidental features; a class of scholars, which, in our age of
      philosophical research, has no longer much chance of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Bulgarians is a series of continued warfare
      with the Servians, Greeks, and Hungarians, on the one hand; and
      on the other, with the Turks, who subdued them, and put an end to
      the existence of a Bulgarian kingdom in A.D. 1392. The people,
      first converted to Christianity by Cyril and Methodius, had
      hitherto adhered to the Greek church; except for a short interval
      in the last half of the twelfth century, when the Roman chair
      succeeded in bringing them under its dominion. Since the
      establishment of the Turkish government, apostasy to
      Muhammedanism has been more frequent in Bulgaria, than in any
      other of the Christian provinces of the Porte. Still, the bulk of
      the population has remained faithful to the Slavic Greek worship.
      The scanty germs of cultivation sown among them by two or three
      of their princes, who caused several Byzantine works to be
      translated into the Bulgarian dialect, perished during the
      Turkish<span class="newpage"><a name="page_146" id=
      "page_146">[pg.146]</a></span> invasion. The few books used by
      the priesthood in our days, are obtained from Russia. They have
      no trace of a literature, and the only point of view from which
      their language, uncultivated as it is, can excite a general
      interest, is in respect to their popular songs. In these this
      dialect likewise is said to be exceedingly rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian Bible Society had prepared a Bulgarian translation of
      the New Testament, intended more especially for the benefit of
      the Bulgarian inhabitants of the Russian province of Bessarabia.
      But the specimen printed in 1823 excited some doubt as to the
      competency of the translator in respect to his knowledge of the
      Bulgarian language; and it was deemed advisable to put a stop to
      its further progress. Among the Albanian portion of its
      inhabitants, the New Testament has been distributed by the
      British and Foreign Bible Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dearth of all philological helps in respect to the
      Bulgarian language, it is matter of grateful acknowledgment to
      Slavic scholars, that an American missionary, the Kev. E. Biggs,
      stationed at Smyrna, should recently have taken up the subject,
      and furnished us with a brief sketch of the principal features of
      the Bulgarian grammar. It seems that the Bulgarians have availed
      themselves of the printing establishment founded by the American
      missionaries at Smyrna; and some books in this language have been
      there printed. Mr. Kiggs says of the language, that "its
      literature is very slender, consisting almost entirely of a few
      elementary books, printed in Bucharest, Belgrad, Buda, Cracow,
      Constantinople, and Smyrna." A Bulgarian translation of
      Gallaudet's "Child's Book on the Soul," was sent by the same
      gentleman to New York. From the same source we learn that a
      Bulgarian version of the New Testament was printed at Smyrna in
      1840, for the British and Foreign Bible Society; and that in 1844
      the first number of a monthly magazine, entitled "Philology," was
      issued from the same press.

    <h4>
      HISTORY OF THE CZEKHISH OR BOHEMIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      Of all the Slavic languages, the Bohemian dialect with its
      literature is the only one, which, in the mind of the protestant
      reader, can excite a more than general interest. Not so much
      indeed by its own nature, in which it differs little from the
      other Slavic languages; but from those remarkable circumstances,
      which, in the night of a degenerate Romanism, made the Bohemian
      tongue, with the exception of the voice of Wickliffe, the first
      organ of truth. Wickliffe's influence, however great and decided
      it may have been, was nevertheless limited to the theologians and
      literati of the age; his voice did not find that responding echo
      among the common people, which alone is able to give life to
      abstract doctrines. It was in Bohemia, that the spark first
      blazed up into a lively flame, which a century later<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">[pg.148]</a></span>
      spread an enlightening fire over all Europe. The names of Huss
      and Jerome of Prague can never perish; although less success has
      made them less current than those of Luther and Melancthon. In no
      language of the world has the Bible been studied with more zeal
      and devotion; no nation has ever been more willing to seal their
      claims upon the Word of God with their blood. The long contests
      of the Bohemians for liberty of conscience, and their final
      destruction, present one of the most heart-rending tragedies to
      be found in human history. Not less ready to maintain their
      convictions with the pen than with the sword, the theological
      literature of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and the first twenty
      years of the seventeenth centuries, is of an extent with which
      that of no other Slavic language can be compared. It is true,
      however, that most of these productions bear decidedly the stamp
      of the period in which they were written. Dictated by the
      polemical spirit of the age, and for the most part directed by
      one protestant party against another, there is very little to be
      found in them to gratify the Christian, or from which the
      theological student of the present day could derive any other
      than historical instruction. On the other hand, while the
      theological literature of all the other Slavic nations is almost
      exclusively limited to sermons, catechisms, prayer-books, and
      other devotional exercises, among the Bohemians alone do we meet
      with exegetical researches and interpretations, founded on a
      scientific examination of the original text of the Scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few branches of science or art in which the Bohemians
      have not to boast of some eminent name. But the talent for which
      this nation is the most distinguished is that of music A fondness
      for music and a natural gift to execute it is indeed common to
      all Slavic nations: but whilst their talent is mostly confined to
      a susceptible ear, and a skill in imitating,&mdash;for the
      Russians and Poles possess some celebrated musical
      <i>performers</i> though very few distinguished
      <i>composers</i>,&mdash;the talent of the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">[pg.149]</a></span>
      Bohemian is of a far higher order. He unites the spirit of
      harmony which characterizes the Germans, with the sweet gift of
      melody belonging to the Italians, and thus seems to be the true
      <i>ideal</i> of a complete musician. A great part of the most
      eminent names among German composers are Bohemians by birth; and
      there is hardly any thing which strikes the American and English
      traveller in that beautiful region more, than the general
      prevalence of a gift so seldom met with in their own countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bohemia, until the sixth century was inhabited by a Celtic race,
      the Boii. After them the country was called <i>Boiohemnum,</i> i.
      e, home of the Boii; in German still Böheim.<a name=
      "FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_153_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> The Boii were driven to
      the south-west by the Markomanns; the Markomanns were conquered
      by the Lombards. After the downfall of the great kingdom of
      Thuringia in the middle of the sixth century, Slavic nations
      pushed forward into Germany, and the <i>Czekhes</i> settled in
      Bohemia, where an almost deserted country offered them little or
      no resistance. The Czekhes, a Slavic race, came from
      Belo-Chrobatia, as the region north of the Carpathian range was
      then called.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id=
      "FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_154_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> Their name has been
      usually explained from that of their chief, Czekh; but Dobrovsky
      more satisfactorily derives it from <i>czeti, czjti</i>, to
      begin, to be the first; according to him Czekhes signifies much
      the same as Front-SIavi.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id=
      "FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_155_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> The person of Czekh has
      rather a mythological than an historical<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">[pg.150]</a></span>
      foundation. The whole history of that period, indeed, is so
      intimately interwoven with poetical legends and mythological
      traditions, that it seems impossible at the present time to
      distinguish real facts from poetical ornaments. The hero of the
      ancient chronicles Samo, the just Krok, Libussa the wise and
      beautiful, and the husband of her choice, the peasant Perzmislas,
      all move in a circle of poetical fiction. There is, however, no
      doubt that there is an historical foundation for all these
      persons; for tradition only expands and embellishes; but rarely,
      if ever, invents.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we have said in our introduction, in regard to the vestiges
      of an early cultivation of the Slavic nations in general, must be
      applied to the Czekhes particularly.<a name="FNanchor_156_156"
      id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_156_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> The courts of justice in
      which the just Krok and his daughter presided, and which the
      chronicles describe to us, present indeed a wonderful mixture of
      the sacred forms of a well organized society, and of that
      patriarchal relation, which induced the dissenting parties to
      yield with childlike submission to the arbitrary decisions of the
      prince's wisdom. According to the chronicle, so early as A.D.
      722, Libussa kept a <i>pisak</i> or clerk, literally, <i>a,
      writer;</i> and her prophecies were written down in Slavic
      characters. The same princess is said to have founded Prague. A
      considerable number of Bohemian poems, some of which have been
      only recently discovered, are evidently derived from the pagan
      period. Libussa's choice of the country yeoman Perzmislas for her
      husband, in preference to her noble suitors, indicates the early
      existence of a free and independent peasantry. All these
      scattered features are however insufficient to give us a distinct
      picture of this early period; and here, as among all other Slavic
      nations, <i>history</i> commences only with the introduction of
      Christianity. The small states originally founded by the Czekhes,
      were first united into one dukedom during the last years
      of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_151" id=
      "page_151">[pg.151]</a></span> Perzmislas; while under his son
      Nezamysl, in the year 752, they are said to have first
      distributed the lands in fee, and to have given to the whole
      community a constitutional form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Boii, Bohemians, was transferred to the Czekhes by
      the neighbouring nations. They continued to call themselves
      Czekhes, as they do even now. The Moravians, a nearly related
      Slavic race, who probably came to these regions at the same time
      with the Czekhes, called themselves <i>Morawczik</i>,<a name=
      "FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_157_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> from <i>Morawa,</i>
      morass, a name frequently repeated in Slavic countries. Until
      A.D. 1029, they were as a people entirely separated from the
      Bohemians. They had formed different petty states; their chiefs
      were called <i>Kniazi</i>, like those of their eastern brethren.
      The ancient Moravia, however, spread far beyond the limits of the
      present country of this name, and extended deep into Hungary.
      Hence this portion of the Slavic race was also generally
      comprised under the name of the Pannonic Slavi. We have shown
      above, in the history of the Old Slavonic language, that Moravia,
      then for a short period a powerful kingdom, was the principal
      theatre of Methodius' exertions.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id=
      "FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_158_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> As at this<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">[pg.152]</a></span>
      time Christianity had been already introduced into these regions,
      and the kings Rostislav and Svatopluk, as well as most of their
      subjects, were already baptized, it is very probable that they
      were induced by motives of policy to send to Constantinople for a
      Christian teacher. Oppressed by the Germans, the usurpations of
      whose emperors were in a certain measure sanctioned by the chair
      of Rome, they desired to secure for themselves in the Byzantine
      court a powerful ally. After the dissolution of the Moravian
      kingdom in A.D. 1029, the present Moravia fell to Bohemia; was
      separated from it repeatedly in the course of the following
      centuries; and at length, in the beginning of the seventeenth
      century, became together with this kingdom an ingredient part of
      the Austrian states.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moravians were among the earliest Slavic tribes converted to
      Christianity. As early as the seventeenth century a considerable
      portion of them were baptized by German priests. It was however
      not before the first half of the ninth century, that the first
      Christian missionaries entered Bohemia. In the year 845, fourteen
      Bohemian princes were baptized at Ratisbon. In the year 894 the
      duke Borzivog, the head of the nation, received baptism; but his
      successors went back to idolatry, and with them the greatest part
      of the people. Christianity was not firmly established in these
      regions until the second half of the tenth century. At this time
      the Slavic liturgy introduced by Methodius into Moravia was
      already, in some measure, by the indefatigable exertions of the
      Romish German priesthood, superseded by the Latin worship. Thus
      it never was fully established in Bohemia with the exception of a
      few churches, attached to convents founded expressly in memory of
      the Slavic saints, Jerome, Cyril, and Methodius. Their inmates
      however were expelled in favour of German-Bohemian monks, or they
      died; and with them disappeared every vestige of the innovations
      of Cyril and Methodius. Hence the Old Slavic language, and the
      noble translation of the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_153"
      id="page_153">[pg.153]</a></span> Bible extant in it, have
      exercised only an inconsiderable influence on the Bohemian
      idiom.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id=

    <p>
      Bohemia, under the sovereignty of her dukes, and from A.D. 1198,
      under that of kings, was independent of the German empire, or at
      least did not belong to its circles; it recognized however a kind
      of sovereignty in that powerful neighbour, and the kings of
      Bohemia deemed it an honour to belong to the seven Electors, who
      chose the worldly head of Christianity. In the year 1306, the
      last male descendant of Perzmislas was murdered. His house had
      reigned in Bohemia in uninterrupted succession; although the
      kingdom was properly not hereditary, but elective, like Germany,
      Hungary, and Poland. After a short interval, the crown of Bohemia
      fell by succession to the house of Luxemburg, and thus became
      several times united with the Roman imperial crown. Under the
      emperor Charles IV, Bohemia rose to the summit of its lustre. It
      was he who founded, A.D. 1348, the university of Prague, the
      first Slavic institution of that description.<a name=
      "FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_160_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> Under his successor,
      Wenceslaus, the war of the Hussites began. In the year 1457. the
      Bohemians maintained their right of election by placing George
      Podiebrad, a Bohemian, on the throne. The wisdom and equity of
      this individual justified their choice. In A.D. 1527, Ferdinand
      I, archduke of Austria, was elected king; and from that time the
      Bohemians have never again been able to detach themselves from
      Austria;<span class="newpage"><a name="page_154" id=
      "page_154">[pg.154]</a></span> with the exception of a short
      interval, during which the unfortunate palatine Frederic, known
      in the history of the thirty years' war, was placed on their
      throne. During the fifteenth, sixteenth, and the first half of
      the seventeenth, centuries. Bohemia was almost without
      interruption the theatre of bloody wars and contests in behalf of
      their religious liberties. Then came the awful stillness of
      death, which reigned for more than a hundred years over this
      exhausted and agonized country. For its revival and its present
      comparatively flourishing condition, it is indebted to its own
      rich natural resources, and to the wiser policy and milder
      dispositions of the more recent Austrian sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian language is the common property not only of the
      Bohemians and the Moravians, constituting together about three
      and a half millions in number, but also of nearly two millions of
      Slovaks, those venerable remains of the ancient Slavic
      settlements between the Carpathian mountains and the rivers
      Theiss and Danube. This people, so nearly related to the Czekhes,
      occupy the whole north-western part of Hungary; and are, besides
      this, scattered over that whole kingdom. They <i>speak</i> indeed
      a dialect or rather several dialects essentially different from
      the language spoken in Bohemia and Moravia; but the circumstance
      of their having, since the Reformation, chosen the Bohemian for
      their literary language, amalgamates their contributions to
      literature with those of the Bohemians, and gives them an equal
      right to the productions of these latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the modern Slavic languages, the Bohemian was the first
      cultivated. Two bishops of Merscburg, Boso towards the middle of
      the tenth century, and Werner at the close of the eleventh, as
      also fifty years later another German priest, Bruno, were above
      all active in promoting the holy cause of Christianity by
      religious instruction. The application of Latin characters to
      Slavic words had long been familiar to the German priesthood;
      inasmuch as very early attempts had been made to<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">[pg.155]</a></span>
      convert the subjugated Slavic tribes, scattered through the north
      of Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now were applied to the Bohemian, so far as writing was
      requisite for religious instruction. According to the old
      chronicles, there were even some regular schools erected in those
      early times, one at Budecz, near Prague, and another somewhat
      later in Prague itself, where Latin was taught. Be this as it
      may, the Latin and German languages had an early influence on the
      formation of the Bohemian. Many foreign words were adopted and
      amalgamated with the language; still more were formed from native
      roots, after the model of those two idioms. In later times this
      capacity of the Bohemian has been greatly improved; it being one
      of the few languages, which, in philosophy, theology, and
      jurisprudence, have not borrowed their terminology from the
      Latins and Greeks, but formed their own technical expressions for
      ideas received only in part from other nations. The extraordinary
      refinement of the Bohemian verb we have mentioned in our remarks
      upon the Slavic languages in general. In respect to free and
      independent construction, the Bohemian approaches the Latin; by
      its richness in conjunctions it differs essentially from the
      Russian, and is able to imitate the Greek in all its lighter
      shades. Thus it yields neither in copiousness nor in pliability,
      neither in clearness nor in precision,<a name="FNanchor_161_161"
      id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_161_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> to any other Slavic
      language; while in respect to lexical and grammatical cultivation
      it is superior to all of them. The Bohemian alone, of all the
      Slavic languages, has hitherto succeeded in imitating perfectly
      the classic metres; although the same degree of capacity for them
      is acknowledged in the Southern-Slavic dialects.
    </p>
    <p>
      After so much well deserved praise, we must also mention, that in
      respect to sound, the reproach of harshness and want of euphony
      has been made with more justice against none of the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">[pg.156]</a></span>
      Slavic tongues. It is true that all the reasons, by which we have
      above seen the Slavic languages in general defended,<a name=
      "FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_162_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> apply with equal weight
      to the Bohemian in particular. It appears also, that this
      apparent harshness is more a production of modern times, than a
      necessary ingredient of the original language; for the ancient
      Bohemian of legends and popular songs sounds by far more
      melodious; and the dialects spoken by the Slovaks, which are
      kindred to the Old Bohemian, are full of vowels, and are even
      distinguished from the other Slavic tongues by diphthongs. On the
      other hand, it cannot be denied, that the accumulation of
      consonants, in which the Bohemian surpasses by far, not the
      Polish, but the southern and eastern languages, and its peculiar
      preference of the vowels <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> over the fuller
      sounding <i>a, o, u</i>, do not add to the euphony of the
      language; although it seems singular to bring forward such a
      reproach against a people so distinguished for their musical
      talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Bohemian literature may be divided into five
      periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>first</i> comprises the whole interval from our first
      knowledge of the Czekhes to the influence of Huss; or from A.D.
      550 to A.D. 1400.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>second</i> period comprises a full century, from Huss to
      the general diffusion of the art of printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>third</i> period, the golden age of the Bohemian
      literature, comprises about the same interval, and extends to the
      battle at the White Mountain, A.D. 1620.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fourth</i> period, extends from the battle at the White
      Mountain to the revival of literature in 1774-1780.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fifth</i> period, covers the interval from 1780 to the
      present time.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_157" id=

    <h4>
      FIRST PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>From the first settlement of the Czekhes, A.D</i>. 550, <i>to
      John Huss, A.D</i>. 1400.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Of the language of the Czekhes as it existed when they first
      settled in Bohemia, nothing is left, except the names they gave
      to the rivers, mountains, and towns, and those of their first
      chiefs. All these names entitle us to conclude, that their
      language was then essentially the same as at the present time,
      though more nearly approaching the Old Slavic. The first
      <i>certain</i> written documents of the language are not older
      than the introduction of Christianity. There were indeed
      discovered, about thirty years ago, some fragments of poetry,
      which appear to lie derived from the pagan period.<a name=
      "FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_163_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> The manuscript has been
      deposited in the Museum of Prague, and the high beauties and
      evident antiquity of these poems have secured them warm advocates
      and admiring commentators. But the circumstance that Dobrovsky
      doubted their genuineness, induces us to regard this point at
      least as not incontestable in respect to the language; in respect
      to the manners they describe, and the institutions they allude
      to, they bear very strong evidence of a later origin.<a name=
      "FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_164_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> Another highly valuable
      fragment is the celebrated manuscript of Koniginhof, discovered
      in the year 1817 by the librarian Hanka, half buried<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">[pg.158]</a></span>
      among rubbish and worthless papers.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id=
      "FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_165_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> This collection, the
      genuineness of which is subject to no doubt, contains likewise
      several poems, the original composition of which belongs
      evidently to the eighth or ninth century. But the manuscript
      itself is not older than the end of the thirteenth century, and
      cannot therefore be considered as a sure monument of the language
      in an earlier age. All these national songs have an historical
      foundation; they celebrate battles and victories; and their
      evident tendency is to exalt the national feelings. They have not
      that plastic and <i>objective</i> character which makes Homer and
      the Servian popular epics so remarkable; and from which it
      appears that the poet, during the time of his inspiration, is
      rather <i>above</i> his subject; but like the Russian tale of
      Igor's Expedition, the epic beauties are merged in the lyric
      effusions of the poet's own feelings, who thus never attempts to
      conceal that his whole soul is engaged in his subject.

      The oldest monuments of the Christian age are the names of the
      days, which are of pure Slavic origin. Of the Lord's Prayer in
      Bohemian, on comparing the oldest copy he could find among the
      ancient manuscripts, Dobrovsky presumes that the form must have
      been about the same in the ninth or tenth century; although the
      manuscript itself is somewhat later. A translation of
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_159" id=
      "page_159">[pg.159]</a></span> <i>Kyrie eleison</i>, ascribed to
      Adalbert second bishop of Prague, dates from the same time.
      During the eleventh and twelfth centuries many convents were
      founded and schools attached to them; German artists and
      mechanics and even agriculturists settled in Bohemia. The
      influence of German customs and habits showed itself more and
      more, and the nobility began to use in preference the German
      language. In the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth
      centuries, this influence increased considerably, and exhibited
      itself most favourably in the lyric poetry of the time, an echo
      of the German Minnesingers; many of the poets belonging like them
      to the highest nobility. Of all the Slavic nations, the Bohemian
      is the only one in which the flower of chivalry has ever unfolded
      itself; and the cause of its development here is doubtless to be
      sought in their occidental feudal system, and in their constant
      intercourse with the Germans. The natural tendency of the Polish
      nobility to heroic deeds and chivalrous adventures was
      counterbalanced, partly by the oriental character of their
      relation to the peasantry, which impressed on them at least as
      much of the character of the Asiatic satrap, as of the occidental
      knight; and partly by the want of a free middle class in Poland,
      as also in Russia. True chivalry indeed does not require simply
      the contrast of a low, helpless, and submissive class; its lustre
      never appears brighter than when placed side by side with an
      independent yeomanry.

    <p>
      In calling the Bohemian lyric poetry of this age the echo of the
      German, we do not mean to say it was wanting in originality; but
      wish rather to convey the idea, that the same spirit inspired at
      the time the Bohemians and the Germans, proceeding however from
      the latter, who themselves received it from the more romantic
      Provence. Of these heroic love-songs very few are left. There
      are, however, several productions of this period, in which the
      German influence is not to be recognized at all, but which
      exhibit purely Slavic national features. We will here
      enumerate<span class="newpage"><a name="page_160" id=
      "page_160">[pg.160]</a></span> the monuments of the Bohemian
      language from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which have
      been preserved, before we pass to the fourteenth, which was more
      productive and exhibited in some measure a new character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most remarkable is the above-mentioned manuscript of
      Königinhof. It contains, besides several epic songs partly
      complete and partly fragmentary, seven or eight charming lyric
      pieces. The near relationship of the Slavic nations among each
      other, is exhibited in no feature more strikingly than in their
      national popular poetry, especially in the little lyric songs,
      the immediate effusion of their feelings, wishes, and cares;
      whilst epic poetry, which draws her materials from the external
      world, must hence, in every nation, be in some measure modified
      by their different fortunes and situations. With the exception of
      this manuscript and a few scattered love-songs and tales, all we
      have from this early period is of a religious character, viz. a
      fragment of a history of Christ's passion in rhymes, another of a
      legend of the twelve apostles, and a hymn on the merits of the
      Bohemian patron saint, Wenceslaus. There is also a complete
      Psalter in Bohemian, with a whole series of hymns, or rather
      rhymed formularies, corresponding to those sung in the catholic
      church, viz a <i>Te Deum,</i>, an office for the dead, a prayer
      for the intercession of all saints, etc. A piece in prose,
      entitled "The complaint of a lover on the banks of the Moldau," a
      very rare appearance in those early times, was formerly
      considered as genuine, on the authority of Linde and Dobrovsky;
      but has since been proved to be spurious. The first historians of
      Bohemia, Cosmas and Vincentius, born towards the middle of the
      eleventh century, wrote both of them in Latin. The chronicle of
      the first is still extant.

      During the fourteenth century the German influence increased so
      much, that the jealousy and impatience of a great part of the
      nation was powerfully excited. The king kept a German body guard;
      German fashions in dress and manners prevailed at the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">[pg.161]</a></span>
      court; and even in the year 1341, when the privileges of the city
      of Prague were first solemnly committed to writing, it was done
      in the German language. Under the reign of Charles I, or the
      emperor Charles IV, for he united the two crowns on his head,
      Bohemia, as we have said, reached the highest point of its
      splendour. He wisely limited the privileges of the Germans in his
      own kingdom; and reconciled the minds of the Bohemians by
      granting to them similar privileges in the German empire. He
      honoured the Bohemian language so much as to recommend expressly,
      in the golden bull, to the sons of the Electors to learn it. His
      capital, Prague, was like the apple of his eye; and he did all he
      could to add to its embellishments and magnificence. Here he
      founded in the year 1348 the first Slavic university, on the plan
      of those of Paris and Bologna. The influence of this institution,
      not merely on Bohemia, but on Germany and indeed all Europe, was
      decided. From the time of its foundation until 1410, it was the
      general resort for students from among the Poles, Hungarians,
      Swedes, and Germans. It was doubtless the wish to give it this
      very kind of universality, which induced Charles IV, in the
      statutes of the institution, to allow to the Bohemians only one
      suffrage in the senate, and the three others to foreigners. We
      shall show in the sequel, with what jealousy this apparent
      preference was received by the natives, and what a violent
      reaction it caused in the Bohemian national feelings.

      Experience every where teaches, that schools and academies never
      enkindle the spark of genuine poetry; nay, that the erection of
      formal scientific institutions is even not favourable to the free
      developement of that high gift. In Bohemia, too, the fourteenth
      century was indeed very productive in rhymed works; but most of
      them were utterly deficient in real poetry. On the other hand, as
      the natural result of a more strictly logical and clearer mode of
      thinking, by reason of a scientific education, the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">[pg.162]</a></span>
      style of the prose writings became more cultivated, concise, and
      distinct; and the direction of mind more general and universal.
      We find in this period several historical works, viz. (1) A
      chronicle in Bohemian rhymes, extending as far as to 1313, and
      finished about the year 1318, written under king John the father
      of Charles IV, when the influence of the German had reached its
      highest point. A glowing hatred against that nation dictated this
      work, and made it for more than two hundred years the favourite
      book of the Bohemian people. The name of the author is not
      ascertained, although it has been usually ascribed to the canon
      Dalimil Mezericky.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id=
      "FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_166_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> (2) Another Bohemian
      chronicle, written by order of Charles IV in Latin, but
      translated into Bohemian by Przibik Pulkawa. It was first
      published by Prochazka in the year 1786; the Latin original in
      1794. (3) Martimiani or the Roman chronicle, translated A.D. 1400
      from the German, by Benesh of Horowic. (4) Another chronicle of
      the Roman emperors, translated from the Latin by Laurentius of
      Brezow, the writer of several other works, some of which were
      printed in the course of the following centuries.&mdash;There
      were also several collections of laws; among others the oldest
      Bohemian statutes, by A. of Duba, a valuable manuscript,
      preserved in the imperial library of Vienna; the common and the
      feudal law, translated from the Latin and kept in the library of
      Prague; the celebrated <i>Sachsenspiegel</i> or laws of
      Magdeburg, etc. The constant intercourse with foreigners directed
      the attention of the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_163" id=
      "page_163">[pg.163]</a></span> Bohemians early to the utility of
      acquiring other languages, and made the possession of their own
      valuable to foreigners. We find, consequently, not less than
      seven dictionaries, or vocabularies as they were called, compiled
      in the course of this century; one of which, the
      <i>Bohemarius</i> so called of A.D. 1309, is even written in
      hexameters. As all these vocabularies are incomplete, and better
      ones, founded partly upon them, have been since compiled, they
      have never, so far as we know, been printed; but are extant in
      several copies, and are preserved in the libraries of Prague,
      Brünn, and several churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetry, during this century, took also in Bohemia the same course
      as in Germany, and degenerated into loose works of fiction
      between prose and verse, mostly allegorical compositions, and the
      basis of the modern novel. Such are Tristram, in 9000 verses, a
      translation from the German; the life of Alexander and the
      History of Troy from the Latin, both of them more novel than
      history; and a great number of similar works.<a name=
      "FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_167_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> Some fragments of an
      heroic epic, entitled "The Bohemian Alexander," have been
      recently found in the archives of Budweis by Professor Kaubek,
      and published in the Journal of the Museum. All the other
      poetical productions of this century may be divided into fables,
      satires, and legends, or other allegorical pieces of an
      ecclesiastico-didactic tendency, as may be seen even from
      their<span class="newpage"><a name="page_164" id=
      "page_164">[pg.164]</a></span> titles; e.g. the Nine Joys of
      Mary, the Ten Commandments, the Five Sources of Sin, etc. All are
      equally deficient in poetical merit.

      With what thoughts the minds of reflecting men and of the reading
      class were at this time chiefly occupied, and how well they were
      prepared to receive, in the beginning of the following century,
      the doctrines of Huss, Jerome, and Jacobellus, those teachers of
      a purer system of divinity, is manifested in some measure in the
      theological literature of the day. A treatise upon the great
      distress of the church, written by a clergyman called John
      Miliez, before 1370;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id=

      principal Christian virtues; a book of Christian instruction
      written by Shtitny, a Bohemian nobleman, for his own children; a
      translation of the Jewish Rabbi Samuel's book on the coming of
      the Messiah; and several similar works,&mdash;all these seem to
      indicate that the religious system of the day was no longer able
      to satisfy reflecting minds. We find also that a great part of
      the Bible was already extant in the Bohemian language in the
      second half of the fourteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_169_169"

      in the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_165" id=

      SECOND PERIOD.
    </h4>

      At the commencement of the fifteenth century, the university of
      Prague was in the zenith of its splendour. Several celebrated
      German scholars occupied the professors' chairs, and the average
      number of students was twenty thousand. No department of science
      was neglected; each faculty had its distinguished teachers; but
      it was theology which excited decidedly the warmest national
      interest among the Bohemians themselves; it was theology in which
      the Bohemians maintained the first rank as teachers. The interest
      in spiritual things was no longer confined, as in former times,
      to those who intended to devote themselves to the clerical
      profession; it pervaded all classes, high and low. Immediately
      after Wickliffe's death, an intercourse had been opened between
      England and Bohemia by the marriage of a Bohemian princess, Ann,
      sister of king Wenceslaus, to Richard II of England. A young
      Bohemian nobleman, who had finished his studies in Prague,
      repaired to Oxford, imbibed the sentiments and opinions of
      Wickliffe, and on his return put a copy of all Wickliffe's
      writings into the hands of John Huss, at that time one of the
      professors of theology at Prague; whose mind was probably already
      prepared for them, and who began to study them with great zeal
      and devotion. Indeed, the pretensions of the chair of Rome, and
      the corruption of the clergy, had been for some time since looked
      upon in Bohemia with private disgust and open disapprobation; and
      when the professors Huss,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_166"
      id="page_166">[pg.166]</a></span> Jerome, and Jacobellus, began
      to declaim against monks, auricular confession, and the
      infallibility of the pope, they found a responding echo in the
      breasts of their hearers; and all that was novel in their
      doctrines, was the boldness with which they were pronounced, and
      the logical consistency with which they were justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another difference of opinion, which tended greatly to augment
      the excitement then reigning at the university, was the contest
      between the two philosophical schools, viz. that of the Realists,
      who were defended by Huss, and the Nominalists, to which nearly
      all the Germans adhered. This contest became very soon a national
      affair; or, more probably, had its principal origin in the unjust
      privileges of the Germans and the jealousy of the Bohemians. The
      preference given to the former at the foundation of the
      university, viz. the possession of three out of the four
      suffrages in all matters determined by vote, became anew the
      subject of debate, and was more especially assailed by Huss, then
      rector of the university. After a whole year of resistance, the
      king at length yielded. A decree of A.D. 1409 ordained that in
      future the proportion should be reversed, so that the Germans
      should possess only one suffrage, and the Bohemians three. For
      this victory of their national pride, the university, the city,
      nay the whole country, had to suffer severely. Immediately after
      this decision, the famous literary emigration took place. All the
      German professors and students left Prague at once. The immediate
      consequences of this step were, the foundation of the
      universities of Leipzig, Rostock, and Ingolstadt; and the
      building up of those of Heidelberg, Erfurt, and Cracow. Prague
      never again became what it had been; although it obtained a
      transient lustre through the victory itself, and the eminence and
      martyrdom of some of its national teachers. Before we proceed, we
      must devote a few words to the personal merits and fortunes of
      these latter.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_167" id=
      "page_167">[pg.167]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      John Huss was born A.D. 1373, at Hussinecz, a village in the
      southern part of Bohemia; from which he sometimes took the name
      of Huss of Hussinecz, or John of Hussinecz. Although without
      property himself, he was enabled, at the age of sixteen years, by
      the pecuniary assistance of the proprietor of his native village
      and some other patrons, to prosecute his studies at the
      university of Prague, where he distinguished himself by his
      abilities and diligence. In the year 1396 he was made Master of
      Arts, and two years later began to lecture on philosophical and
      theological subjects. In A.D. 1402 he was appointed curate and
      preacher to the chapel of Bethlehem at Prague, the duties of
      which office he united with his professorship. In the same year
      the queen Sophia chose him for her confessor. He thus at once
      acquired an influence over the people, the students, and at
      court. It was about this time that he became acquainted with the
      writings of Wickliffe. In the year 1407 he began publicly to
      oppose and preach against the errors in doctrine and the
      corruption then reigning in the church. The archbishop of Prague,
      Zbyniek, an illiterate and violent man, whose ignorance had made
      him the laughing-stock of the students, by whom he was called the
      <i>Alphabetarius</i>, or ABC doctor, collected two hundred
      manuscripts of Wickliffc's writings; and, without any further
      authority from the pope than his previous condemnation of them,
      committed them to the flames in the archiepiscopal palace. Huss,
      both in his lectures and sermons, not only blamed this act in
      strong terms; but translated the <i>Trilogus</i> and several
      other of Wickliffc's works into Bohemian, distributed them among
      laymen and females, and caused new Latin copies to be made. When
      the archbishop interdicted his preaching in the Bohemian
      language, Huss not only refused to obey, but continued to spread,
      by all legal means, those doctrines of Wickliffe which he
      approved. At the same time the first translation of the whole
      Bible&mdash;whether a collection of the parts already extant, or
      a new version, we are<span class="newpage"><a name="page_168" id=
      "page_168">[pg.168]</a></span> not informed&mdash;appeared, and
      was distributed in multiplied copies among the public. It is not
      known whether this translation was prepared by Huss; but it is
      certain that he did what he could to promote its circulation. On
      such proceedings the Romish clergy could not look with
      tranquillity. Twice he was called to Rome; twice he disobeyed;
      and at length appealed to a general council. In consequence of
      his doctrines, and of some tumultuous scenes among his followers,
      the excess of which he himself highly disapproved, he was by a
      decree of pope John XXIII solemnly expelled from the communion of
      the church. Deeming himself no longer safe at Prague under the
      weak king, he retired to the territory of his friend and patron,
      Nicholas of Hussinecz, where he prepared new works, some of which
      are among his most powerful ones, and preached repeatedly in the
      open fields before an innumerable audience. Those of his works
      which caused the greatest sensation, were his treatise 'On the
      Church,' and a pamphlet entitled 'The Six Errors;' both of which
      he caused to be fixed on the walls and gates of the chapel of
      Bethlehem. Both were directed against indulgences, against the
      abuse of excommunication, simony, transubstantiation, and the
      like; and, above all, against the unlimited obedience required by
      the see of Rome; maintaining that the Scriptures presented the
      only rule of faith and conduct for the Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of this conviction, the correction and
      distribution of the Bohemian Bible was his constant care. In all
      his Bohemian writings he paid an uncommon attention to the
      language, and exerted a decided and lasting influence on it. The
      old Bohemian alphabet, which consisted of forty-two letters, he
      arranged anew; and first settled the Bohemian orthography
      according to fixed principles.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id=
      "FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_170_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> In order to render it
      more<span class="newpage"><a name="page_169" id=
      "page_169">[pg.169]</a></span> interesting and impressive to
      learners, he imitated Cyril's ingenious mode of giving to each
      letter the name of some well-known Bohemian word, which had the
      same initial letter, e.g. H, <i>hospodin</i>, lord; K,
      <i>kral</i>, king, etc. Thus he devoted his whole life to the
      different means of enlightening his countrymen; and justly
      considered a general cultivation of the mind as the best
      preparation for receiving the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the coadjutors of Huss, the most distinguished was
      Hieronymus von Faulfisch, more generally known under the name of
      Jerome of Prague; who was, like Huss, professor in the
      university. In erudition and eloquence he surpassed his friend;
      he accorded with him in his doctrinal views; but did not possess
      the mild disposition, the moderation of conduct, for which Huss
      was distinguished. His hatred against the abuses of the Romish
      church was so violent, that he used to trample under his feet the
      relics regarded as holy by that church. He is even said to have
      once ordered a monk who resisted him, to be thrown into the
      river. He was so great an admirer of Wickliffe, several of whose
      writings he translated into Bohemian, that even when preaching
      before the emperor at Buda, he could not but interweave that
      reformer's doctrines in his sermons; an imprudence which caused
      him to be arrested immediately afterwards at Vienna. He obtained
      his liberty in consequence of the solicitation of the university
      of Prague. He wrote several works in the Bohemian language, for
      the instruction of the people,<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_170" id="page_170">[pg.170]</a></span> hymns, pamphlets,
      etc. His reputation for erudition and extraordinary powers rests,
      however, more on the testimony of his cotemporaries, than on his
      works, of which very few remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another active assistant of Huss, especially in his improvement
      and distribution of the Bohemian Bible, was Jacobellus of Mies,
      known under the name Jacobellus of the [sacramental] Cup, on
      account of his zeal for the general introduction of the communion
      in both forms. He wrote commentaries on some of the epistles,
      sermons, religious hymns, etc. He too was a professor in the
      university of Prague.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1414 Huss was summoned to appear before the Council
      of Constance, to exculpate himself before the united theologians
      of all the Christian nations of Europe. Without the least
      reluctance, and rather with rejoicing at the opportunity of
      justifying himself from the extravagant charges brought against
      him by his enemies, and of demonstrating publicly the truth of
      his doctrines, he obeyed this call. Provided with a safe conduct
      from the emperor Sigismund, and accompanied moreover by several
      Bohemian noblemen at the express order of king Wenceslaus, he
      undertook the journey without fear for his personal safety, and
      arrived on the fourth of November at Constance. Here, before he
      was permitted to appear in the presence of the general Council,
      he had to undergo several private audiences before a few
      cardinals; at one of which, about three weeks after his arrival,
      he was arrested, cast into prison, and without being tried or
      even heard, kept more than <i>six months</i>. When the news of
      this treachery reached Bohemia, it was felt by the whole people
      as a national insult. Three petitions, signed by nearly the whole
      body of the nobility, were in the course of time successively
      tendered to the Council; and as the two first were without avail,
      the third was accompanied by one to the emperor, in which he was
      reminded of his broken word, in terms so strong,&mdash;he having
      pledged his imperial honour for the safety of
      Huss,&mdash;that<span class="newpage"><a name="page_171" id=
      "page_171">[pg.171]</a></span> at length the 5th of June was
      fixed for a public hearing. Here however every attempt of Huss,
      not merely to justify himself, but even to speak, was frustrated
      by the most indecent and tumultuous clamour of the assembled
      clergy, who loaded him with invectives and reproaches. In the two
      following audiences he was indeed allowed a hearing, at the
      special demand of the emperor, who had been disgusted and
      offended by the indecent behaviour of the Council. Huss was now
      permitted to justify himself at large upon all the forty articles
      brought against him, most of them founded on his writings by the
      frequent aid of the most unfair deduction; but although he
      exculpated himself completely from some of the charges, yet he
      himself acknowledged so many others, that the Council could only
      be confirmed in its previous determination to condemn him as an
      obstinate heretic. A month was allowed him, to give in his final
      answer. During this time cardinals and bishops tried their
      eloquence to persuade him to recant; especially at the
      instigation of the emperor, who wished to save his life on
      account of his own pledged honour. But all these efforts could
      not move the faith nor firmness of this pious and heroic man; and
      on the 6th of July, A.D. 1415, he was unanimously condemned,
      ignominiously degraded from the office of a priest, and burned
      alive the same day. His ashes were thrown into the Rhine.<a name=

      His friend Jerome of Prague, on hearing of his dangerous
      situation, hurried to Constance, to assist and support him,
      without even waiting for a safe conduct from the emperor or
      Council. In the vicinity of Constance he stopped, and tried all
      possible means to obtain some assurance for his personal safety.
      Not succeeding in this, he felt himself compelled by prudence to
      return, although slowly and reluctantly, to Bohemia. But on the
      road, in consequence of a dispute in which he became engaged with
      some bigoted priests, he was arrested by the duke of Salzbach and
      sent to Constance, where the same scenes were repeated before the
      Council, as in the case of Huss. At his first appearance, a
      thousand voices exclaimed: Away with him! burn him, burn him! It
      is most melancholy to read in the reports of the time, that even
      this strong and pious man could have been terrified into
      temporary submission; not by the prospect of death, which he met
      gladly, but by the horrors of a lonely and protracted
      imprisonment in a noxious dungeon. But his fortitude did not long
      abandon him; tortured by his own conscience, he solemnly
      announced at the next audience his recantation; and declared,
      that of all the sins he had committed, he repented of none more
      than his apostasy from the doctrines he had maintained. In
      consequence of this he was subjected to the same condemnation as
      his illustrious friend; and met his painful death with the same
      magnanimity and resignation. He was burnt the 30th of May, 1416.

      The behaviour of both these eminent men; the Christian mildness
      with which they bore the infamous treatment of their enemies; the
      generosity with which they forgave their persecutors; the
      patience, nay cheerfulness of Huss, when during his imprisonment
      severe bodily sufferings united with the persecutions of his
      adversaries to make his life a heavy burden; the magnanimity and
      fortitude with which both of them submitted to their final fate,
      and maintained the truth of their religious opinions<span class=

      until the very moment of an excruciating death, praising the Lord
      with soul and voice; all this presents one of the most affecting
      and at the same time elevating pictures which the history of
      martyrs has to exhibit. The eloquence of Jerome made a powerful
      impression on his enemies; and there were some moments during his
      trial, when even his judges wished to save his life. The
      celebrated Poggio Bracciolini, one of the revivers of Italian
      literature, happened to be present at the trial and execution of
      Jerome; and although not agreeing with him, or rather being
      indifferent in point of religion, the eloquence, magnanimity and
      amiable deportment of the unfortunate martyr, excited his
      sympathy and admiration in an uncommon degree. This is manifested
      in his letters to Leonardo Aretius; who in his reply found it
      advisable to warn his friend, not to show too much warmth in this
      matter.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id=

      The instigators of these cruel acts, when they kindled the
      faggots by which these two martyrs died, did not anticipate that
      the fire they had lighted would spread over a whole country, and
      carry horror and devastation through the half of Germany. The war
      by which the disciples of Huss avenged him, was one of the most
      bloody and destructive known in history. The news of his death,
      when it reached Bohemia, touched the heart of every individual
      like an electric spark. But this is not our province. Keeping
      only our own object, the fate of the language and literature in
      view, we must refer the reader to the historical accounts of this
      distressing period, and limit ourselves to the mention of those
      events only, which had an immediate influence on these two
      topics.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_174" id=

    <p>
      Under the guidance of Nicholas of Hussineccz, the friend and
      patron of Huss, in whom even his enemies acknowledged more a
      defender of the Reformers, than a persecutor of the Catholics; of
      Zhizhka of Trocznow, a Bohemian knight of great valour, but
      disgraced by cruelty; and, after the death of these two, under
      Procopius, formerly a clergyman; the Hussites carried their
      victorious arms throughout all Bohemia, into Silesia, Franconia,
      Austria, and Saxony; and made these unhappy countries the theatre
      of the most cruel devastations. If, divided into several parties,
      as they were, they were thus powerful, they would have been twice
      as strong, had they been united in the true spirit of Huss. But
      even as early as A.D. 1421 dissensions arose among them; and they
      finally split into several sects and parties, who mutually hated
      each other even more than they did the Romanists. Among these the
      Calixtins or Utraquists, whose principal object was to obtain the
      sacrament in both forms; and the Taborites, who insisted on a
      complete reform of the church; were the two principal. The
      Calixtins comprehended the more moderate of the nobility and the
      wealthy citizens of Prague; between them and the Romanists a
      compact was concluded at Basle, in A.D. 1434, by which a
      conditional religious liberty was granted to them, and they
      acknowledged the emperor Sigismund as their sovereign; the weak
      king Wenceslaus having died in 1419. The Taborites were unable to
      resist any longer the united power of both parties. They partly
      dispersed; the rest united in the year 1457, in separate
      communities, and called themselves United Brethren. Under the
      severest trials of oppression and persecution, the number of
      these congregations, the form of which was modelled after the
      primitive apostolic churches, rose in less than fifty years to
      two hundred. In the middle of the sixteenth century, numerous
      emigrations to Prussia and Poland took place, where a free
      toleration was secured to them. In the beginning of the
      seventeenth century, their communities in Bohemia were
      finally<span class="newpage"><a name="page_175" id=
      "page_175">[pg.175]</a></span> dissolved. From the remnant of
      these persecuted Christians, who were called by the Germans,
      Bohemian or Moravian Brethren, has sprung the present community
      of United Brethren, often called in English, Moravians, which was
      founded at Hernhut in 1722, at first under the protection and
      ultimately under the patronage and direction of count Zinzendorf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences of the barbarous measures of the Council of
      Constance became immediately visible. Even the common people
      began to show an intense interest in the numberless theological
      pamphlets, which were published in Bohemia and Moravia for or
      against Huss. Among the former, one written by a female deserves
      to be distinguished. The copies of the Bohemian Bible became
      greatly multiplied; many of them were made by females: and Æneas
      Sylvius takes occasion to praise the biblical erudition of the
      women of the Taborites, whilst the abbot Stephen of Dolan in
      Moravia complains of their meddling in ecclesiastical affairs. In
      the revision of the text of the Bohemian Scriptures, the clergy
      were indefatigable. From 1410 to 1488, when the Bible was first
      printed, at least four recensions of the whole Bible can be
      distinguished, and several more of the New Testament. The
      different parties of the Hussites were united in a warm
      partiality for their own language; the Taborites began as early
      as 1423 to hold their service in Bohemian. After the compact of
      1434, the Calixtins also attempted to introduce the mass in their
      own language, an innovation which caused new disturbances and
      contests. Meanwhile the language of the country assumed gradually
      even among the Romanists its natural rights; the privileges of
      the city of Prague, the laws of the painters' guild, the statutes
      of the miners, were translated into Bohemian. At the session of
      the Estates in Moravia in 1480, the Latin was exchanged for the
      Bohemian; in Bohemia itself not before 1495. The knowledge of the
      Bohemian language, which Albert duke of Bavaria had acquired at
      the court of king Wenceslaus, where he<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">[pg.176]</a></span>
      was educated, had a decided influence on the Bohemian Estates,
      when in 1441 they offered him their crown. Under George
      Podiebrad, diebrad, a Bohemian by birth, this language even
      became that of the court. After the death of George, one of the
      reasons which led to the election of Vladislaus, king of Poland,
      was, that the Bohemians "could hope to see elevated through him
      the glory of the Bohemian nation and of the Slavic language."
      <a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_173_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> Under this king all
      ordinances and decrees were issued in the Bohemian language,
      which gained prodigiously in pliancy and extent by the
      application of it to different uses. The most favourable
      influence on its formation, however, was effected towards the
      close of the fifteenth century, by the custom which began to
      prevail of studying the classics, and of translating them with
      all the fidelity of which the idiom was capable. Thus fostered by
      judicious application and patriotic feeling, the Bohemian
      language approached, with rapid steps, the period of its
      <i>golden age</i>,&mdash;a time, indeed, in a political respect,
      of oppression, war, and devastation; but affording a gratifying
      proof, how powerfully moral means may counteract physical causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the theological literature of this period may be
      named the Life of Huss, written by P. Mladienowicz. Although,
      strictly speaking, not a theological book, yet this character was
      in some measure impressed upon it by the custom which prevailed
      for a time, of causing it to be read aloud in the churches, in
      order to communicate to the people all the circumstances of the
      martyr's death. Mladienowicz, acting as a notary at Constance,
      had been an eye-witness of the whole transaction. Among the
      Romish theological writers of the day, Hilarius Litomierzicky,
      ob. 1467, Rosenberg bishop of Breslau, Simon of Tishnow, and
      others, wrote against the practice of communion in both forms.
      But they were inferior to their adversaries in talent, and
      still<span class="newpage"><a name="page_177" id=
      "page_177">[pg.177]</a></span> more in productiveness. Rokycana,
      archbishop of the Calixtins, ob. 1471, Koranda, Mirosh, and
      others, defended their right to the sacramental cup; and exerted
      their pens in doctrinal controversies with the other sects. The
      Bohemian Brethren, Paleczek, Procopius, Simon, Mirzinsky, and
      others, wrote interpretations of portions of the Scriptures,
      polemical pamphlets, religious hymns, apologies, and the like,
      partly printed, and partly preserved in manuscript. In the
      contests of the different parties, the use of weapons of every
      description was regarded as lawful; and among them, satire and
      irony were employed with much skill and dexterity by the
      Hussites.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id=
      "FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_174_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> Uricz of Kalcnicz wrote
      a satirical letter from Lucifer to Lew of Rozhmital. Bohuslav of
      Czechticz partly wrote and partly compiled the work, "Mirror of
      all Christendom," with many remarkable illustrations.<a name=
      "FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_175_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> The Bohemian brother,
      Chelcicky, ob. 1484, called also the Bohemian doctor, because he
      did not understand Latin, and of course neither Greek nor Hebrew,
      undertook, nevertheless, besides several other works, to write an
      interpretation of the Sunday Lessons of the Gospels. His most
      popular book, called <i>Kopyta</i>, i.e. "The Shoe-last," (being
      himself a shoemaker by trade,) which was much read by the common
      people, is no longer extant. A pamphlet of Martin Lupacz, ob.
      1468, called "The Sprinkling-brush," was likewise in the hands of
      every body. This<span class="newpage"><a name="page_178" id=
      "page_178">[pg.178]</a></span> clergyman, however, acquired
      better claims on the gratitude of his cotemporaries, by a careful
      revision of the New Testament, which he undertook with the aid of
      several learned friends. Indeed, both among clergymen and laymen,
      there was an ardent desire for the right understanding of the
      Scriptures; which induced many individuals, who were not
      satisfied with the existing Bohemian translations, to undertake
      the task themselves anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of this period alone the manuscripts of thirty-three copies
      of the whole Bible, and twenty-two of the New Testament, are
      still extant; partly copied from each other, partly translated
      anew; all, however, having been made from the Vulgate.<a name=
      "FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_176_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> The Bohemian versions
      made from the original languages belong to the following period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although religion filled the minds of the learned during this
      period more than in any other, it did not absorb their interest
      so entirely as to occupy them exclusively. It could not, however,
      be expected, that in the midst of such struggles, both political
      and religious, the minds of men could elevate themselves so far
      above their circumstances, as to look at any science or art in
      the light of its independent value. Poetry, at least, with a few
      exceptions, was only regarded as the handmaid of religion. We
      find many books of legends, biographies of the fathers and
      saints, both prose and rhyme, written partly by Romish, partly by
      Hussite writers. The doctrines of Huss did not, like those of
      Luther a century later, shake the belief in saints. Dobrovsky
      mentions a very ancient printed work of 1480, in which the
      letters of Huss,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_179" id=
      "page_179">[pg.179]</a></span> his life by Mladionowicz, and the
      letter of Poggio on the execution of Jerome, are annexed to a
      <i>Passional</i>, as such collections of the lives and sufferings
      of the saints are called. There is also an abundance of Taboritic
      war-songs; many of them replete with life and fire. These appear
      to have been partly founded on ancient Bohemian popular songs;
      for there are passages in them which are also to be found in the
      old chronicles. Altered to suit the existing circumstances, their
      effect must have been the more powerful by association. This
      period was also rich in religious hymns; most of them translated
      from the Bible as literally as the rhyme would permit. But no
      form of poetry was more used, and none operated more strongly on
      the minds of the people, than the satirical ballads, with which
      the streets and alleys every where resounded. All these
      productions are only remarkable, as characteristic memorials of
      the age. Hynck of Podiebrad, fourth son of king George, who was
      born A.D. 1452, a highly accomplished and amiable man, is named
      as one of the most distinguished among the Bohemian poets of the
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politics, too, united with religion. Stibor of Cimburg, a
      patriotic and distinguished nobleman, wrote in 1467 an ingenious
      work in the form of a novel, "On the goods of the Clergy;"
      Waleczowsky wrote on the vices and hypocrisy of the clergy; and
      Zidek, in 1471, instructions on government. All these books were
      dedicated to king George, and the latter work was even written at
      his instigation. Hagck of Hodielin, and Wlezek, between 1413 and
      1457, wrote strategetical works. Marco Polo's description of the
      East, and Mandeville's Travels, were translated from the Latin.
      Kabatnik, J. Lobkowicz, and Bakalarz, wrote descriptions of
      Palestine between 1490 and 1500; the two first in books of
      travels. Mezyhor wrote a journal of the travels of Lew of
      Rozhmital, whom he accompanied as jester through Europe and a
      part of Asia. Collections of statutes, of the decrees of diets,
      of judicial decisions, and of other documents, were made
      by<span class="newpage"><a name="page_180" id=
      "page_180">[pg.180]</a></span> patriotic and sometimes eminent
      men; and those merely extant in Latin were carefully translated
      into Bohemian.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id=
      "FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_177_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> Thus they gathered
      materials for future historians, although in their own day the
      field of history was but poorly cultivated, or at least with no
      more than common ability; for, as to quantity, there is no want.
      Procopius, following out the example of Dalimil, wrote a new
      rhymed chronicle; Bartosh of Drahenicz wrote a chronicle
      extending from 1419 to 1443, in barbarous Latin, to which he
      added some notes in Bohemian. Several other chronicles, the
      authors of which are not known, serve as continuations of those
      of the preceding century, which were devoted to the affairs of
      their own country. The above-mentioned Zidck, on the other hand,
      undertook to write a universal history, after the division of
      time then customary, into six ages. This book forms the third
      part of his great work, "Instructions on Government," to which we
      have above alluded. In this work the author seizes every
      opportunity to lecture the king, to give him advice, and to
      rebuke him. According to Dobrovsky, his boldness not unfrequently
      degenerates into coarseness and insolence. It is an amusing
      reproach, which among others he brings against the king, that he
      had net one camel, whilst Job had six thousand. The same
      individual wrote also a large work in Latin, a kind of
      Cyclopædia, the manuscript of which is in the library of the
      university of Cracow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We finish the history of this period with a short account of the
      state of medicine and natural sciences in Bohemia. It is true,
      that the greater part of the learned men who wrote on these
      subjects, preferred the use of the Latin language. But many
      of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_181" id=
      "page_181">[pg.181]</a></span> them were in the habit of making
      at least Bohemian extracts or abridgments of their most popular
      works, or sometimes had the whole of them translated by their
      pupils. Among the medical writers of this time, Christian
      Prachatitzky a clergyman, John Czerny and Claudian Bohemian
      brethren, Albik, and Gallus, must be mentioned; the two latter
      wrote only in Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section of the Bohemian literature is particularly rich in
      herbals. Several works of instruction in botany were also
      written. A manuscript of 1447, "On the inoculation of Trees," may
      be mentioned here, although belonging rather to the department of
      agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian language, although improving and evidently rising in
      esteem with every lustrum of the fifteenth century, had however
      not yet supplanted the Latin. Many of the most eminent among the
      learned of this period preferred still to write in Latin: as
      Hieronymus Balbus, Bohuslav, Hassenstein of Lobkowic, Shlechta,
      Olomucius, and a number of others; who all contributed
      nevertheless to elevate the glory of the Bohemian name, and could
      not but exert a powerful influence on the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In respect to the date of the introduction of printing into
      Bohemia, the first regular printing establishment at Prague is
      not older than A.D. 1487. Several Bohemian books, however, were
      printed before this time by travelling workmen. In regard to the
      first work printed in the Bohemian language historians are not
      entirely agreed. According to Jungmann,<a name="FNanchor_178_178"
      id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_178_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> a letter from Huss to
      Jakaubek, of 1459. was the first specimen of Bohemian printing;
      the above-mentioned chronicle of Troy of 1468 the second; and the
      New Testament of 1475 the third. According to Dobrovsky, the New
      Testament of 1475 is the earliest printed<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">[pg.182]</a></span>
      work in Bohemian. From that year to 1488, only seven Bohemian
      works appear to have been issued from the press; among which was
      a Psalter and another New Testament. In 1488, after the
      foundation of a regular printing office, the whole Bohemian Bible
      was printed for the first time; in the same year the History of
      Troy again, and the Roman chronicle; and in the following year
      the first Bohemian almanac, and the Bible of Kuttenberg. The
      subsequent editions belong, as to time, to the following period;
      but are given in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id=

      <i>Golden age of the Bohemian Literature. From the diffusion of

      It is chiefly for the sake of clearness and convenience, that
      writers on the literary history of Bohemia separate this period
      from the former; in its character and its genius it was entirely
      the same. What the Bohemians had <i>acquired</i> in the one,
      they<span class="newpage"><a name="page_183" id=
      "page_183">[pg.183]</a></span> <i>possessed</i> in the other;
      what they had only aimed at in the former, they reached in the
      latter; what had been the property of a few, was now augmented by
      an abundant harvest in their diligent hands, and enriched a
      multitude. But the objects, the stamp, the character, of both
      centuries were essentially the same. Literary cultivation, which
      during the sixteenth century was every where else monopolized by
      the clergy and a few distinguished individuals, was now in
      Bohemia the common property of the people; who for the most part
      embraced the evangelical doctrines in their manifold, though but
      little differing shades. But although religion was to them the
      object of chief interest, it was yet far from occupying their
      minds exclusively. And this is the point, in which the history of
      the Bohemian Reformation materially differs from that of some
      other countries. Luther's elevated mind did not indeed give room
      to narrow prejudices against those flowers of life, with which a
      kind Creator has adorned this earth. But almost all the other
      Reformers were led, either by a one-sided zeal or by
      circumstances, to show themselves decidedly opposed to the
      cultivation of elegant literature and the fine arts; they
      destroyed or banished pictures, music, statuary, and every thing
      which they could in any way regard as worldly temptations to
      allure men from the only source of truth and knowledge; nay, they
      sometimes went so far as to look at science and art in themselves
      only in the light of handmaids to religion; and to deem a
      devotion to them without such reference, as sinful worldliness.
      Of such narrowness we do not find a trace in the fathers of the
      Bohemian Reformation, who were themselves men of high
      intellectual cultivation; and even their most zealous followers
      kept themselves nearly free from it. If, as we have seen in the
      preceding period, political, poetical, and religious subjects
      were merged in each other, it was only the necessary result of
      the confusion occasioned by the struggles of the time. Where one
      object is predominant, all others must naturally
      become<span class="newpage"><a name="page_184" id=
      "page_184">[pg.184]</a></span> subordinate; but wherever that
      which appears amiable only as the free tendency of the whole
      soul, is exacted as a duty, a spiritual despotism is to be
      feared; of which we find very little in the history of Bohemian
      literature. The classics never were studied with more attention
      and devotion, were never imitated with more taste. Italy, the
      cradle of fine arts, and then the seat of general cultivation,
      was never visited more frequently by the Bohemian nobility, than
      when three-fourths of the nation adhered to the Protestant
      Church. At the very time, too, when the Bohemian Protestants had
      to watch most closely their religious liberties, and to defend
      them against the encroachments of a treacherous court, they did
      not deem it a desertion of the cause of religion to unite with
      the same Romanists, whose theological doctrines they contested,
      in their labours in the fields of philology, astronomy, and
      natural philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extent of the Bohemian national literature increased during
      the sixteenth century so rapidly; the number of writers augmented
      so prodigiously; and the opportunities for literary cultivation
      presented to the reading public, by the multiplication of books
      through the press, became so frequent; that the difficulty of
      giving a condensed yet distinct picture of the time is greatly
      augmented. A sketch of the political situation of the country may
      serve as a back-ground, in order by its gloomy shades to render
      still brighter the light of a free mental development.

      After the death of George Podiebrad in 1471, the
      Bohemians&mdash;or rather the catholic party, after the pope had
      excommunicated this prince&mdash;elected Vladislaus, a Polish
      prince, for their king; who, like his son and successor Louis,
      united on his head the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia. The
      different evangelical denominations were during these reigns in
      some measure tolerated; except that from time to time a
      persecution of one or another sect broke out, and again after a
      year or two was<span class="newpage"><a name="page_185" id=
      "page_185">[pg.185]</a></span> dropped, when the minds of the
      community had become somewhat pacified. It is a melancholy truth
      for the evangelical Christian, that at this time the most violent
      persecutors were to be found among the Calixtins or Utraquists.
      During the first years of the sixteenth century, persecution was
      mostly directed against the United Brethren and their writings.
      The latter were burned; the former banished; until, driven from
      place to place, they found an asylum in the territory of some
      high-minded nobleman, where they established themselves anew; and
      then after some years perhaps a new persecution began. Of a more
      revolting and bloody description were the measures directed
      principally against the Lutherans in the years 1522-26; in which
      the most shocking tortures were employed, and several faithful
      Lutherans and Picardites were burned alive. During all this time
      the Romanists and Calixtins exercised a severe censorship; and it
      was ordained, that every individual who brought a newly printed
      book into the city of Prague, must submit it to the revision of
      the consistory. These laws, however, were no better observed than
      all similar ordinances, when directly in opposition to the spirit
      of the age. Meanwhile the Calixtins and Romanists, although
      writing against all others, had their own mutual contests. When,
      however, the former caused a new edition of the Bible to be
      printed in the year 1506,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id=
      "FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_180_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> it was unanimously
      adopted by the Roman Catholics also; who, as is amusing to
      observe, did not notice that a wood cut is appended to the sixth
      chapter of the Apocalypse, in which the pope is represented in
      the flames of hell.

      In the year 1526 king Louis died in the battle of
      Mohaez.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_186" id=

      According to a matrimonial treaty, he was succeeded by his
      brother-in-law Ferdinand, archduke of Austria and brother of the
      emperor Charles V. This prince was received by the Bohemians with
      reluctance as their king, and only on the condition, insisted on
      by the Estates, that he should subscribe the compact of Basle, by
      which their religious liberties were secured to them. So long as
      Ferdinand was occupied in Hungary against the Turks, all went
      well in Bohemia; but when, in the war which followed the league
      of Smalkalde (1547), the Protestants of this country refused to
      fight against their brethren, a new and unremitted persecution
      began against all, who could in any way be comprised under the
      name of <i>sectarians</i>. The compact of Basle was strictly only
      in favour of the Utraquists or Calixtins; the Lutherans and
      Taborites, or, as they were then called, United Brethren, as also
      the Picardites and Grubenheimer, were considered as <i>sects</i>,
      and did not belong to the indulged.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id=
      "FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href=

      churches were shut up; their preachers arrested; and all who did
      not prefer to exchange their religion for the Roman Catholic,
      were compelled to emigrate. The scene altered under Maximilian
      II, Ferdinand's successor, a friend of the Reformation, and in
      every respect one of the most excellent princes who ever took
      upon himself the responsibility of directing the destinies of a
      nation; to use Schaffarik's happy metaphor, the benefits of his
      administration fell on the field, which Ferdinand's strength had
      ploughed, like a mild and fertilizing rain. During his life, and
      the first ten years of his son Rudolph's reign, Bohemia was in
      peace: the different denominations were indulged; literature
      flourished, and the Bohemian language was at the summit of its
      glory. But we regret to add, that the Protestants, instead of
      improving this fortunate period by uniting to acquire a legal
      foundation for their church, instead of a mere indulgence
      depending on the will of the sovereign, lived in constant mutual
      warfare, and attempted only to supplant each other. An ordinance
      in 1586 against the Picardites, a name under which the Bohemian
      Brethren were then comprehended; and still more the strict
      censorship introduced in 1605; first aroused them to unite their
      strength against oppression; and in 1609 they compelled the
      emperor to subscribe the celebrated <i>Literæ Imperatoriæ</i>, or
      edict, by which full liberty in matters of religion was secured
      to them. During the rest of this period, the Protestants remained
      the ruling party. The university of Prague, by the side of which
      from A.D. 1556 another of the Jesuits existed, was by that treaty
      given entirely into their hands. This institution, although in
      consequence of the foundation of so many similar<span class=

      schools it never recovered completely from the shock it received
      in 1410, and though for more than a hundred years it had been
      decidedly on the decline, yet rose in reputation towards the
      middle of the sixteenth century; and among the professors who
      filled its chairs, there were always celebrated names. Among the
      schools of a less elevated rank, those of the Bohemian Brethren
      at Bunzlau, Prerow, and other places, were distinguished.
    </p>

      Rudolph was a great patron of literature and science; and was
      quite farourably disposed towards the Bohemian language. Nearly
      two hundred writers were numbered under his reign; and among
      these many ladies and gentlemen of his court, of which Tycho
      Brahe, Kepler, and other scientific foreigners were the chief
      ornaments. Zeal for the cultivation of their mother tongue,
      seemed to be the point in which all religious denominations in
      Bohemia united. But during this century, as in the preceding one,
      the language of the country existed only side by side with the
      Latin; which was still preferred by many, for the sake of a more
      general reputation. It became the chief object of other eminent
      men, to make their countrymen acquainted with the classics in a
      Bohemian dress; and to improve the language by a strict imitation
      of Latin and Greek forms. Among these a rich and noble citizen of
      Prague named George Hruby must be first named;<a name=
      "FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_182_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> also Pisecky, ob. 1511,
      who translated Isoerates' Epistle to Demonicus; Nicholas Konacz
      and Ulric of Welensky, the translators of Lucian; Krupsky, of
      Plutarch; Ginterod, of Xenophon's Cyropaedia. Kocyn, celebrated
      for his eloquence and<span class="newpage"><a name="page_189" id=
      "page_189">[pg.189]</a></span> other gifts, translated the
      ecclesiastical history of Eusebius and Cassiodorus; Orliczny, the
      Jewish wars of Josephus, several of the Latin classics, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we consider this general zeal for the cultivation of the
      language, it is a matter of surprise that the first Bohemian
      grammar should not be older than A.D. 1533. Its author was Benesh
      Optat, who also translated Erasmus' Paraphrase of the New
      Testament. Another grammar was published by Beneshowsky in 1577,
      a third by the Slovak Benedicti in 1603. But the individual to
      whom is justly assigned the chief merit in regard to the
      language, is Weleslawin, ob. 1599, professor of history in the
      university of Prague, and the proprietor of the greatest printing
      establishment in Bohemia. Partly by his own works, original and
      translated, and among these three dictionaries for different
      purposes; partly by the encouragement he gave to other writers,
      and the activity with which he caused works whether old or new
      deserving of a greater circulation, to be printed; he acquired a
      most powerful influence among his cotemporaries.

      The field however which was cultivated with the most diligence,
      was that of theology; and fortunately, during this whole period,
      with an equal measure of talent and zeal. The writings of the
      Bohemian Brethren, Thomas Prelavsky, Laurentius Krasonicky, and
      more especially of Lucas, belong partly to the former, partly to
      the present period. The latter was a most productive writer; and
      as being one of their best scholars, he was generally chosen to
      answer the charges made against the United Brethren, in learned
      and elaborate pamphlets.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id=
      "FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_183_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> Several of the
      productions of the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_190" id=
      "page_190">[pg.190]</a></span> Brethren, mentioned in the former
      period, were written and printed in the beginning of this. Among
      these in 1508, Procopius' question. "Whether it is right for a
      Christian to compel infidels or heretics to embrace the true
      faith?" is remarkable, as one of the earliest instances in which
      this position of intolerance was made the subject of public
      debate, or at least answered in the negative. In 1563 the New
      Testament was first translated directly from the Greek, by J.
      Blahoslav, another president of the Bohemian Brethren, a man of
      profound erudition. The first translation of the whole Bible from
      the original languages, did not take place until several years
      later. The first edition of this latter splendid work, for which
      the patriotic and pious baron John of Zherotin expressly founded
      a printing office in his castle of Kralicz in Moravia, and
      advanced money for all the necessary expenses, was printed in
      1579. This version is still considered, in respect to language,
      as a model; and in respect to typography, as unsurpassed. On the
      fidelity of the translation and the value of the commentary,
      Schaffarik remarks, that "they contain a great deal of that
      which, two hundred years later, the learned <i>coryphaei</i> of
      exegesis in our day have exhibited to the world as their own
      profound discoveries." The translators were Albert Nicolai, Lucas
      Helic, Joh. Aeneas, George Stryc, E. Coepolla, J. Ephraim, P.
      Jessenius, and J. Capito.&mdash;G. Stryc wrote also a good
      translation of the Psalms in rhyme, and several theological
      works. J. Wartowsky likewise translated the Old Testament from
      the Hebrew and left it in manuscript; but his version has never
      been published. Of his translation of Erasmus' Paraphrase of the
      Gospels, only that of the Gospel of Matthew has been printed.
      Among the Bohemian Brethren, Augusta surnamed Pileator, ob. 1572,
      Stranensky, the above-mentioned Blahoslav, Zamrsky, ob. 1592,
      were distinguished by great erudition. They and many others wrote
      voluminous works on theological subjects, e.g. biblical
      researches, systematic divinity, sermons, etc. Several of these
      writers, and<span class="newpage"><a name="page_191" id=
      "page_191">[pg.191]</a></span> also many others, were authors of
      numerous religious hymns; among which not a few are still
      considered as unsurpassed in any language. Nicholas Klaudian, who
      was at the same time physician, printer, and theologian, wrote an
      apology in favour of the Brethren. This individual, who, besides
      being the printer and editor of several medical works written by
      himself and others, was in part the translator of Seneca and
      Lactantius, has further the merit of having published in 1518 the
      first map of Bohemia. Luther's sermons and other writings were
      translated into Bohemian; and the religious affairs of Germany
      began to excite an intense interest among all classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theological productions of this period written by Roman
      Catholics&mdash;among which we distinguish the names of Pishek
      surnamed Scribonius, Makawsky, and the Jesuits Sturm and
      Hostowin&mdash;are mostly of a polemical character; while some
      also are translations of the fathers, especially of Augustine's
      writings; or original ascetic productions in the form of
      allegorical novels. Among the Utraquists several individuals were
      celebrated as preachers; above all Ctibor Kotwa, who was called
      the Bohemian Cicero, and Dicastus Mirkowsky. Others wrote
      theological treatises and interpretations of portions of the
      Scriptures. Such were Beransky, author of an interpretation of
      Daniel, of the gospels, and the epistles; Orliczny, or, as he is
      called in Latin, Aquilinas, known chiefly as a translator of the
      classics;<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id=
      "FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_184_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> Turnowsky, a Slovak by
      birth; Bydzhowsky, Bilegowsky the writer of a Bohemian church
      history and of a history of the Hussites and Picardites;
      Rwaczowsky, Zeletawsky, Tesak, author of many popular religious
      hymns; Palma, who published towards twenty theological works;
      Peshina, Maurenin, and Borowsky, who wrote interpretations of the
      epistles and gospels; Wrbensky, author of a biblical Synopsis, a
      Harmony, etc.; Rosacius Sushishky, <span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_192" id="page_192">[pg.192]</a></span> distinguished as a
      Latin poet; Martin of Drazow, Jacobides Stribrsky, Jakesius
      Prerowsky. and others.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      There are few among the theological writers of this
      century,&mdash;of whom we have named perhaps the twentieth
      part,&mdash;who have not left at least ten volumes of their own
      writings; while many have reached twice, and some thrice the
      number. More than one third of the printed works in this
      department contain sermons. The eloquence of the pulpit acquired
      a high degree of cultivation; and besides the two Utraquist
      preachers mentioned above, many other names were celebrated among
      them. In respect to erudition, however, the Brethren occupied
      decidedly the first rank. In religious hymns all sects were
      equally productive; and there are, as we have mentioned already,
      not a few among them of a high excellence. To the names of
      spiritual poets alluded to in the preceding paragraphs, we may
      here add the following: T. Sobeslawsky Reshatko, Gryllus,
      Herstein of Radowesic, Horsky, Mart. Pisecky, Taborsky, Sylvanus
      a Slovak by birth and called by way of eminence <i>Poeta
      Bohemicus</i>, Chmelowecz, Mart. Philomusa, Karlsberg, Hanush;
      and more especially Lomnicky, <i>poeta laureatus</i>, who is
      regarded as the first Bohemian poet of that age.
    </p>
    <p>
      These names comprise also nearly all we have to say of the state
      of Bohemian poetry in general. Not that some of them did not
      occasionally desert the sacred muse, and compose specimens of
      secular poetry; for some of Lomnicky's larger and most celebrated
      works belong to this class, as may be seen by the titles; e.g.
      'The arrows of Cupid,' 'The golden Bag,' etc.<a name=
      "FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      But every thing of real poetical value is of a religious
      character; and bears too much the stamp of its age, to be
      relished at the present day. The secular poets of the time wrote,
      with a few exceptions, in Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the historians of merit we may name the following writers
      of Bohemian history: Hagek of Liboczan, Kuthen, Procopius Lupacz,
      Paprocky a Pole who however wrote some of his works in the
      Bohemian language, Racownicky, and the above-mentioned Weleslawin
      and Bilegowsky. In respect to universal history, or that of other
      lands, we find the names of Placel, Sixt von Ottersdorf,
      Konstantinovicz, Kocin, and others. This period is equally rich
      in valuable books of travels. Count Wratislaw of Mitrowicz, ob.
      1635, described his interesting embassy from Vienna to
      Constantinople; C. Harant, a courtier and statesman, published
      his travels in Egypt and Palestine; Prefat of Wlkanow likewise
      gave a description of his journey from Prague to Palestine;
      Charles of Zherotin, the son of the munificent patron of the
      United Brethren, and like him their protector and friend, left
      letters and a description of his travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      As lawyers, orators, and political writers, the following names
      may be adduced: Baron Kocin of Kocinet, whom we have had occasion
      to mention repeatedly; the counts Sternberg, Wratislaw of
      Mitrowicz, and Slawata; the latter known as one of the persons
      thrown from a lofty window of the castle by the violence of count
      Thurn&mdash;one of the introductory scenes of the thirty years'
      war; Baron Budowecz of Budow, equally excellent as a Christian
      and a statesman, the protector and public defender of the
      Bohemian Brethren, and faithful to his religious conviction until
      his last breath; Christopher Harant, another nobleman of great
      merit, whom we have mentioned above as a traveller in the East.
      Both these last were executed in 1621. Writers of merit in the
      department of jurisprudence, were also the counsellors Ulric of
      Prostiborz under Ferdinand I, Wolf of Wresowicz, the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">[pg.194]</a></span>
      chancellor Koldin, and others. But on topics like these, by far
      the greater number wrote only in Latin; and these of course we do
      not mention here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writers on the medical and natural sciences we cannot well
      separate; since, in most cases, the same individuals
      distinguished themselves in the departments of medicine,
      astronomy, and mathematics. The following, along with many
      others, are named with distinction: Th. Hagek, body physician of
      the emperors Maximilian and Rudolph, and a celebrated astronomer;
      Zhelotyn, author of medical and mathematical works; Zaluzhansky,
      physician and naturalist, who anticipated Linnæus in his doctrine
      of the sexual distinction and impregnation of plants; P.
      Codicillus, historian, philosopher, theologian, and astronomer,
      who wrote on all these different subjects; Huber von Reisenbach,
      a physician and rector of the university of Prague; Shud, a
      celebrated astronomer; and many more.<a name="FNanchor_187_187"
      id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_187_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of books printed during this period cannot well be
      ascertained; since by far the greater number were burned, or
      otherwise destroyed, in the dreadful catastrophe which signalized
      its close. Prague alone had eighteen printing offices; and
      fourteen more existed in other places in Bohemia and Moravia.
      Besides these, many Bohemian books were printed at Venice,
      Nürnberg, Wittenberg, and some in Holland and Poland.

    <p>
      In 1617, the emperor Matthias succeeded in obtaining the crown of
      Bohemia for his nephew Ferdinand, archduke of Austria. This was
      the signal for the Romanists, in spite of the <i>Literæ
      Imperatoriæ</i> of the emperor Rudolph, to make new attempts for
      the suppression of the Protestants. The Estates belonging to this
      denomination brought their complaint before the emperor, who gave
      them no redress; and thus the spark was kindled into flames,
      which for thirty years continued to rage throughout
      all<span class="newpage"><a name="page_195" id=
      "page_195">[pg.195]</a></span> Germany. At the death of Matthias
      in 1619, the Bohemians refused to receive Ferdinand II as their
      king; and elected the Protestant palatine Frederic V, a generous
      prince, but incapable of affording them support. The battle at
      the White Mountain, near Prague, in 1620, decided the destiny of
      Bohemia. Twenty-seven of the leaders of the insurrection were
      publicly executed; sixteen were exiled or condemned to prison for
      life; their property, as also the possessions of seven hundred
      and twenty-eight noblemen and knights, who had voluntarily
      acknowledged themselves to have taken part in the insurrection,
      and of twenty-nine others who had fled, was wholly confiscated;
      and thus the amount of fifty-three millions of rix dollars
      transferred from Protestant to Romish hands. The <i>Literce
      Imperatorice</i> were annulled; the Protestant religion in
      Bohemia abolished; and that kingdom declared a purely catholic
      hereditary monarchy. All non-catholic preachers were banished;
      thirty thousand families, who preferred exile to a change of
      their religion, emigrated. Among them 185 were noble families;
      the others artists, mechanics, merchants, and labourers. Yet in
      the villages, among the woods and mountains, where neither
      soldier nor Jesuit had penetrated, and there alone, many
      Protestants remained, buried in a fortunate obscurity. From the
      time of this catastrophe, the Bohemian language has never again
      been used in public business. The thirty years' war completed the
      devastation of this unfortunate country. In 1617, Bohemia had 732
      cities and 34,700 villages; when Ferdinand II died in 1637, there
      remained 130 cities and 6000 villages; and its three millions of
      inhabitants were reduced to 780,000.<span class=

      the Revival of Literature in A.D</i>. 1774-80.

    <br />
    <p>
      Of this melancholy period we have but little to say. A dull
      pressure lay upon the nation; it was as if the heavy strokes
      inflicted on them had paralyzed their very limbs. Innumerable
      monks came to Bohemia from Italy, Spain, and the south of
      Germany, who condemned and sacrificed to the flames every
      Bohemian book as necessarily heretical. There were individuals
      who boasted having burned with their own hands 60,000 literary
      works. They broke into private houses, and took away whatever
      Bohemian books they could find. Those which they did not burn,
      were deposited in separate chambers in the convents, provided
      with iron grates, bolts, and chains, drawn before the door, on
      which was written. <i>The Hell</i>. They distributed pamphlets
      respecting hell and purgatory, the reading of which produced
      derangement of mind in many weak persons; until, at last, the
      government was wise enough to lay a severe prohibition upon these
      measures. The Bohemian emigrants indeed continued to have their
      religious books printed in their foreign homes; but they wrote
      comparatively few new works. These however they contrived to
      introduce into Bohemia, where they were answered by the Jesuits
      and Capuchins in thick folio volumes, written in a language
      hardly intelligible. There were however some honourable
      exceptions among these fathers; some persons, who, independent of
      religious prejudices; continued to labour for the benefit of a
      beloved mother tongue. The Jesuits Konstanz, Steyer, and
      Drachovsky, wrote grammatical works, and the two first attempted
      to translate the Bible anew. Plachy, ob. 1650, Libertin,
      and<span class="newpage"><a name="page_197" id=

      preachers; Peshina, ob. 1680, Hammerschmidt, ob. 1731, and
      Beckowsky, ob. 1725, wrote meritorious historical works; Rosa,
      ob. 1689, composed another grammar and a dictionary. Others wrote
      in Latin; and among these must be named the Jesuit Balbin, ob.
      1688, who prepared several historical and bibliographical works
      of importance, part of which, however, were not published until
      long after his death.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id=

      We turn once more to the unfortunate emigrants, and in the midst
      of the distress, privations, and sacrifices, which were the
      natural accompaniments of their exiled condition, we rejoice to
      meet with a name, which owes its splendour not alone to the
      general poverty of the period; but which outshines even the most
      distinguished of the former age, and is indeed the only one in
      the literary history of Bohemia, which has acquired a
      <i>European</i> fame. This is Comenius, the last bishop of the
      Bohemian Brethren. Although he belongs partly to the former
      period, and, in respect to his style, decidedly to the golden age
      of the Bohemian. literature, the time of his principal activity
      falls within this melancholy interval. A few words may be devoted
      to the life of this remarkable individual. He was born A.D. 1592,
      in the village of Komna in Moravia. His baptismal names were John
      Amos; his father had probably no family name, as was frequently
      the case at that time among the lower classes throughout all
      Europe. According to the custom of the time, he was called
      Komnensky from his native place, the Latin form of which is
      Comnenius, or more commonly Comenius. His parents, who belonged
      to the community of the Brethren, sent him to school at Herborn.
      He<span class="newpage"><a name="page_198" id=
      "page_198">[pg.198]</a></span> distinguished himself so much as
      to be made rector at Prerow, when only twenty-two years old; and
      two years later was transferred to Fulnck. In 1618 this latter
      city was plundered by the Spaniards, and Comenius lost all his
      books and other property. When the great persecution of the
      Protestants broke out, he fled to Poland. Here he found many of
      his countrymen, of the sect of the Brethren, whom the
      persecutions of the former century had already driven hither, and
      who had here gathered themselves into communities essentially of
      the same constitution; although in some measure they were
      amalgamated with the dissenters in Poland. In 1632 they elected
      him their bishop. In 1631 he published his <i>Janua linguarum
      reserrata</i>, a work which spread his fame over all the world,
      and which was translated into twelve European languages, and also
      into Persian, Arabic, and Mongolian. His object in this work was
      to point out a new method of teaching languages, by which they
      were to be used as keys for acquiring other useful knowledge. In
      1641 he was invited to England to prepare a new arrangement of
      the schools; but the civil war having prevented the execution of
      this project, he went from England to Sweden, whither the
      chancellor Oxenstiern had invited him for a similar purpose.
      After protracted journeys through half Europe, he returned to
      Lissa, the principal seat of his activity. In 1659 be published
      his <i>Orbis pictus</i>, the first picture-book for children
      which ever appeared, and which acquired the same reputation as
      the work above-mentioned. The war and the destruction of Lissa
      compelled him some years later to leave Poland; he sought another
      asylum in Germany, and settled at length at Amsterdam, where be
      died in 1671, occupied with literary pursuits until his last
      hour. According to Adelung, he wrote not less than ninety-two
      works, of which only fifty-four have come down to us; and among
      these, twenty are in the Bohemian language. His style has a
      classical perfection; the contents of his works are manifold, and
      have mostly lost<span class="newpage"><a name="page_199" id=
      "page_199">[pg.199]</a></span> their interest for the present
      age.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_189_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> In the last years of his
      life Comenius is said to have devoted himself to a mystical
      interpretation of the prophetic Scriptures; he discovered in the
      Revelation of St. John the state of Europe, as it then was;
      awaited the millennium in the year 1672; and believed in the
      far-famed Bourignon, as an inspired prophetess.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few names only among the emigrants require to be mentioned as
      writers, after Comenius. They may find their place here: Paul
      Stransky, who was exiled in 1626 and found an asylum as professor
      at Thorn, wrote a history of Bohemia in Latin in 1643, which was
      translated and accompanied with supplements and corrections by
      Cornova, in 1792. Elsner, pastor of the Bohemian Brethren at
      Berlin, and Kleich at Zittau, printed works for religious
      instruction and devotional exercises for Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of what was written during this period proceeded
      from the Slovaks in Hungary, a nation related to the Bohemians in
      race and language, who after the Reformation had adopted the
      Bohemian dialect as their literary language.<a name=
      "FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_190_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> Although also constantly
      struggling against oppression and persecution, the Protestants in
      Hungary were not formally annihilated, as in Bohemia; but
      belonged rather to the tolerated sects, so called. A certain
      degree of activity in behalf of their brethren in faith was
      consequently allowed to them; especially later under Maria
      Theresa. We meet among them, with hardly any other than
      theological productions, or works for religious edification.
    </p><span class="newpage"><a name="page_200" id=
    "page_200">[pg.200]</a></span> The two pastors Krman and Bel, who
    both died towards the middle of the eighteenth century, men of no
    inconsiderable merit as Christians and as scholars, prepared a new
    edition of the Bohemian Bible, and also translated several works of
    Luther, Arndt, etc. Ambrosius, their cotemporary, wrote a
    commentary on Luther's catechism, and several other useful
    religious works. G. Bahyl published an introduction to the Bible, a
    history of the symbolical books, and assisted Comenius in his
    <i>Orbus pictus</i>. Matthias Bahyl became the object of a cruel
    persecution, on account of a translation of Meissner's
    <i>Consultatio orthod. de fide Lutherana.</i> Numerous religious
    hymns were written in Bohemian by Hrusbkowic, the two Blasius,
    Glosius, Augustini, and others. Michalides translated the
    <i>Summarium biblicum</i> of the theologians of Wittenberg; and
    another Protestant minister, Dolezhal, wrote in 1746 a Bohemian
    grammar. But their books, with a few exceptions, were little read
    beyond the frontiers of Hungary; and had consequently little or no
    influence on the Bohemians. The works written in the Slovakian
    dialect do not belong here.

    <h4>
      FIFTH PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>Revival of Bohemian Literature, from A.D</i>. 1774-80 <i>to
      the present time</i>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In A.D. 1774, the marshal count Kinsky published a work on the
      advantages and necessity of a knowledge of the Bohemian language.
      At that time so great was the neglect of the mother tongue, that
      even for a work of so patriotic a nature, he had to employ a
      foreign language in order to be understood! One year later
      appeared an apology for the vernacular tongue of the
      country,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_201" id=
      "page_201">[pg.201]</a></span> written a hundred years before by
      the Jesuit Balbin in Latin,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id=
      "FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_191_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> and edited by Pelzel.
      These two writings created a deep sensation; and even the
      government would seem to have taken notice of them. We find, at
      least, that in the same year teachers of the Bohemian language
      were appointed in the university of Vienna and in two other
      institutions in that city. At the same time, the royal normal
      school at Prague began to print several Bohemian books for
      instruction. When the tolerant views and principles by which
      Joseph II was actuated, became known, more than a hundred
      thousand concealed Protestants immediately appeared; their hidden
      books were brought to light again; and many works, of which only
      single copies existed, were reprinted. In 1781 the severe edict
      of Ferdinand II was repealed, and a censorship established upon
      more reasonable principles. In 1786, the Bohemian language had
      gained friends enough to induce the government to institute a
      Bohemian theatre; which, with a short interruption during the
      present century, has ever since existed. The unfortunate system
      of general centralization adopted by Joseph II, was on the whole
      not favourable to the cultivation of any but the German language;
      but during the reign of his two successors, the Bohemian received
      more encouragement. In 1793 a professorship for the language and
      literature of the country was founded in the university of
      Prague; the use of that language in all the schools was ordained
      by several decrees of the government; and by a law of A.D. 1818,
      a knowledge of it was made a necessary qualification for holding
      any office.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very outset of this revival of Bohemian literature, there
      appeared so great a multitude of writers; such habits of
      diligence and productiveness were immediately manifested
      throughout the whole nation; and such a mass of respectable
      talent was brought to light; that the long interval of a dull and
      deathlike<span class="newpage"><a name="page_202" id=
      "page_202">[pg.202]</a></span> silence, which preceded this
      period, presents indeed an enigma difficult to be solved. No
      small influence may be ascribed to Germany. The principles of the
      government were changed; the country, physically as well as
      morally exhausted, could recover but gradually; but all this
      could not create talents where there were none; nor could all
      external oppression and unfavourable conjunctures destroy the
      germs of real talent, if they had been there. The list of modern
      Bohemian writers of merit is very extensive; but we must be
      satisfied with bringing forward the most distinguished of them,
      and refer the reader to works less limited than these pages,
      where he may find more complete information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those whose desert is the greatest in respect to the
      revival of Bohemian literature, Kramerius, born 1753, ob. 1808,
      must be named first. He was one of those indefatigable and
      creative minds, which never sleep, never lose a moment, and by a
      restless activity and happy ingenuity know how to render the
      difficult easy,&mdash;the apparently impossible, practicable.
      From the year 1785, he was editor of the first Bohemian
      newspaper; from 1788, of the annual called the <i>Toleranz
      Kalender</i>, or Almanac of Toleration; and published besides
      this more than fifty works, written by himself and others, but
      accompanied with notes or commentaries of his own. None of his
      productions surpassed mediocrity; but according to the best
      judges, they were well and perspicuously written; they became
      popular and exerted a very favourable influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As literary historians, Slavic philologians and antiquaries,
      Pelzcl, Prochazka, Durich, Puchmayer, Negedly, Jungmann, Tomsa,
      Hanka, and above all Dobrovsky, must be distinguished. One of the
      principal merits of most of these scholars consists in their
      preparing for the press and editing valuable old manuscripts; or
      in the judicious commentaries which they added to new editions of
      ancient works already printed. Pelzel we have<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">[pg.203]</a></span>
      named above as the editor of the writings of the Jesuit Balbin.
      Most of his works are in German, but some also in Bohemian. In
      1804 Prochazka and Durich translated the Bible for Roman
      Catholics; the former had already translated the New Testament in
      1786. His principal labours besides this were in the department
      of history. Durich wrote in Latin; but his researches were
      nevertheless devoted to the Bohemian language and history. Tomsa
      and Negedly have written Bohemian grammars, and several other
      Slavic-philological works and essays.<a name="FNanchor_192_192"
      id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_192_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> Puchmayer published a

      "#Footnote_193_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> consisting partly of his
      own productions, a token of the reviving poetical genius of the
      nation, which had slept for centuries; while his elaborate
      Russian grammar is also a valuable contribution to Slavic
      literature in general.

    <p>
      Joseph Jungmann, besides a translation of Chauteaubriand's Atala
      and of Milton's Paradise Lost, which Bowring calls "the most
      admirable among the many admirable versions of that renowned and
      glorious heroic," <a name="FNanchor_194_194" id=
      "FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_194_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> has written many
      important essays scattered in periodicals; and also published in
      1820 a Bohemian chrestomathy, in 1825 a history of Bohemian
      literature, and in 1830-31 a complete dictionary of that
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      W. Hanka. librarian at Prague, has made himself particularly
      known by critical editions of valuable writings out of the
      golden<span class="newpage"><a name="page_204" id=
      "page_204">[pg.204]</a></span> age of Bohemian literature. In
      1817 he was so fortunate as to discover a manuscript of high
      importance, as well in a philological respect, as for its
      intrinsic poetical value; which he published in 1819 with a
      modern Bohemian translation, and also a German translation by
      Swoboda.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id=
      "FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_195_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> He has written several
      works, and also essays in periodicals, of a bibliographical and
      antiquarian character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Dobrovsky, born 1753 in Hungary, but of Bohemian parents,
      ob. 1829, is called the patriarch of modern Slavic literature,
      and was one of the profoundest scholars of the age. His merits in
      regard to Slavic philology and history are so generally
      acknowledged, and we have so often had occasion to cite his name
      in these pages, and to refer the reader to his authority, that
      without attempting to present a critical view of one, or an
      analysis of another of his works, we are contented to give in a
      note the title of his principal works. We are the more willing to
      adopt this course, because the most of his works form in a
      certain measure one great whole, and mutually supply each other;
      and because too, the author having in part first explored unknown
      regions, and having of course sometimes found it necessary to
      retract hypotheses started in his earlier writings, his works
      cannot well be separated. He wrote mostly in German; sometimes in
      Latin; while comparatively very few of his numerous books are in
      the Bohemian language. In this way only could they gain that kind
      of universality, which the subject required; and which has so
      much contributed to promote the cause of Slavic literature in
      general.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      There were also some scholars among the Slovaks, who aided the
      same cause with diligence and talent. Leska, ob. 1818, published
      from 1785 onward the first Slovakian newspaper, and was a
      diligent and judicious compiler in respect to Slavic
      lexicography. Palkowicz published a Bohemian dictionary, and
      prepared in 1808 a more correct edition of the Bible. Plachy,
      besides many volumes of prose and poetry, published a valuable
      periodical; Schramko wrote some philological works; Schaffarik
      and Kollar, of whom more will be said in the sequel, were also
      Slovaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the collection of poetry by Puchmayer above alluded to,
      several others of a miscellaneous kind appeared; poetry having
      been hitherto limited almost exclusively to religious purposes.
      Kamaryt, Palacky, Chmelensky, Zdirad Polak, Czelakowsky, Snaidr,
      Hnewkowsky, Turinsky, Stulcz,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id=
      "FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_197_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> Jablonsky, Tupi, Sabin,
      are favourably known as poets. A. Marek has translated several
      dramas of Shakspeare; Machaczek several from Goethe; Kliczpera,
      Stepanek, and Sychra, are esteemed dramatic writers. Among the
      Slovaks, Holli translated the Latin and Greek elegiac poets;
      Roshnay, Anaereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As historical writers Tomek and Jordan must be honourably
      mentioned. An excellent work on Bohemian Antiquities, written in
      German by J.E. Wocel, ought also to be noticed.<a name=

    <p>
      In the department of natural science are to be mentioned, Presl,
      count Berchtold, Strnad, Sedlaczek, Wydra, Smetana, etc. Others,
      Bohemians by birth, have written in German, e.g. Haenke, Sieber,
      etc. etc. Count Buquoy also is of Bohemian origin.&mdash;Writers
      of merit on moral and religious subjects are, Rautenkranz,
      Zahradnik, Parizek, and others. The Slovak Bartholomaeides, a
      distinguished scholar, has written several useful works on
      various topics.&mdash;Periodicals full of learned researches and
      variety of interest were edited, <i>Dobraslaw</i> by Hromadko and
      Ziegler, <i>Krok</i> by Presl, etc. Modern journals of a more
      general tendency are <i>Wlastimil</i> (the Patriot),
      <i>Dennica</i>, etc. Among the highest nobility the national
      language found powerful patrons; and in the establishment of a
      national Museum, a Bohemian Academy of Sciences, and similar
      patriotic institutions, the national literature received great
      encouragement. One of the principal objects of this institution
      was to publish old works and to patronize new ones. Its first
      publication was an old treatise on Bohemian law.<a name=

      The leading poet of the present day in the Bohemian language is
      J. Kollar, born 1793 at Thurocz in Hungary. In 1821 he published
      a volume of poems; and some years later a larger beautiful poem
      in two cantos, called <i>Slawy dzery</i>, the Daughter of Glory,
      by which he meant <i>Slavina</i>, or the Slavic nations
      personified; for <i>Slava</i> means glory. With talents of the
      first order, and at the same time purely national, he imitates
      Petrarch in some measure; making his nation his Laura, praising
      her beauty, and prophesying her ultimate triumph.<a name=

      The patriotic zeal which in our days has instigated the Slavic
      scholars to follow out the traces of their language and history
      into the remotest past, in order to clear up more satisfactorily
      the origin and primitive connection between the different members
      of the great Slavic family, and their relative position to the
      Germans, has nowhere been exhibited in a more energetic and
      disinterested way than in Bohemia. The idea of Panslavism was
      here first worked out systematically.<a name="FNanchor_201_201"
      id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_201_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> If we are not entirely
      mistaken, it was the same Kollar, the Czekho-Slovakian poet, who
      first conceived, or at least expressed, that idea. In a Slavic
      periodical, published in Hungary, entitled <i>Hronka</i>, he came
      out with an address to his Slavic brethren, which he himself
      translated into German. He urged the Slavi to drop their numerous
      intellectual family feuds; to consider themselves as <i>one</i>
      great nation; their mutual languages essentially as <i>one</i>;
      their respective interests as one. He prophesied power and
      predominance to the Slavi <i>united</i> as a whole. The idea was
      seized with eagerness; especially by the Bohemian scholars, in
      whom a certain irritation against the Germans, the oppressors of
      their nation for centuries, was far from being unnatural. At the
      head of this movement, so far as it respects philological
      investigations, was P.J. Schaffarik; in respect to historical
      researches, Fr. Palacky; the first a Slovak, the second a
      Moravian by birth; and both of them highly esteemed as scholars
      of great learning, uncommon acuteness, and indefatigable
      research; but both also, from a very laudable national
      partiality, inclined to favour those results of their researches,
      which should serve to support their own patriotic or Panslavic
      views. It will therefore not be found surprising, that they
      should have met with a strong, nay passionate opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schaffarik, whose valuable work on the Slavic languages
      and<span class="newpage"><a name="page_208" id=
      "page_208">[pg.208]</a></span> their history we have chiefly
      consulted in our present sketch, (not however without due regard
      to his own altered and corrected views, as given to the public in
      his later works,) was born in 1795 at Kbeljarowo in Northern
      Hungary. He received a German education; and, following the
      example of other leading Slavic scholars, like Dobrovsky and
      Kopitar, notwithstanding his partiality for all that is Slavic,
      he wrote most of his earlier works in German. His "History of the
      Slavic Language and Literature," although a production of his
      youth, and written before the full maturity of the author's
      views, has perhaps contributed more than any other work to a
      knowledge of the Slavic literature in general, and of the
      classification and mutual relation of the Slavic languages. After
      further researches, he prepared a "History of the Southern
      Slavi;" which however, so far as we are informed, has never been
      printed. Instead of it he published a work on "Slavic
      Antiquities" in the Bohemian language. It was patriotism which
      induced him not only to choose this language in preference to the
      German, and thus give up a far greater field of influence; but he
      also declined a well endowed Slavic professorship in the
      university of Berlin, from the same generous and patriotic
      motive, and settled in Prague. Here he undertook the editorship
      of a periodical founded by Palacky; and operated in connection
      with him and other Slavic scholars for the promotion of Slavic,
      and principally Bohemian, literature. For this end a society was
      founded among the Bohemian and Slovakian scholars and gentry,
      called the <i>Stalci</i>, the Constant. They bound themselves to
      buy every respectable book, which should be printed in the
      Bohemian language. In 1842 Schaffarik published a "Slavic
      Ethnography," a small introductory work, but founded on extensive
      studies. Of this he himself prepared a German
      translation.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id=
      "FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_202_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a><span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">[pg.209]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The faithful fellow-labourer of Schaffarik is Francis Palacky, a
      scholar of great diligence and research, a few years younger in
      age; who however seems to have adopted an opposite course, in so
      far as his early works were written in Bohemian, while his later
      and principal ones are in German. In 1829 he was appointed
      Historiographer of Bohemia by the Estates; but he was too warm a
      <i>Bohemian</i> to hope for the confirmation of the Austrian
      government under the emperor Francis, and it was not obtained
      until under his successor. By means of the "Journal of the
      Bohemian National Museum," of which he was the founder and
      editor, he had early gained a leading voice in all that concerned
      the revival of Bohemian literature; and, in that capacity, had to
      fight his way through a series of literary struggles and combats,
      sometimes conducted with personal vehemence and bitterness. He
      had the satisfaction, however, of finally coming off as victor in
      the more essential points. His most important work is his
      <i>History of Bohemia</i>; of which two volumes were published in
      the German language in 1836. A Bohemian edition, with additions
      and a historiographical introduction, appeared in 1848.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit which pervades this great work makes the author to a
      certain extent the representative of his nation. One of the
      objects of the work is to point out the <i>primitive</i>
      relations of Slavism on the one hand, and of Germanism, the heir
      of Romanism,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_210" id=
      "page_210">[pg.210]</a></span> on the other; their contrasts and
      necessary conflicts; the Germans, warlike, conquering, oppressing
      all their neighbours, and bearing the germs of privileged castes
      in their earliest institutions; the Slavi, peaceful, industrious,
      living in patriarchal communities, and in their fundamental
      elements purely democratic. Hence, the author says, the principal
      idea and fundamental feature of Bohemian history is the
      uninterrupted clashing and struggle of Slavism and Germanism; and
      in another place he remarks, that "the history of Bohemia
      consists chiefly in the combat with Germanism; or in the
      alternate reception and rejection by the Czekhes of German
      manners and institutions." <a name="FNanchor_203_203" id=
      "FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_203_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our own days have witnessed the enthusiasm with which the thought
      of a total separation between Slavism and Germanism was received,
      when the events of the month of March 1848 seemed to open an
      unexpected prospect of realizing a long cherished idea. A great
      congress of all the Slavic nations was convoked at Prague. But at
      that very moment, at the gathering together of so many members of
      that wide-spread family, it became strikingly apparent that they
      were a <i>family</i> of nations; but could never again become,
      what for thousands of years they had not been, <i>one</i> nation.
      In order to be understood, several of their deputies had to speak
      in German; and even for the journal founded as the great central
      organ of Slavism, the <i>German</i> language had to be employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patriotic efforts made to prevent the Bohemian language from
      gradually yielding to the German, are honourable and<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">[pg.211]</a></span>
      laudable; but whether they will have any ultimate result seems to
      be quite doubtful. The times indeed are somewhat changed, since
      Jungmann called the present literature of Bohemia "the produce of
      a few enthusiasts, who, exposing themselves to the hatred of
      their enemies and the ingratitude of their countrymen, have
      devoted themselves to the resuscitation of a language, neither
      living nor dead." Twenty-five years have brought on a great
      revolution; and those enthusiasts are no longer "a few." But they
      have still a hard combat to fight. It may be doubtful whether
      their strength will hold out to struggle against the torrent of
      time; which, in its resistless course, overwhelms the nations,
      and only throws their vestiges in scattered fragments on the
      banks, as feeble memorials to show to an inquiring posterity that
      they once existed.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id=

    <h4>
      LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF THE SLOVAKS.
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      The northwestern part of Hungary is inhabited by the Slovaks, a
      Slavic nation, who appear to be the direct descendants of the
      original Slavic settlers in Europe. Numerous colonists of the
      same race are scattered all over the other parts of that country.
      The Byzantine historians, and, somewhat later, the Russian
      annalist Nestor, speak of the region on the north of the Danube
      as being the primitive seat of the Slavi. In early times the
      <i>Sarmatae limigantes</i> or <i>Jazyges metanastae</i>, nomadic
      tribes between the Danube and the Theiss, whose name indicates
      incontestably their having been Slavi,<a name="FNanchor_205_205"
      id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_205_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> are mentioned as having
      troubled the Byzantine empire. But they soon disappeared entirely
      from history,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_213" id=
      "page_213">[pg.213]</a></span> and it is not before the ninth
      century, when they were already Christians, that we meet them
      again. At that time Slovakia, in Slavic <i>Slovansko</i>, viz.
      the regions adjacent to the two rivers Waag and Gran, reappears
      as an ingredient part of the ephemeral kingdom of great Moravia.
      The rest of Pannonia was inhabited by other Slavic tribes, by
      Bulgarians, Rumelians and Khazares. In A.D. 894, the Magyars
      conquered Pannonia, drove back the Slovaks into the mountains,
      and made them tributary; whilst they themselves settled on the
      plains. But although the Slovaks appear to have submitted to
      their fate, and to have thenceforth lived on good terms with
      their conquerors, it cannot unconditionally be said that the two
      nations were merged in each other; since, even after nearly a
      thousand years have passed, they still speak different languages.
      The Magyars learned the arts of peace from the Slavi; who,
      besides being already Christians, had built many cities, and were
      mechanics, traders, agriculturists. All words and terms relating
      to these occupations, the Magyars had to obtain from them. The
      Slovaks on their side lost their national existence in that of
      their Asiatic conquerors, entered into their ranks as soldiers,
      and participated thence-forward in all their fortunes; but the
      influence of the Magyars on their language could be only
      inconsiderable, since the circle of new ideas which the Slovaks
      had to receive in exchange from them, barbarians as they were,
      could be only very limited. The language however is the only
      remnant of their national existence which the Slovaks have
      preserved; in every other respect they belong to the Hungarian
      nation, of which they form an ingredient part, as the Magyars
      form another; and on the glory of whose valiant deeds they have
      an equal claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hungary, traversed by two large rivers, the Danube and the
      Theiss, is divided into four great districts, usually called this
      side the Danube and beyond the Danube, this side the Theiss and
      beyond the Theiss. The district this side the Theiss is
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_214" id=
      "page_214">[pg.214]</a></span> principal seat of the Slovaks. The
      counties Trencsin, Thurocz, Arva, Liptau, and Sohl, are entirely
      inhabited by them, amounting to about 550,000 in number. In the
      other counties of the same district they live more mingled with
      Russniaks and Magyars; and, together with the numerous Slovakish
      settlements which are scattered over all Hungary, are computed in
      all at about 1,800,000. About 1,300,000 of them are Roman
      Catholics, and the remaining 500,000 Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Slovakish language, exposed through the geographical
      situation of the nation, to the influence of various other Slavic
      idioms&mdash;as the Polish, Bohemian, Malo-Russian, Servian, and
      Vindish&mdash;is more broken up into different dialects than
      perhaps any living tongue. In its original elements it is very
      nearly related to the Old Slavic language;<a name=
      "FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_206_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> a fact which is easy to
      be explained, when we consider that the development of this
      language must have been the result of the primitive cultivation
      of the Slavi; and that the region about the Carpathian mountains,
      the seat of the ancient as well as of the present Slovaks, was
      the cradle of all the Slavic nations which are now spread over
      the whole of eastern Europe. Of all living Slavic tongues, the
      Bohemian is the nearest related to the Slovakish, especially as
      it appears in the oldest Bohemian writers; a circumstance which
      induced Dobrovsky at first to consider both languages as
      essentially the same; or rather to maintain, that the Slovakish
      was nothing more than Old Bohemian. But after entering more
      deeply into the subject, he found reason to regard the Slovakish
      idiom as a separate dialect, which forms the link of connection
      between<span class="newpage"><a name="page_215" id=
      "page_215">[pg.215]</a></span> the Bohemian and Croatian-Vindish
      dialects, or between the two principal divisions, the Eastern and
      Western stems, of the great Slavic family.<a name=
      "FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_207_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      To enumerate the features by which the Slovakish dialects are
      distinguished from the other Slavic languages, would oblige us to
      enter more into detail than would be acceptable to persons not
      acquainted with any of them; as we may suppose to be the case
      with most of our readers. Besides, most of the peculiarities
      which could be alleged as <i>general</i> characteristics, are
      contradicted by so many single cases, that all general rules
      would be in danger of being rendered void by a plurality of
      exceptions. The only thing which belongs to the Slovaks alone,
      and is not common to any of the other Slavic tongues, is a
      variety of diphthongs where all the rest have simple vowels; e.g.
      <i>kuoñ</i>, horse, for <i>koñ; lieucz</i>, light, for
      <i>lucz</i>, etc. In the counties situated on the frontiers of
      Galicia, the Slovakish language participates in many of the
      peculiarities of the Polish tongue; on the frontier of Moravia,
      the dialect of the people approaches nearer to the vernacular
      idiom of that province, and consequently to the Bohemian; which
      has been adopted as their own literary language. On the Slovaks
      who live more in the interior of the country, the influence of
      the Magyars, or of the Transylvanian-Germans, or of the
      Russniaks, or of the Servians, is more or less prominent,
      according to their locality. The less exposed to the influence of
      other races, the purer of course has the proper Slovakian idiom
      been preserved, But even in its purest state, it has, as we
      mentioned above, a strong and decided resemblance to the Bohemian
      tongue; from which it is however distinguished by a more
      harmonious and pleasing sound; its vowels being fuller and
      occurring more frequently. But a peculiarity which distinguishes
      it more materially, is a treasure of words and phrases
      obsolete<span class="newpage"><a name="page_216" id=
      "page_216">[pg.216]</a></span> or entirely unknown in the present
      Bohemian language; although they were to be found in the old
      Bohemian, and are so still, in part, in the Old Slavic, Russian,
      and Vindish dialects. Schaffarik mentions that G. Rybay, a
      minister in the county of Bacz, who possessed many valuable
      manuscripts, had collected 15,000 words for a Slovakish
      <i>Idioticon</i>, and that it would be easy to enlarge this
      number.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id=
      "FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_208_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Slovakish language has never been a literary language; the
      first attempt to render it so, with a few trifling exceptions,
      was made about forty years ago; but the opposition which it met
      with from the literati who had already adopted the kindred
      Bohemian tongue for their literary language, together with the
      political obstacles which it had to encounter from the jealousy
      of the Magyars, seems to have been too strong to be conquered.
      Indeed, in consequence of this jealousy of the Magyars, the
      Slovakish language is so far oppressed, that even in the higher
      schools of the Slovaks themselves this language is not permitted
      to constitute a branch of instruction, like the Hungarian and
      Latin. Schaffarik thinks it probable, that in ancient times the
      vernacular tongue of the counties inhabited by Slovaks was used
      in public documents and similar writings; and that such
      historical monuments must be buried in the libraries and archives
      of the catholic archbishops, noblemen, and cities.<a name=
      "FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_209_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> But this subject has
      never been sufficiently examined. The historical popular songs,
      which nearly a hundred years ago were familiar to the Slovakian
      peasants, and some of which appear to have been derived even from
      the pagan period, have perished, with the exception of a few
      initial verses.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      There is no trace known to be left of the mental existence of
      this nation of nearly two millions of souls, until the middle of
      the fifteenth century. At that time a great body of Hussites, who
      were exiled from Bohemia, broke into Upper Hungary, and, under
      the conduct of Giskra von Brandeis, were hired by the queen
      Elizabeth against the rival Polish-Hungarian monarch Vladislaus,
      afterwards king of Bohemia. The Bohemian soldiers were
      accompanied by their wives and children, and settled finally in
      different parts of Hungary, Other Taboritic colonists followed
      them, and amalgamated gradually with the Slovaks, among whom they
      principally established themselves. It is probable, that at this
      time the Slovaks became familiar with the Bohemian as a literary
      language; which from its kindred genius and its similarity of
      forms was perfectly intelligible, and must have been highly
      acceptable to them. When the doctrines of the German Reformers
      penetrated into Hungary, they found the Slovaks already so well
      prepared, that those doctrines were at once spread among the
      people by numerous books written by Slovakian clergymen in the
      Bohemian language. The Bible and the liturgical books were
      written and printed in Bohemian; and many Bohemians and Moravians
      came into Hungary as preachers and teachers. Thus the dominion of
      the Bohemian language over the pulpit, and, since <i>all</i> the
      Slovakian writers of this period were clergymen, in the republic
      of letters also, was established among the Slovaks without
      struggle. There is nothing known of any<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">[pg.218]</a></span>
      catholic Slovakish writers at this period; if there were any,
      they probably followed the beaten track, and wrote also in
      Bohemian or in Latin. But the produce of the literary cultivation
      of the Slovaks during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, is
      at most but small: for the times appear to have been too heavy,
      and men's minds too much oppressed, for a free development of
      their powers. The civil wars, the devastations of the Turks, the
      religious controversies, and after the battle at the White
      Mountain, religious oppression and persecution, chased the
      peaceful muses from Pannonia, and put the genius of the people in
      chains. All the productions of these two centuries, with a few
      exceptions, are confined to theology, and are mostly sermons,
      catechisms, devotional exercises, or religious hymns. Schaffarik
      observes, that from these latter there speaks a melancholy gloomy
      spirit, crying for divine aid and deliverance.<a name=
      "FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_211_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> Among the clergymen who
      during the first half of the eighteenth century exerted
      themselves for the diffusion of biblical knowledge, were Matth.
      Bel and D. Krman, who prepared a new edition of the Bible; G.
      Ambrosius and G. Babyl, authors of theological commentaries, etc.
      Those Slovakian writers who in any measure distinguished
      themselves, have been enumerated under their proper heads in our
      sketch of the Bohemian literature.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id=

      The Bohemian dialect, as we have mentioned repeatedly, is
      perfectly <i>intelligible</i> to the Slovaks. But as it is not to
      them the language of common conversation, it cannot be
      <i>familiar</i> to their minds. If, in listening to their
      preachers in the churches, the people succeed in straining up
      their minds sufficiently to enable them to follow the course of
      the sermons and devotional exercises, it still seems rather
      unnatural, that even their prayer books, destined for private
      use, should not be written in their vernacular<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">[pg.219]</a></span>
      tongue; but that even their addresses to the Most High, which,
      more than any thing else, should be the free and natural
      effusions of their inmost feelings, should require such an
      intellectual exertion and an artificial transposition into a
      foreign clime. It is a singular fact, that, whilst every where
      else Protestantism and the friends of the Bible have advocated
      and attempted to raise the dialect of the people, in opposition
      to a privileged idiom of the priesthood, among the Slovaks the
      vindication of the vernacular tongue has been attempted by the
      Romanists, and has met with strong opposition from the
      Protestants. In the year 1718, Alex Macsay, a catholic clergyman,
      published sermons at Tyrnau, written in the common Slovakian
      dialect. The Jesuits of Tyrnau followed his example, in
      publishing books of prayers and several other religious works, in
      a language which is rather a mixture of the dialect of the people
      and the literary Bohemian language. During the last ten years of
      the eighteenth century, a more successful attempt was made to
      elevate the Slovakian dialect spoken on the frontiers of Moravia,
      and which approaches the Bohemian language most, to the rank of a
      literary language. At the head of this undertaking were the Roman
      catholic curates Bajza, Fandli, and Bernolak, especially the
      last. A society was formed, the members of which bound themselves
      to buy the books written in Slovakish by Bernolak and his
      friends. The Romanists proceeded in the work with great zeal and
      activity, and were patronized by the cardinal Rudnay, primate of
      Hungary; who himself published some of his orations held in the
      Slovakian dialect, and caused a voluminous Slovakish dictionary,
      a posthumous work of Bernolak's, to be printed.<a name=

      Bohemian republic of letters,&mdash;especially during the course
      of the seventeenth century, when most of the native Bohemians had
      been banished from it,&mdash;feared to endanger the cause of
      literature itself by innovations of this kind. They too united
      themselves into a society, and founded a professorship of
      Bohemian-Slovakian literature at the Lyceum of Pressburg, which

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HISTORY OF THE POLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      The regions of the Baltic and Lower Vistula, after the Goths and
      Vandals had finally left them, were occupied, towards the fourth
      century, by the Lettonians and Lithuanians, who are according to
      some historians Slavic, and according to others Finnic-Scythic
      tribes.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id=
      "FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_217_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> It appears, that the
      various nations which inhabited this country were by the ancients
      comprised under the name of Sarmatae. In the sixth, or according
      to others, in the seventh century, the Lekhes, a people kindred
      to the Czekhes, and coming like them from the Carpathian regions,
      whence they were urged forwards by the Bulgarians, settled on the
      banks of the Vistula and Varta. Lekh (Ljakh) signified in old
      Bohemian a free and noble man, and had<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">[pg.223]</a></span>
      this meaning still in the fourteenth century.<a name=
      "FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_218_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> The Lekhes were divided
      into several tribes, of which, according to Nestor, at first only
      those who settled on the vast plains, <i>polie</i>, of the
      Ukraine, were called <i>Polyane</i>, Poles, i.e. inhabitants of
      the plain. The tribes which occupied Masovia were called
      <i>Masovshane</i>; the Lekhes who went to Pomerania,
      <i>Pomoriane</i>, etc. The specific name of <i>Poles</i>, as
      applied to all the Lekhish tribes together, does not appear until
      the close of the tenth century, when the generic appellation of
      Lekhes or Ljakhes had perished. In the year 840, the chiefs of
      the different tribes united themselves under one common head; at
      that time they are said to have chosen a husbandman by the name
      of Pjast for their duke, and the male descendants of this, their
      first prince, lived and reigned not less than six hundred and
      thirty years. From Germany and Bohemia Christianity was carried
      to Poland by Romish priests, probably as early as the ninth
      century. In the beginning of the tenth, some attempts were made
      to introduce the Slavic liturgy into Poland. Both species of
      worship existed for some time peacefully side by side; and even
      when, through the exertions of the Latin priesthood, the Slavic
      liturgy was gradually superseded by the occidental rites, the
      former was at least tolerated; and after the invention of
      printing, the Polish city of Cracow was the first place where
      books in the Old Slavic dialect, and portions of the Old Slavic
      Bible, were printed.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id=
      "FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_219_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 965, the duke Miecislav married the Bohemian princess
      Dombrovka, and caused himself to be baptized. From<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">[pg.224]</a></span>
      that time onward, all the Polish princes and the greatest part of
      the nation became Christians. There is however not one among the
      Slavic nations, in which the influence Christianity must
      necessarily have exerted on its mental cultivation, is so little
      visible; while upon its language it exerted none at all. It has
      ever been and is still a favourite opinion of some Slavic
      philologists, that several of the Slavic nations must have
      possessed the art of writing long before their acquaintance with
      the Latin alphabet, or the invention of the Cyrillic system; and
      among the arguments by which they maintain this view, there are
      indeed some too striking to be wholly set aside. But neither from
      those early times, nor from the four or five centuries after the
      introduction of Christianity, does there remain any monument
      whatever of the Polish language; nay, with the exception of a few
      fragments without value, the most ancient document of that
      language extant is not older than the sixteenth century. Until
      that time the Latin idiom reigned exclusively in Poland. The
      teachers of Christianity in this country were for nearly five
      centuries foreigners, viz. Germans and Italians. Hence arose that
      unnatural neglect of the vernacular tongue, of which these were
      ignorant; the private influence of the German, still visible in
      the Polish language; and the unlimited dominion of the Latin.
      Slavic, Polish, and heathenish, were to them synonymous words.
      Thus, while the light of Christianity everywhere carried the
      first dawn of life into the night of Slavic antiquity, the early
      history of Poland affords more than any other part of the
      Christian world a melancholy proof, how the passions and
      blindness of men operated to counterbalance that holy influence.
      But although so unfavourably disposed towards the language, it
      cannot be said that the influence of the foreign clergy was in
      other respects injurious to the literary cultivation of the
      country. Benedictine monks founded in the beginning of the
      eleventh century the first<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_225" id="page_225">[pg.225]</a></span> Polish schools; and
      numerous convents of their own and other orders presented to the
      scholar an asylum, both when in the year 1241 the Mongols broke
      into the country, and also during the civil wars which were
      caused by the family dissensions of Pjast's successors. Several
      chronicles in Latin were written by Poles long before the history
      of the Polish literature begins; and Polish noblemen went to
      Paris, Bologna, and Prague, to study sciences, for the very
      elements of which their own language afforded them no means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polish writers are in the habit of dividing the history of their
      language into five periods.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id=
      "FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_220_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>first</i> period extends from the introduction of
      Christianity to Cassimir the Great, A.D. 1333.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>second</i> period extends from A.D. 1333 to A.D. 1506, or
      the reign of Sigismund I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>third</i> period is the golden age of the Polish
      literature, and closes with the foundation of the schools of the
      Jesuits, A.D. 1622.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fourth</i> period comprises the time of the preponderance
      of the Jesuits, and ends with the revival of literature by
      Konarski, A.D. 1760.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>fifth</i> period comprehends the interval from A.D. 1760
      to the revolution in 1830.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Polish literature of our own day bears a different stamp
      from that of former times, we may add a <i>sixth</i> period,
      extending from 1830 to the present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we enter upon a regular historical account of these
      different periods, we will devote a few words to the history and
      character of the language itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extent of country, in which the Polish language is
      predominant, is much smaller than would naturally be
      concluded<span class="newpage"><a name="page_226" id=
      "page_226">[pg.226]</a></span> from the great circuit of
      territory, which, at the time of its power and independence, was
      comprised under the kingdom of Poland. We do not allude to the
      sixteenth century, when Poland by the success of its arms became
      for a short time the most powerful state in the north; when the
      Teutonic knights, the conquerors of Prussia, were compelled to
      acknowledge its protection; and when not only were Livonia and
      Courland, the one a component part of the Polish kingdom, and the
      other a Polish fief, but even the ancient Smolensk and the
      venerable Kief, the royal seat of Vladimir, and the Russian
      provinces adjacent to Galicia, all were subjugated by Poland. We
      speak of this kingdom as it was at the time of its first
      partition between Russia, Austria, and Prussia. Of the four or
      five millions of inhabitants in the provinces united with Russia
      at the three successive partitions of 1772, 1793, and 1795, only
      one and a half million are strictly Poles, that is, Lekhes, who
      speak dialects of that language;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id=
      "FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_221_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> in White and Black
      Russia, the Russniaks are by far more numerous; and in Lithuania
      the Lithuanians. Besides the independent language of these
      latter, the Malo-Russian and White Russian dialects are spoken in
      these provinces; and all documents of the grand-duchy of
      Lithuania before it was united with Poland in A.D. 1569, were
      written in the latter.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id=
      "FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_222_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Polish language is farther spoken: 1) By the
      inhabitants<span class="newpage"><a name="page_227" id=
      "page_227">[pg.227]</a></span> of the kingdom of Poland formed in
      1815, three and a half millions in number, or reckoned together
      with the Poles of the Polish-Russian provinces, five millions; 2)
      By the inhabitants of the cities and the nobility of Galicia,
      belonging to Austria, and the Poles in the Austrian part of
      Silesia, about three millions; 3) By the inhabitants of the small
      republic of Cracow, about one hundred thousand; 4) By the
      inhabitants of the Prussian grand-duchy of Posen, and a part of
      the province called Western Prussia, together with the Poles in
      Silesia and the Kassubes in Pomerania; In all less than two
      millions.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id=
      "FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_223_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Polish language is spoken by a population of about ten
      millions.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id=
      "FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_224_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> Like all living
      languages, it has different dialects, and is in one place spoken
      with greater purity than in another. As these varieties, however,
      are neither very striking nor have ever had an influence on
      literature, they do not concern us here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient Polish language seems to have been very nearly
      related to the dialects of the Czekhes and the Sorabian Vendes.
      Although very little is known in respect to the circumstances and
      progress of the formation of the language into its present state,
      it is sufficiently obvious, that it has been developed from the
      conflict of its natural elements with the Latin and German
      idioms. Of the other Slavic dialects, the Bohemian is the only
      one which has exerted any influence upon the Polish tongue. The
      Italian and Turkish words introduced during the dominion of an
      Italian priesthood, and through the political relations of the
      Poles and the Turks, never entered deeply into the body
      of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_228" id=
      "page_228">[pg.228]</a></span> the language; and might be easily
      exchanged for better Polish forms of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the Slavic dialects, the Polish presents to the foreigner
      the most difficulties; partly on account of the great variety and
      nicety of shades in the pronunciation of the vowels, and from the
      combination of consonants in such a way that only a Slavic tongue
      can conquer them, and cause the apparent harshness in some
      measure to disappear;<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id=
      "FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_225_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> partly on account of its
      refined and artificial grammatical structure. In this latter
      respect it differs materially from the Russian language; which,
      although equally rich, is remarkable for its simplicity and
      perspicuity. The Polish and Bohemian idioms, in the opinion of
      the best judges, are above all others capable of faithfully
      imitating the refinements of the classical languages; and the
      Polish prose is modelled after the Latin with a perfection,
      which, in the golden age of Polish literature, was one of its
      characteristic features. It is therefore surprising, that the
      Polish language in poetry, although in other respects highly
      cultivated, does not admit the introduction of the classical
      prosody. We mean, the Polish language in its present state; for
      it is very probable, that in its original character it possessed,
      in common with all the other Slavic languages, the elements of a
      regular system of <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> syllables. So
      long, however, as there have existed Polish poets, they have not
      measured, but, in imitation of the French, have <i>counted</i>
      the syllables. With the exception of a few recent poets, who have
      written in blank verse, and a few weak attempts to adapt the
      Greek principles of accent to the Polish language, all Polish
      poetry is, like the French, in rhyme;<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_229" id="page_229">[pg.229]</a></span>
      and the French Alexandrine is the favourite form of the Polish
      poets.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id=

    <h4>
      FIRST PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>From the introduction of Christianity to Casimir the Great,
      A.D. 1333.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In dividing the early part of the history of the Polish
      literature into two periods, we follow the example and authority
      of Bentkowski; although it seems to be singular to pretend to
      give an account of a literature which did not yet exist. The
      history of the Polish literature does not indeed properly begin
      before the close of the second period; yet that of the
      <i>literary cultivation</i> of the nation commences with the
      beginning of that period; and a few slight traces of it are to be
      found even in the middle of the first. Of the language itself,
      nothing is left but the names of places and persons, and some
      Polish words scattered through the Latin documents of the time,
      written without orthographic rules, and therefore often hardly
      intelligible. There exists an ancient Polish war-song, the author
      of which is said to have been St. Adalbert, a Bohemian by birth,
      who was bishop of Prague at the end of the tenth century;<a name=
      "FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_227_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> but even according to
      Rakowiecki, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_230" id=
      "page_230">[pg.230]</a></span> a philologist who is more disposed
      than any other to find traces of an <i>early</i> cultivation of
      the Slavic nations, and especially of the Poles, this song, or
      rather hymn, is, in its present form, not older than the
      fourteenth century. All that is extant from this period is
      written in Latin. Besides some unimportant documents and an
      anonymous biography of Adalbert, there remain several historical
      works of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin Gallus, a Frenchman, who lived in Poland between 1110 and
      1135, is considered as the oldest Polish historian. Other
      chronicles of Poland were written by the bishops of Cracow,
      Matthew Cholewa, and Vincent, son of Kadlubec, who died in 1223;
      by Bogufal, bishop of Posen, some twenty years later; and by
      Godzislav Baszko, about thirty years later still. Strzembski
      wrote towards the middle of the thirteenth century a history of
      the popes and Roman emperors. In 1008 duke Boleslav, the son of
      Miecislav, invited Benedictine monks to Poland, who founded
      convents at Sieciechov and Lysagora, with schools attached to
      them. This example was followed at a later period by other
      orders: and in Poland, longer than in any other country,
      education was entirely in the hands of the ecclesiastics. For
      several hundred years the natives were excluded from all clerical
      dignities and privileges, and the numerous monasteries were
      filled only with foreign monks. Even as late as the fifteenth
      century, foreigners had decidedly the preference. In the year
      1237 Pelka, archbishop of Gnesen, directed the institution of
      schools by the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_231" id=
      "page_231">[pg.231]</a></span> priests; but added the
      recommendation to the bishops, that they should employ as
      teachers only Germans who understood Polish. In A.D. 1285 at the
      synod of Leczyc, they went a step further in excluding all
      foreigners, who were ignorant of the Polish language, from the
      places of ecclesiastical teachers and instructors. But more than
      eighty years later, it was found necessary at the synod of Kalish
      in 1357 to repeat the same decree; and even a century after this
      time, in A.D. 1460, John Ostrorog complained that all the rich
      convents were occupied by foreign monks.<a name=
      "FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_228_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> These ignorant men were
      wont to throw into the fire the few writings in the barbarian
      language, which they could discover; and, as instructors of the
      youth, were able to fill the heads of the young nobility with the
      most unnatural prejudices against the vernacular tongue of their
      own country. Besides the clergy, many other foreigners also
      settled in Poland, as mechanics and traders, especially Germans.
      But as they all lived merely in the cities of Poland, they and
      their language had far less influence on the people, than was the
      case in Bohemia, where they mingled with all classes.

      Casimir is one of the few princes, who acquired the name of the

      benefits of laws, national courts of justice, and means of
      education, which he procured for his subjects. His father,
      Vladislaus Lokietek, had resumed the royal title, which hitherto
      had been<span class="newpage"><a name="page_232" id=
      "page_232">[pg.232]</a></span> alternately taken and dropped; and
      was the first who permanently united Great and Little Poland.
      Under Casimir, the present Austrian kingdom of Galicia, which,
      together with Lodomeria, the present Russian government Vladimir,
      was then called Red Russia, was added by inheritance. Lithuania
      became connected with Poland as a Polish fief in the year 1386.
      when queen Hedevig, heiress of the crown of Poland, married
      Jagello, duke of Lithuania; but was first completely incorporated
      as a component part of the kingdom of Poland only so late as the
      year 1569. Masovia had been thus united some forty years earlier.
      At the time of the marriage of Hedevig and Jagello, the latter
      caused himself to be baptized, and introduced Christianity into
      Lithuania, where he himself in many cases acted as an apostle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the influence of Casimir the Great upon the literary
      cultivation of his subjects, it was more mediate than immediate.
      Whilst his cotemporary and neighbour, Charles IV of Bohemia,
      loved and patronized the language of that kindred nation. Casimir
      paid no attention whatever to the vernacular tongue of his
      country; nor was any thing done under his administration for the
      development of that rich dialect. This king indeed, as early as
      A.D. 1347, laid the foundation of the high school of Cracow; but
      the regular organization and influence of this institution dates
      only from half a century later.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id=
      "FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_229_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> But by introducing a
      better order of things, by providing his subjects with their
      earliest code of laws, by instituting the first constitutional
      diets, by fortifying the cities and protecting the tillers of the
      soil against a wild and oppressive nobility, he established a
      better tone of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_233" id=
      "page_233">[pg.233]</a></span> moral feeling throughout the
      nation. A seed, sown in such ground, necessarily springs up
      slowly, but surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Casimir the race of the Pjasts expired. His nephew, Louis of
      Hungary, a prince of the house of Anjou, was elected king; but
      his reign was spent in constant war, and left no trace of care
      for the internal cultivation of the country. The limitation of
      the power of the sovereign, and the exorbitant privileges of the
      Polish nobility, date from the reign of this prince; he resided
      mostly in Hungary, and granted to the Poles all their demands, in
      order to prevent the alienation of their crown from his house.
      After his death his second daughter, Hedevig, was preferred to
      the emperor Sigismund, who was married to the eldest, Mary;
      because this prince refused to subscribe the conditions demanded
      by the Polish Estates. Hedevig married Jagello of Lithuania; and
      under their descendants the Jagellons, who reigned nearly two
      centuries, Poland rose to the summit of its power and glory. With
      Siegmund I, the grandson of Jagello, but the fifth king after
      him, a new period of the Polish literature begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the Polish language, as we have already said,
      properly commences only with the close, or at the utmost with the
      middle of the present period, when in the year 1488 the first
      printing office was erected at Cracow. Of the more ancient times,
      with a few exceptions, only weak and scattered traces are left.
      There was said to have existed a Polish translation of the Bible,
      made by order of queen Hedevig before the year 1390; but no copy
      had ever been seen; and there was reason to doubt whether it ever
      existed. There was extant however, an old manuscript of a
      Psalter, which the antiquarian Thadd. Czacki took to be a
      fragment of it; and other ancient manuscripts of portions of a
      Psalter were found at Saros Patak in Hungary, and seemed to
      belong to it. But no one of these codices bore any incontestable
      mark of its age. The Psalter of St. Florian, a convent near
      Linz<span class="newpage"><a name="page_234" id=
      "page_234">[pg.234]</a></span> in Austria, discovered in 1826 by
      the librarian Chmel, proved at last to be in reality the lost
      treasure. This important document, the origin of which could be
      philologically and historically traced back to the fourteenth
      century, after having given occasion to a passionate conflict in
      the Slavic literary world, was finally published by Kopitar in a
      complete and erudite edition, as the most ancient monument of the
      Polish language.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id=
      "FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_230_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      All other Polish manuscripts of those times are fragments;
      documents relating to suits of law, translations of statutes
      issued in Latin, the ten commandments in verse, a translation of
      one of Wickliffe's hymns, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orthography of the language, and especially the adoption of
      the Latin alphabet, seems to have troubled the few writers of
      this period exceedingly. They appear to have founded their
      principles alternately on the Latin, the Bohemian, and the German
      methods of combining letters; an inconsistency, which adds
      greatly to the difficulties of modern Slavic etymology.<a name=
      "FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_231_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> In 1828 a remarkable
      manuscript was published under the title, <i>Pamientniki
      Janozara</i>, or Memoirs of a Janissary. It was the journal of a
      Polish nobleman, who had been induced by circumstances to enter
      the Turkish army during the siege and conquest of Constantinople,
      an event which took place A.D. 1453. This interesting document of
      a language, that is so remarkably poor in ancient monuments, was
      no longer intelligible to the common Polish reader. It was
      necessary to add a version in modern Polish in order to make it
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annalists of Polish history, who wrote in Latin, were not wanting
      in this period. Sig. Rositzius, Dzierzva,<a name=

      In northern climates, the bright and glowing days of summer
      follow in almost immediate succession a long and gloomy winter,
      without allowing to the attentive mind of the lover of nature the
      enjoyment of observing, during a transient interval of spring,
      the gradual development of the beauty of the earth. Thus the
      flowers of Polish literature burst out from their buds with a
      rapidity unequalled in literary history, and were ripened into
      fruit with the same prodigious celerity.

      The university of Cracow had been reinstituted under Jagello in
      A.D. 1400, and organized after the model of that of Prague.
      Although the most flourishing period of this institution was the
      sixteenth century, yet it presented during the fifteenth to the
      Polish nobility a good opportunity of studying the classics; and
      it is doubtless through this preparatory familiarity with the
      ancient writers, that the phenomenon to which we have alluded
      must be principally accounted for. It was moreover now the epoch,
      when the genius of Christian Europe made the most decided efforts
      to shake off the chains which had fettered the freedom of
      thought. The doctrines of the German Reformers, although the
      number of their professed disciples was in proportion smaller
      than in Bohemia, had nevertheless a decided influence upon the
      general direction of the public mind. The wild flame of false
      religious zeal, which in Poland also under the sons<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">[pg.236]</a></span>
      and immediate successors of Jagello, had kindled the faggots in
      which the disciples of the new doctrines were called to seal the
      truth of their conviction with their blood, was extinguished
      before the milder wisdom of Sigismund I; although the early part
      of his reign was not free from religious persecution. The
      activity of the inquisition was restrained. But the new doctrines
      found a more decided support in Sigismund Augustus. Poland
      became, under his administration, the seat of a toleration then
      unequalled in the world. Communities of the most different
      religious principles formed themselves, at first under the
      indulgence of the king and the government, and finally under the
      protection of the law. Even the boldest theological skeptics of
      the age, the two Socini, found in Poland an asylum.<a name=
      "FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_233_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohemian language, which already possessed so extensive
      a<span class="newpage"><a name="page_237" id=
      "page_237">[pg.237]</a></span> literature, acquired during this
      period a great influence upon the Polish. The number of clerical
      writers, however, which in Bohemia was so great, was
      comparatively only small in Poland. Indeed it is worthy of
      remark, that while in other countries the diffusion of
      information and general illumination proceeded from the clergy,
      not indeed as a body, but from individuals among the clergy, in
      Poland it was always the highest nobility who were at the head of
      literary enterprises or institutions for mental cultivation.
      There are many princely names among the writers of this period;
      and there are still so among those of the present day. This may
      however be one of the causes, why education in Poland was
      entirely confined to the higher classes; while, even during this
      brilliant period, the peasantry remained in the lowest state of
      degradation, and <i>nothing</i> was done to elevate their minds
      or to better their condition. For it is to the clergy, that the
      common people have always to look as their natural and bounden
      teachers; it is to the clergy, that a low state of cultivation
      among the poorer classes is the most dishonourable. During this
      period, however, the opportunity was presented to the people of
      becoming better acquainted with the Scriptures, through several
      translations of them into the Polish language, not only by the
      different Protestant denominations, but also by the Romanists
      themselves. Indeed, with the exceptions above mentioned, all the
      translations of the Bible extant in the Polish language are from
      the sixteenth or the beginning of the seventeenth
      century.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id=
      "FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      We meet also, among the productions of the literature of this
      period, a few catechisms and postillac, written expressly for the
      instruction of the common people by some eminent Lutheran and
      reformed Polish ministers. But the want of means for acquiring
      even the most elementary information, was so great, that only a
      very few among the lower classes were able to read them. The
      doctrines of the Reformers, which every where else were favoured
      principally by the middle and lower classes, in Poland found
      their chief support among the nobility. Comparatively few of the
      people adhered to them. There was a time, between 1550 and 1650,
      when half the senate,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id=
      "FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_235_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> and even
      more<span class="newpage"><a name="page_239" id=
      "page_239">[pg.239]</a></span> than half of the nobility,
      consisted of Lutherans and Calvinists. In the year 1570, these
      two denominations, together with the Bohemian Brethren, formed a
      union of their churches by the treaty of Sendomir for external or
      political purposes. In 1573, by another treaty known under the
      name of <i>pax dissidentium</i>, they were acknowledged by the
      state and the king, and all the rights of the Catholics were
      granted to the members of these three denominations, and also to
      the Greeks and Armenians. The want, however, of an accurate
      determination of their mutual relation to each other, occasioned
      repeatedly in the course of the following century bloody
      dissensions. The Protestants succeeded, nevertheless, in
      maintaining their rights, until the years 1717 and 1718, when
      their number having gradually yet considerably diminished, they
      were deprived of their suffrages in the diet. Their adversaries
      went still further; and, after struggling against oppression of
      all sorts, the dissidents had at length, in 1736, to be contented
      with being acknowledged as <i>tolerated sects</i>. After the
      accession of Stanislaus Poniatowsky to the throne in 1766, the
      dissidents attempted to regain their former rights. In this they
      were supported by several Protestant powers; but more especially
      by Russia, who thus improved the opportunity of increasing its
      influence in Polish affairs. In consequence of this powerful
      support, the laws directed against the dissidents were repealed;
      and in 1775 all their old privileges were restored to them,
      except the right of being eligible to the stations of
      ministers<span class="newpage"><a name="page_240" id=
      "page_240">[pg.240]</a></span> of state and senators. In more
      recent times the Protestants have been admitted to all the rights
      of the Catholics; although the Roman Catholic is still the
      predominant religion of the kingdom of Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have permitted ourselves this digression, and anticipation of
      time; although we shall have an opportunity of again returning to
      this subject. The influence of Protestantism on the literature of
      Poland cannot be denied; although its doctrines and their
      immediate consequence, the private examination and interpretation
      of the Scriptures, have occupied the minds and pens of the Poles
      less than those of any other nation among whom they have been
      received. We now return to the sixteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Polish language acquired during this period such a degree of
      refinement, that even on the revival of literature and taste in
      modern times, it was necessary to add nothing for its
      improvement; although the course of time naturally had occasioned
      some changes. Several able men occupied themselves with its
      systematic culture by means of grammars and dictionaries.
      Zaborowski, Statorius, and Januscowski wrote grammars; Macynski
      compiled the first dictionary. The first part of Knapski's
      <i>Thesaurus</i>, an esteemed work even at the present day, was
      first published in 1621, and may therefore be considered as a
      production of this period. But the practical use, which so many
      gifted writers made of the language for a variety of subjects,
      contributed still more to its cultivation. The point in which it
      acquired less perfection, and which appeared the most difficult
      to subject to fixed rules, was that of orthography. That the
      Latin alphabet is not fully adapted to express Slavic sounds, is
      evident in the Polish language. Indeed the reputed harshness of
      this language rests partly on the manner in which they were
      obliged to combine several consonants, which to the eye of the
      occidental European can only be united by intermediate vowels. On
      the other hand,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_241" id=
      "page_241">[pg.241]</a></span> it is just this system of letters
      which forms a connecting link between the Polish language and
      those of western Europe; and although most Slavic philologists
      regret that the Latin alphabet ever should have been adopted for
      any Slavic language in preference to the Cyrillic, yet Grimm
      (with whom we fully agree) thinks that "the adoption of the
      former, with appropriate additions corresponding to the peculiar
      sounds of each language and dialect, would have been beneficial
      to all European languages."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id=

      Although the art of printing was introduced into Poland as early
      as 1488, when the first printing office was established at
      Cracow, yet printed books first became generally diffused between
      the years 1530 and 1540. The first work printed in Poland was a
      calendar for the year 1490; the first book printed in the Polish
      language was Bonaventura's life of Jesus, translated for the
      queen of Hungary, and published in 1522. In the second half of
      the sixteenth century nearly every city, which had a considerable
      school, had also its printing office.<a name="FNanchor_237_237"
      id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_237_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> The schools were
      unfortunately confined to the cities; nothing was done for the
      peasantry, who have remained even to the most recent times in a
      state of physical and moral degradation, with which that of the
      common people of no other country except Russia can be compared.
      A peasant who could read or write, would have been considered as
      a prodigy. So much the more, however, was done for the national
      education of the nobility. In the year 1579 the university of
      Wilna was instituted; in 1594, another university was created at
      Zamosc in Little Poland, by a private nobleman, the great
      chancellor Zamoyski; which however survived only a few years, and
      perished in the beginning of the<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_242" id="page_242">[pg.242]</a></span> seventeenth
      century.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id=
      "FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_238_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> Numerous other schools
      of a less elevated character were founded at Thorn, Dantzic,
      Lissa, etc. most of them for Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      So early as under Casimir, the son of Jagello, the Polish
      language began to be employed as the language of the court. Under
      his grandson Sigismund Augustus, the public laws and decrees were
      promulgated in the vernacular tongue of the country. But a
      language which thus issued from the court, was necessarily also
      dependent on the changes of the court. The influence of the
      French prince, Henry of Valois, successor of Sigismund Augustus,
      could not be considerable, as he occupied the throne only two
      months. But Stephen Bathory, prince of Transylvania, the
      brother-in-law of Sigismund Augustus, who was elected after Henry
      of Valois had deserted the country, was as a foreigner in the
      habit of interspersing his conversation and writings with Latin
      words, when the proper Polish words, of which language he had
      only an imperfect knowledge, did not occur to him. It is hardly
      credible that such a habit, or rather the imitation of it among
      his courtiers, could have had any influence on a language already
      so well established and cultivated, as the Polish idiom was at
      the close of the sixteenth century. The Polish literary
      historians, however, ascribe to Bathory's influence the fashion,
      which began at this time to prevail, of debasing the purity of
      the Polish language by an intermixture of Latin words and
      phrases.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id=
      "FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_239_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a>
    </p>

      Although the Polish literature acquired during this period a kind
      of universality, and there were few departments of science,
      familiar to that age, which were not to some extent cultivated in
      it, yet it owes its principal lustre to the contributions made in
      it<span class="newpage"><a name="page_243" id=
      "page_243">[pg.243]</a></span> to history, poetry and rhetoric.
      The didactic style did not reach the perfection of the
      historical; nor did Polish literature acquire any wide domain in
      purely scientific productions. In accordance with the national
      tendency, the mass of distinguished talents was devoted to those
      interests, which yield an immediate profit in life, or which are
      themselves rather the results of empirical knowledge, than of
      abstract contemplation, viz. to politics, to eloquence, and to
      poetry, in so far as this latter is considered not as a creative
      power, but as the most appropriate means for expressing and
      describing the emotions, passions, and actions of man. There have
      however always been not a few gifted Poles, who have cultivated
      the field of science for its own sake, without reference to the
      practical importance of their labours; and there are more
      especially at the present time many distinguished names among the
      Polish mathematicians, natural philosophers, and chemists. In
      Copernicus himself, born indeed of parents of German extraction,
      and in a city (Thorn) mostly inhabited by German colonists, but
      also born a Polish subject and educated in a Polish university,
      Poland and Germany seem to have equal rights.<a name=
      "FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_240_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal reason why didactic prose did not acquire the same
      degree of cultivation as the historical style, is, that
      all<span class="newpage"><a name="page_244" id=
      "page_244">[pg.244]</a></span> scientific works during this
      period, which was that of the formation of the language, were
      written by preference in Latin. Indeed, the authority of the
      classical languages did not suffer at all from the rising of the
      national literature. It is on the contrary a remarkable fact,
      that the cultivation of the vernacular tongue of the country, and
      the study of the Latin language in Poland, have ever proceeded
      with equal steps. The most eminent writers and orators of this
      period, who employed the Polish language, managed also the Latin
      with the greatest skill and dexterity. Even for common
      conversation, Latin and Polish were used alternately. Sigismund
      I, when separated from his first queen, Barbara Zapolska,
      maintained with her a correspondence in Latin; his second queen,
      Bona Sforza, used to employ that language in their most familiar
      intercourse.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id=
      "FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_241_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> Choisnin, in his Memoirs
      of the election of Henry of Valois, observes, that among a
      hundred Polish noblemen, there were hardly to be found two, who
      did not understand Latin, German, and Italian; and Martin Kromer
      goes so far as to state, that perhaps in Latium itself fewer
      persons had spoken Latin fluently than in Poland.<a name=

      Latin poet Casimir Sarbiewski, in Latin Sarbievus, spread through
      all Europe. Most Polish poets were equally successful both in
      Polish and Latin verse. As the former language first developed
      itself in poetry, we therefore, in our enumeration of the
      principal writers of this time, begin with the poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the influence of the classics, and, above all, that of the
      Italian literature, is very distinctly perceived. Rey of
      Naglowic, ob. 1569, is called the father of Polish poetry. Most
      of his <span class="newpage"><a name="page_245" id=
      "page_245">[pg.245]</a></span> productions are of the religious
      kind, chiefly in verse, but also orations and postillæ. His chief
      work was a translation of the Psalms.<a name="FNanchor_243_243"
      id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_243_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      His principal followers were the Kochanowskis, a name of
      threefold lustre. John Kochanowski, ob. 1584, by far the most
      distinguished of them, published likewise a translation of
      David's Psalms, which is still considered as a classical work; in
      his other poems, Pindar, Anacreon, and Horace, were alternately
      his models, without diminishing the original value of his
      pieces.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id=
      "FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_244_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> Adam Mickiewicz compares
      him, in respect to the brevity, conciseness, and terseness of his
      expression, with the last named Roman poet; in reference to his
      treatment of the classic elements, to Goethe. His brother Andrew
      translated Virgil's Æneid; his nephew Peter, with more talent and
      success, the great epics of Tasso and Ariosto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rybinski maintains, as a lyric poet, in the opinion of several
      critics, the same rank with John Kochanowski; like him he wrote
      Polish and Latin verses, and was created poet laureate. Simon
      Szymonowicz, called Simonides, ob. 1629, obtained likewise the
      poetical crown from the pope Clement VIII; indeed his Latin odes
      secured him a lasting fame throughout all Europe, and procured
      him the appellation of the Latin Pindar. In Polish he wrote
      mostly idylls, after the model of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus;
      but these, as their chief merit consists in the sweetness and
      delicacy of the language, only natives are able fully to
      appreciate.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id=

      The productions of his friend and contemporary Zimorowicz have
      the same general character, but are of less value in respect to
      diction. Other lyrical poets of merit may be named; e.g. the
      archbishop of Lemberg, Grochowski, a very productive writer;
      Czahrowski, Klonowicz, called also Acernus, and others.<a name=
      "FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_246_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> As poets of a religious
      character we name here together, without reference to the
      denomination to which they belonged,&mdash;since most of the
      Polish poetical productions of this age were of a higher
      character than to suffer the intrusion of
      polemics,&mdash;Dambrowski, Bartoszewski, Miaskowski, whoso hymns
      are considered as the finest of that period, Sudrovius,
      Turnowski, and others. The age was also rich in satires and
      epigrams, Polish as well as Latin. Productions of this class by
      the two Zbylitowskis, Pudlowski, Kraiewski, and a great many
      others, are still extant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facility of rhyme in a language so rich in rhymes as the
      Polish, seduced several writers to use verse as a vehicle for the
      most trivial thoughts, or for subjects the very nature of which
      is opposed to poetry. Thus Paprocki of Glogol, who is esteemed as
      a diligent historian and accurate investigator of the past, wrote
      his numerous works on genealogy and heraldry mostly in
      rhyme.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id=
      "FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_247_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> Other historical poems
      were also written, which perhaps would not have been utterly
      deficient in merit, had they been transferred into prose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloquence, so nearly related to poetry, and which, nevertheless,
      perhaps on that very account, should be distinguished from it by
      the most definite limits, is a gift, the cultivation of
      which<span class="newpage"><a name="page_247" id=
      "page_247">[pg.247]</a></span> may be expected above all in a
      republic. The Poles possess indeed all the necessary qualities
      for public orators; and eminent talents not only for poetical
      eloquence, but also for the pulpit, are not uncommon among them.
      Gornicki, ob. after 1591, Czarnkowski, Odachowski, and others,
      but especially the first named, were considered as the most
      distinguished orators of the age. The eloquence of the pulpit was
      exhibited in its highest eminence by Peter Skarga, court preacher
      of Sigismund III, whom his cotemporaries used to call the Polish
      Chrysostom; and by the learned Jesuit Wuiek, who also translated
      the Bible into Polish.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id=
      "FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_248_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> The sermons and orations
      of both of them, besides numerous other theological productions,
      were published at the time. Other theological writers of some
      distinction were, among the Catholics, Stanislaus Karnkowski,
      archbishop of Gnesen, Bierkowski, who was Skarga's successor,
      Bialobrzeski, Kuczborski, the Jesuit Rosciszewski, and others;
      among the Protestants, Seklucyan, the translator of the Polish
      Bible for Protestants;<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id=
      "FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_249_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> Koszutski of Zarnowec,
      Radomski, Gilowski, and Budny, one of the leaders of the
      Unitarians, who also translated the Bible into Polish from the
      original languages.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id=
      "FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_250_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> We must remark, that the
      Polish theological literature of this period evinced much less of
      a polemical spirit than might have been expected, in an age when
      that of the neighbouring countries, Bohemia and Germany, abounded
      in controversial books and pamphlets, replete with unchristian
      bitterness and doctrinal rigidity. For productions of this
      character we have to look in Poland to the following period. The
      wise moderation of the two Sigismunds, and of Stephen Bathory,
      seems to have had a prodigious influence on the minds of the
      nation, to pacify them and keep them within appropriate limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      History, especially national history, was justly considered as
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_248" id=
      "page_248">[pg.248]</a></span> one of the subjects most worthy of
      human attention. History is the great school, in which nations
      appear as the pupils, experience as the teacher; and the fate of
      mankind depends on a wise application of the great moral lessons
      which they daily receive. Most of the Polish historians of this
      ago preferred however the Latin language; but their productions
      are too intimately connected with Poland to be separated from its
      literature, and may, therefore, be named here. The Polish
      chronicle written by Matthew of Miechow, body physician to
      Sigismund I, and published in 1521, was the first historical work
      printed in Poland. Martin Kromer, bishop of Ermeland or Warmia,
      called the Livy of Poland, Wapowski, Guagnini, an Italian, but
      naturalized and ennobled in Poland, and Piasecki, a Protestant,
      distinguished for his frankness, wrote works on Polish history;
      Koialowicz, on that of Lithuania. They all wrote in Latin. The
      first who published an historical work in Polish was Martin
      Bielski, ob. 1576. His chronicle of Poland, which is of value in
      every respect, is written in a style so beautiful, that it was
      called <i>le style d'or</i>. His son Joachim continued this work
      as far as to the reign of Sigismund III.<a name=
      "FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_251_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> Another Polish
      chronicle, compiled with more erudition than taste, was written
      by Stryikowski, the author of numerous works on various subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other writers of merit, some of whom published original works on
      portions of history, while some translated the Latin volumes of
      their countrymen, or those of classic historical authors, were
      Wargocki, the Polish translator of Julius Cæsar, and other Roman
      writers; Orzechowski, also lauded as an orator; Januszowski,
      Blazowski, Paszkowski, Cyprian Bazylik, and others. Works on
      tactics were published by John Tarnowski, a general<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">[pg.249]</a></span>
      celebrated in his time; by Strubicz, and Cielecki. Collections of
      statutes and laws were made by Herbart, Sapieha, Groicki,
      Sarnicki, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several memoirs referring to this period, and written during it,
      have been first published in our days; since the value of
      cotemporary historical documents has begun to be sufficiently
      appreciated. One of these publications (Wilna, 1844) is a
      chronicle referring to the first half of the sixteenth century;
      and was written by John Tarnowski, the general mentioned above.
      The manuscript had been long considered as lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It still remains to note the progress made in the philosophical
      sciences. We remarked above, that scientific works in Poland were
      mostly written in Latin; and since the case with them is
      different from that of historical works,&mdash;because, as the
      results of scientific examination and discovery, they are
      independent of the country where they are written, and belong to
      the world,&mdash;we therefore mention here only those works which
      were published in the Polish language. Falimierz, in Latin
      Phalimirus, first ventured to use the vernacular tongue of the
      country for a scientific book. He published as early as 1534 a
      work on natural history, and especially <i>Materia medica</i>.
      The first medical work in the Polish language was written in 1541
      by Peter of Kobylin; the first mathematical work by Grzebski.
      Their example was followed by Latosz, Rosciszewski, Andrew of
      Kobylin, Umiastowski, Spiczynski, Siennik, Oczko, Grutinius,
      Syrenski, in Latin Sirenius, and others, all physicians,
      astronomers, botanists, etc.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id=

      only of the nobility.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id=
      "FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href=

      strength kept the discordant elements together; and while at home
      he took care to improve the administration of justice, and
      erected the high tribunals of Petricau, Lublin, and Wilna, his
      victorious arms in his contest with Russia raised Poland for a
      short time to the summit of its glory. But under his successor
      Sigismund III, a Swedish prince, and nephew of Sigismund Augustus
      and of Stephen, began that anarchy which is to be considered as
      the principal cause of Poland's final calamitous fate. For about
      fifty years the Poles still maintained with equal valour, though
      with alternate good<span class="newpage"><a name="page_251" id=
      "page_251">[pg.251]</a></span> and ill success, their warlike
      character abroad; even while internal dissensions and bloody
      party strife raged in their own unhappy country. But to such
      fundamental evils, combined with the rising power of Russia, with
      the revolt of the Kozaks in 1654, occasioned principally by
      religious oppression, and with the gradual but sure advancement
      of a new rival in the elector of Brandenburg, hitherto considered
      as a weak neighbour&mdash;to all these influences, the building
      thus sapped in its foundation could make no resistance, and its
      walls could not but give way, when they were suddenly shaken by
      the hands of avaricious and powerful enemies from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perversion of taste, which at the beginning of the
      seventeenth century reigned in Italy, and thence spread over all
      Europe, with much more rapidity indeed than the true poetry and
      pure style of the fifteenth century had done, created also in the
      literature of Poland a new period; which, through the political
      circumstances above referred to, was protracted to a greater
      length than would have been expected in a literature already so
      rich in national models. To the remarkable activity of mind in
      the preceding period, there followed a literary lethargy. A very
      pernicious influence is also ascribed, by the literary historians
      of Poland, to the Jesuits; although this order is in general
      disposed to favour the cultivation of science. Under Sigismund
      III, they were shrewd enough to make themselves gradually masters
      of nearly all the colleges; and after a long and obstinate
      struggle, even the university of Cracow had to submit. According
      to Bentkowski, it was principally by their influence, that the
      tone of panegyric and of bombast was introduced, which for nearly
      a hundred and fifty years disgraced the Polish literature. The
      tastelessness of this style reached its highest point under John
      Sobieski; when the panegyrics with which this victorious captain
      was hailed by his courtiers, became the model for all similar
      productions. The fashion, first introduced at the
      close<span class="newpage"><a name="page_252" id=
      "page_252">[pg.252]</a></span> of the preceding period, of
      interspersing the Polish language with Latin words and phrases,
      became during the present more and more predominant; and was at
      length carried so far as to give even to Polish words a false
      Latin sound, by means of a Latin termination. French, German, and
      Italian forms of expression soon obtained the same right. But
      what was still worse, and what indeed affected the language most
      of all, was the fact, that even the natural structure and well
      established syntax of the Polish language had to give place to an
      injudicious imitation of foreign idioms. Thus the very
      circumstance of its great pliancy, one of its principal
      excellencies, became a source of its corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poland, moreover, at a time when the minds of the rest of Europe
      were tolerably pacified in a religious respect, became the scene
      of theological controversies full of sophistry and bitterness,
      the natural consequence of the incipient oppression of the
      dissidents. The literature was overwhelmed with pamphlets,
      stuffed with a shallow scholastic erudition, and written in a
      style both bombastic and vulgar. But the influence of the Jesuits
      was not limited to literature and science; it had a still more
      unhappy result in its active consequences. Poland became also
      during this century the theatre of a religious persecution, less
      authorized by even the semblance of law than any which had
      before, or has since, occurred in other countries. The Arians or
      Unitarians, after having been for more than sixty years tacitly
      included in the general appellation of <i>dissidents</i>, had to
      sustain between the years 1638 and 1658 the utmost rigour of
      oppression, and were finally banished from the country; and all
      this without having done any thing to forfeit their rights as
      dissidents, from which body they had to be formally expelled by
      the united hatred of the other Protestants and Catholics, before
      even a pretext could be devised of proceeding lawfully against
      them. Nor had the Lutherans, Calvinists, Greeks, and<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">[pg.253]</a></span>
      Armenians, who, after the exclusion of the Unitarians, Quakers,
      and Anabaptists, were alone comprised under the name of
      dissidents, given any occasion for that gradual deprivation which
      they had to encounter of their lawful rights, in the possession
      of which they had been a hundred and fifty years undisturbed. The
      storm which threatened them, first manifested itself publicly in
      the diets of 1717 and 1718, and degenerated at last into open and
      shameless persecution. In the year 1724, a quarrel arose at
      Thorn, on occasion of a procession of the Jesuits, between the
      students of one of their schools and those of the Lutheran
      gymnasium. A Lutheran mob intermeddled and committed some
      excesses; in consequence of which the Jesuit Wolanski, in the
      name of his order, instituted a lawsuit against the Lutheran
      magistracy of the city. The result of this lawsuit was a tragedy,
      such as only the bloody pages of the books of the inquisition can
      exhibit, and unequalled as to its motives in the annals of the
      eighteenth century. All the perpetrators were punished with the
      utmost rigour; while Rösner, the president of the city, together
      with eleven other citizens, was publicly beheaded, and their
      property confiscated for the benefit of the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      A body which acted in such a spirit, placed at the head of public
      education, could exert but a very injurious influence in a moral
      and religious respect; its influence on the literature and
      language has been described above. The general mental paralysis
      and lethargy, which reigned in Poland during this period, can
      indeed hardly be ascribed solely to their influence; but the
      latter served greatly to increase it. For more than twenty years
      <i>all</i> the schools in the whole country were in the hands of
      the Jesuits; and when in the year 1642 the congregation of the
      Piarists erected their first school in Warsaw, which soon was
      followed by several others founded by the same order, these
      seminaries had to struggle for nearly a century, watched and
      oppressed by the jealousy and despotism of the Jesuits,
      before<span class="newpage"><a name="page_254" id=
      "page_254">[pg.254]</a></span> they could acquire any influence
      consistent with the spirit in which they were founded. To the
      talents and firmness of Stanislaus Konarski, himself a Piarist,
      the Polish literary historians ascribe the principal merits of
      the final victory of his order. His endeavours indeed were
      favoured by a combination of fortunate circumstances. Literature
      and the fine arts found a friend and protector in a gifted and
      accomplished king, and in several high-minded noblemen of even
      more than regal authority. But the period of pedantry, perversion
      of taste, and deficiency of true criticism, had already lasted
      more than a hundred and thirty years. There was much to be done
      to cleanse the beds in the garden of literature from all the
      weeds which had luxuriated there, and to fertilize a soil which
      had so long lain fallow. The details of these endeavours belong
      however to the following period.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the character of the theological literature of this age, we
      have above alluded. Among the Protestant writers were Andrew and
      Adalbert Wengierski. The works of the latter gave occasion to the
      polemical discussions of the Jesuit Poszakowski, himself the
      author of a history of the Lutheran and of the Calvinistic creed,
      and of several other books. Other works on subjects of theology
      and education, or collections of sermons and devotional
      exercises, were published by the Jesuits Szczaniecki, Koialowicz,
      Sapecki, Poninski, Zulkicwski, and others; and the Piarists
      Gutowski, Wysocki, Rosolecki, and others. The Jesuit Niesiecki
      wrote a comprehensive biblio-biographical work of great merit,
      which is considered as one of the best sources for the inquirer
      in Polish history and literature.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id=
      "FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_255_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> Another Jesuit, Wiiuk
      Koialowicz, translated Tacitus' Annals into Polish, and wrote in
      Latin a history of Lithuania. Knapski, also a Jesuit, published a
      large dictionary or "Thesaurus," which<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">[pg.255]</a></span> is
      still highly esteemed. Luhienski, archbishop of Gnesen, wrote in
      1740 the first detailed geography in the Polish language. One of
      the most productive writers on various subjects of theology,
      history, and politics, was Starowolski, who died in 1656.
      Fourteen of his forty-seven works are written in Polish, the rest
      in Latin. We mention further, as geographical and historical
      writers of some merit, the Piarist Kola, professor Saltszewicz,
      Chodkicwicz, Niemir and Chwalkowski; and as a distinguished
      mathematician and scholar of general information, Broscius.
    </p>
    <p>
      We conclude this period with the poets of that age; who, although
      perhaps they exhibited more talent than the cotemporary prose
      writers, must necessarily, from the nature of poetry, have
      suffered more from the predominant tastelessness of the time.
      Sam. Twardowski, ob. 1660, must be named first; a poet of fine
      gifts, but of an impure, bombastic, rhetorical style, the author
      of numerous lyrical and epic poems of very unequal value. After
      him came Vespasian Kochowski, the best lyric poet of the age;
      Gawinski, a very productive author, whose pastorals have been
      collected by Mostowski, together with those of Kochanowski,
      Simonides, and other classical poets; and Wenceslaus Potocki, the
      author of novels, poetry, and more especially epigrams, not
      without merit, but frequently licentious and indelicate. Among
      the poets of this age, who are in some measure distinguished by
      Polish critics, we find also a lady. Elizabeth Druzbacka, a
      poetess of high rank, but without a literary education or a
      knowledge of foreign languages, though not without natural gifts.
      Satires were written by Dzwonowski and Opalinski; historical and
      didactic poems by Bialabocki, prince Jablonowski, and by
      Leszczynski, father of king Stanislaus Leszczynski. Ovid was
      translated by Zebrowski and Otfinowski; Lucan's Pharsalia by
      Chroscinski, who versified also portions of the Bible; and again
      with more fidelity and skill by the Dominican monk

      Other poets of this age were, prince Lubomirski, who on account
      of his wealth and wise sayings is styled the Polish Solomon;
      prince Wisniowiocki, who published whole poems without the letter
      <i>r</i>, because he could not pronounce that letter; Bratkowski,
      the author of a series of happy epigrams; Falibogowski,
      Szymonowski, the Jesuits Ignes and Poniatowski, and others.

    <h4>
      FIFTH PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>From Stephen Konarski, A.D. 1760, to the Revolution in
      1830</i>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Polish language, at the beginning of this period, was in a
      melancholy state; it was, to use Schaffarik's expression,
      stripped of its natural gifts of perspicuity, simplicity, and
      strength, deformed by tastelessness, and grown childish and
      obsolete at the same time. An able work, <i>Memoirs</i>,
      referring to the period between 1750 and 1760, written by K.H.
      Kallontaj, and published a few years since by count E. Raczynski,
      gives a graphic picture of the miserable and illiterate state of
      society in Poland at that time; and shows clearly how the seeds
      of decay and destruction were already scattered with full hands
      on a susceptible soil. It was a fortunate circumstance, that,
      just at the time when several of the most powerful Polish
      noblemen began to feel an intense and patriotic interest in their
      neglected language,&mdash;the king Stanislaus Augustus and his
      uncle prince Czartoryski at their head,&mdash;there awoke a
      number of gifted minds, who began to plant with so much activity
      on the long deserted though still fertile soil, that the field of
      Polish literature soon flourished and bore fruit again. These
      fruits, however artificial and <i>un</i>national in their
      character, could only be compared to green-house productions.
      Various effective measures were taken for the revival of
      literature, and also for the promotion of science and art.
      <span class="newpage"><a name="page_257" id=
      "page_257">[pg.257]</a></span> But the new patrons could not
      afford to wait. The French literature of the day, with all its
      levity, shallowness, and splendour, seemed to be a material
      nearer at hand and more in harmony with the spirit of the
      court&mdash;the only school of revival for Polish
      literature&mdash;than their own national productions of former
      ages. In this way we may explain in part the frivolous tone, the
      shallow-mindedness, which prevail in all the Polish works of this
      age; during a period when vehement passions and furious contests
      already tore the country in pieces, and deep sorrow and grief
      reigned among all classes of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The establishment of the Monitor, a periodical work, to which the
      best and ablest men of Poland contributed, first exerted a
      superficial happy influence on the language.<a name=
      "FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_256_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> Of still more importance
      in this respect was the establishment of a national stage, at the
      head of which were distinguished and well qualified men. But the
      measure which produced more effect than any other, was the
      appointment of a department of Education, resolved upon by the
      diet of 1775. Public instruction was thus made one of the great
      concerns of the government itself; and the power of the Jesuits,
      which had been for some time on the decline, was finally
      annihilated. The rich income of this order was henceforth
      entirely set apart for the benefit of learned institutions, to
      which free access was given. The provincial or departmental
      schools throughout the whole kingdom received a new organization
      on a different plan; and the university of Cracow resumed again
      its former rights. In respect to the instruction and melioration
      of the situation of the common people, we find as yet no
      attention whatever paid to these important subjects. It was not
      until 1807, or the foundation of the duchy of Warsaw under the
      administration of the king of Saxony,<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">[pg.258]</a></span>
      that the lower classes obtained their rights as men; and
      unfortunately even then without the power of availing themselves
      of these rights. Stanislaus Augustus, however, and some of his
      advisers and counsellors, acted in this respect with an honest
      will and noble intention; and by promoting the general interests
      of mankind in literature and science, did much for the social
      improvement of their own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, this unhappy country was the scene of the most violent
      party struggles; during which the heads of the parties conducted
      themselves with the most revolting selfishness, and an entire
      forgetfulness of all political consequences and of their own
      moral responsibility. The fanaticism of the bishops of Cracow and
      Warsaw refused to the dissidents the restoration of their rights;
      and Russia thus acquired the first pretext for intermeddling with
      Polish affairs. In the course of a few years, Poland was reduced
      to that torn and broken state, which induced Catharine II to
      consider it as a country "where one needed only to stoop, in
      order to pick up something." For a short time this course of
      things even seemed to be favourable to literature. The minds of
      men were in a state of excitement, which gave them power to
      produce the greatest and most extraordinary things. But a
      reaction very naturally followed. After twenty years of mental
      and political struggles and combats, to sustain which claimed the
      whole united powers of mind and soul,&mdash;twenty years
      numerically productive in every department,&mdash;there followed
      a mental calm, an intellectual blank, of more than twelve years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, as if with the political dissolution of the kingdom, with
      the annihilation of the unity of the nation, this latter had sunk
      back into a state of intellectual paralysis. The interval from
      A.D. 1795 to A.D. 1807, in comparison with the years which
      preceded and have followed, was remarkably poor in productions of
      value. The literature of translations rose in an<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">[pg.259]</a></span>
      undue proportion, and the purity of the language suffered
      considerably. The government of the duchy of Warsaw acted on wise
      and truly humane principles; and during the short period between
      1807 and 1812, all was done for the improvement of the country,
      which the unfortunate circumstances of the case permitted. Under
      this administration the number of schools rose from 140 to 634; a
      commission was instituted for procuring the publication of
      appropriate books of instruction in the Polish language; and
      several similar measures were taken for advancing the best
      interests of the country. The constitution of the new kingdom of
      Poland, in 1815, entered essentially into the same views; and was
      in every respect favourable to the development of the mental
      faculties of the nation. The modern kingdom of Poland embraced,
      indeed, not much more than the sixth part of the vast territory,
      which under the Jagellons had constituted the kingdom of that
      name. Before the cessions at Andrussov in the year 1667, the
      ancient kingdom contained sixteen millions of inhabitants; the
      census of the modern kingdom in 1818, counted only 2,734,000. But
      that the population of this exhausted country increased during
      the Russian administration,&mdash;especially in consequence of
      the encouragement given to foreign colonists, the establishment
      of manufactures which furnished means of support for the lower
      classes, and other similar measures,&mdash;is apparent from the
      results of the census of 1827; according to which the kingdom
      then contained 3,705,000 inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_257_257"
      id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_257_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the field of science and literature, the nobility had at
      length found rivals among the free citizens; and the courts of
      these temples were now, through the erection of village schools,
      made accessible even to the peasant, who was, in name at
      least,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_260" id=
      "page_260">[pg.260]</a></span> no longer a degraded
      slave.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id=
      "FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_258_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> If the Russian
      government in Poland had been exercised in practice, according to
      the same principles on which it was founded; if Alexander's first
      intentions had been practically executed in the same spirit in
      which the happiness of his Polish subjects had been theoretically
      planned; perhaps it would have been less difficult to reconcile
      the minds of the Poles to the loss of their independence as a
      nation, which they justly consider as an inestimable good. We
      have here no concern with politics, except so far as they have a
      necessary influence on the state of general cultivation; or so
      far as they give birth to important occasional appearances in the
      republic of letters. Considered in the first point of view, it is
      not to be denied, that the Polish nation, since the foundation of
      the <i>constitutional</i> Russian kingdom of Poland in 1815, has
      made more progress towards social improvement, and has advanced
      more towards a state of equality in a mental and intellectual
      respect with the countries of middle Europe, viz. Germany, France
      and England, than during the whole vast period of their previous
      existence.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_261" id=
      "page_261">[pg.261]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      For most of these improvements, however, the preparation had
      already been made, in the last ten years before the dissolution
      of the republic. The emancipation of the serfs, who comprised the
      whole peasantry, one of the fundamental laws of the duchy of
      Warsaw in 1807, was confirmed at the creation of the kingdom of
      Poland in 1815. In the diet of the kingdom, not only the nobility
      and the government, but also the cities and smaller communities,
      had their own representatives; and all Christian denominations
      acquired equal political rights. To the universities of Cracow,
      Wilna, and Lemberg,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id=
      "FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_259_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> there was added in 1818
      a fourth at Warsaw. The kingdom of Poland contained in 1827, in
      each of its eight woiwodships, a palatine school, and besides
      this three other institutions for the higher branches of
      education; fourteen principal department schools, and nine for
      sub-departments; several professional seminaries for miners,
      teachers, agriculturists, and others; a military academy, a
      school for cadets, and a number of elementary schools, both
      private and public.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id=
      "FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_260_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> The Russian-Polish
      provinces, i.e.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_262" id=

      Russia in the three successive dismemberments of Poland,
      participate in all the means of education which the Russian
      empire affords; the province of West Prussia and the grand duchy
      of Posen, in those of the kingdom of Prussia, where an
      enlightened government has made, as is generally acknowledged,
      the mental improvement of the lower classes one of its principal
      objects. The Austrian kingdom of Galicia had in the year 1819 two
      lyceums, twelve gymnasiums, several other institutions for
      education of different names and for specific purposes, and also
      numerous elementary schools. The Catholic religion is here the
      only reigning one; although the Protestants, who here are still
      comprised under the name of dissidents, are tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The literary activity of the Polish nation occupied in 1827 not
      less than sixty printing offices and twenty booksellers. Of the
      latter, fifteen were in Warsaw, the rest scattered over all the
      province formerly belonging to Poland. At Warsaw alone five daily
      political papers and one weekly were published in the Polish
      language; besides these there existed only five, viz. one in each
      of the four larger cities, Cracow, Lemberg, Wilna, and Posen, and
      a fifth at St. Petersburg. There are other periodicals for
      scientific objects published at Warsaw; while in the other cities
      the German publications of that character are chiefly read. The
      periodical published by the national institution, called after
      count Ossolinski, at Lemberg, is however considered as the most
      important in the Polish language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high spirit of the Polish nation, and that glowing patriotism
      for which they are so distinguished, has induced them during the
      period of their unnatural partition and amalgamation<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">[pg.263]</a></span>
      with foreign nations, to devote more zeal than ever to the sole
      national tie which still binds together the subjects of so many
      different powers&mdash;their language. There have been numerous
      learned societies founded; among them, above all, the society of
      the friends of science at Warsaw, to which the most eminent men
      of the nation belong, must be distinguished. Academies of arts
      and sciences have been established, and associations formed for
      various scientific purposes. The influence of all these
      institutions, more especially that of the above-mentioned society
      at Warsaw, has been very favourably employed in limiting that of
      the French and German languages, naturally induced by political
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French language indeed, independently of the political events
      of modern times, had already acted powerfully on the Polish at
      the close of the preceding period. In poetry, the affected
      bombastic school of the Gongorists and Marinists had been
      supplanted throughout all Europe by the better taste of the cold,
      stiff, and formal French poets, whose defects it was much easier
      to imitate than their merits. For more than half a century the
      French language reigned with an uncontrolled and unlimited
      sovereignty over all the literary world. But its most absolute
      dominion was in Poland. In the manners of the nobility of this
      country, French gracefulness and ease were, in a peculiar and
      interesting manner, blended with the daring heroism of the knight
      and the luxuriousness of the Asiatic despot. French refinement
      and French witticism covered the rudeness and revelry
      characteristic of the middle ages. French teachers and
      governesses had inundated the whole country, and a journey to
      France was among the requisite conditions of an accomplished
      education. The Polish writers&mdash;all of them belonging to the
      nobility&mdash;to whom, from their youth, the French language was
      equally familiar with their own, unconsciously disfigured the
      latter by Gallicisms; since French forms of expression seemed to
      be the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_264" id=
      "page_264">[pg.264]</a></span> best adapted for the expression of
      French thoughts and French philosophy. A modern Polish author
      calls the Polish literature of this period a second edition of
      the French with inferior types and on worse paper.<a name=
      "FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_261_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> Long after the rest of
      literary Europe had shaken off the yoke, the Polish poets,
      although the genius of their rich, creative, and pliant language
      was decidedly opposed to such a slavery, continued to submit to
      French rules and laws, and do so partly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin the enumeration of the distinguished writers of this
      period, with its principal founder, Stephen Konarski, mentioned
      above,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id=
      "FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_262_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> who was born A.D. 1700,
      and died in 1773. In his seventeenth year he entered the order of
      Piarists, and became later a professor in the college of this
      congregation at Warsaw. After a long stay in Italy and France, he
      returned to Poland; accompanied king Stanislaus Leszczynski to
      Lorrain; but again returned to his country and founded several
      institutions for education in Warsaw, Wilna, and Lemberg, on
      principles different from those of the Jesuits. In the year 1747
      he went a third time to France, but returned after three years;
      and from that time devoted himself entirely to the literary and
      mental reform of his own country. Of his printed works,
      twenty-eight in number, fourteen are written in Polish. They
      embrace different topics in poetry, and a tragedy; but his
      principal merits lie in his writings on the subject of politics
      and education.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id=
      "FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_263_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After him we name the illustrious philosopher Stanislaus
      Leszczynski. Most of his works, on politics and ethics, were
      written in French; in the Polish language he wrote, besides one
      or two<span class="newpage"><a name="page_265" id=
      "page_265">[pg.265]</a></span> other works, a history of the Old
      and New Testaments in verse.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id=
      "FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_264_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> Zaluski, known more
      especially by the foundation of a large and celebrated library,
      in which he spent an immense fortune, and which he finally made
      over to his country,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id=
      "FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_265_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> was the friend of king
      Stanislaus and of Konarski. In possession of an uncommon amount
      of knowledge, and a very extensive erudition, which however he
      owed more to his remarkable memory than to any distinguished
      capacity, he wrote a large number of Latin and Polish books on
      literary and biographical subjects, and on poetry; in all which
      the genius of the preceding period still reigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another nobleman of high rank, who distinguished himself by his
      patriotism and erudition, was Wenceslaus Rzewuski, woiwode of
      Podolia, and cotemporary with Zaluski, whom he surpassed however
      in critical taste and productive powers. His translation of the
      Psalms is highly esteemed. A still higher name as a patron of
      literature and the arts, is the uncle of king Stanislaus
      Augustus, prince Adam Czartoryski. He was marshal of the diet in
      1764, when the ill-famed <i>liberum veto</i> was abolished, which
      gave to every deputy, singly, the right of overthrowing the
      otherwise unanimous resolutions of the diet, and thus was the
      principal cause of the lawless disorder which disgraced the
      sessions of that body. His merits as a statesman and a Mecænas
      are equal. Several historical works, designed to advance the
      honour of Poland, were published under his care and at his
      instigation. Amid all his numerous avocations, he found time to
      write several pieces for the national stage; which, as a promoter
      of the purity of the language, was a subject of his particular
      care and attention.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id=
      "FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_266_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a><span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">[pg.266]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the side of the name of Czartoryski, shines that of Potocki.
      More than one member of this illustrious family had in former
      times acquired the right of citizens in the republic of letters.
      Count Paul Potocki and his grandson Anthony, in the seventeenth
      and beginning of the eighteenth century, were both equally
      celebrated for their talents. The works of the former were
      published by count Zaluski, under the title of <i>Genealogia
      Potockiana</i>; the speeches and addresses of the latter are
      partly printed in Daneykowicz' <i>Suada Polona</i>, and were in
      their time considered as models. But the most elevated rank in
      this family is occupied by the two brothers Ignatius and
      Stanislaus Kostka Potocki, whether as patriots and statesmen, or
      as writers and patrons of science. Ignatius, besides promoting
      several literary undertakings, and bearing the expenses of more
      than one journey for the purposes of science and learning, was
      himself a distinguished writer. He translated Condillac's work on
      logic, and introduced it into the Polish schools as a class book.
      His merits in respect to public education were great; he was one
      of the most urgent promoters of the emancipation of the serfs;
      and at his death in the year 1809, he left behind the reputation
      of a true friend of the people. His brother Stanislaus Kostka,
      although entertaining the same political principles, did not take
      the same active part during the struggles of the Poles for their
      expiring independence; he retired to Austria after the king had
      joined the confederation of Targowicz, and there devoted himself
      entirely to his studies. In 1807 he returned to his country; and
      there, as president of the department for schools and education,
      he found means to carry out his enlightened views and benevolent
      intentions for the good of his country. At the foundation of
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_267" id=
      "page_267">[pg.267]</a></span> kingdom of Poland in 1815, he was
      made minister of public instruction, and was always found at the
      head of every noble and patriotic undertaking. From his
      oratorical powers, he was called <i>princeps eloquentiæ</i>. In
      respect to genius he was above his brother; although the latter
      seems to have surpassed him in energy of character. His principal
      work, "on Style and Eloquence," was published in 1815; another
      work of value is his translation of Winkelmann's book on ancient
      art, which he accompanied by illustrations and remarks, but did
      not finish. His influence on Polish literature was
      decided.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id=
      "FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_267_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> Another nobleman,
      distinguished as an orator and political writer, was Hugo
      Kollantay, count Sztumberg, who published, together with Ignatius
      Potocki, a history of the constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the historical writers of this period stands Adam
      Naruszewicz, the faithful translator of Tacitus, whose style he
      adopted also in his original works. His history of the Polish
      nation is considered as a standard work; as a production, which
      in respect to erudition, philosophical conception, and style, is
      the <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of Polish literature. The six volumes
      published by himself comprise only the period between A.D. 965
      and 1386, beginning with the second volume; as for the first,
      which was to have contained the earliest history of Poland, he
      intended to have executed it afterwards, and had indeed collected
      all the necessary materials, but was prevented by death. The
      Warsaw Society of Friends of Science published it thirty years
      after his death,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_268" id=
      "page_268">[pg.268]</a></span> and endeavoured to engage the
      principal talents of Poland in the continuation of his work. This
      was done in such a way, that each writer was to undertake the
      history of the administration of a single king; and at last,
      after each part had appeared separately, the society was to make
      a collection of the whole, and, if necessary, cause it to be
      rewritten. Several able men have devoted themselves to this work.
      The plan of the society, which by its very nature excluded all
      unity of character, seems to have met with more approbation than,
      according to our opinion, it deserved. The Polish public is
      however indebted to it for more than one valuable work on
      history, to which it gave birth. Naruszewicz had collected for
      his undertaking a library of materials, in 360 folio volumes. He
      wrote also a history of the Tartars, a biography of the
      Lithuanian captain Chodkiewicz, and was admired as a poet. He
      died in 1796, it is said of grief at the fate of his unhappy
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naruszewicz was educated by the Jesuits, and was himself of that
      order until its dissolution. He died as bishop of Luck. In
      respect to time he stands as the first eminent writer of a new
      period, just on the verge of the past; and even his warmest
      admirers do not deny that he participated, in some slight degree,
      in the character of that past, by a certain inclination to
      panegyric and a flowery style. But in energy and richness of
      thought, he far surpasses all his predecessors, and has not yet
      been reached by any who have written after him.<a name=

      Another historical work of value on Poland, was edited by Joachim
      Lelewel. The history of Poland by Waga, in the want of any thing
      more suitable, had been in use as a class book in the Polish
      schools for more than fifty years. Lelewel, in order
      to<span class="newpage"><a name="page_269" id=
      "page_269">[pg.269]</a></span> improve its popularity, took this
      book as a foundation, but completely recast it, divided the
      history of Poland according to a plan perfectly new, completed
      the work, and published it under Waga's name. His rich additions
      regard chiefly the legislature, statistics, and the cultivation
      of the country. His very division of the history of Poland, into
      Poland conquering, Poland divided, Poland flourishing, and Poland
      on the decline, seems to indicate the political tendency of his
      work, and his desire to impress upon the Polish youth the great
      moral lessons which history presents.<a name="FNanchor_269_269"
      id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_269_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another history of Poland of more extent was published by G.S.
      Bantkie. Lelewel said of the second edition of this book, which
      appeared in 1820, that "a more perfect work in this department
      did not exist."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most remarkable writers of his time, on history and
      bibliography, was the Jesuit Albertrandy; who, besides being the
      author of several historical works and treatises, was
      indefatigable in collecting materials for the history of his
      country. He went to Italy, and here gathered during a stay of
      three years a hundred and ten folio volumes of extracts, entirely
      written with his own hand. He then went to Stockholm and Upsal,
      where the most important manuscripts relative to Poland are
      deposited. The Swedish government was narrow-minded enough, to
      allow him access to their libraries only on condition of his
      not<span class="newpage"><a name="page_270" id=
      "page_270">[pg.270]</a></span> taking any written notes. But
      Albertrandy had so remarkable a memory, that he was able to make
      up for this disadvantage, by writing down every evening all that
      he had read during the day, and added in this way not less than
      ninety folio volumes to his library of manuscripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portions of Polish history, or subjects belonging to it, were
      treated with success by the poet Niemcewicz; by Bentkowski,
      Kwiatkowski, Soltykowicz, Surowiecki, Lelewel, Onacewicz, the
      counts Ossolinski and Czacki, the former distinguished by
      learning and critical discernment, the latter the author of an
      esteemed history of the Polish and Lithuanian laws; by Maiewski,
      Siarczynski, and others. The princess Isabella Czartoryski
      intended her "Pilgrim of Dobromil," to be a book of historical
      instruction for the common people. Abridgments of Polish history
      were given by Miklaszcwski and Falenski. The historical songs
      written by Niemcewicz, at the instigation of the Warsaw Society
      of Friends of Science, are also to be considered as belonging to
      history, as well as to poetry, since they are accompanied by
      valuable historical illustrations. The same author wrote Memoirs
      on ancient Poland. Turski translated the memoirs of Choisain on
      the administration of Henry of Valois; and the memoirs of Michael
      Oginski, <i>Sur la Pologne et les Polonais depuis 1788 jusqu'en
      1815</i>, are a valuable contribution to the history of our time.
      Memoirs of J. Kilinski, a shoemaker by trade, but like the
      butcher Sierakowski, a successful revolutionary leader in 1795,
      were published in 1830. The modern periodicals likewise contain
      many well written historical essays, some of them of decided
      importance. This is especially true of the <i>Memoirs</i> of
      Warsaw, and also of Lemberg, the <i>Scientific Memoirs</i>, the
      Wilna and Warsaw <i>Journals</i>, the <i>Bee</i> of Cracow, the
      <i>Ant</i> of Poznania, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have remarked above, as a characteristic of the Polish
      literature, that although Poland was never poor in
      talents<span class="newpage"><a name="page_271" id=
      "page_271">[pg.271]</a></span> of various kinds, yet its literary
      contributions have aimed less at the advancement of science in
      general, than to exalt the glory of the Polish name, and thus
      have an immediate reflexive influence on the nation. In the same
      spirit, the history of other countries has received little
      attention, not excepting even ancient history. Poland indeed does
      not possess a single distinguished work on foreign history; and
      their Gibbons and Robertsons seem ever to have been absorbed in
      their own patriotic interests. As writers of merit on universal
      history and its auxiliary branches, we may mention Cajetan and
      Vincent Skrzetuski, count John Potocki, Bohusz, Jodlowski,
      Sowinski. prince Sapieha, count Berkowski, and above all
      Lelewel.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id=
      "FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_270_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a> Several of his works
      have been translated into French and German. The German version
      of his History of the discoveries of the Carthaginians and Greeks
      (Berlin 1832), was accompanied by an introduction from the
      celebrated Ritter.

      The Polish language, the purity of which at the beginning of the
      present period was an object of particular attention, has in our
      own century been the subject of numerous learned inquiries; some
      of which have added considerably to the light thrown in modern
      times by Slavic-German scholars upon the Slavic languages and
      Slavic history in general. Linde, besides several other
      philological and historical writings, has enriched Slavic
      literature with a comparative critical dictionary in six volumes,
      which is considered as one of the standard works of the language.
      G.S. Bantkie, the author of several historical and
      bibliographical works of great merit in the Polish, Latin, and
      German languages, has written a Polish grammar and Polish-German
      dictionary. Rakowiecki prepared a new edition of the <i>Jus
      Russorum</i>, introduced by a critical preface, and accompanied
      with many explanatory notes. We must, however, take this occasion
      to remark, that the Polish critics in general; even<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">[pg.272]</a></span> if
      in every other respect qualified as sagacious and impartial
      judges, are by no means infallible on subjects which have any
      relation to their own country. The glory and honour of their own
      nation are always with them the principal objects, to which not
      seldom the impartiality of a scientific inquirer, and even
      historical truth, is unscrupulously sacrificed. Maiewski wrote a
      book rich in ideas on the Slavi;<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id=
      "FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_271_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a> bibliographical works,
      and books on the literary history of Poland have been published
      by Chrominski, Sowinski, Juszynski, count Ossolinski, Szumski,
      and more especially by Bentkowski.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id=
      "FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_272_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> Count Stan. Potocki's
      works contain likewise a number of articles on Polish literature.
      In the previous periods, all bibliographical works were written
      in Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant talent of the Poles for eloquence enjoyed, during
      the early part of this period and before the dissolution of the
      republic, the best possible opportunity for development, among
      the intellectual struggles and combats occasioned by the
      political circumstances of the country and the discussion of new
      political theories. The constitutional diet of 1788-1791
      exhibited a rich store of oratorical talent. The names of the
      Potockis, Sapieha, Czartoryski, Kollantay, Matuszewicz,
      Niemcewicz, Soltyk, Kicinski, and others, were mentioned with
      distinction. The eloquence of the pulpit was of course much less
      cultivated in a nation which lives chiefly in politics.
      Lachowski, a Jesuit and court preacher of the last king, is by
      the Poles considered as an eminent preacher; although according
      to German judges he was shallow and voluble, and was surpassed by
      his cotemporary Wyrwicz, and above all by Karpowicz. Prazmowski,
      Jakubowski, Woronicz bishop of Warsaw, Szismawski,<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">[pg.273]</a></span>
      Szweykowski, Zacharyaszewicz, and others, were esteemed as
      powerful preachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the oratorical powers and the historical productions of
      the Poles, the reputation of their modern literature rests
      chiefly on poetry. Although the Polish poets adhered longer to
      the strict rules of Boileau than the rest of Europe, and have
      only in the most recent times chosen better models in the Germans
      and English,&mdash;without however having been able to free
      themselves entirely from their French chains,&mdash;yet the
      national genius of their language has sometimes conquered the
      artificial restraints of narrow rules and arbitrary laws.
      Naruscewicz, the celebrated historian, occupies also a
      distinguished rank as a poet. He translated Anacreon and some of
      Horace's odes; but wrote still more original pieces, odes,
      pastorals, epigrams, satires, and a tragedy entitled 'Guido.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The most distinguished poet under Stanislaus Augustus was count
      Ignatius Krasicki, bishop of Ermeland or Warmla, and later of
      Gnesen, the Polish Voltaire. His principal works are an epic
      under the title of <i>Woyna, Chocimska</i> or 'War of Chocim,'
      and three comic epics, one of which, <i>Monachomachia</i>,
      ridicules the monkish system and exhibits its absurdity in strong
      colours. He wrote this poem at the suggestion of Frederic the
      Great, to whose <i>coterie</i> of literary friends he belonged.
      His great heroic epic is considered by his countrymen as a
      standard work; while foreigners look at it as a valuable
      historical poem indeed, but as utterly deficient in true epic
      power and original invention. His smaller poems and prose
      writings are replete with wit and spirit; to see a bishop writing
      erotic songs and satirical epigrams was nothing extraordinary in
      his time. As a prose writer be appears as one of the few who were
      not blind to the defects and follies of their countrymen. Of his
      translations we mention Macpherson's Ossian and Plutarch. He
      belongs so decidedly to his age, i.e. to the age of the freezing,
      unpoetical,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_274" id=
      "page_274">[pg.274]</a></span> French influence, that our time,
      with its higher standard for a true poet, can no longer set a
      great value on his works.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id=
      "FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_273_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembecki, ob. 1812, as a lyric poet takes equal rank, according
      to some Polish critics, with Krasicki. His chief poem,
      <i>Zofiowka</i>, which has been translated into French by La
      Garde, is of that descriptive, contemplative kind, which was
      fashionable in his day. He had more imagination than other
      cotemporary Polish poets. Szymanowski, ob. 1801, a writer of
      pastorals, is distinguished for delicacy and sweetness. As to the
      beauty of his diction his countrymen are the best judges; but as
      for the character and real poetical value of his productions, we
      doubt whether the sounder taste of our day would relish the whole
      species so highly as was done at a time, when the forms of
      society had reached the very summit of artificial perversion. A
      certain longing after nature and its purity was the necessary
      result of such a state of things; but even nature itself they
      were unable to see, except in an artificial light. All the Polish
      productions of this species, in the present period, savour
      strongly of the French school; whilst the pastorals of the
      sixteenth century hover in the midst between the bucolics of the
      ancients and the Italian and Spanish eclogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the same decided influence of the French literature on
      Wengierski, who died in 1787; although less in respect to taste
      than to morals. Karpinski, also a writer of pastorals, approaches
      nearest the Greeks, and is on the whole a poet of uncommon
      talent. His original writings bear much more of a national stamp
      than those of other poets of this period. His translation of
      Racine's Athalia is considered as a masterpiece, and his version
      of the Psalms has not been surpassed in any language. Another
      distinguished poet is Dionysius Kniaznin, <span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">[pg.275]</a></span>
      remarkable for a certain external freshness, which imparts life
      to all his productions. He was educated in the college of the
      Jesuits at Witebsk; and it was during his whole life a matter of
      regret to him, that he "had lost the golden season of his youth,
      and wasted the labour of sleepless nights on irksome trifles."
      Notwithstanding this learned education, the author of the Letters
      on Poland finds between him and Burns a kind of analogy.
      Kniaznin's principal fame rests on a ludicrous heroic called the
      'Balloon.' He spent a part of his life at Pulawy, the estate of
      prince Czartoryski, under the patronage of this nobleman; and is
      said to have become, like Tasso, the victim of a passion for one
      of his lady patronesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are further regarded among their countrymen as
      poets of the first rank, viz. Niemcewicz, Brodzinski, bishop
      Woronicz, and Mickiewicz. Julius Niemcewicz is also known by his
      political fortunes and influence, and is equally esteemed as an
      historian and for his poetical talents. The eloquence which he
      exhibited in the diet of 1788-92, as the <i>nuntius</i> or deputy
      of Lithuania, laid the foundation of his fame. When his country
      was lost, after having fought at the side of Kosciuszko and
      shared his fate as a prisoner, he accompanied this great man to
      America, where he associated with Washington, whose life he has
      since described. His eulogy on Kosciuszko is considered as a
      masterpiece. His principal works are his historical songs, his
      dramas, and his "Reign of Sigismund III." Whatever he writes
      evinces more than common talents; as to which his friends only
      deplore that he has scattered them so much, or, according to the
      expression of the author of the Letters on Poland, that "his
      genius was too eager in embracing at once so much within its
      potent grasp; and thus, instead of concentrating his powers,
      lessened their brilliant beams, by diffusing them over too wide a
      horizon." <a name="FNanchor_274_274" id=
      "FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_274_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a><span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_276" id="page_276">[pg.276]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      John Woronicz, bishop of Cracow, and afterwards of Warsaw, whom
      we have named above as one of the most eloquent preachers, is
      equally celebrated as a poet. His productions all have a
      character of dignity and loftiness; and, with the exception of
      some religious hymns, are devoted to the historical fame of his
      country. His "Sybil," in which he conjures up in succession the
      ancient Polish kings from their graves to behold the cruel state
      of their once triumphant country, and the "Lechiade," an epic,
      which Schaffarik considers as the best Polish production of this
      species, are his principal works. The inclination of the Polish
      poets to celebrate and exalt their own country and the heroic
      deeds of their ancestors, without even admitting the possibility
      of rivalship on the part of any other nation, can easily be
      accounted for; while to foreign critics the same poems, which
      inspire Polish readers with patriotic enthusiasm, often appear
      pompous and void of that simplicity, which is the true source of
      the sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casimir Brodzinski, ob. 1835, was an eminent original poet, and
      an excellent translator. His poetry is pervaded by a character of
      strong and decided nationality, and Bowring says of him: "If any
      man can be considered the representative of Polish feelings, and
      as having transfused them into his productions,<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_277" id="page_277">[pg.277]</a></span>
      Brodzinski is certainly the man." He translated Macpherson's
      Ossian; and first introduced Scott's masterpieces into the
      literature of Poland. He may be considered as one of the founders
      of the modern romantic school in Polish literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam Mickiewicz, born in 1798, whose name belongs, perhaps, more
      appropriately to the next period, owed his first reputation, as a
      poet of eminent talent, to three small volumes of miscellaneous
      poetry, first published in 1822-1828. A poetic tale, <i>Conrad
      Wallenrod</i>, a scene from the wars of the Poles with the
      Teutonic knights, was published shortly after.<a name=
      "FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_275_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The series of Polish poets towards the end of this period, who
      have manifested some talent, is too long to permit us to
      enumerate them all; and even a complete catalogue of their names
      must not be expected in these pages, which are devoted merely to
      an historical review of the <i>whole</i> literature, and to
      individuals only so far as they go to form characteristic
      features of the physiognomy of the former. The "Dictionary of
      Polish poets," published in 1820 by Juszynski, describes the
      lives of not less than 1400 individuals, independently of course
      of their poetical worth. We confine ourselves to presenting some
      of the most distinguished names in addition to those
      above-mentioned, viz. Gurski, a very productive and popular
      writer; L. Osinski, still more esteemed as a critic: Molski,
      Tanski, Boncza Tomaszewski, Okraszewski, Tymowski, Szydlowski,
      and Kozmian, the author of a popular didactic poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Polish literature of this time was particularly rich in
      translations, which are approved by their countrymen, although
      they perhaps will not satisfy the higher standard of German or
      English criticism. This is due partly to the richness and
      pliability of the language itself. Dmochowski, Przybylski,
      and<span class="newpage"><a name="page_278" id=
      "page_278">[pg.278]</a></span> Staszyc, translated Homer; and the
      first also Virgil. Dmochowski's translations are in rhymed verse;
      those of Przybylski, who also enriched Polish literature with
      translations of the Paradise Lost, the Lusiad, and of many other
      poems, are in the measures of the originals, and manifest both a
      profound knowledge of the foreign languages, and great dexterity
      in using his own. Staszyc has written valuable works on various
      subjects, and enjoys a high esteem as a literary man and patriot.
      Felinski, the translator of Delille and Racine, is considered as
      the most harmonious Polish versifier. Hodani, Osinski, Kicinski,
      Kruszynski, have likewise transplanted the productions of the
      French Parnassus into the Polish soil; Sienkiewicz, Odyniec, and
      others, devoted their talents to the English. Okrascewski
      translated the Greek tragic poets. Minasowicz, the author of
      fifty-three various works, and Nagurczewski, translated also
      several of the ancient authors; but according to the best
      critics, with more knowledge of the classic languages, than skill
      in the management of their own. Among all the distinguished poets
      mentioned above, there is hardly one, who, besides his original
      productions, did not likewise devote his talents to poetical
      translations; in which Karpinski, Naruscewicz, and Krasicki, were
      considered as eminently successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the whole domain of poetry, there is no branch in which the
      Poles manifested a greater want of <i>original</i> power, than
      the dramatic. Here the influence of the French school was most
      decided, and indeed exclusive. We have seen above what pains were
      taken by the most distinguished men of the nation, to establish a
      national stage; to which they looked, not in the light of a
      frivolous amusement, but as a school for purifying and elevating
      the national language and literary taste, and also as a means of
      correcting vice by ridiculing it. In this view several clergymen
      wrote for the theatre. The Jesuit Bohomolec wrote the first
      original comedies in 1757; other comedies, valuable
      as<span class="newpage"><a name="page_279" id=
      "page_279">[pg.279]</a></span> pictures of the time, were written
      by bishop Kossakowski. Prince Czartoryski we have mentioned above
      as a writer of dramas. Zablocki, Lipinski, Osinski, Kowalski, and
      others, transplanted the French masterpieces to the Polish stage,
      or imitated them. The actors, Boguslawski, Bielawski, and
      Zolkowski, wrote original pieces. Tragedies, mostly on subjects
      of Polish history, were written by Niemcewicz, Felinski,
      Dembowski, Slowacki, Kropinski. Hofmann, and F. Wenzyk, whose
      "Glinski" is considered as the best Polish production of this
      kind. The most popular comedies in recent times are by count
      Fredro, who is called the Polish Molière. The Polish stage is
      still richer in melo-dramas, especially rural pictures in a
      dramatic form; of which Niemcewicz's piece, "John Kochanowski,"
      is a fine specimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it respects novels, tales in prose, and similar productions,
      the literature of Poland has been much less overwhelmed with this
      species of writing, in which mediocrity is so easy and perfection
      so rare, than that of their neighbours the Russians. We think
      this can easily be accounted for. They possess few, for the same
      reason that the English are so rich in them. Domestic life, the
      true basis of the modern novel, has no charms in Poland. The
      whole tendency of the nation is towards public life, splendour,
      military fame; theirs are not the modest virtues of private
      retirement, but the heroic deeds of public renown. The beauty,
      the spirit, the influence of their women, is generally
      acknowledged; but that female reserve and delicacy which draws
      the thread of an English novel through three volumes, would be
      looked for in vain in Poland. Niemcewicz, however, published in
      1827 an historical novel, "John of Trenczyn," which is considered
      as a happy imitation of Scott. Others were written by count
      Skarbeck. Among the novels, which present a psychological
      development of character, and a description of fashionable life,
      "The Intimations of the Heart" is regarded as the principal work.
      It was written by the princess of Wirtemberg,
      daughter<span class="newpage"><a name="page_280" id=
      "page_280">[pg.280]</a></span> of Adam and Isabella Czartoryski.
      Another esteemed female writer is Clementina Hofmann, formerly
      Tanska.

      The Poles, although from a feeling of pride and patriotism
      naturally disposed to overrate the productions of their own
      literature, are far from being deficient in critical judgment or
      in exalted ideas on the theory of the beautiful. The count
      Stanislaus Potocki and Ossolinski, L. Osinski, Golanski, and
      others, maintain a high rank in this department.

      Philosophy, as an abstract science, independently of its
      immediate application to subjects of real life, has never found
      more than a few votaries among the Poles. In the beginning of the
      seventeenth century, Aristotle was translated into Polish by
      Petryci. For nearly two hundred years, the teachers of philosophy
      in the Polish universities stopped at Aristotle; and a few
      commentaries on his Ethics and Politics composed the whole
      philosophical literature of Poland. In the first years of our own
      century, Jaronski and Szianiawski made an attempt to introduce
      the philosophy of Kant; but although the cause appeared to be in
      the best hands, they met with little success. Galuchowski, a
      German philosophical writer of merit, is a Pole by birth;<a name=
      "FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_276_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> as also Trentovski and
      Cieszkowski, followers of Hegel, who prefer the German for their
      organ.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id=

      For the study of polite literature and the Slavic languages
      during this period, Warsaw was the principal seat; for philology
      and the exact sciences, the university of Wilna. This learned
      institution had taken special pains in respect to the necessary
      elementary books for the study of the classical languages; and
      was distinguished by its able professors Groddek,
      Bobrowski,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_281" id=
      "page_281">[pg.281]</a></span> and Zukowski. The former, a
      scholar of high reputation, in addition to several philological
      works, translated Buttman's Greek Grammar into Polish; the latter
      published also a Greek and a Hebrew Grammar. In the oriental
      languages Senkowski at St. Petersburgh is distinguished; and
      count Rzewuski at Vienna had great desert in connection with the
      periodical work, <i>Fundgruben des Orients</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of the grand-duke Constantine's predilection for
      mathematics, an undue share of attention, after the erection of a
      kingdom of Poland under his administration, was paid in schools
      to the exact or empirical sciences; <i>undue</i> we call it,
      because on account of its excess, the moral and literary pursuits
      of the pupils were necessarily neglected. Mathematics, during
      this whole period, were taught by several eminent men; by John
      Sniadecki, who is at the same time considered as a model in
      respect to style and language; by Poezobut, Zaborowski, Czech,
      Rogalinski, and others. In the same departments the names of
      Twardowski, Polinski, and Konkowski, must be honourably
      mentioned. Count Sierakowski wrote a classical work on
      architecture; and the learned Polish Jew Stern is celebrated over
      all Europe as the inventor of arithmetical and agricultural
      machines. Count Chodkiewicz and Andrew Sniadecki are
      distinguished chemists. Natural philosophy, although less
      studied, had able professors in H. Osinski and Bystrzycki;
      natural history, more particularly botany and zoology, in Kluk
      and Jundzill. Medicine, until the middle of the last century, was
      in Poland exclusively in the hands of foreigners, especially
      Germans and French <a name="FNanchor_278_278" id=
      "FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_278_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> since then several
      gifted Poles have devoted<span class="newpage"><a name="page_282"
      id="page_282">[pg.282]</a></span> themselves to this science,
      although they have not yet formed a national school. Lafontaine,
      body physician of the last king, Dziarkowski, Perzyna, Malcz, and
      others, must be mentioned here. The university of Wilna was the
      most celebrated school for medical science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the reflecting statesmen of Poland, in the second decennium
      of our century, there began to be a great deal of attention
      bestowed on national economy and its various branches; more
      especially on studies connected with agriculture, as being the
      science most applicable to the present wants of the country.
      Poland being the most extensive plain in Europe, and for the most
      part of a very rich and fertile soil, the Poles would seem
      destined by nature to be an agricultural people. We cannot but
      observe here, that from this very circumstance, the wretched
      state of the labouring classes is placed in a still more striking
      light. The interests of agricultural science have been promoted
      by different societies, and several able treatises on those
      subjects have been published; although it does not appear that
      any new theory or principles have been started. Of all the
      branches of moral science, political economy has met in Poland
      with the most disciples. Valuable statistical works on Poland in
      the Polish language have been written by Staszyc, honourably
      mentioned above;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id=
      "FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_279_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> by Slawiarski, and
      others. Swiencki in his 'Geography of ancient Poland,' Surowiecki
      in his 'History of the Polish towns and peasantry,' give very
      valuable statistical notices; and the 'Journey to Constantinople
      and Troy' by count Raczynski, contains an exact statistical
      account of Podolia and the Ukraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The science of law must ever have been in a melancholy state in a
      country like Poland. Poland proper has always been governed by
      <i>statutes</i> and <i>constitutions</i>, sanctioned by the
      diet.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_283" id=
      "page_283">[pg.283]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      These were either founded on ancient usages,
      <i>consuetudines</i>, or occasioned by particular circumstances.
      The towns were governed according to the code of Magdeburg. In
      Lithuania the ancient Lithuanian statutes, collected in 1529,
      prevailed and still prevail, if not in collision with any
      intervening <i>ukase</i>.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id=
      "FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_280_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> In the other provinces,
      the laws of the respective monarchies to which they are annexed,
      are in force. Thus the different portions of Poland are governed
      in accordance with seven different systems of law.<a name=
      "FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_281_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> Under the administration
      of the last king of Poland, which was so rich in improvements; a
      general code of laws was also planned, and projects were prepared
      by able statesmen and lawyers; but they were all rejected by the
      diet of 1777. Under the Russian administration, preparation was
      made from the very beginning for the introduction of a new code;
      but the first project of a criminal code presented by the council
      of state, was likewise rejected by the diet of 1820. A portion of
      the civil code was accepted in A.D. 1825; but the complete code,
      which was ready for publication in the year 1830, had not, so far
      as we are informed, been introduced before the outbreak of the
      revolution. The administration of justice in Poland is about as
      bad as in Russia; being nothing but one great system of bribery
      and corruption. Of the judges of the lower courts, two thirds are
      elected; one third of these, and all the officers of the higher
      tribunals, are appointed by the government. In former times the
      profession of a lawyer, as well as that of a physician, was
      considered in Poland as degrading and unworthy of a nobleman.
      These two professions were not indeed prohibited by law, like
      that of traders,&mdash;for a nobleman who retailed "by yards or
      by pints," legally lost his rank,&mdash;but custom had made all
      those<span class="newpage"><a name="page_284" id=
      "page_284">[pg.284]</a></span> occupations which were the source
      of pecuniary profit, equally the objects of contempt. There was
      even a time, "when it was reckoned a matter of indifference for a
      nobleman <i>to understand arithmetic</i><a name=
      "FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_282_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a>." In modern times the
      ideas on this subject have of course changed; the study of law is
      no longer despised, especially in its necessary connection with
      the administration of justice. Slotwinski in Cracow, Bantkie and
      Maciejowski in Warsaw, were esteemed as teachers of law. We shall
      hereafter have occasion to mention the valuable work of the
      latter on this subject. The Roman law, both civil and criminal,
      was studied in the universities, as well as the law of nature and
      nations; which latter, in the case of this unhappy country, has
      been for more than seventy years so cruelly violated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a singular fact, that although, down to the year 1818 when
      the Russian government interfered to prevent it, foreign travel
      was one of the favourite means of education among the Polish
      nobility, their literature exhibits hardly any books of travels.
      A few were formerly written in Latin or French; among the latter
      we mention John Potocki's 'Travels for the purpose of discovering
      Slavic antiquities,' Hamb. 1795. In more modern times count
      Raczynski has published the 'Journal of his travels to
      Constantinople and the plain of Troy,' richly embellished with
      illustrations, mentioned above.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id=

    <h4>
      SIXTH PERIOD.
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>From the Polish Revolution in 1830 to the present time</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have thus brought down the history of Polish literature to the
      year 1830; an epoch of glorious, although most melancholy moment
      in the history of Poland. If the literature of a country could
      ever be regarded completely <i>in abstracto</i>; if it was not in
      intimate connection with the political fate and position of its
      country; we would have commenced this period with the first
      combats of the Romantic and Classical schools, that is, about
      fifteen years earlier.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id=
      "FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_284_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> But while these fifteen
      years may be considered in some measure as the time of the
      fermentation of that spirit, which broke out in 1830; this latter
      year&mdash;with its melancholy attempts on the part of Russia to
      crush all Polish nationality, by the annihilation of their higher
      seats of learning and the spoliation of all their libraries, as
      the principal means of cultivating it&mdash;forms only too
      distinctly an epoch, not only in Polish history in general, but
      specially in Polish literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of the country on the whole in the beginning of 1830
      was not unprosperous. The cruel wrongs inflicted on the Poles
      since 1815 were all in express violation of a constitution, which
      met with the approbation of Kosciuszko and the best of the
      nation. A noble individual, or a high-spirited people, can
      more<span class="newpage"><a name="page_286" id=
      "page_286">[pg.286]</a></span> easily submit even to unjust laws,
      than to arbitrary despotism. <i>Legally</i> the Grand Duke had no
      right to keep a single Russian soldier in Poland; by the terms of
      the constitution they could be there only as foreign guests.
      <i>Legally</i> the press was free. <i>Legally</i> Poland could
      have defended herself by her charter against any arbitrary act of
      her sovereign or his viceroy. It would seem, however, that even
      the repeated infringements of the constitution, and the direct
      violation of the laws by the government, did not contribute so
      much to induce the Poles to insurrection, as the fierce and
      brutal behaviour of the Russian generalissimo, and of the Russian
      civil and military officers high and low, whose profligacy had
      long made them the objects of deep contempt. The annals of Warsaw
      indeed present, during the Russian administration, one of the
      most revolting pictures which history exhibits. And the idea,
      that it owes its darkest shades principally to the reckless
      despotism of one individual, serves only to make them appear
      still darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war, which called into exercise all the mental faculties of
      the nation, put a stop of course to all literary activity; but
      even during the more quiet period which immediately succeeded
      it&mdash; the quietness of a cemetery&mdash;the dejected spirits
      of the nation, whose noblest sons an interval of two years had
      rendered prisoners, exiles, or corpses, are easily to be
      perceived in the results of their intellectual pursuits. A small
      volume, containing three poems by Niemcewiecz and Mickiewicz was
      printed in 1833 at Leipzig. It is the swan-like melody of the
      aged poet; whilst the younger celebrates the exploits of his
      valiant brethren. To the poems of the latter, (three volumes,
      Paris 1828.) a fourth volume was added, containing the riper
      productions of his manhood. The late vice president of Warsaw,
      Xavier Bronikowski, published at the same time <i>Polnische
      Miscellen</i> in the German language at Nuremberg. A number of
      Polish literati were gathered at Paris. A work, intended to
      contain about twelve volumes, with<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_287" id="page_287">[pg.287]</a></span> the title
      <i>Souvenirs de la Pologne, historique, statistique, et
      literaire</i>, was announced in that city; for the printing
      offices at home were of course closed against the expression of
      all patriotic feelings. The fifteen printing establishments at
      Warsaw issued in the year 1832, from March to December, only
      sixty-three works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The universities of Warsaw and Wilna were broken up; and the rich
      libraries of these institutions were carried to St. Petersburgh.
      The emperor declared openly, that it should be his aim to
      annihilate all traces of <i>Polish</i> nationality, and to
      metamorphose it into a Russian people. Even the lower schools
      were in great part deprived of their funds, and changed to
      Russian government schools. After some years of utter privation
      as to all means of higher instruction, a new university for the
      Poles was founded at Kief; of course on a Russian model and in a
      Russian spirit. In a most consistent and energetic manner the
      language and the national peculiarities of the country were every
      where checked and persecuted; and attempts of every kind were
      made to replace them by Russian customs and the Russian language.
      The union of the Greek and Catholic churches was dissolved; and
      in that way thousands were compelled to join the Russian church.
      In the higher schools prizes were set forth for the best essays
      in the Russian language; and in 1833 a law was made, that after
      1834 no Pole could hope for employment in the Russian service,
      without a complete knowledge of the Russian language. In the
      White Russian provinces, so called, that is in Lithuania,
      Podolia, and Volhynia,&mdash;countries which formerly had been
      under Russian dominion, and are still inhabited by a Lithuanian
      and Russian peasantry, while the nobility is Polish,&mdash;these
      severe and arbitrary measures were surprisingly successful in
      respect to the youth then in training; and the minister of the
      School department, Ouwarof, in his report of 1839, expressed his
      satisfaction in the strongest terms.<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">[pg.288]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But Poland as a whole was far from giving satisfaction to the
      government. There was indeed a certain stoppage of mental life,
      which seemed to favour its views. Literary productions were few
      in proportion to the former productiveness. In the year 1837, not
      more than 118 books were published in the whole kingdom; and of
      these only 75 were Polish; the rest in Hebrew. The press and all
      other organs of public feeling were under the strictest control.
      Yet the very topics, which were chosen by the literati for their
      researches and commentaries, proved best of all that the love of
      their country was not extinguished. The history of Poland became
      more than ever a chosen study. Private libraries and archives
      were searched for materials; and detached parts of the past, and
      single branches of history, were made the subjects of a closer
      examination and research, than had ever before been devoted to
      such topics among this active and restless people. One of the
      most important works, issued immediately after the revolution,
      was Prof. Maciejowski's History of the Slavic
      Legislatures.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id=
      "FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_285_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> It was well received by
      the numerous German and Slavic scholars, who devote themselves to
      similar pursuits; but they soon found that it did not fully
      satisfy the claims of the deeper criticism of our days. It has
      come finally to be considered rather as a preparatory work, which
      was shortly afterwards partially completed by another production
      of the same author: "Contributions to the History of Slavic
      events, literature, and legislation." <a name="FNanchor_286_286"

      As valuable monographs must be mentioned, the history of queen
      Barbara Radzivil, from sources hitherto unknown, by M. Balinski,
      who wrote also a history of Wilna; the biographies of the
      Hetmans, by Zegota Pauli; a history of Posen, by Lukaszewicz; of
      Lithuania, by Th. Narbutt: of Poland in the first half of the
      sixteenth century, by Maraczewski; historical and topographical
      descriptions, relating also to language and manners, by
      Przezdziecki and by Kraszewski. We may also notice here the
      History of the Latin Language in Poland, by Dr. Macherzynski; a
      book considered as a mine of erudition and useful knowledge. To
      it is annexed a list of all the different editions of the
      Classics published in Poland. We learn from it that Cicero's
      works have been edited there, either complete or in particular
      portions, not less than forty-five times; first as early as A.D.
      1500, at Cracow. Horace also has appeared eight times, first in
      1521; Ovid four times, first in 1529; Virgil six times, first in
      1642.

      The publication of early chronicles, for the purpose of rendering
      them more accessible to the public, was continued. That of

      Church history also, a department hitherto entirely neglected, in
      Poland, has begun to receive some small degree of attention in
      the present period. Joseph Lukascewicz wrote a history of the
      Bohemian Congregations in Poland,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id=
      "FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_294_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> in 1835; and in 1846 a
      history of the Helvetian (Calvinistic) Confession in Lithuania.
      Count Valerian Krasinski, who found a home in England, has
      likewise published a history of the Reformation in Poland, in the
      English language.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id=
      "FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      The history of recent times cannot be expected to be written in
      Poland; where the pen is chained, even if the mind keeps itself
      unfettered. The republic of Cracow, until about ten years ago,
      enjoyed a certain degree of liberty. It could have become the
      asylum of Polish literature and science; but it became only too
      soon the battlefield of political passions and combats.
      Some<span class="newpage"><a name="page_291" id=
      "page_291">[pg.291]</a></span> of her scholars however kept
      themselves entirely aloof from the strife. Macherzinski's and
      Muczkowski's learned works, already mentioned above; a history of
      Polish Literature by Wisznewski; and a new Polish Dictionary, by
      Trajanski; were the immediate results.
    </p>
    <p>
      New works of travels have been written by Kraszewski and
      Holawinski; the former describing the South of Russia, and the
      latter his pilgrimage to the Holy Land; both were published in
      1845. A book of travels on Siberia, a land so seldom chosen for a
      tour of pleasure, had preceded them.<a name="FNanchor_296_296"

      Modern history, we have said, cannot be expected to be written in
      Poland. This remark leads us at once to the literature of Polish
      Emigrants, as it is generally called, which has sprung up in
      Paris. Since the revolution of 1830, this capital has been the
      principal seat of Polish literary activity. One of the first
      works of importance published there was Maurice Mochnacki's
      History of the Polish insurrection; which excited among his own
      countrymen a new and passionate feud. Mochnacki's name had been
      favourably known as the author of a work on the Polish literature
      of the nineteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id=
      "FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_297_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> and as the able editor
      of several periodicals. His political misfortunes, however, and
      especially the circumstance that he had been compelled to appear
      alternately as the tool of the grand duke Constantine, and as the
      victim of his hatred, made him a subject of distrust to his
      countrymen, although he had fought with bravery in the
      revolution. He died in France when not yet thirty years old. His
      scattered writings were published in 1836 by A. Jelowicki, one of
      the patriotic family of that name; who had been deeply implicated
      in the revolution, and lived as fugitives in Paris. A<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_292" id="page_292">[pg.292]</a></span>
      printing office, which they have founded there, serves for the
      publication of Polish works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another work on the recent events was written by Wratnowski, who
      published a history of the insurrection in Volhynia, Paris. 1837.
      An animated picture of the time, which appeared three years ago
      under the title, "Representation of the national spirit in
      Poland." by Ojczyczniak,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id=
      "FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_298_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> exhibits strong passions
      in the author; a glowing and certainly not unnatural hatred
      against the great powers; but a still more violent one against
      his <i>democratic</i> countrymen, to whom he imputes the
      perdition of the good cause. A history of the Polish
      insurrection, published by S.B. Gnorowski in the English
      language. Lond. 1839, is written in the same violent and
      prejudiced spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Slavic press in Paris has been especially productive in
      periodicals; all of them replete with passion and hatred against
      their oppressors; some of them conducted not without talent. The
      <i>Revue Slave</i>, the <i>Mlada Polska</i>, (young Poland), the
      <i>Cronika, Emigracyi Polskiej</i> (Polish Emigrant's Chronicle),
      and the <i>Polish Vademecum</i> edited by N.U. Hoffmann, may be
      named here. From the latter we learn, that, from 1831 to 1837
      among the Polish emigrants in France, <i>nine</i> died in duels
      and <i>fourteen</i> by suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim Lelewel, whose <i>literary</i> activity belongs rather to
      the preceding period, while that now under consideration was
      partly the result of his <i>political</i> career, lives still at
      Brussels, where he has recently published (1849) a work on the
      civil rights of the Polish peasantry. He attempts to demonstrate,
      that the oppression and the debased condition of this class came
      upon them along with the introduction of Christianity; and
      represents the Romish clergy, whose advantage it was to keep up
      this state of things, as the principal enemies of the peasantry.
      Lelewel's<span class="newpage"><a name="page_293" id=
      "page_293">[pg.293]</a></span> writings have wielded a more
      decided influence in Poland than those of any other modern
      author. The tendency of all his historical investigations, even
      when apparently without any such design, has been since the very
      beginning of the Russian dominion to undermine their power; and
      the great ability with which he contrived to veil hints, to
      disguise remarks, and to follow out under a harmless mask a
      certain and fixed purpose, had earned him twenty or thirty years
      ago the name of the "Jesuit of history."
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains now to give a general survey of the progress of Polish
      <i>belles-lettres</i> during the last twenty years; and also of
      those mixed publications which excite a general interest. Here we
      must not omit to mention Witwicki's the "Evening Hours of a
      Pilgrim," <a name="FNanchor_299_299" id=
      "FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_299_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> a book which, in a
      sprightly style and a peculiarly interesting way, gives a good
      deal of information as to the literary and mental condition of
      Poland, and the much-lauded revival of letters during the reign
      of Stanislaus Poniatowski.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps the most interesting production of this period is
      Adam Mickiewicz's course of Lectures on Slavic literature and the
      condition of the Slavic nations, delivered in French at Paris,
      where he had found employment as a professor in the College de
      France.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id=
      "FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_300_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> The deep enthusiasm
      which pervades these lectures, the mental excitement by which
      they would seem to have been dictated from beginning to end,
      forbid us to consider them in the ordinary light of a mere course
      of instruction on the subject to which they relate. But there is
      no other work more full of ideas, or richer in thought; it is the
      reasoning of a poet, and a poet's way of viewing the world. The
      one great<span class="newpage"><a name="page_294" id=
      "page_294">[pg.294]</a></span> principle of these lectures again
      is <i>Panslavism</i>,&mdash;Panslavism spiritualized and
      idealized; and therefore in a shape which can inspire little fear
      to others in respect to their own nationality, although it can
      never excite their sympathies. Mickiewicz still idolizes
      Napoleon, and prophesies a revolution of the world; a new
      revolution, a torch to illumine the world; he himself is "a
      spark, fallen from that torch;" his mission is to prophesy to the
      world the coming events "as a living witness of the new
      revelation," Although these prophecies are not strictly
      political, we can see plainly, that in the expectation of the
      prophet this new revolution will consist in "the union of the
      <i>force</i> of Slavic genius, with the <i>knowledge</i> of the
      West" (France); by which of course the intermediate Teutonic
      principle must be crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In purely poetical creations, this great poet shows his full
      power. In a beautiful tale, <i>Pan Tadeusz</i>, "Sir Thaddeus,"
      (Paris 1834,) which, though in verse, may be considered as a
      novel, he very graphically described the civil and domestic life
      existing in Lithuania immediately before the war of 1812; and
      gave also further evidence of his genius by several smaller
      poems. He is, however, not very productive; a striking
      peculiarity of Slavic poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal poets of the modern romantic school in Poland, of
      which Mickiewicz must be considered the founder, are the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      A.E. Odyniec and Julian Korssak, both chiefly known by happy
      translations from the English; but also not without creative
      power of their own. Anton Malczeski is the author of a poetical
      tale, <i>Maria</i>,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id=
      "FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_301_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> perhaps the most popular
      production of the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_295" id=
      "page_295">[pg.295]</a></span> Polish literature. It is a
      touching family legend, traditional in the noble house of Potocki
      in Volhynia; but transposed by Malczeski to the Ukraine, and
      connected in that way with graphic descriptions of this latter
      country. Malczeski lived a life of wild adventures; and died
      young, not yet 34 years old, in 1826.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ukraine appears to be, on the whole, one of the favourite
      theatres for the romantic school of Polish poets. Zaleski,
      Gosczynski, Grabowski, all of them poets of more than ordinary
      talents, give us pictures of this country, alternately sweet and
      rough, wild and romantic. There must necessarily be some mixture
      of attractive and repulsive elements here even for native poets;
      for the common people are Russians, and hate the Polish nobility
      as their oppressors. Nevertheless Thomas Padura, another of the
      young Polish school, chose even the dialect of the Ruthenian
      peasantry for his songs. Another Polish poet, who has selected
      the Ukraine for the theatre of most of his tales, is Michael
      Czaykowski; he too is considered as standing at the head of the
      novel writers of his country. His legends of the Kozaks<a name=
      "FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_302_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a>, his tales,
      <i>Wernyhora</i><a name="FNanchor_303_303" id=
      "FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_303_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a>, <i>Kirdzali</i>, the

      "#Footnote_304_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a>, etc. manifest a more
      than common talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the poetical literature of the Polish emigrants belong further
      the works of A. Gorecki, Garczinski, J. Slawacki, but, above all,
      of count Ignatius Krasinski; not the same individual who wrote a
      history of the Reformation in Poland in the English
      language<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id=
      "FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_305_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a>. He is by many of his
      countrymen considered as their greatest living poet. Most of his
      productions are enveloped<span class="newpage"><a name="page_296"
      id="page_296">[pg.296]</a></span> in a certain mystical
      atmosphere, which renders a commentary necessary in order to
      understand them. Two dramatic poems, one called, in contrast to
      Dante, "The Undivine Comedy;" the other, "Irydion," an
      illustration of Schiller's stern apothegm, that "the history of
      the world is the judgment of the world;" <a name=
      "FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_306_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> are regarded as his most
      powerful productions<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id=
      "FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_307_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile this department of literature, in Poland itself, has
      taken, in some of its branches, the same strictly national
      direction which characterizes the Russian and Bohemian tendencies
      of modern times. Many of the publications, which are reckoned
      under belles-lettres, are nothing better than drawing-room
      productions, so called, meant to satisfy the immediate wants of
      the reading world. Count Skarbek, J. Krascewski, F. Barnatowicz
      (ob. 1838), K. Korwell, Szabranski, and others, are popular novel
      writers. Among the poets we mention the same Szabranski,
      Nowasielski, Zialinski, Alex. Groza, Burski, and, above all,
      Lucian Siemienski and A. Bielowski. The latter, along with
      Kamienski, is the translator of Schiller. Count Vinzent Kicinski
      translated Victor Hugo; and Holawinski, Shakspeare. As successful
      dramatic writers are named, the counts Fredro, Korzeniowski, St.
      Jaozowski, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of an entirely national character are all the productions of
      Wladislas Woicicki, who devoted his life principally to the study
      of the antiquities of his country and its language. In 1838 he
      published an interesting collection of old Polish
      proverbs<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id=
      "FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_308_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a>; several historical
      tales, scattered in Annuals; a<span class="newpage"><a name=

      "FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_309_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> all of them
      illustrations of Polish life and manners at certain times, and
      resting on an historical foundation. A rich collection of
      traditions and popular legends was published by the same scholar
      in 1839.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id=
      "FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_310_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> This important national
      feature has at last excited some attention among the Polish
      scholars. In 1838 a collection of the songs of the people in the
      country adjacent to the Bug was published.<a name=
      "FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_311_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> Another appeared in the

      translations of Malo-Russian popular songs. The great and simple
      beauty of this poetry of the Kozaks surprised the literary world.
      But Woicicki and Zegota Pauli were the first who gave their
      attention to the really Polish Lekhian popular songs, i.e. songs
      of the peasantry in Masavia and Podlachia, the grand duchy of
      Posen, the territory of Cracow, etc. of which, until then, the
      existence was hardly known.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id=

      It would almost seem as if the Russian government, in placing all
      the evidences of the mental activity of its Polish subjects under
      its strictest guardianship, was ready to supply also the supposed
      want of popular poetry. There was recently published at Warsaw a
      collection of ballads, sixty-nine in number, devoted to the
      praise of all the sovereigns of Russia, from Rurik to Alexander.
      These ballads are in the popular tone, and were sold<span class=

      cheap.[314] What degree of popularity they may have obtained, we

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LANGUAGES OF THE SORABIAN-VENDES IN LUSATIA, AND OF OTHER VENDISH
      TRIBES NOW EXTINCT.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      The north-eastern part of Germany, as far west as the Elbe and
      Saale, was, from the fifth to the tenth century, almost
      exclusively inhabited by nations of the Slavic race. Various
      Teutonic tribes&mdash;among them the Burgundians, the Suevi,
      Heruli, and Hermunduri&mdash;had before this taken up their
      temporary residence along the Baltic, between the Vistula and the
      Elbe. In the great migration of the Asiatic-European nations,
      which for nearly two centuries kept in motion all Europe from the
      Icy Ocean to the Atlantic, and extended even to the north of
      Africa, the warlike German nations moved towards the south-west,
      and Slavic tribes traversing the Danube and Vistula, in immense
      multitudes, took possession of the countries which they left.
      Those who came over the northern Vistula, settled along the
      coasts of the Baltic as far west as to the Elbe and Saale, and as
      far south as to the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) on the borders of
      Bohemia.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Slavic tribes were called by the Germans, <i>Wenden</i>,
      Lat. <i>Venedi</i>, for which we prefer in English the form of
      <i>Vendes</i>, rather than that of Wends. It appears indeed that
      this name<span class="newpage"><a name="page_300" id=
      "page_300">[pg.300]</a></span> was formerly applied by the
      Germans indiscriminately to all the Slavic nations with which
      they came in contact; for the name <i>Winden</i>, Eng.
      <i>Vindes</i>, which is still, as we have seen, the German
      appellation for the Slovenzi, or the Slavic inhabitants of
      Southern Germany, is evidently the same in a slightly altered
      form. The name of <i>Wenden</i>, Vendes, became, however, in the
      course of time, a specific appellation for the northern
      German-Slavic tribes; of which, at the present day, only a few
      meagre remnants are left. They were nevertheless once a powerful
      nation. Five independent branches must be distinguished among
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first name the <i>Obotrites</i>, the former inhabitants of the
      present duchies of Mecklenburg, and the adjacent country, west,
      north, and south. They were divided into the Obotrites proper,
      the Wagrians in Holstein, and the Polabæ and Linones on the banks
      of the Elbe and Leine; but were united under a common chief or
      king. They and their eastern neighbours the Wiltzi, (Germ.
      <i>Wilzen</i>, Lat. <i>Veletabæ</i>,) with whom they lived in
      perpetual warfare, were the most warlike and powerful among the
      Vendish tribes. The Wiltzi or Pomeranians lived interspersed with
      the Kassubes, a Lekhish tribe, between the Oder and the Vistula,
      and were subjugated by the Obotrites in A.D. 782. It was however
      only by the utmost exertions, that these latter could maintain
      their own independence against their western and southern
      neighbours, the Germans. Conquered by Charlemagne, they regained
      their independence under his successors, and centuries passed
      away in constant and bloody conflicts and alternate fortunes. In
      the middle of the twelfth century, however, they were completely
      subjugated by Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria. He laid
      waste their whole country, destroyed most of the people, and
      compelled the few remaining inhabitants and their prince, to
      accept Christianity from his bloody hands. In A.D. 1167 he
      restored to this latter, whose name was Pribislaus,<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">[pg.301]</a></span> a
      part of his kingdom, and gave his daughter Matilda in marriage to
      the son of Pribislaus, who, a few years later, was made a prince
      of the empire, and was thus gained over to the German cause. His
      descendants are the present dukes of Mecklenburg; and it is a
      memorable fact, that these princes are at the present day the
      only sovereigns in Europe of the Slavic race. German priests and
      German colonists introduced the German language; although we find
      that Bruno, the chief missionary among the Obotrites, preached
      before them in their own language. The Slavic dialect spoken by
      them expired gradually; and probably without ever having been
      reduced to writing, except for the sake of curiosity when very
      near its extinction. The only documents of it, which have come
      down to us, are a few incomplete vocabularies, compiled among the
      Polabæ and Linones, i.e. the inhabitants adjacent to the Elbe, in
      Slavic <i>Labe</i>, and to the Leine, in Slavic <i>Linac</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after the whole region was perfectly Germanized, a few towns
      in the eastern corner of the present kingdom of Hanover, were
      still almost exclusively inhabited by a people of Slavic race,
      who in the seventeenth century, and even to the middle of the
      eighteenth, had preserved in some measure their language and
      habits. But, since the Germans were strongly prejudiced against
      the Vendish name,&mdash;the nations of this race, especially
      those in the western part of the German territories, being
      despised as subjugated tribes, and inferior in general knowledge
      and information,&mdash;they gradually renounced their national
      peculiarities. Towards the close of the seventeenth century, when
      Hennings, German pastor at Wustrow, took great pains to collect
      among them historical notices and a vocabulary of their language,
      he found the youth already ignorant of the latter, and the old
      people almost ashamed of knowing it, or at least afraid of being
      laughed at by their children. They took his inquiries, and those
      of other intelligent persons, in respect to their ancient
      language<span class="newpage"><a name="page_302" id=

      ridicule them, and denied at first any knowledge of those
      matters. We find, however, that preaching in the Vendish language
      of this region was still continued for some time later. Divine
      service was held in it for the last time at Wustrow, in the year
      1751. According to the vocabularies which Hennings and a few
      others collected, their dialect, like that spoken in Lower
      Lusatia, was nearly related to the Polish language; partaking
      however in some peculiarities of the Bohemian, and not without
      some of its own.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id=

      The second great Vendish tribe, the Wiltzi or Pomeranians (Germ.
      <i>Wilzen</i>), also called Veletabæ, were, as we said above,
      subjugated in A.D. 782 by the Obotrites; and the country between
      the Oder and the Vistula formed for more than a hundred and fifty
      years a part of the great Vendish kingdom. They regained,
      however, even before the final dissolution of this latter in A.D.
      130226, the partial independence of their own dukes; who attached
      themselves to Germany, and afterwards, under the name of the
      dukes of Pomerania, became princes of the empire. In the year
      1124 the first Pomeranians were baptized by Otho, bishop of
      Bamberg; and the place where this act was performed, Ottosbrunnen
      (Otho's Well), which five hundred years ago was encircled by four
      lime-trees, is still shown to the traveller. As they received
      religion and instruction from Germany, the influence of the
      German language can easily be accounted for. German colonists
      aided in spreading it throughout the whole country. The last
      person who understood the old Pomeranian language, is said to
      have died in the year 1404. No trace of it remains, excepting
      only the names of places and persons, the Slavic origin of which
      can be recognized throughout all north-eastern Germany by the
      terminations in <i>its, enz, ik</i>, or <i>ow</i>. In<span class=

      A.D. 1637 the line of the old Pomeranian dukes expired, and the
      country fell to Brandenburg, with the exception of that part
      which Sweden usurped at the peace of Westphalia. The island of
      Rügen, which till A.D. 1478 had its own native princes, belonged
      to this latter. It is the principal seat of German-Slavic
      antiquities. The ancient Rugians and their gods are mentioned by
      Tacitus, and described by Saxo Grammaticus. The old chronicles
      and legends, founded on still older traditions, speak of a large
      and flourishing city named Vineta on the small island Wollin,
      south-east of Rügen, once the principal seat of the western
      Slavic commerce, and, as Herder calls it, the Slavic Amsterdam.
      This city is said by some to have been destroyed by the Danes; by
      others to have been ingulfed in the sea by the sinking of the
      ground beneath it. Modern inquirers, however, have doubted
      whether it ever existed; and, hard as it is to renounce the many
      poetical associations attached to such a subject,&mdash;so
      similar to those which fill the mind in thinking of Pompeii and
      Herculaneum,&mdash;their objections have not yet been
      satisfactorily refuted.

      The third separate branch of the Vendish stem were the Ukrians,
      or Border-Vendes, Germ. <i>Ukern,</i> from <i>Ukraina</i>,
      border. They lived in the territory which afterwards became the
      margravate of Brandenburg, and were divided into several tribes,
      as the Hevelli on the banks of the Havel, the Retarians, etc.
      Their situation was such, that constant conflicts between them
      and the guardians or watch of the German frontiers, the Saxon
      margraves on the other side of the Elbe, were unavoidable. These
      served gradually to extend the German <i>marches</i> or frontiers
      further and further, until in the year 1134 Albert the Bear,
      count of Ascania, finally conquered the Vendes. The Slavic
      inhabitants of this region were cruelly and completely destroyed;
      the country was repeopled by German and Dutch colonists, and
      given as a fief by the emperor to Albert the Bear, the first
      margrave of <span class="newpage"><a name="page_304" id=
      "page_304">[pg.304]</a></span>Brandenburg. Brandenburg was the
      German form for <i>Brannibor</i>, the most considerable of the
      Vendish cities, after which the country was called. The names of
      places, many of them altered in a similar manner, are indeed the
      only weak traces of the Vendish language once spoken in this part
      of Germany. No tribe of the Vendes seems to have been so
      completely extinguished; the present inhabitants of Brandenburg
      being of as pure a German origin, as those of any other part of
      Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descendants of only two Vendish tribes have preserved their
      language; and even these, from powerful nations spread over the
      surface of at least 4800 geographical square miles, have shrunk
      into the comparatively small number of scarcely two hundred
      thousand individuals, now inhabitants of Upper and Lower Lusatia.
      Nearly all of them are peasants; for the higher classes, even if
      Slavic blood perhaps runs in their veins, are completely
      Germanized. These tribes are the Sorabians, Lat. <i>Sorabæ</i>,
      Germ. <i>Sorben</i>, in Lusatia, divided into two different
      branches. They call themselves to this very day <i>Servians</i>,
      or rather (as also their brethren on the Danube) <i>Serbs</i>;
      their language, the <i>Serbish</i> language. Although in fact two
      distinct tribes, and speaking different dialects, yet their early
      history cannot well be separated. After the dissolution of the
      great kingdom of Thuringia by the Francs and Saxons in the year
      1528, the Sorabians, or Sorbæ, took possession of the countries
      left by the Hermunduri, viz. the territory between the Harz
      mountains, the Saale, and the Erzgebirge, and extended their
      dominion in a northern direction to the seats of their brethren,
      the Ukrians, and towards the east as far as to the region in
      which their near relations, the Lekhes. about the same time had
      settled. They made slaves of the few German inhabitants whom they
      found scattered through this country; and according to their
      industrious habits, began immediately after their arrival to
      cultivate the soil, to build cities, and to trade in the
      productions of the country. Although not strictly<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_305" id="page_305">[pg.305]</a></span> a
      warlike people, they were able for several centuries to defend
      their frontiers against the frequent attacks of their German
      neighbours on the other side of the Saale, and to give them
      trouble in return. But they yielded before the arms of
      Charlemagne; and after a short interval of renewed independence,
      they were completely subjugated and made tributary by Henry I.
      Their country, according to the German custom, was divided into
      <i>marches</i>, and populated with German settlers. These latter
      more especially occupied the towns, and built villages among the
      woods and mountains; whilst the Vendes, chiefly addicted to
      agriculture, continued to occupy the plains. But even on the
      plains, there soon arose the castles of German knights, their
      masters and oppressors; and the Vendish population was by degrees
      reduced to the miserable condition of serfs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 968, the first attempt was made to convert them to
      Christianity, partly by the sword of the conqueror, partly by the
      instruction of Christian missionaries. But more than one century
      passed away, before the Christian religion was fully introduced
      among them. Benno, bishop of Meissen, who died in A.D. 1106, at
      the age of ninety-six, acquired by his activity in the work of
      converting the Vendes, the name of the apostle of the Slavi. The
      obstinate resistance with which the Christian religion had been
      rejected by them, can easily be explained by the unjudicious, nay
      flagitious way, in which it was presented to them by the Germans;
      who came among them, the sword in one hand and the cross in the
      other; and exacted moreover from them the sacrifice of their
      language, their customs, their whole nationality in exchange. The
      naturally childlike and submissive disposition of the Slavi
      rendered them in all other regions, as we have seen, willing to
      receive the Christian doctrines, more especially when their
      superiors themselves acted as their apostles, as was in some
      measure the case with the Russian <span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_306" id="page_306">[pg.306]</a></span> Vladimir, Jagello in
      Lithuania, etc.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id=
      "FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_315_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> But the mode described
      above, which was adopted by the German heroes, not only among the
      Vendes, but also some centuries later among the old Borussians,
      could not but rouse all their feelings of pride and nationality
      to a decided resistance. Even when the Germans refrained from
      force, their means of conversion were equally opposed to the
      spirit of Christianity. Bishop Otho of Bamberg, for instance, was
      accustomed, when on his missionary travels, to have fifty or more
      wagons in his train loaded with cloth, victuals, and other
      supplies, in order to reward on the spot those who submitted to
      baptism.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id=
      "FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_316_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the holy light of Christianity, even after the Vendish tribes
      had embraced its doctrines, did not clear up the darkness of
      their fate. The whole humiliating relation between masters and
      serfs in Germany, which still degraded the last century, was
      unknown to the free ancient Germans, among whom only the prisoner
      of war was a slave; and is derived from the period of the
      submission of the Vendes. The Germans indeed seem to have
      considered them as an inferior race, and treated them
      accordingly. The contempt with which the old historians speak of
      them, is revolting to every liberal and unprejudiced mind, and
      can hardly be explained. For the Sorabians seem to have been at
      the time of their submission, superior on the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_307" id="page_307">[pg.307]</a></span>
      whole to the Germans in respect to civilization; although in
      consequence of this contemptuous treatment, they in the course of
      time fell far behind them. Despised and oppressed, they were kept
      for centuries in a state of ignorance and neglect; from which, it
      seems, they could only escape by renouncing their Slavic
      peculiarities, and above all their language. The use of this
      latter before courts of justice was in the fourteenth century
      forbidden by law throughout most of the country. In the beginning
      of the same century, the Vendish language was still sometimes
      heard at Leipzig, but not afterwards. In the villages also it
      became wholly extinct fifty or a hundred years later; and only
      single words passed over into the German language. But this was
      not the case with their usages and other national peculiarities;
      there are still several tribes, nay the peasants of whole
      provinces in this part of Germany, in whom the Slavic origin can
      be distinctly traced.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id=
      "FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_317_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> Their language however
      was driven into the remotest eastern corner of their former
      extensive territory; and is there, and only there, still to be
      heard. We speak of the province called Lusatia, situated between
      Saxony, Bohemia, Silesia, and Brandenburg, of which the greatest
      part is at present under the Prussian dominion, and the smallest
      but richest portion under that of Saxony.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lushitze</i>, Lusatia, Germ. <i>Lausitz</i>, signifies in
      Slavic, a low marshland. This name was formerly applied only to
      the north-eastern part of this province, or Lower Lusatia, which
      is, or was at least at the time of the Vendish settlement, a
      country of that description. At a later period, the name was
      carried over very<span class="newpage"><a name="page_308" id=
      "page_308">[pg.308]</a></span> improperly to the south-western
      part, or Upper Lusatia, a beautiful and mountainous region.
      Lusatia was given by Henry I, as a fief, to the margrave of
      Meissen. In the course of the following centuries, its two parts
      were repeatedly separated and reunited, alternately under the
      dominion of the last named margrave, of Poland, or of Bohemia,
      without however belonging to the German empire. In the fourteenth
      century it was at length incorporated with Bohemia, and remained
      so for nearly three hundred years. To this circumstance alone the
      partial preservation of the Vendish language is to be ascribed.
      At the peace of Prague, A.D. 1636, it was allotted to Saxony. At
      the congress of Vienna in 1815, it was assigned, with the
      exception of the smaller half of Upper Lusatia, to Prussia, to
      which monarchy it still belongs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      1. <i>Language of the Sorabians in Upper Lusatia</i>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The cities of Bautzen, Zittau, Kamenz, Löbau, and their
      districts, form the Saxon part of Upper Lusatia. Of its 195,000
      inhabitants, about the fourth or fifth part still speak the
      Vendish language. In the north-eastern part of Upper Lusatia,
      which belongs to Prussia, there is about the same proportion of
      Vendish inhabitants. In both territories the whole number of
      Vendes is about 100,000. Their language is very nearly related to
      the Bohemian; where the Sorabians of Lower Lusatia and the Poles
      pronounce the letter <i>h</i>, the Upper Lusatians and Bohemians
      give the sound of <i>g</i>. Both Lusatian dialects have of course
      lost very many of their original peculiarities; thus both have
      adopted the article from the German language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reformation exhibited here, as every where, its favourable
      influence on the vernacular language. The bishops of<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_309" id="page_309">[pg.309]</a></span>
      Meissen, to whose diocese Lusatia belonged, had indeed repeatedly
      admonished the priests and curates, to whose care the spiritual
      welfare of the poor Slavic Lusatians was intrusted, to learn the
      language of the people; but no particular pains was taken; and
      the Romish clergy, who spoke of the natives with the utmost
      contempt, were quite satisfied to hear the people say <i>Amen</i>
      and <i>Kyrie Eleison</i> after their own Latin prayers. As
      Lusatia lies near to the scene of Luther's earliest influence,
      the Gospel was preached early to the Slavic inhabitants by some
      of his followers; and it had the natural consequence, that the
      Romish clergy also began to give some attention to the vernacular
      language. In 1550, if not before, a Sorabian translation of the
      New Testament, the manuscript and perhaps the autograph of which
      is preserved in the library of Berlin, was completed; but it was
      never printed; probably because during the melancholy period of
      the "Interim" so called, which commenced about that time, the
      energies of the Protestants were in some measure paralyzed.
      Towards the end of the century Luther's smaller Catechism, and
      several other religious and doctrinal tracts, were translated
      from the German, mostly by clergymen, and introduced into the
      schools; chiefly the village schools; for the cities were
      steadily becoming more and more Germanized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neglect and decline of the Sorabian population was however
      always painfully felt by some patriotic individuals; and the very
      injudicious and tyrannic attempts of their German rulers, during
      the seventeenth century, to eradicate the language and supplant
      it by the German, found in all places only a reluctant and forced
      submission. But the effect of appointing every where German
      magistrates and German pastors was irresistible. The language was
      gradually forgotten by the rising generation; and hardly a
      Vendish book was printed during the first three quarters of the
      seventeenth century. Indeed hardly any one knew<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_310" id="page_310">[pg.310]</a></span>
      how to write in a language, the orthography and grammar of which
      had not yet been subjected to any rules or principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1679 the Jesuit Jacob Ticinus, a native of Lusatia, in a
      little Latin pamphlet, advised his countrymen to adopt the rules
      of orthography current in the Bohemian language, so nearly
      related to their own.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id=
      "FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_318_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> But the Protestants
      among them, who constituted the principal part in number and
      respectability, rejected his advice; and preferred to adopt the
      rules established shortly afterwards by a German clergyman, Z.J.
      Bierling.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id=
      "FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_319_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> This was a system
      between the Bohemian and the German, and is still observed. It
      was probably a sense of the approaching danger of an ultimate
      total extirpation of their language, that roused the slumbering
      Vendes again to some efforts. Parts of the Gospels were published
      towards the close of the same century by Michael Frenzel; and in
      1706 the whole New Testament appeared in a Vendish translation,
      conformed to Luther's German one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A translation of the whole Bible, made by several Protestant
      clergymen, was first published in 1729; and has been twice
      reprinted. A version for Catholics, by A. Swotlik, is extant in
      manuscript. A German hymn-book for the latter already existed in
      1696; and in 1710 the Protestants were likewise supplied with
      one. In the former the orthography of Ticinus was followed; while
      the latter was printed according to the system of Bierling. Thus
      this handful of people, surrounded by German adversaries and
      underminers of their nationality, and who would have had hard
      work enough even if they had stood as one man in their own
      defence, were split into parties, even in things the most
      indifferent; and thus made their own weakness still weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Protestants succeeded at last in the establishment of
      a<span class="newpage"><a name="page_311" id=
      "page_311">[pg.311]</a></span> seminary for the education of
      Vendish ministers at Leipzig in 1716. Another was instituted at
      Wittenberg, A.D. 1749. Their literature continued to be almost
      exclusively of a religious kind; and consisted mostly of
      translations from the German. Another <i>Wendische Grammatica</i>
      was written by G. Matthei, one of the translators of the Vendish
      Bible. A dictionary was prepared by Frencel.<a name=
      "FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_320_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> Both works can now only
      be considered as curiosities. The latter proceeds upon the firm
      conviction, that the Slavi were originally Hebrews; and contrives
      to point out in all the substantives or nouns of the Sorabian
      language a certain degree of analogy. The only philological
      works, which will be of use to those who may wish to study this
      Slavic dialect in our day, is a short grammar by Seiler,<a name=
      "FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_321_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> and a more modern one by
      J.P. Jordan. The latter has adopted the system of orthography
      best adapted to the language, viz. that introduced by Dobrovsky
      for the Bohemian.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id=
      "FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_322_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Upper Lusatian dialect has acquired in this way a degree of
      cultivation, which of course, since most of those who speak and
      read it are of the common people, comparatively few are able to
      appreciate. In religious hymns, there is no deficiency; and
      several cantos of Klopstock's Messiah have been translated into
      it by Möhn, in the measure of the original. In regard to
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_312" id=
      "page_312">[pg.312]</a></span> popular songs of the Sorabians, a
      kind of poetry in which most Slavic nations are so rich, no pains
      was taken until recently to discover whether they had any or not.
      But when on the publication of the remarkable Servian ballads,
      the interest of the German public in this species of poetry
      became strongly excited, the Saxon minister of state, baron
      Nostitz, himself an esteemed German poet, turned his attention
      particularly to this subject; and succeeded in collecting several
      little songs full of that sweet, half pensive, half roguish
      feeling, which characterizes Slavic popular poetry in general.
      They were translated by him and communicated in manuscript to his
      friends: but whether they have ever been printed we are not
      informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This subject, however, was not long suffered to rest. Two
      societies have been formed within the last twelve years, one at
      Breslau among the students of the university natives of Lusatia;
      the other at Bautzen among the scholars of the Gymnasium or High
      School; for the promotion of their native language and extending
      the knowledge of the antiquities of their country. Both these
      societies of the rising generation are favoured and assisted by
      gentlemen who take a general interest in Slavic affairs. Another
      learned society, called "The Scientific society of Upper
      Lusatia," a union of scholars, had been founded previously. In
      1836, this society offered a premium for collecting a certain
      number of genuine songs with their melodies, still extant among
      the common people. The result has been a very valuable
      collection. The first numbers appeared in 1841; and the whole
      will form a standard work in the literature of popular poetry. It
      was an agreeable surprise to find, that even these isolated
      Slavic tribes, who have been so long separated from other nations
      related to them, were still in possession of a store of genuine
      Slavic ballads and ancient melodies; while, on the other hand,
      many other ballads were found among them, in which the influence
      of their German neighbours, or perhaps their own influence on the
      latter,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_313" id=
      "page_313">[pg.313]</a></span> could be distinctly traced.
      Ballads and ditties, known to have been sung centuries before in
      Hessia or on the Rhine, rose suddenly from the night of an
      unheeded existence: disguised, indeed, but easily recognized, in
      a Slavic dress, which bore indications of the same
      antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id=

      2. <i>Language of the Sorabians in Lower Lusatia</i>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Lower Lusatia, or the north-eastern part of the Lusatian
      territory, together with the adjacent circle of Cotbus in
      Brandenburg, has about the same number of Vendish inhabitants as
      the upper province. The dialect they speak has a strong affinity
      with the Polish; but is, like that of their brethren in Upper
      Lusatia, corrupted by German interpolations, and even in a still
      greater degree. It is obviously on the decline; and we can only
      expect, that after the lapse of a hundred years or less, no other
      vestige of it will be left than written or printed documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first book known to have been printed in this dialect, which
      is written according to a peculiar combination of the German
      letters, is Möller's Hymns, Catechism, and Liturgy, Bautzen 1574.
      Their present literature, like that of Upper Lusatia, is confined
      to works for religious instruction, grammars, and dictionaries.
      Of the former they possess no small number. They have also a
      complete version of the Bible. The New Testament was translated
      for them as early as 1709, by Fabricius, and printed together
      with the German text. It has been repeatedly reprinted;
      and<span class="newpage"><a name="page_314" id=

    <h3>
      SKETCH OF THE POPULAR POETRY OF THE SLAVIC NATIONS.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      In the preceding view of the literature of the Slavic nations, we
      have abstained from giving any specimens of their poetry. A
      <i>few</i> would not have satisfied the reader, and could not
      have done justice to poets, who each for himself has a literary
      character of his own; and <i>many</i> would have at least doubled
      the size of this volume. Shukovsky, Pushkin, Mickewicz,
      Brodzinski, Krasinski, Kollar&mdash;each, as we said, has an
      individual poetical character of his own, of which the reader
      could have gathered no just idea without a whole series of their
      productions; and these even then would have lost half their value
      in a translation. Yet they all have little of that peculiar
      <i>Slavic</i> character, which belongs still in some degree to
      all Slavic nations; and which is so strikingly expressed in their
      POPULAR POETRY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our remark respecting the loss of the principal charms which all
      poetical productions have to undergo, when clothed in a foreign
      dress, applies as well to popular poetry as to the works of
      literature, and even more. Indeed, if any kind of poetry must
      needs lose half its beauties in a translation, the truth of the
      Latin saying, <i>Dulcius ex ipsa fonte bibuntur aguæ</i>, will
      never be more readily acknowledged, than in respect to the
      idiomatic<span class="newpage"><a name="page_316" id=
      "page_316">[pg.316]</a></span> peculiarities of popular ballads.
      This holds good principally of merely lyric productions, the only
      kind of songs which are left to some of the Slavic tribes. They
      are grown into the very bone and marrow of the language itself;
      and a congenial spirit can at the utmost imitate, but never
      satisfactorily translate them. And yet they are the most
      essential features in the physiognomy of a people; or, as Görres
      expresses it, they are like pulse and breath, the signs and the
      measure of the internal life. "While the great <i>epic</i>
      streams," as this ingenious writer justly says, "reflect the
      character of a whole wide-spread river-district, in time and
      history, these lyric effusions are the sources and fountains,
      which, with their net-work of rills, water and drain the whole
      country; and, bringing to light the secrets of its inmost bowels,
      pour out into lays its warmest heart's blood." <a name=
      "FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_325_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> We therefore give the
      specimens of Slavic popular poetry, which we here present to the
      reader, not merely as poems to be admired, but rather as
      characteristic features of the mental condition of the respective
      nations, and of their manner of thinking and feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the age of utilitarianism. The Genius of poetry still
      lives indeed, for he is immortal; but the period of his living
      power is gone. His present dwelling is the study; the sphere of
      his operations the parlour; the scene, where his exhibitions are
      displayed in a dress of morocco and gold, is the centre table of
      the rich and the genteel. <i>Popular poetry</i>,&mdash;we do not
      mean that divine gift, the dowry of a few blessed individuals; we
      mean that general productiveness, which pervades the mass of men
      as it pervades Nature,&mdash;popular poetry, among all the
      nations of Europe, is only a dying plant. Here and there a lonely
      relic is discovered among the rocks, preserved by the
      invigorating powers of the mountain air; or a few sickly plants,
      half withered in their birth, grow up in some solitary
      valley,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_317" id=
      "page_317">[pg.317]</a></span> hidden from the intrusive genius
      of modern improvement and civilization, who makes his appearance
      with a brush in his hand, sweeping mercilessly away even the
      loveliest flowers which may be considered as impediments in his
      path. Twenty years hence, and a trace will not be left, except
      the dried specimens which the <i>amateur</i> lays between two
      sheets of paper, and the copies preserved in cabinets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the nations of the Slavic race alone is the living flower
      still to be found, growing in its native luxuriance; but even
      here, only among the Servians and Dalmatians in its full blossom
      and beauty. For centuries these treasures have been buried from
      the literary world. Addison, when he endeavored to vindicate his
      admiration of the ballad of "Chevy-Chace," by the similarity of
      some of its passages with the epics of Virgil and Homer, had not
      the remotest idea, that the immortal blind bard had found his
      true and most worthy successors among the likewise blind poets of
      his next Hyperborean neighbours. The merit of having lifted at
      last the curtain from these scenes, belongs to Germany, chiefly
      to Herder. But only the few last years have allowed a more full
      and satisfactory view of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In laying before our readers a sketch of Slavic popular poetry,
      we must renounce at once any attempt at chronological order.
      Slavic popular poetry has yet no history. Not that a considerable
      portion of it is not very ancient. Many mysterious sounds, even
      from the gray ages of paganism, reach us, like the chimes of
      distant bells, unconnected and half lost in the air; while, of
      many other songs and legends, the colouring reminds us strongly
      of their Asiatic home. But the wonderful tales they convey, have
      mostly been only confined to tradition; especially there, where
      the fountain of poetry streamed; and streams still, in the
      richest profusion, namely, in Servia. Handed down from generation
      to generation, each<span class="newpage"><a name="page_318" id=
      "page_318">[pg.318]</a></span> has impressed its mark upon them.
      Tradition, that wonderful offspring of reality and imagination,
      affords no safer basis to the history of poetry, than to the
      history of nations themselves. To dig out of dust and rubbish a
      few fragments of manuscripts, which enable us to cast one glance
      into the night of the past, has been reserved only for recent
      times. Future years will furnish richer materials; and to the
      inquirer, who shall resume this subject fifty years after us, it
      may be permitted to reduce them to historical order; while we
      must be contented to appreciate those, which are before our eyes,
      in a moral and poetical respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Slavi, even when first mentioned in history, appear as a
      singing race. Procopius, relating the surprise of a Slavic camp
      by the Greeks, states that the former were not aware of the
      danger, having lulled themselves to sleep by singing.<a name=
      "FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_326_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> Karamzin, in his history
      of the Russian empire, narrates, on the authority of Byzantine
      writers, that the Greeks being at war with the Avars, about A.D.
      590, took prisoners three Slavi, who were sent from the Baltic as
      ambassadors to the Khan of the Avars. These envoys carried,
      instead of weapons, a kind of guitar. They stated, that, having
      no iron in their country, they did not know how to manage swords
      and spears; and described singing and playing on the guitar as
      one of the principal occupations of their peaceful life.<a name=
      "FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_327_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> The general prevalence
      of a musical ear and taste among all Slavic nations is indeed
      striking. "Where a Slavic woman is," says Schaffarik, "there is
      also song. House and yard, mountain and valley, meadow and
      forest, garden and vineyard, she fills them all with the sounds
      of her voice. Often, after a wearisome day spent in heat and
      sweat, hunger and thirst, she animates, on her way home, the
      silence of the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_319" id=
      "page_319">[pg.319]</a></span> evening twilight with her
      melodious songs. What spirit these popular songs breathe, the
      reader may learn from the collections already published. Without
      encountering contradiction, we may say, that among no other
      nation of Europe does natural poetry exist to such an extent, and
      in such purity, heartiness, and warmth of feeling, as among the
      Slavi." <a name="FNanchor_328_328" id=
      "FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_328_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we recognize in the last sentence the voice of a Slavic
      enthusiast, we copy the whole of his remarks as perfectly true;
      and would only add, that we do not consider "heartiness and
      warmth of feeling" more a characteristic feature of Slavic than
      of Teutonic popular poetry. As for the purity and universality
      with which popular poetry is preserved among the Slavic nations,
      we strongly fear, that the chief cause of these advantages lies
      in the barrenness of their literature, and in the utter ignorance
      among the common people even of its elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we attempt to carry our reader more deeply into this
      subject, we must ask him to divest himself as much as possible of
      his personal and national feelings, views, and prejudices, and to
      suffer himself to be transported into a world foreign to his
      habitual course of ideas. Human feelings, it is true, are the
      same every where; but we have more of the artificial and
      factitious in us than we are aware of. And in many cases, we
      hold, that it is not the worst part of us; for we are far from
      belonging to the class of advocates of mere nature. The reader,
      for instance, must not expect to find in all the immense treasure
      of Slavic love-songs, adapted to a variety of situations, a
      single trace of <i>romance</i>, that beautiful blossom of
      Christianity among the Teutonic races. The love expressed in the
      Slavic songs is the natural, heartfelt, overpowering sensation of
      the human breast, in all its different shades of tender affection
      and glowing sensuality; never elevating but always natural,
      always<span class="newpage"><a name="page_320" id=
      "page_320">[pg.320]</a></span> unsophisticated, and much deeper,
      much purer in the female heart, than in that of man. In their
      heroic songs, also, the reader must not expect to meet with the
      chivalry of the more western nations. Weak vestiges of this kind
      of exaltation, with a few exceptions, are to be found among those
      Slavic nations only, who, by frequent intercourse with other
      races, adopted in part their feelings. The gigantic heroism of
      the Slavic Woiwodes and Boyars is not the bravery of honour; it
      is the valour of manly strength, the valour of the heroes of
      Homer. The Servian hero, Marko Kralyewitch, was regarded by
      Goethe as the personification of <i>absolute</i> heroism; but
      even Marko does not think it beneath him to flee, when he meets
      one stronger than himself. These are the dictates of nature,
      which only an artificial point of honour can overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for the full enjoyment of Slavic popular poetry, we must
      exact still more from the reader. He must not only divest himself
      of his habitual ideas and views, but he must adopt foreign views
      and prejudices, in order to understand motives and actions; for
      the Oriental races are far from being more in a state of pure
      nature than ourselves. He will have to transport himself into a
      foreign clime, where the East and the West, the North and the
      South, blend in wonderful amalgamation. The suppleness of Asia
      and the energy of Europe, the passive fatalism of the Turk and
      the active religion of the Christian, the revengeful spirit of
      the oppressed, and the child-like resignation of him who
      cheerfully submits,&mdash;all these seeming contradictions find
      an expressive organ in Slavic popular poetry. Even in respect to
      his moral feelings, the reader will frequently have to adopt a
      different standard of right and wrong. Actions, which a Scotch
      ballad sometimes shields by a seductive excuse,&mdash;as for
      instance in the case of "Lady Barnard and Little Musgrave," where
      we become half reconciled to the violation of congujal faith by
      the tragic end of the transgressors,&mdash;are detestable crimes
      in the eyes of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_321" id=
      "page_321">[pg.321]</a></span> the Servian poet. On the other
      hand, he relates with applause deeds of vengeance and violence,
      which all feelings of Christianity teach us to condemn; and even
      atrocious barbarities, which chill our blood, he narrates with
      perfect composure. This latter remark refers, in fact, chiefly to
      the ancient epics of the Servians. Much less of barbarism and
      wild revenge meets us in their modern productions, namely, the
      epic poems relating to the war of deliverance in the beginning of
      the present century; although their oppressors had given them
      ample cause for a merciless retaliation. In the shorter and more
      lyric songs, of which a rich treasure is the property of most
      Slavic nations, and in which their common descent is most
      strikingly manifested, there prevails a still purer morality, and
      the most tender feelings of the human breast are displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on account of this decidedly exotic character of Slavic
      popular poetry, that, when the author of the present work first
      published a German version of the Servian popular songs, Goethe
      considered it as an advantage, that the work of translation had
      fallen into the hands of a lady. Only a female mind, the great
      poet thought, was capable of the degree of accommodation
      requisite to clothe the "barbarian poems" in a dress, in which
      they could be relished by readers of nations foreign to their
      genius. Even the love-songs, although "of the highest beauty," he
      thought could only he enjoyed <i>en masse</i>. But this last
      remark applies in a certain measure to all popular poetry; for
      these little songs are like the warblings of the wood-birds; and
      a single voice would do little justice to the whole. The
      monotonous chirping of one little feathered singer is tedious or
      burdensome; while we enjoy their full concert as the sweetest
      music of nature. One swallow does not make a summer. But the
      whole blissful sense of nature waking from her wintry sleep comes
      over you, when you hear the full, mixed chorus of the little
      songsters of the grove; and the monotonous cry of the
      cuckoo<span class="newpage"><a name="page_322" id=
      "page_322">[pg.322]</a></span> seems to belong just as much to
      the completeness of the concert, as the enchanting solo of the
      nightingale.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we attempt to characterize Slavic popular poetry as a whole,
      we have chiefly to consider those shorter songs, which are common
      to all Slavic tribes, and which alone can be compared to the
      ballads of other nations. For, among the Slavi, only the
      Servians, including the Dalmatians, Montenegrins, and Croats, who
      speak the same language,&mdash;and indeed among all other modern
      nations they alone,&mdash;possess long popular epics, of a heroic
      character. What of this species of poetry still survives among
      the other Slavic nations, or indeed in any other country of
      Europe, is only the echo of former times. The endlessly
      protracted "Storie" of the Italians are, indeed, often longer
      than the Servian heroic tales; but in no other respect do they
      afford a point of comparison with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Slavic popular songs have nothing, or very little, of the
      bold dramatic character which animates the Scotch, German, and
      Scandinavian ballads. Even dialogues occur seldom, except in some
      narrative form; as for instance:
    </p>To her brother thus the lady answered;
    <br />
    <p>
      or,
    </p>And the bonny maiden asked her mother.
    <br />
    <p>
      A division into epic and lyric ballads would also be difficult. A
      considerable portion, especially of the Russian and Servian
      songs, begin with a few narrative verses; although the chief part
      of the song is purely lyric. These introductory verses are
      frequently allegorical; and if we do not always find a connection
      between them and the tale or song which follows, it is because
      one singer borrows these introductions from another, and adds an
      extemporaneous effusion of his own. These little
      allegories,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_323" id=
      "page_323">[pg.323]</a></span> however, frequently give a
      complete picture of the subject. They are, also, not always
      confined to the introduction, but spun out through the whole
      poem. The following Russian elegy on the death of a murdered
      youth, may illustrate our remarks. We translate as literally as
      possible. The Russian original, like the translation, has no
      rhymes,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id=
      "FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href=

    </p>ELEGY.

    <br />
    O thou field! thou clean and level field!
    <br />
    O thou plain, so far and wide around!

    <br />
    Every thing; with sky-blue flowerets small,
    <br />
    Fresh green grass, and bushes thick with leaves;
    <br />
    But defaced by one thing, but by one!
    <br />
    <br />
    For in thy very middle stands a broom,
    <br />
    On the broom a young gray eagle sits,
    <br />
    And he butchers wild a raven black,
    <br />
    Sucks the raven's heart-blood glowing hot,
    <br />
    Drenches with it, too, the moistened earth.
    <br />
    Ah, black raven, youth so good and brave!
    <br />
    Thy destroyer is the eagle gray.
    <br />
    <br />
    Not a swallow 't is, that hovering clings,
    <br />
    Hovering clings to her warm little nest;
    <br />
    To the murdered son the mother clings.
    <br />
    And her tears fall like the rushing stream,
    <br />
    And his sister's like the flowing rill;
    <br />
    Like the dew the tears fall of his love:
    <br />
    When the sun shines, it dries up the dew.

    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Servian songs begin also frequently with a series of questions,
      the answers to which form mostly a very happy introduction to the
      tale. For instance:
    </p>What's so white upon yon verdant forest?
    <br />
    Is it snow, or is it swans assembled?
    <br />
    Were it snow, it surely had been melted;
    <br />
    Were it swans, long since they had departed.
    <br />
    Lo! it is not swans, it is not snow, there,
    <br />
    'T is the tents of Aga, Hassan Aga, etc.<a name="FNanchor_330_330"
    id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_330_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a>
    <br />
    <p>
      In Russian songs, on the other hand, a form of expression
      frequently occurs, which we venture to call a negative
      antithesis. It is less clear than the Servian, but just as
      peculiar. A preceding question seems to be frequently supposed;
      as we have also seen in the piece adduced above, "It is not a
      swallow," the poet says, "that clings to her nest; it is a mother
      who clings to her son." In other songs we hear;
    </p>Not a <i>falcon</i> floateth through the air,
    <br />
    Strays a <i>youth</i> along the river's brim, etc.
    <br />
    <p>
      or,
    </p>Not a cuckoo in the forest cool doth sing,
    <br />
    Not in the gardens sings a nightingale;
    <br />
    In the prison dark a brave youth sighs,
    <br />
    He sighs and pours out many parting tears.
    <br />
    <p>
      The frequency of standing epithets, characteristic more or less
      of all popular poetry, is particularly observable among the
      Slavic nations. The translator will be troubled to find
      corresponding terms; but whatever he may select, it is essential
      always<span class="newpage"><a name="page_325" id=
      "page_325">[pg.325]</a></span> to employ the same; for instance,
      he must not translate the far-extended idea of <i>bjeloi</i>,
      white, alternately by <i>white, bright, snowy, fair</i>. In
      Slavic, not only things really white are called so, but every
      thing <i>laudable</i> and <i>beautiful</i> is called white; as,
      the <i>white</i> God, i.e. the <i>good</i> God; the <i>white</i>
      Tzar, i, e. the monarch of <i>white</i>, or great and powerful,
      Russia. In most cases the poet himself no longer thinks of the
      signification and original meaning of the word. Yards, walls,
      bodies, breasts, hands, etc. are invariably <i>white</i>; even
      the breast and the hand of the tawny Moor. The sea is seldom
      mentioned without the epithet <i>blue</i>; Russian heroes have
      <i>black</i> hair, but the head of the Servian hero is called
      <i>Rusja glava</i>, fair-haired, with a reddish shade. Russian
      youths, together with their steeds, are invariably <i>dobroe</i>,
      that is, good or brave; the heart is in the poetry of the same
      nation <i>retivoe</i>, cheerful, rash, light. The sun is in
      Servian <i>yarko</i>, bright; in Russian <i>krasnoi</i>, which
      signifies fair and red. Doves are in both languages <i>gray</i>.
      How much the poets are accustomed to these epithets, and how
      heedlessly they use them, appears from a Servian tale, called
      "Haykuna's Wedding," a charming poem, and even much more
      elaborated than is common, where the breasts of a beautiful girl
      are compared to two gray doves. To remind our readers of the
      father of popular poetry, Homer, and of the like use by him of
      stereotype epithets, is unnecessary.

      The Slavic popular ballads, like the Spanish, very seldom lay any
      claim to completeness. They do not pretend to give you a whole
      story, but only a <i>scene</i>. They are, for the most part,
      little pictures of isolated situations, from which it is left to
      the imagination of the hearers to infer the whole. The narrative
      part is almost always descriptive, and, as such, eminently
      <i>plastic</i>. If the picture represented has not the dramatic
      vivacity of the ballads of the Teutonic nations, it has the
      distinctness, the prominent forms, and often the perfection of
      the best executed bas-reliefs of the ancients. Like these, the
      Slavic poems seldom represent wild passions or complicated
      actions; but, <span class="newpage"><a name="page_326" id=
      "page_326">[pg.326]</a></span> by preference, scenes of rest, and
      mostly scenes of domestic grief or joy. When we look at the
      celebrated Greek bas-relief, which represents an affianced maiden
      the evening before her wedding, weeping, or bashfully hiding her
      fair face, while a servant girl washes her feet,<a name=
      "FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_331_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> we cannot help being
      impressed with just the same feelings, which seize us when we
      hear or read one of the numerous Slavic songs devoted to similar
      scenes. To illustrate our remarks, and to make our readers
      understand exactly what we call the <i>plastic</i> character of
      Slavic popular songs, we insert here the following Servian
      love-scene. We add, that it was one of Goethe's favourites,
      worthy, in his opinion, to be compared with the
      Canticles.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id=
      "FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_332_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> There is a melody in the
      language of this song, not to be imitated in any translation. We
      confess that Frederic Schlegel's definition of architecture,
      "frozen music," occurs to us when we read it in the original.
    </p>JOVO AND MARIA.
    <br />
    <br />
    'Cross the field a breeze it bore the roses,
    <br />
    Bore them far into the tent of Jovo;
    <br />
    In the tent were Jovo and Maria,
    <br />
    Jovo writing and Maria broidering.
    <br />
    Used has Jovo all his ink and paper,
    <br />

    "O sweet love, my dearest soul, Maria,
    <br />
    Tell me, is my soul then dear unto thee?
    <br />
    Or my hand find'st thou it hard to rest on?"
    <br />

      The high antiquity of Slavic popular poetry is manifest among
      other things, in the frequent mythological features which occur.
      In the ballads of the Teutonic nations, we recollect very few
      instances of talking animals. As to those which talk in nursery
      tales, we are always sure to discover in them enchanted princes
      or princesses. In one Scotch ballad, "The Gray Goshawk," a horse
      speaks; and, in a few other instances, falcons and nightingales.
      In Spanish popular poetry we do not meet with a single similar
      example. In the songs of all the Slavic nations, conversing,
      thinking, sympathizing animals are very common. No one wonders at
      it. The giant Tugarin Dragonson's steed warns him of every
      danger. The great hero Marko's horse even weeps, when he feels
      that the death of his master approaches. Nay, life is breathed
      even into inanimate objects by the imagination of Slavic girls
      and youths. A Servian youth contracts a regular league of
      friendship and brotherhood with a bramble-bush, in order to
      induce it to catch his coy love's clothes, when she flees before
      his kisses. Even the stars and planets sympathize with human
      beings, and live in constant intercourse with them and their
      affairs. Stars become messengers; a proud maiden boasts to be
      more beautiful than the sun; the sun takes it ill, and is advised
      to burn her coal-black in revenge. The moon hides herself in the
      clouds when the great Tzar dies. One of the most interesting
      Servian tale, called "The Heritage," is the fruit of the moon and
      the morning star's gossiping with each other. It begins
      thus:<span class="newpage"><a name="page_328" id=
      "page_328">[pg.328]</a></span>
    </p>To the morning star the moon spake chiding;
    <br />
    "Morning star, say where hast thou been wandering?
    <br />
    Where hast thou been wandering and where lingering,
    <br />
    Where hast thou three full white days been lingering?"
    <br />
    <br />
    To the moon the morning star has answered;
    <br />
    "I've been wandering, I've three days been lingering,
    <br />
    O'er the white walls of the fortress Belgrade,
    <br />
    Gazing there on strange events and wonders."
    <br />
    <p>
      The events which the star had witnessed, it now proceeds to
      relate to the moon; and these make the subject of this beautiful
      tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having touched upon these general features, did our limits
      permit, we should speak more at large of those mythological
      beings of a more distinct character, which belong to the
      individual Slavic races; for example, the Vila of the Servians,
      the Russalki of the Malo-Russians, and the like; at least so far
      as this belief is interwoven in their poetry, the only respect in
      which it concerns us here. But we must confine ourselves to a few
      brief remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong and deeply-rooted superstitions of the Slavic nations
      are partly manifest in their songs and tales; these are full of
      foreboding dreams, and good or bad omens; witchcraft of various
      kinds is practised; and a certain oriental fatalism seems to
      direct will and destiny. The connection with the other world
      appears nevertheless much looser, than is the case with the
      Teutonic nations. There is no trace of spirits in Russian
      ballads; although spectres appear occasionally in Russian nursery
      tales. In Servian, Bohemian, and Slovakian songs, it occurs
      frequently, that the voices of the dead sound from their graves;
      and thus a kind of soothing intercourse is kept up between the
      living and the departed. The superstition of a certain species of
      blood-sucking spectres, known to the novel<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_329" id="page_329">[pg.329]</a></span>
      reading world under the name of <i>vampyres</i>, a superstition
      retained chiefly in Dalmatia, belongs also here. In modern Greek,
      such a spectre is called <i>Brukolacas</i> in Servian
      <i>Wukodlak</i>. We do not however recollect the appearance of a
      vampyre, in any genuine production of modern Greek or Servian
      poetry. It seems as if the sound sense of the common people had
      taught them, that this superstition is too shocking, too
      disgusting, to be admitted into poetry; while the oversated
      palates of the fashionable reading world crave the strongest and
      most stimulating food, and can only be satisfied by the most
      powerful excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the whole series of Slavic ballads and songs, which lie before
      our eyes, we meet with only one instance of the return of a
      deceased person to this world, in the like gloomy and mysterious
      way, in which the Christian nations of the North and West are
      wont to represent such an event. This is in the beautiful Servian
      tale, "Jelitza<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id=
      "FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_334_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> and her Brothers." As it
      is too long to be inserted here entire, we must be satisfied with
      a sketch of it. Jelitza, the beloved sister of nine brothers, is
      married to a Ban on the other side of the sea. She departs
      reluctantly, and is consoled only by the promise of her brothers
      to visit her frequently. But "the plague of the Lord" destroys
      them all; and Jelitza, unvisited and apparently neglected by her
      brothers, pines away and sighs so bitterly from morning to
      evening, that the Lord in heaven takes pity on her. He summons
      two of his angels before him;
    </p>"Hasten down to earth, ye my two angels,
    <br />
    To the white grave where Jován lies buried,
    <br />
    The lad Jován, Jelitza's youngest brother;
    <br />
    Into him, my angels, breathe your spirit,<span class=
    "newpage"><a name="page_330" id="page_330">[pg.330]</a></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    "Make for him a horse of his white grave-stone,
    <br />
    Knead a loaf from the black mould beneath him,
    <br />
    And the presents cut out from his grave-shroud;
    <br />
    Thus equip him for his promised visit."
    <br />
    <p>
      The angels do as they are bidden. Jelitza receives her brother
      with delight, and asks of him a thousand questions, to which he
      gives evasive answers. After three days are past, he must away;
      but she insists on accompanying him home. Nothing can deter her.
      When they come to the church-yard, the lad Jován's home, he
      leaves her under a pretext and goes back into his grave. She
      waits long, and at last follows him. When she sees the nine fresh
      graves, a painful presentiment seizes her. She hurries to the
      house of her mother. When she knocks at the door, the aged
      mother, half distracted, thinks it is "the plague of the Lord,"
      which, after having carried off her nine sons, comes for her. The
      mother and daughter die in each other's arms.<a name=
      "FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_335_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple and affecting tale affords, then, the only instance,
      in Slavic popular poetry, of a regular apparition; but even here
      that apparition has, as our readers have seen, a character very
      different from that of a Scotch or German ghost. The same ballad
      exists also in modern Greek; although in a shape perhaps not
      equal in power and beauty to the Servian.<a name=
      "FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_336_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a><span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_331" id="page_331">[pg.331]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the very circumstance that its subject is so isolated among
      the Slavic nations, who are so ready to seize other poetical
      ideas and to mould them in various ways, leads us to believe,
      that the Servian poet must have heard somehow or other the Greek
      ballad, or a similar one; and that the subject of the Servian
      ballad, although this is familiar to all classes, was originally
      a stranger in Servia. Nowhere indeed, in the whole range of
      Slavic popular poetry, do we meet with that mysterious gloom,
      with those enigmatical contradictions, which are peculiar to the
      world of spirits of the Teutonic North; and which we think find
      their best explanation in the antithesis between the principles
      of Christianity, and the ruins of paganism on which it was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, that, wherever Christianity has been carried, similar
      contradictions must necessarily have taken place: but the mind of
      the Slavic nations, so far as it is manifest in their poetry,
      seems never to have been perplexed by these contradictions.
      History shows, that the Slavic nations, with the exception of
      those tribes who were excited to headstrong opposition by the
      cruelty and imprudence of their German converters, received
      Christianity with childlike submission; in most cases principally
      because their superiors adopted it.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id=
      "FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_337_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> Vladimir the Great, to
      whom the Gospel and the Koran were offered at the same time, was
      long undecided which to choose; and was at last induced to
      embrace the former, because "his Russians could not live without
      the pleasure of drinking."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id=
      "FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_338_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> The wooden idols, it is
      true, were solemnly destroyed; but numerous fragments of their
      altars were suffered to remain undisturbed at the foot of the
      cross; and the passion-flower<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_332" id="page_332">[pg.332]</a></span> grew up in the midst
      of the wild broom, the branches of which, tied together, the
      Tshuvash considers, even at the present day, as his tutelary
      spirit or Erich<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id=
      "FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_339_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a>. No struggle seems ever
      to have taken place, to reconcile these contradictory elements;
      while the more philosophical spirit of the Teutonic nations, and
      their genius for meditation and reflection, could not be so
      easily satisfied. The character of the Teutonic world of spirits
      is the reflex of this struggle. The foggy veil which covers their
      forms, the mysterious riddles in which their existence is
      wrapped, the anxious pensiveness which forms a part of their
      character, all are the results of these fruitless and mostly
      unconscious endeavours to amalgamate opposing elements. We cannot
      approach the region of their mysterious existence without an
      awful shuddering; while the few fairies, which Slavic poetry and
      superstition present us, strike us by the distinctness and
      freshness of their forms, and give us the unmingled impression
      either of the ludicrous or of the wild and fantastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains to speak of the moral character of Slavic popular
      poetry. If, in respect to its decency, we may judge from the
      printed collections, we must be struck with the purity of manners
      among the Slavic nations, and the unpollutedness of their
      imagination. Hacquet, speaking of the Slovenzi or Vindes, the
      Slavic inhabitants of Carniola, states, that the songs with which
      they<span class="newpage"><a name="page_333" id=
      "page_333">[pg.333]</a></span> accompany their dances are often
      indecent<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id=
      "FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_340_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a>. But there is little
      dependence to be placed on judgments of this description.
      Sometimes expressions and ideas are rashly called indecent, which
      only differ from the conventional forms of decency without really
      violating its laws. Hacquet moreover only half understood those
      songs of the Slovenzi. We will at least not condemn them without
      having seen them. Among the Russian songs, there are some of a
      certain wanton and equivocal character, displaying with perfect
      <i>naïveté</i> a scarcely half-veiled sensuality. The boldness,
      with which these songs are sung in chorus by young peasant women,
      has often excited the astonishment of foreigners. The number of
      ballads of this description, however, so far as we are informed,
      is not considerable; and the character of Russian love-ballads in
      general is pure and chaste. As for the Servians, they have in
      fact a great multitude of songs of a very marked levity and
      frivolity; and Goethe, when these first appeared in the German
      version of Gerhardt, could not help finding it remarkable, that
      two nations, one half-barbarous, the other the most practised of
      all, (<i>die durchgeübteste</i>, meaning the French,) should meet
      together on the step of frivolous lyric poetry<a name=
      "FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_341_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a>. But these Servian songs
      are pure in comparison with many Grub-Street ballads and German
      <i>Zotenlieder</i>. The spirit of roguery and joviality, which
      prevails in them all, proves that they are more the overflowings
      of wild and unrestrained youth, than the fruits of dissoluteness
      of manners. They are often coarse, but never vulgar; they are
      indelicate, but they are not impudent. At any rate, we never meet
      in them that confounding of virtuous and vicious feelings, which
      has so often struck us<span class="newpage"><a name="page_334"
      id="page_334">[pg.334]</a></span> painfully even in the best
      Scotch and German ballads. We refer the reader here to our
      previous remarks on the measure of right and wrong, to be applied
      in our judgment of nations foreign to us in habits and pursuits.
      The heroes of the Servian epics are always represented as
      virtuous, often to harshness. Marko Kralyewitch is always ready
      to punish young women for any trespass against female modesty, by
      severing their heads from their shoulders; and even to his own
      bride, when he thinks her too obliging towards himself, he
      applies the most ignominious names, and threatens her with the
      sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love and heroism, the principal subjects of all poetry, are also
      the most popular among the Slavi. But one of the peculiarities of
      their poetry is, that these two subjects are kept apart more than
      among other nations. While in the exploits of the Spanish heroes,
      which the popular Romances celebrate, love is so interwoven with
      heroism, and heroism with love, that we are not able to separate
      this two-fold exaltation of a generous mind, love is almost
      excluded from the heroic poems of the Slavi; or, at least,
      admitted only about in the same degree as in the epics of the
      ancients. It is seldom, if ever, the motive of the hero's
      actions. We need then add nothing more, to describe the character
      of Slavic heroism. It is never animated by romantic <i>love</i>;
      although sometimes, in the more modern epics of the Servians, by
      romantic <i>honour</i>. In one of the modern Servian tales,
      perhaps about a century old, which describes a duel between a
      Dalmatian Servian and a Turk, a scene of the most perfect
      chivalry occurs. The young Dalmatian captain, Vuk Jerinitch,
      having just reached manhood, inquires of the older captains,
      which of the Turks had most injured their country during the last
      invasion, while he was a child. The old captains name to him
      Zukan, the Turkish standard bearer. Vuk consequently challenges
      him, proposing at the same time, in true Oriental<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_335" id="page_335">[pg.335]</a></span>
      character, that, himself having a beautiful sister and the Turk a
      wife of equal beauty, both shall belong to the victor. Zukan of
      course accepts the challenge. Their meeting is in the best
      chivalric style; they demand of each other no pledge or oath of
      faith, but meet in Vuk's tent with perfect confidence; they
      embrace and kiss each other, and make friendly inquiries after
      each other's health. The first hour of their meeting flies away
      in conviviality, and in admiration of the ladies. At last the
      desire to gain the Christian girl induces the Turk to interrupt
      their drinking. But, before they begin the fight, "they kiss each
      other on the cheeks, and forgive each other mutually their blood
      and death." This scene indeed has a decidedly Oriental costume;
      but the feelings, from which it results, are produced by as much
      of romantic exaltation as any Spanish romance could exhibit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goetze, in the introduction to his German translation of Russian
      popular ballads, observes: "In the Russian love songs we meet
      with more <i>softness</i> of feeling than romantic delicacy." We
      do not perceive any marked difference in that respect, between
      the character of Russian and of other Slavic erotic songs; and
      apply therefore his remark to the whole race. <i>Romantic</i>
      delicacy we must not, in fact, expect to find; but often all the
      natural delicacy of warm, tender, devoted love; all the freshness
      of youthful, unsophisticated feelings; all the burning passion of
      Spanish love, with the same strong tincture of sensuality; though
      seldom, very seldom, that depth, that infiniteness of the same
      feeling, so affectingly expressed in more than one popular ballad
      of the Scandinavians, Germans, and British,&mdash;that love which
      reaches far beyond the grave, and chains souls to each other even
      in different worlds. Russian lovers, who are compelled by
      circumstances to leave their mistresses, give frequently the
      following or similar advice:<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_336" id="page_336">[pg.336]</a></span>
    </p>Weep not, weep not, O sweet maid!
    <br />
    Choose, O choose another love!
    <br />
    <i>Is he better, thou'll forget me</i>;
    <br />
    Is he worse, thou'lt think of me,
    <br />
    Think of me, sweet soul, and weep!
    <br />
    <p>
      Love, among the Slavi, more than among any other Christian race,
      seems to be a <i>dream of youth</i>. Among unmarried persons of
      both sexes, free and easy intercourse is kept up. But nothing can
      favour less a free and lasting affection, than the national mode
      of contracting marriages. Among those Slavic nations, who have
      lived long in connection with the Teutonic races, the national
      manners have of course partly changed in this respect, as in
      others; especially among the higher classes. But among the
      Servians, the old Asiatic custom, according to which a marriage
      is agreed on by the parents of the parties, often without these
      knowing each other, is kept up in its fullest extent; and, even
      among all Slavic nations, strong traces of this custom are still
      left. Affianced Slavic girls often do not see their intended
      husbands before the wedding-day. Thus a girl, even in attaching
      herself to a youth, must early familiarize herself with the
      thought, that the time may come when she will have to take back
      her heart at her parent's bidding. Illegitimate love is rare; and
      is considered as the highest crime. Of the Russian popular songs,
      no small portion describe lovers taking leave of each other,
      because the youth or the maid must marry another; in another
      considerable portion, young married women are represented
      lamenting their miserable fate. The following popular ballad will
      afford the reader a characteristic specimen of the whole
      tenderness of such a Russian parting scene.
    </p>THE FAREWELL.

    <br />
    <br />
    Not a falcon floated through the air,
    <br />
    Strayed a youth along the river's brim.
    <br />
    Slowly strayed he on and dreamingly,
    <br />
    Sighing looked unto the garden green,
    <br />
    Heart all filled with sorrow mused he so:
    <br />
    "All the little birds are now awake,
    <br />
    All, embracing with their little wings,
    <br />
    Greeting, all have sung their morning songs.
    <br />
    But, alas! that sweetest doveling mine,
    <br />
    She who was my youth's first dawning love,
    <br />
    In her chamber slumbers fast and deep.
    <br />
    Ah! not even her friend is in her dreams,
    <br />
    Ah! no thought of me bedims her soul,
    <br />
    While my heart is torn with wildest grief,
    <br />
    That she comes to meet me here no more."
    <br />
    <br />
    Stepped the maiden from her chamber then;
    <br />
    Wet, O! wet with tears her lovely face,
    <br />
    All with sadness dimmed her eyes so clear,
    <br />
    Feebly drooping hung her snowy arms.
    <br />
    'T was no arrow that had pierced her heart,
    <br />
    'T was no adder that had stung her so;
    <br />
    Weeping, thus the lovely maid began:
    <br />
    "Fare thee well, beloved, fare thee well,
    <br />
    Dearest soul, thy father's dearest son!
    <br />
    I have been betrothed since yesterday;
    <br />
    Come, to-morrow, troops of wedding-guests;
    <br />
    To the altar, I, perforce, must go!
    <br />
    I shall be another's then; and yet
    <br />
    Thine, thine only, thine alone till death."

      But the warm and tender hearts of the Slavic women, nevertheless,
      find means to satisfy that natural want of the female breast, to
      pour out on certain objects the whole blessing of love.
      <i>Family</i> connections are among no other race regarded as so
      holy, the ties of relationship are nowhere so cherished, as among
      the Slavi. Maternal tenderness is the subject of very many songs;
      and is set by comparisons in the most shining light. In the
      Russian ballad above adduced,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id=
      "FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_343_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> we have seen how
      slightly the poet thinks of the love of the wife; her tears are
      dried up by the sun, like the morning dew; while the mother's
      tears gush out incessantly like the waters of the mountain
      stream. In a Servian ballad, a youth wounds his hand. The Vila, a
      malicious mountain-nymph, offers to cure him. But she exacts a
      high price,&mdash;from his mother, her right hand; from his
      sister, her hair; and from his wife, her necklace of pearls. The
      mother willingly gives her right hand, and the sister her hair,
      but the wife refuses the necklace. The love of a mother is often
      described by the image of swallows, clinging to their own warm
      nest; or of tender doves, bereft of their young ones. The rights
      of a mother are respected with true filial piety, even by the
      barbarian hero Marko, who never fails to pay his aged mother
      filial respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      More remarkable, however, in Slavic popular poetry, is the
      peculiar relation of the sister to the brother. This remark holds
      especially good of Servia. Sisters cling to their brothers with a
      peculiar warmth of feeling. These are their natural protectors,
      their supporters. They swear by the head of their brothers. To
      have no brother is a misfortune, almost a disgrace. A mourning
      female is represented in all Slavic poetry under the constant
      image of a cuckoo; and the cuckoo, according to the Servian
      legend, was a sister who had lost her brother. Numerous
      little<span class="newpage"><a name="page_339" id=
      "page_339">[pg.339]</a></span> songs illustrate the great
      importance which a Servian girl attaches to the possession of a
      brother. Those who have none, think even of artificial means for
      procuring one. This is exhibited in a pretty little ballad, where
      two sisters, who have no brother, make one out of white and pink
      silk wound around a stick of box-wood; and, after putting in two
      brilliant black stones as eyes, two leeches as eyebrows, and two
      rows of pearls as teeth, put honey in his mouth, and entreat him
      "to eat and to speak." In another ballad, of a more serious
      description, "George's young wife" loses at once in battle her
      husband, her brideman (<i>paranymphos</i>, in Servia a female's
      legitimate friend through life), and her brother. The gradations
      of the poetess in her description of the widow's mourning are
      very characteristic, and give no high idea of conjugal
      attachments in Servia.
    </p>For her husband, she has cut her hair;
    <br />
    For her brideman she has torn her face;
    <br />
    For her brother she has plucked her eyes out.
    <br />
    Hair she cut, her hair will grow again;
    <br />
    Face she tore, her face will heal again;
    <br />
    But the eyes, they'll never heal again,
    <br />
    Nor the heart, which bleedeth for the brother.
    <br />
    <p>
      After having thus attempted to point out to the reader what we
      consider as the <i>general</i> characteristic features of Slavic
      popular poetry, we proceed to add a few remarks on the
      <i>distinguishing</i> traits of the different nations of the
      Slavic race individually, so far as our limits permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here it is among the nations of the EASTERN STEM that we must
      look for our principal harvest. We follow the same order as in
      the former parts of this work.

      The RUSSIANS have very few ballads of high antiquity; and, even
      in this small number, hardly any one has reference to the heroic
      prose tales, which are the delight of Russian
      nurseries.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_340" id=
      "page_340">[pg.340]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russians have indeed nursery tales (<i>skazki</i>) of all
      descriptions; and we have often heard, that, during the first
      decennium of the present century, still many an old-fashioned
      country squire, many a country gentlewoman brought up among her
      female slaves like an oriental princess, were in the habit of
      having themselves lulled to sleep by them. They are almost
      invariably told in the same words; and as much as possible with
      the same intonation of voice. One <i>Skazkochnik</i>, or
      <i>Skazkochnitza</i>, adopts this manner from another. The
      traditions of Vladimir and his giant heroes are the favourite,
      but not the exclusive subjects of these tales. They are also
      printed and sold separately; with a coarse wood-cut on the upper
      part of every page, representing the scene described, and the
      back of the page empty. We are told that they are mostly got up
      by "Deacons," a class of the lower clergy, in their leisure
      hours. It is probable that these traditions formerly existed also
      in the shape of popular ballads; but no trace has been left of
      them. In the beginning of this century the work of Kirscha
      Danilof, of which we have spoken in our view of Russian
      literature,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id=
      "FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_344_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> was first published,
      containing the ancient traditions; written in the national
      prosodic measure, but without any poetical spirit; replete with
      anachronisms and absurdities, without the <i>naiveté</i> which
      can alone make these latter tolerable. They were, besides, full
      of interpolations; and were evidently the productions of a man
      from the people who had acquired half an education. For this
      reason they have never gained popularity in this shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more modern heroic ballads of the Russians are of a
      remarkably tame character. Lawless and rebellious deeds are
      sometimes their subjects; but they end mostly with an act of
      retributive justice. We shall give a specimen of this species
      before we part with the Russians.<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_341" id="page_341">[pg.341]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      By far the largest portion of Russian popular songs is of the
      erotic kind. According to Russian authorities, even their oldest
      ballads, to judge from the language,<a name="FNanchor_345_345"
      id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_345_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> cannot be traced further
      than to the last quarter of the sixteenth century; and the number
      even of these is very small. Most of those now current among the
      people are derived from the beginning of the middle of the last
      century. According to Goetze, the reign of Peter the First was
      very favourable to popular poetry.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id=
      "FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_346_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> His daughter, the
      empress Elizabeth, was a successful poetess herself; and her
      ditties had a perfectly popular character. If we may draw a
      conclusion from the frequency with which modern historical events
      have given birth to popular ballads, one must suppose that many
      ancient ones are lost. The victories of Peter the First are
      celebrated in many popular ballads, some of which are of no
      inconsiderable merit; as the reader will judge for himself from
      the specimen we give below. The French invasion also, of 1812,
      which aroused the Russian nation so powerfully, gave rise to not
      a few patriotic songs, of many of which the authors were peasants
      and common soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are, however, various indications, which seem to justify
      the belief, that several of the Russian ballads still current
      among the people are, in fact, more ancient than they appear, or
      perhaps even than they actually are in their present shape. We
      have not room here to dwell on this subject. We remark only, that
      from one circumstance alone we may draw the safe conclusion, that
      the Russians have ever been a <i>singing</i> race. We allude to
      their custom of attaching verses full of allusions and sacred
      meaning to every festival, nay, to every extraordinary event
      of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_342" id=
      "page_342">[pg.342]</a></span> human life, and thus of fettering
      the flying hours with the garland chains of poetry and song. They
      have to this very day their wedding songs, Pentecost and
      Christmas carols, and various other songs, named after the
      different occasions on which they are chanted, or the game which
      they accompany. Although these songs, also, have been modernized
      in language and form, they seem always to have been regarded with
      a kind of pious reverence, and appear to have been altered as
      little as possible. Most of their allusions are, for that reason,
      unintelligible at the present day. That their groundwork is
      derived from the age of paganism, is evident from the frequent
      invocations of heathen deities, and from various allusions to
      heathen customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly related to these songs are the various ditties of a social
      kind, which peasant girls and lads are in the habit of singing on
      certain, stated occasions; for instance, walking songs, dancing
      songs, and the like. They consist mostly of endless repetition,
      often of words or single syllables, apparently without meaning;
      and the tune, in which these fragmentary poems are sung, is after
      all the best part of it. Yet not seldom a spark of real poetry
      shines through that melodious tissue of unmeaning words. What is
      most remarkable in these songs, which have now been more than a
      century the exclusive property of the common people, is the utter
      absence of coarseness and vulgarity, even in the wedding songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian songs, like the Russian language, have a peculiar
      tenderness, and are full of caressing epithets. These are even
      frequently applied to inanimate objects. A Russian postilion, in
      a simple and charming song, calls the tavern, which he never can
      make up his mind to pass without stopping, "his dear little
      mother." The words <i>Matushka, Batushka, Starinka</i>, which we
      may venture to give in English by <i>motherling, fatherling,
      oldling</i>, are in Russian favourite terms of endearment. The
      post-boy's song may stand here as eminently characteristic of
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_343" id=
      "page_343">[pg.343]</a></span> cheerful, childlike, caressing
      disposition of the nation. It is translated in the measure of the
      original, as nearly as it could be imitated in English.
    </p>THE POSTILION.
    <br />
    <br />
    Tzarish Tavern, thou
    <br />
    Our good motherling,

    So invitingly
    <br />
    Standest by the way!
    <br />
    Broad highway, that leads

    Fellows young as I,
    <br />
    As they drive along,

    When they pass thee by,

    <br />

    <br />
    And thy voice is soft,

    Full of gentle talk.

      Russian lovers are quite inexhaustible in fondling and caressing
      expressions. "My shining moon, my bright sun, my nourisher
      (<i>Kormiletz</i>), my light, my hope, my white swan," together
      with all those epithets common to all languages, as, <i>dove,
      soul, heart</i>, etc. are current terms In Russia. Especially
      favourable to this affectionate manner of address is the
      abundance of diminutives which the language possesses. Not only
      "little soul," "little heart," <i>Dushinka, Serdzinka</i>, etc.
      are favourite expressions of Russian lovers; but we find even
      <i>Yagodka</i>, "little berry," and <i>Lapushka</i>, "little
      paw," etc. Love is ingenious in inventing new diminutives for the
      beloved object.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exquisite tenderness in the Russian love-songs is united
      with a deep, pensive feeling, which indeed pervades the whole
      Russian popular poetry. Were we to describe the character of this
      in one expression, we should call it <i>melancholy-musical</i>.
      Even the more frivolous and equivocal songs have a tincture of
      this pensiveness. While the Servian songs of this description are
      the ebullitions of merry and petulant youth, the Russian are
      frequently not without a spice of sentimentality. Girls are often
      represented painting the unhappy consequences of their weakness
      with a very suspicious mixture of penitence and pleasure; so that
      the hearer remains undecided, whether the former or the latter is
      predominant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In perfect harmony with this melancholy is the Russian national
      music. The expressive sweetness of the Russian melodies has long
      been the admiration of those foreign composers, to whom
      circumstances had made them known. The history of these melodies
      is just as uncertain as that of the verses; they<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_345" id="page_345">[pg.345]</a></span>
      seem always to have been united; no one knows where they came
      from. In respect to popular tunes and songs, the answer which the
      Ashantees gave to Mr. Bowditch has often occurred to us: "They
      were made when the country was made." The Russian tunes are
      richer and more varied than are popular airs in general. Of most
      of the songs only the first two verses are set to the melody; all
      the following being repeated in the same tune. But there are some
      which extend further. Some of these airs include more than a
      whole octave in their notes; while the national melodies of most
      other nations move in general among a few notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To account for the melancholy character of the Russian music and
      poetry, and to reconcile it with the well-known cheerful
      disposition of the nation, has been attempted by several Russian
      critics. "The peculiarities of a nation," Karamzin remarks, "may
      always be explained by the circumstances which have operated on
      it; although the grandchildren may have some of the virtues and
      some of the vices of their ancestry, even if they are differently
      situated. Perhaps the present character of the Russians may
      exhibit faults, which it contracted during the barbarism of the
      Mongolian subjugation." The pensiveness which pervades the
      Russian songs has also been considered as a remnant of that
      gloom, necessarily impressed on the Russian character during two
      centuries of the most cruel oppression. There is no doubt that
      the Russians before, during, and after their subjugation by the
      Mongols, had a thousand causes of discouragement and disasters;
      bloody civil wars, the most barbarian despotism, the plague,
      slavery,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id=
      "FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_347_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> and the like. But it is
      just as certain, that notwithstanding all the causes of sorrow,
      the Russians are still the most cheerful and light-hearted people
      on earth; with all their hearts and senses enjoying the
      scanty<span class="newpage"><a name="page_346" id=
      "page_346">[pg.346]</a></span> pleasures of life; though deprived
      of all civil privileges, and even of many social rights. The
      truth is, that it is with nations as with individuals. Neither in
      the one case nor in the other must we expect always to see them
      deposit their <i>habitual</i> feelings in their poetry. It is a
      well-known fact that Molière was a man of a most serious
      disposition. Cowper, immediately before writing his "John
      Gilpin," was in a mood bordering on despair. Young, while
      composing his melancholy Night Thoughts, enjoyed his life as well
      as any man. The Russians do not sing their every-day sentiments,
      but their holiday feelings. That sweet pensiveness, which thrills
      so affectingly through their music and poetry, is to them a
      species of luxury. A soft, melancholy emotion, not deep enough
      indeed to cause suffering, and slumbering in every-day life in
      the recesses of the poet's soul, awakes in the hour of
      inspiration and spreads a gentle shadow over his habitual
      sunshine. The peculiar melancholy <i>resignation</i> of Slavic
      lovers we have already attempted to explain. Indeed, it is to
      their love songs, principally, that the general remark on the
      pensiveness of Russian songs and airs is applicable.

    With their little wings;
    <br />
    On them, suddenly,
    <br />
    Darted down a hawk.
    <br />
    <br />
    One he seized and tore,
    <br />
    Tore the little dove,
    <br />
    With his feather'd feet,
    <br />
    Soft blue little dove;
    <br />
    And he poured his blood
    <br />
    Streaming down the tree.
    <br />
    Feathers too were strew'd
    <br />
    Widely o'er the field;
    <br />
    High away the down
    <br />
    Floated in the air.
    <br />
    <br />
    Ah! how wept and wept;
    <br />
    Ah! how sobb'd and sobb'd
    <br />
    The poor doveling then
    <br />
    For her little dove.

      The following little elegy we translate from a Russian Annual;
      the editor of which, Baron Delvig, took it down from the lips of
      a peasant girl.
    </p>THE FAITHLESS LOVER.
    <br />
    <br />
    Nightingale, O nightingale,
    <br />
    Nightingale so full of song,
    <br />
    Tell me, tell me, where thou fliest,
    <br />
    Where to sing now in the night?
    <br />
    Will another maiden hear thee
    <br />
    Like to me, poor me, all night
    <br />
    Sleepless, restless, comfortless,
    <br />
    Ever full of tears her eyes?
    <br />
    Fly, O fly, dear nightingale,
    <br />
    Over hundred countries fly,
    <br />
    Over the blue sea so far;
    <br />
    Spy the distant countries through,
    <br />
    Town and village, hill and dell,
    <br />
    Whether thou find'st any one,
    <br />
    Who so sad is, as I am?
    <br />
    <br />
    O, I bore a necklace once,
    <br />
    All of pearls like morning dew;

    With a precious stone thereon;<span class="newpage"><a name=

    <br />
    <br />
    And I bore deep in my heart
    <br />
    Love, a love so warm and true.
    <br />
    When the sad, sad autumn came,
    <br />
    Were the pearls no longer clear;
    <br />
    And in winter burst my ring,
    <br />
    On my finger, of itself!<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id=

      There is one trait in the Russian character, which we recognize
      distinctly in their poetry, namely, their peculiar and almost
      Oriental veneration for their sovereign, and a blind submission
      to his will. There is indeed somewhat of a religious mixture in
      this feeling; for the Tzar is not only the sovereign lord of the
      country and master of their lives, but he is also the head of the
      orthodox church. The <i>orthodox</i> Tzar is one of his standing
      epithets. The following ballad, which we consider as one of the
      most perfect among Russian popular narrative ballads, exhibits
      very affectingly the complete resignation with which the Russian
      meets death, when decreed by his Tzar. In its other features,
      also, it is throughout natural. Its historical foundation is
      unknown. There are several versions of it extant, slightly
      differing from each other; which seems to prove that it has been
      for a long time handled by the people.

    They are leading a prince and peer.
    <br />
    <br />
    Priests and deacons are walking before,
    <br />
    In their hands a great book open;
    <br />
    Then there follows a soldier troop,
    <br />
    With their drawn sabres flashing bright.
    <br />
    At his right, the headsman goes,
    <br />
    Holds in his hand the keen-edged sword;
    <br />
    At his left goes his sister dear,
    <br />
    And she weeps as the torrent pours,
    <br />
    And she sobs as the fountains gush.
    <br />
    <br />
    Comforting speaks her brother to her:
    <br />
    "Weep not, weep not, my sister dear!
    <br />
    Weep not away thy eyes so clear,
    <br />
    Dim not, O dim not thy face so fair,
    <br />

    Say, for what is it thou weepest so?

    Is 't for my lands, so rich and wide?
    <br />
    Is 't for my silver, or is 't for my gold?

    <br />
    <br />
    "Ah, thou, my light, my brother dear,
    <br />
    Not for thy goods or inheritance,
    <br />
    Not for thy lands, so rich and wide,
    <br />
    Is 't that my eyes are weeping so;

    "Ah, thou, my light, my sister sweet!
    <br />
    Thou mayest weep, but it won't avail;
    <br />
    Thou mayest beg, but 't is all in vain;
    <br />
    Pray to the Tzar, but he will not yield.

    Now the scaffold the prince ascends.

    Calmly mounts to the place of death;

    Prays to his Great Redeemer there,

      We add another more modern heroic ballad, composed, perhaps, by
      one of the soldiers, who was present at the exploit. The first
      siege of Azof took place in 1695. The fortress was, however, not
      taken by storm, although repeated assaults were made; but the
      garrison capitulated in the following year. The great white Tzar
      is of course Peter I.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id=

    </p>THE STORMING OF AZOF.
    <br />
    <br />
    The poor soldiers have no rest,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Neither night nor day!</span>
    <br />
    Late at evening the word was given
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the soldiers gay;</span>
    <br />
    All night long their weapons cleaning,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were the soldiers good,</span>
    <br />
    Ready in the morning dawn,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in ranks they stood.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    Not a golden trumpet is it,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That now sounds so clear;</span>
    <br />
    Nor the silver flute's tone is it,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That thou now dost hear.</span>
    <br />
    'Tis the great white Tzar who speaketh,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis our father dear.</span>
    <br />
    Come, my princes, my Boyars,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nobles, great and small!</span>
    <br />
    Now consider and invent
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good advice, ye all!</span>
    <br />
    How the soonest, how the quickest,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fort Azof may fall?</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    The Boyars, they stood in silence.&mdash;
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our father dear,</span>
    <br />
    He again began to speak
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his eye a tear:</span>
    <br />
    Come, my children, good dragoons,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my soldiers all,</span>
    <br />
    Now consider and invent

    <br />
    How the soonest, how the quickest,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fort Azof may fall?</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    Like a humming swarm of bees,
    <br />
    So the soldiers spake,<span class="newpage"><a name="page_354" id=
    "page_354">[pg.354]</a></span>
    <br />
    With one voice at once they spake:
    <br />
    "Father, dear, great Tzar!
    <br />
    Fall it must! and all our lives
    <br />
    Thereon we gladly stake."
    <br />
    <br />
    Set already was the moon,
    <br />
    Nearly past the night;
    <br />
    To the storming on they marched,
    <br />
    With the morning light;
    <br />
    To the fort with bulwark'd towers
    <br />
    And walls so strong and white.
    <br />
    <br />
    Not great rocks they were, which rolled
    <br />
    From the mountains steep;
    <br />
    From the high, high walls there rolled
    <br />
    Foes into the deep.
    <br />
    No white snow shines on the fields,
    <br />
    All so white and bright;
    <br />
    But the corpses of our foes
    <br />
    Shine so bright and white.
    <br />
    Not up-swollen by heavy rains
    <br />
    Left the sea its bed;
    <br />
    No! in rills and rivers streams
    <br />
    Turkish blood so red!
    <br />
    <p>
      Different dialects are spoken, and different ballads are sung by
      the population of Malo-Russia<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id=

      Polish-Russian and Polish-Austrian provinces, where the peasantry
      is of the Ruthenian race. The musical element is still more
      prevalent among them; and their ditties are rhymed. The few very
      ancient ones, which are still extant, alone make an
      exception.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_355" id=

      These have the form and the spirit of the ballads of the Great
      Russians, and can in no way be discerned from them; while the
      great mass has a different character. Indeed, such an immense
      number of ballads have originated in the rich and fertile steppes
      of the Ukraine, that it would seem as if each bough of their
      forest trees must harbour a singer, and each blade of grass on
      these endless blooming plains whisper the echo of a song.<a name=
      "FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_354_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> The pensive character of
      the Great Russian popular poetry becomes, in that of the
      Malo-Russian and Ruthenian, a deep melancholy, that finds vent in
      a great variety of sweet, elegiac, melodies. According to the
      author of a little collection of their popular songs, published
      first in a German translation, "these are the after-pains of
      whole generations; these are the sorrows of whole centuries,
      which are blended in one everlasting sigh!" <a name=
      "FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_355_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> If we look back to the
      history of these regions, we cannot doubt that it is the spirit
      of their past, that breathes out of these mournful strains. The
      cradle of the Kozak stood in blood; he was rocked to the music of
      the clashing of swords. For centuries the country on both banks
      of the Dnieper as far as to the northwestern branch of the
      Carpathian mountains, the seat of this race, was the theatre of
      constant warfare and aggression; there was no time for the
      blessings of a peaceful development. Their narrative ballads
      have, therefore, few other subjects than the feuds with Poles and
      Tartars; the Kozak's parting with his beloved one; or his lonely
      death on the border, or on the bloody<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_356" id="page_356">[pg.356]</a></span>
      battle field! No wonder that their little lyric effusions have
      imbibed the same melancholy spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      These vast level regions were the principal thoroughfares of the
      hordes of Mongols and Tartars, who from the thirteenth to the
      fifteenth century overspread Russia, and penetrated as far as
      Silesia. In Northern Russia, at least, a shade of the old forms
      and constitutions was preserved; and native princes reigned under
      Mongol dominion; but in the South every thing was broken up, and
      the country laid completely waste. Fugitives, reduced to a life
      of plunder and booty, congregated here and there; the country on
      the Lower Don, near the entrance of this river into the sea of
      Azof, was one of their strongholds; another portion found refuge
      on the islands of the Dnieper, just below the present site of
      Yekatrinoslav. Here they fortified themselves in little rude
      castles; while, after all, their situation out of the track of
      the wild barbarians was their best shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first named region was principally the asylum for fugitives
      from Great Russia; deserters and exiles from other parts of the
      country joined them; and the Tartar population, which they found
      on the spot, and the neighbouring Kalmuk tribes, mingled with
      them. These are the Kozaks of the Don; of whom the Kozaks of
      Grebensk, of Yaitzk, and of the Ural, are branches. They are
      Russians, and sing the songs of their brethren, the Russians. The
      river Don, or, as it is familiarly and at the same time
      respectfully called, <i>Don Ivanovitch</i><a name=
      "FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_356_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a> plays a prominent part
      in their ballads. They have a touching childlike love for that
      noble river, so majestic and yet so gentle, that once gave
      shelter on its banks to their forefathers. Father Don, the stilly
      (<i>tikho</i>) Don, Don Ivanovitch, are its constant epithets.
      The scene of a considerable number of their ballads is in the
      vessels which glide upon the 'stilly' Don.<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_357" id="page_357">[pg.357]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The fugitives who had congregated on the Dnieper were also
      Russians; but the mixture of other nations, which they received,
      would appear to have come principally from the Circassians of the
      Caucasus, as the still beautiful shape and countenance of the
      Tshernomorski seem to indicate;<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id=
      "FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_357_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> and also in part from
      the Ruthenian tribes of the Carpathian mountains, as their
      language proves. These are the Zaporoguean Kozaks; so called from
      having their principal seats beyond the <i>porogues</i>, or
      water-falls of the Dnieper. Both sections of the Kozaks founded a
      kind of military democratic government; and tried to shelter
      themselves against their enemies in those rude castles called
      <i>Sicza</i>, best protected by thick woods and the surrounding
      water. They soon began to spread out in the small towns called
      <i>Groazisko</i>, fortified also indeed, but built so slightly
      that they were almost as soon erected as destroyed. The Kozaks of
      the Don, after the deliverance of Russia in the second half of
      the fifteenth century, acknowledged in some degree the
      sovereignty of the Russian Tzar; and aided Ivan II to conquer
      Siberia. They were used by his successors as border guardians
      against the wild Asiatic hordes; whom they partly chased from
      their homes in the Ural mountains, and settled there in their
      stead. Thus they spread all over Siberia; always looking back
      with a pensive and languishing feeling to their "dear
      fatherling," their gentle "nourisher," their "stilly Don
      Ivanovitch." <a name="FNanchor_358_358" id=
      "FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_358_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Zaporoguean Kozaks, meanwhile, had issued
      the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_358" id=
      "page_358">[pg.358]</a></span> population of the Ukraine. Their
      first establishment consisted of a strict republic of warriors;
      no female was admitted into their strongholds on the islands of
      the Dnieper. By degrees they relaxed; and began with keeping
      their families in villages in the vicinity, where they spread
      with incredible rapidity. Then a line of separation was drawn
      between the inhabitants of the settlements, and the Zaporogueans
      in the castles; none of these latter were allowed to marry. Thus
      their youth were always ready for the enemy; and the distinction
      was only dropped in more peaceful times. They kept themselves
      independent of Russia until the latter part of the seventeenth
      century; but their more dangerous enemies had long been the
      Poles, their north-western neighbours. It was the period of
      Poland's glory. The Poles were conquerors in the North and in the
      East. At last the Kozaks, after a century of struggles,
      acknowledged the authority of the Polish sovereign Stephan
      Bathori (ob. 1586); moved partly, it is said in their traditions,
      by the personal grandeur of that chevaleresque monarch. But now
      the Polish nobility overspread the Ukraine. They became
      land-owners and oppressors; and their stewards, their still more
      detested assistants. They were followed by the Jesuits; who
      alternately by persuasion and compulsion attempted to entice the
      natives, who all belonged to the Greek church, to come under the
      dominion of the Pope. A war of religious persecution and
      resistance arose. The Kozaks ultimately revolted in 1648; and a
      few years after (in 1654) their Hetman Chmielnitzky submitted
      himself and the whole Ukraine to Tzar Alexei, the father of Peter
      I.

    <p>
      The struggles of this insurrection, their previous feuds with the
      Poles their oppressors, and afterwards their repeated revolts
      from the Russians, who tried to undermine their liberties, have
      given birth to a great number of simple ballads, the bold spirit
      of which presents a noble relief to the habitual melancholy of
      Malo-Russian poetry in general. They have

      <i>Bandurists</i>; and who, with a kind of simple guitar in their
      hand, ramble through the country, sure to find a willing audience
      in whatever village they may stop. Their ballads are of course
      not confined to the scenes of the earlier centuries; the more
      recent wars with the Turks and Tartars also, and the campaigns
      made in modern times in the service of Russia, present subjects
      enough of interest; for their productiveness is still alive,
      although the race of the professional bards is growing more and
      more scarce. They call their historical ballads <i>Dumi</i>, or
      <i>Dumki</i>, an appellation for historical elegies, which has
      recently been adopted by Polish literati.<a name=

      We give here a few characteristic specimens of their poetry;
      serving to illustrate their warlike spirit, as well as their
      domestic relations; their skill in narrative ballads, as well as
      their power of expressing in lyric strains the unsophisticated
      feelings of a tender heart. We begin with two genuine Kozak
      elegies.

      We finish with a few Ruthenian ballads, having no political
      reference. The first is interesting as illustrating a peculiar
      popular superstition. The Leshes are a kind of Satyrs; covered
      like them with hair, and of a very malicious nature. They
      steal<span class="newpage"><a name="page_363" id=
      "page_363">[pg.363]</a></span> children and young women. Their
      presence has a certain benumbing influence; a person whom they
      visit cannot move or stir; although, in the case of our ballad,
      we have some suspicion that "the brandy, the wine, and the mead,"
      had some preparatory influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second exhibits the whole plaintive, yielding mood of a
      Russian loving maid; and may be considered as a
      <i>characteristic</i> specimen.

    'They are stolen by the Leshes,

    <br />
    <p>
      Of still greater importance in respect to our subject are the
      SERVIANS. We have seen already in this work, that the inhabitants
      of the Turkish provinces of Servia and Bosnia, of <span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_367" id="page_367">[pg.367]</a></span>
      Montenegro, of the Austrian kingdom of Slavonia, of Dalmatia and
      Military Croatia, speak essentially the same language; which is
      likewise the vernacular dialect of numerous Servian settlements
      in Hungary, along the south-western shore of the Danube. Of this
      language, which has been alternately called Illyrian, Servian,
      Morlachian, Bosnian, Croatian, Rascian, and perhaps by still
      other different appellations, it may be truly said, that it has
      more names than dialects; and even the few of these latter differ
      so slightly, that the difference would scarcely be perceived by a
      foreigner. It is also true, that, on account of the various
      systems of writing which have been adopted by the different
      sections of this race, the foreigner will sometimes find it more
      difficult to understand the language as written than as spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inexhaustible mine of Servian popular poetry belongs then to
      the whole nation; although, of course, neither the productiveness
      is every where the same, nor the power and opportunity of
      preservation. For its favourite home we must look to those
      regions where modern civilization has least penetrated; viz. to
      Turkish Servia, Bosnia, Montenegro. There also the vernacular
      language is spoken with the greatest purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      An intelligent Italian traveller, Abbate Fortis, published about
      a hundred years ago an interesting description of the
      Morlachians, that is, the Croatian Servian inhabitants of
      Dalmatia, a tribe distinguished by wild passions and proud
      contempt of civil life; but full of poetical feeling, and much
      attached to old usages and the recollections of their ancestors.
      He printed for the first time some of their beautiful ancient
      ballads; but although they were much admired in the German
      versions which Herder and Goethe gave of them (through the
      French), the region of their birth remained a <i>terra
      incognita</i>. To a few literati only it was known, that many of
      these ballads, although in a spurious shape, had been collected
      by the Franciscan monk, Andreas Cacich Miossich; and also that a
      great many fragments<span class="newpage"><a name="page_368" id=
      "page_368">[pg.368]</a></span> of remarkable popular heroic songs
      were scattered, as illustrations, through the Croatian and
      Dalmatian dictionaries of Bellosztenecz, Jambressich, and Delia
      Bella. It was known, too, but only by a few, that even ancient
      Servian historians referred to similar songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vuk Stephanovitch Karadshitch must therefore be called the true
      discoverer of this mine of beauty; and the judiciousness,
      patience, and conscientious honesty, with which his collection
      was got up, deserves the highest praise. Many of the remarkable
      songs first communicated to the literary public were the
      reminiscences of his own youth; for he was born and brought up in
      Turkish Servia. Many more he was only able to find after years of
      careful and indefatigable research. His large
      collection&mdash;four volumes with at least five or six hundred
      pieces of poetry&mdash;was formed upon the principle, that no
      piece should be admitted, for the genuineness of which he could
      not be personally responsible, by having himself heard it from
      one of the people. Nearly the third part of these poems consists
      of epic tales; some of them from five to seven hundred verses
      long; one, more than twelve hundred.

      The poetry of the Servians is most intimately interwoven with
      their daily life. It is the picture of their thoughts, feelings,
      actions, and sufferings; it is the mental reproduction of the
      respective conditions of the mass of individuals, who compose the
      nation. The hall where the women sit spinning around the
      fireside; the mountains on which the boys pasture their flocks;
      the square where the village youth assemble to dance the
      <i>kolo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id=
      "FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_366_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> the plains where the
      harvest is reaped; the forests through which the lonely traveller
      journeys,&mdash;all resound with song. Song accompanies all kinds
      of business, and frequently relates to it. The Servian
      <i>lives</i> his poetry.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_369"
      id="page_369">[pg.369]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Servians are accustomed to divide their songs into two great
      portions. Short compositions in various measures, either lyric or
      epic, and sung without instrumental accompaniment, they call
      <i>shenske pjesme</i>, or <i>female songs</i>, because they are
      mostly made by females. The other portion, consisting of long
      epic tales in verses of five regular trochaic feet, and chanted
      to the <i>Guslé</i>, a kind of simple violin with one chord, they
      called <i>Yunatchke pjesme,</i> that is, <i>heroic</i> or
      <i>young men's songs</i>; for it is an interesting fact, that the
      ideas of a <i>young man</i> and of a <i>hero</i>, are expressed
      in Servian by one and the same word, <i>Yunak</i>. The first are,
      in a very high degree, of a domestic character. They accompany us
      through all the different relations of domestic life; as well
      through its daily occupations, as through the holidays and
      festivals which interrupt its ordinary course. Much has been
      said, and more could be said, in praise of these harmonious
      effusions of a tender, fresh, and unsophisticated feeling; but,
      as we have already dwelt at large upon their general character,
      we must be satisfied here with adding only that which
      distinguishes Servian lays from other Slavic songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this distinction we find principally in the
      <i>cheerfulness</i>, which is the fundamental element of Servian
      poetry,&mdash;a serenity clear and transparent like the bright
      blue of a southern sky. The allusions to the misfortunes of
      married life alone, gather sometimes in heavy clouds on this
      beautiful sky. The fear of being chained to an <i>old</i> man, or
      of a grim mother-in-law, or the quarrelling of the
      sisters-in-law, or the increasing cares of the
      household,&mdash;for, in the true patriarchal style, married sons
      remain in the house of the parents, and all make together only
      one family,&mdash;all these circumstances disturb sometimes the
      inexhaustible serenity of the Servian women, and call forth
      gentle lamentations, or perhaps still oftener horrible
      imprecations, from their humble breasts. Indeed the songs not
      made for particular<span class="newpage"><a name="page_370" id=
      "page_370">[pg.370]</a></span> occasions also bear strongly and
      distinctly the stamp of domestic life, and are fall of allusions
      to family relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spirit of graceful roguery is very prevalent among Servian
      girls. Their social spinning meetings are especially productive
      of little witty ballads, in which men and women are represented
      as disputing, and the former, of course, are always outwitted;
      just as is the case in numerous English and German popular
      ballads. But love is also among them the grand and prevailing
      theme. To judge from these songs, Servian girls and youths keep
      up a frequent and tender intercourse with each other. The youth
      bears carefully in memory the hour when the girls go to fetch
      water; and the frequent festivities, where the dance is not
      permitted to fail, give the best opportunity for mutual
      intercourse. Further to the south, and between the mountains, the
      customs are more strict, and love-songs are less frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the ancient songs, recited on certain stated occasions, the
      wedding songs, adapted to all the various ceremonies of Slavic
      marriage, are the most remarkable. And here we meet again with
      one of those various contradictions of the mental world, which
      puzzle philosophy. While all the symbolic ceremonies are strongly
      indicative of the shameful state of servitude and humiliation, to
      which the institution of marriage subjects the Slavic
      woman<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id=
      "FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a>
      (for Slavic <i>maidens</i> are in a certain measure free and
      happy, and, if beautiful and industrious, even honoured and
      sought after;) the <i>songs</i>, the mental reproductions of
      these coarse, rough, humiliating <i>acts</i>, are delicate,
      sprightly, and almost gallant. There are various indications,
      that, like the Russian<span class="newpage"><a name="page_371"
      id="page_371">[pg.371]</a></span> songs of this description,
      which they strongly resemble, they are derived from a very early
      period. Like them they have no allusion to church
      ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id=
      "FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_368_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling expressed in their love-songs is in general gentle
      and often playful, indicating more of tenderness than of passion.
      If, however, they are excited to anger, their hatred becomes
      rage; and is poured forth in imprecations, of which no other
      language has a like multitude. But these imprecations are not
      stereotype, as is the case with most other nations. They are
      composed often, with astonishing ingenuity, by the offended
      persons themselves. Sometimes we see curses invoked upon the
      satisfying of the common wants of life. Thus when the lad curses
      his faithless love: "As much bread as she eats, so much pain may
      she suffer! as much water as she drinks, so many tears may she
      shed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We subjoin a few of these Servian ballads as specimens, just as
      they happen to come to hand.
    </p>PARTING LOVERS.
    <br />
    <br />
    To white Buda, to white castled Buda
    <br />
    Clings the vine-tree, cling the vine-tree branches;
    <br />
    Not the vine-tree is it with its branches,
    <br />
    No, it is a pair of faithful lovers.
    <br />
    From their early youth they were betrothed,
    <br />
    Now they are compelled to part untimely;
    <br />
    One addressed the other at their parting:
    <br />
    "Go, my dearest soul, and go straight forward,
    <br />
    Thou wilt find a hedge-surrounded garden,
    <br />
    Thou wilt find a rose-bush in the garden,
    <br />
    Pluck a little branch off from the rose-bush,
    <br />
    Place it on thy heart, within thy bosom;
    <br />
    Even as that red rose will be fading,<span class="newpage"><a name=
    "page_372" id="page_372">[pg.372]</a></span>
    <br />
    Even so, love, will my heart be fading."
    <br />
    And the other love this answer gave then;
    <br />
    "Thou, dear soul, go back a few short paces,
    <br />
    Thou wilt find, my love, a verdant forest,
    <br />
    In the forest stands a cooling fountain,
    <br />
    In the fountain lies a block of marble;
    <br />
    On the marble stands a golden goblet,
    <br />
    In the goblet thou wilt find a snowball.
    <br />
    Dearest, take that snowball from the goblet,
    <br />
    Lay it on thy heart within thy bosom;
    <br />
    Even as the snowball will be melting,
    <br />
    Even so, love, will my heart be melting."
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      RENDEZVOUS.
    </p>Sweetheart, come, and let us kiss each other!
    <br />
    But, O tell me, where shall be our meeting?
    <br />
    In thy garden, love, or in my garden?
    <br />
    Under thine or under mine own rose-trees?
    <br />
    Thou, sweet soul, become thyself a rose-bud;
    <br />
    I then to a butterfly will change me;
    <br />
    Fluttering I will drop upon the rose-bud;
    <br />
    Folks will think I'm hanging on a flower,
    <br />
    While a lovely maiden I am kissing!
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      ST. GEORGE'S DAY.
    </p>To St. George's day the maiden prayed;
    <br />
    "Com'st thou again, O dear St. George's day!
    <br />
    Find me not here, by my mother dear,
    <br />
    Or be it wed, or be it dead!&mdash;
    <br />
    But rather than dead, I would be wed!" <a name="FNanchor_369_369"
    id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href=

    <br />
    UNITED IN DEATH.
    <br />
    <br />
    Two young lovers loved each other fondly,
    <br />
    And they washed them at the self-same water,
    <br />
    And they dried them with the self-same napkin.
    <br />
    One year passed, their love was known by no one;
    <br />
    Two years passed, and all the world did know it,
    <br />
    And the father heard it and the mother;
    <br />
    And their love the mother would not suffer,
    <br />
    But she parted the two tender lovers.
    <br />
    <br />
    Through a star the youth sent to the maiden:
    <br />
    "Die, O love, on Saturday at evening,
    <br />
    I, thy youth, will die on Sunday morning."
    <br />
    And they did as they had told each other;
    <br />
    Died the maiden Saturday at evening.
    <br />
    Died the youth on Sunday morning early;
    <br />
    Close together were the two then buried;
    <br />
    Through the earth their hands were clasped together;
    <br />
    In their hands were placed two young green apples.
    <br />
    <br />
    Little time had passed since they were buried;
    <br />
    O'er the youth sprang up a verdant pine-tree,
    <br />
    O'er the maid a bush with sweet red roses;
    <br />
    Round the pine-tree winds itself the rose-bush,
    <br />
    As the silk around a bunch of flowers.
    <br />
    <p>
      But not all the female Servian songs exhibit so much tenderness.
      That their usual gentleness and humility does not always prevent
      these poor oppressed beings from sometimes taking the lead in
      domestic affairs, one would be apt to conclude from the following
      ballad:<span class="newpage"><a name="page_374" id=
      "page_374">[pg.374]</a></span>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      HOUSEHOLD MATTERS.
    </p>Come, companion, let us hurry
    <br />
    That we may be early home,
    <br />
    For my mother-in-law is cross,
    <br />
    Only yestreen she accused me,
    <br />
    Said that I had beat my husband;
    <br />
    When, poor soul, I had not touched him.
    <br />
    Only bid him wash the dishes,
    <br />
    And he would not wash the dishes;
    <br />
    Threw then at his head the pitcher,
    <br />
    Knocked a hole in head and pitcher;
    <br />
    For the head I do not care much;
    <br />
    But I care much for the pitcher,
    <br />
    As I paid for it right dearly;
    <br />
    Paid for it with one wild apple,
    <br />
    Yes, and half a one besides.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id=

    "#Footnote_370_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a>
    <br />
    <p>
      Objects of still higher admiration the Servians afford us in
      their <i>heroic</i> poems. Indeed, what epic popular poetry is,
      how it is produced and propagated, what powers of invention it
      naturally exhibits,&mdash;powers which no art can
      command,&mdash;we may learn from this multitude of simple legends
      and complicated fables. The Servians stand in this respect quite
      isolated; there is no modern nation, that can be compared to them
      in epic productiveness; and a new light seems to be thrown over
      the grand compositions of the ancients. Thus, without
      presumption, we may pronounce the publication of
      these<span class="newpage"><a name="page_375" id=
      "page_375">[pg.375]</a></span> poems one of the most remarkable
      literary events of modern times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general character of the Servian tales is the
      <i>objective</i> and the <i>plastic</i>. The poet, in most cases,
      is in a remarkable degree <i>above</i> his subject. He paints his
      pictures not in glowing colours, but in distinct, prominent
      features; no explanation is necessary to interpret what the
      reader thinks he sees with his own eyes. If we compare the
      Servian epics with those, which other Slavic nations formerly
      possessed, we find them greatly superior. In the Russian
      <i>Igor</i>, the whole narrative is exceedingly indistinct; you
      may read the whole of it five times, without being able clearly
      to follow out the composition. Not a single character stands out
      in relief. The mode of representation has more of the lyric than
      of the epic. The ancient Bohemian poems have more distinctness
      and freshness. No obscurity disturbs us. But the passions of the
      poet break forth so often, as to give the whole narration
      something of the subjective character; while the Servian, even
      when representing his countrymen in combat with their mortal
      enemies and oppressors, displays about the same partiality for
      the former, as Homer for his Greeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introductions, not only to the tales themselves, but even to
      new situations, are frequently allegorical. A distinct image is
      placed before the eyes at once. A tale, describing a famous
      sanguinary deed of revenge, commences thus:
    </p>What's that cry of anguish from Banyani?<a name=

    <br />
    <p>
      Ravens are the messengers of unhappy news. The battle of Mishar
      begins with the following verses:
    </p>Flying came a pair of coal-black ravens
    <br />
    Far away from the broad field of Mishar,
    <br />
    Far from Shabatz, from the high white fortress;
    <br />
    Bloody were their beaks unto the eyelids,
    <br />
    Bloody were their talons to the ankles;
    <br />
    And they flew along the fertile Matshva,
    <br />
    Waded quickly through the billowy Drina,
    <br />
    Journey'd onward through the honoured Bosnia,
    <br />
    Lighting down upon the hateful border,
    <br />
    'Midst within the accursed town of Vakup,
    <br />
    On the dwelling of the captain Kulin;
    <br />
    Lighting down and croaking as they lighted.
    <br />
    <p>
      Three or four poems, of which courtships or weddings are the
      subjects, begin with a description of the beauty of the girl.
      Especially rich and complete is the following:
    </p>Never since the world had its beginning,
    <br />
    Never did a lovelier flow'ret blossom,
    <br />
    Than the flow'ret in our own days blooming;
    <br />
    Haikuna, the lovely maiden flower.
    <br />
    <br />
    She was lovely, nothing e'er was lovelier!
    <br />
    She was tall and slender as the pine-tree;
    <br />
    White her cheeks, but tinged with rosy blushes,
    <br />
    As if morning's beam had shone upon them,
    <br />
    Till that beam had reached its high meridian.
    <br />
    And her eyes, they were two precious jewels,<span class=
    "newpage"><a name="page_377" id="page_377">[pg.377]</a></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    And her eyebrows, leeches from the ocean,
    <br />
    And her eyelids they were wings of swallows;
    <br />
    And her flaxen braids were silken tassels;
    <br />
    And her sweet mouth was a sugar casket,
    <br />
    And her teeth were pearls arrayed in order;
    <br />
    White her bosom, like two snowy dovelets,
    <br />
    And her voice was like the dovelet's cooing;
    <br />
    And her smiles were like the glowing sunshine;
    <br />
    And her fame, the story of her beauty,
    <br />
    Spread through Bosnia and through Herz'govina.
    <br />
    <p>
      We should never end, if we continued thus to extract all the
      beautiful and striking passages from the Servian popular lyrics;
      although their chief merit by no means consists in beautiful
      passages, but, in most cases, in the composition of the whole,
      and in the distinct, graphic, and plastic mode of representation.
      In respect to their style, we add only a single remark. Slavic
      popular poetry in general has none of the vulgarisms, which, in
      many cases, deface the popular ballads of the Teutonic nations.
      Yet <i>dignity</i> of style cannot be expected in any popular
      production. Those whose feelings, from want of acquaintance with
      the poetry of nature, are apt to be hurt by certain undignified
      expressions interspersed unconsciously sometimes in the most
      beautiful descriptions, will not escape unpleasant impressions in
      reading the Servian songs. The pictures are always fresh,
      tangible, and striking; but, although not seldom the effects of
      the sublime, and of the deepest tragic pathos, are obtained by a
      perfect simplicity, nothing could be more foreign to them than
      the dignified stateliness and scrupulous refinement of the French
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number and variety of the Servian heroic poems is immense.
      The oldest legendary cycle is formed by their great Tzar Dushan
      Nemanyitch and his heroes; by the pious prince<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_378" id="page_378">[pg.378]</a></span>
      Lazar, their last independent chief, who was executed by the
      Turks after having been made prisoner in battle; and by the death
      of his faithful knights on the field of Kossovo. The two battles
      fought here, in 1389 and 1447, put an end to the existence of the
      Servian empire. In immediate connection with these epic songs are
      those of which Marko Kralyewitch, i.e. Marko the king's son, the
      Servian Hercules, is the hero; at least thirty or forty in
      number. The pictures, which these ballads exhibit, are extremely
      wild and bold; and are often drawn on a mythological ground.
      Indeed both the epic and the lyric poetry of the Servians are
      interwoven with a traditional belief in certain fanciful
      creatures of Pagan superstition, which exercise a constant
      influence on human affairs. Witches (<i>Vjashtitzi</i>), veiled
      women who go from house to house, carrying with them destruction;
      the plague, personified as an old horrible looking female; and
      also the saints, and among them the <i>thunderer</i> Elias and
      the <i>fiery</i> Mary who sends lightning; these all appear
      occasionally. But the principal figure is the Vila, a mountain
      fairy, having nearly the same character as the northern
      elementary spirits; though the malicious qualities predominate,
      and her intermeddling is in most cases fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various features which serve to allay the extreme
      wildness and rudeness of the oldest Servian poems. As one of the
      principal of these we consider the solemn institution of a
      contract of brotherhood or fraternal friendship, which the
      Servians seem to have inherited from the Scythians.<a name=
      "FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_373_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> Two men or two women
      promise each other before the altar, and under solemn ceremonies,
      in the name of God and St. John, eternal friendship. They bind
      themselves by this act to all the mutual duties of brothers and
      sisters. Similar relations exist also between the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_379" id="page_379">[pg.379]</a></span>
      two sexes, when a maid solemnly calls an old man her "father in
      God," or a young one her "brother in God;" or when a man calls a
      woman his "mother or sister in God." This is mostly done in cases
      of distress. When a person, thus appealed to, accepts the
      appellation, they are in duty bound to protect and to take care
      of the unfortunate, who thus give themselves into their hands;
      according to the prevailing notion, a breach of this contract is
      severely punished by Heaven. Marko Kralyevitch was united in such
      an alliance with the Vila; in modern times we find it sometimes
      between Turks and Servians in the midst of their most bitter
      feuds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional ballads of the Servians, referring to the heroes
      of their golden time, are undoubtedly in their groundwork of
      great antiquity; but as until recently they have been preserved
      only by tradition, it cannot be supposed, that they have come
      down in their present form from the original time of their
      composition; which was perhaps nearly cotemporary to the events
      they celebrate. In most of them frequent Turcisms show, that the
      singer is familiar with the conquerors and their language.
      According to Vuk, very few are in their present form older than
      the fifteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more modern heroic ballads&mdash;for the productiveness of
      this remarkable people is still alive&mdash;are essentially of
      the same character. They may be divided into two parts. One
      division, probably composed during the last two centuries and
      down even to the present time, is devoted to a variety of
      subjects, public and private. Duels, love stories, satisfaction
      of blood-revenge, domestic quarrels and reconciliation, are
      alternately related. The variety of invention in these tales is
      astonishing; the skill of the combinations and the final
      development surpasses all that hitherto has been known of popular
      poetry. One of the most remarkable of them is a narrative of 1227
      lines; which relates to the marriage of a young man, Maxim
      Tzernovitch, son of<span class="newpage"><a name="page_380" id=
      "page_380">[pg.380]</a></span> Ivan Tzernovitch, a wealthy and
      powerful Servian. The father goes to Venice to ask in marriage
      for his son the daughter of the Doge. He describes him as the
      handsomest of young men; but, when he comes home, he finds him
      metamorphosed by the smallpox into the ugliest. By the advice of
      his wife, he substitutes another handsome young man to fetch home
      the bride with the procession of bridal guests; promising him the
      principal share in the bridal gifts; for he commits the fraud
      less from covetous views than from pride, being afraid of being
      put to shame as unable to keep his word before the haughty
      Venetians. They succeed in bringing away the bride; but the cheat
      is discovered on the road; a contest arises, and the whole affair
      ends in a horrible slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vuk Stephanovitch has heard this tale repeatedly, and with
      several variations; but the principal features, for instance a
      rich and elaborate description of the bridal gifts, were always
      recited exactly in the same words. It was chanted in the most
      perfect manner by an old singer, named Milya, whom prince Milosh
      often had to sing it before him; and from whose lips Vuk at last
      took it down.
    </p>

      Another section of more modern ballads narrates events from the
      latest war between the Servians and Turks, between 1801 and 1815.
      Who of our readers has not heard of Kara George? His companions,
      Yanko Katitch, Stoyan Tchupitch, Milosh of Potzerye, are in
      Servia as well known and admired as Kara George himself. They and
      their comrades are the heroes of these ballads. The gallant
      Tchupitch rewarded the blind poet Philip, who chanted to him a
      long and beautiful poem of his own composition, with a white
      horse. The subject of his narrative was the battle of Salash;
      where Tchupitch himself had been the Servian commander.<a name=
      "FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href=

    </p>
    <p>
      The same ballad singer Philip is the author of most of the modern
      heroic poems. Of others the authors are not known. Little stress
      is laid on the art of poetry; exercised with such extraordinary
      power. These productions of our day are by no means inferior to
      the ancient. There is indeed no essential difference, either in
      their diction or in their conception; and it is easy to be
      perceived, that old and young have been nursed from their infancy
      on tales of "the days of yore." Some passages of Philip's ballads
      are really Homeric.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id=
      "FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_375_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> Fortunately, the period
      is past when our admiration for hyperborean poetry needed to be
      justified by its similarity with the classics. We have learned
      that real poetry is not spell-bound to names, nor to any nation
      or age; and the <i>beautiful</i> has obtained in our time an
      independent existence, no longer subject to certain forms and
      conditions, but resting on itself and its divine gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulties Vuk Stephanovitch met with in collecting these
      wonderful ballads, were not small. He was often hardly able to
      prevail on the young men and girls to recite, still less to sing
      them before him; partly from a natural shyness to exhibit
      themselves before a stranger; partly because his search after
      effusions which had so little value in their eyes, and his
      attempt to fix them by writing, seemed to them an idle and
      useless occupation. The only reason which they could conceive for
      it was, that the learned idler meant to ridicule them; and his
      request was frequently answered by the words: "We are no blind
      men to sing or recite songs to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the heroic poems, he tells us, that they are not only chanted,
      but often recited, as <i>we</i> are accustomed to <i>read</i>;
      and that in this latter way, old people teach them by preference
      to the<span class="newpage"><a name="page_382" id=
      "page_382">[pg.382]</a></span> children. His own father,
      grandfather, and uncle, were wont to recite and to sing them; and
      the two latter even composed not a few. Among those from whose
      lips he took down the present collection, were lads, peasants,
      merchants, as also hayduks, i.e. highwaymen, in Servia a mode of
      life less disreputable than with us, and somewhat approaching to
      heroism. Further, at least seven or eight were blind men; all of
      them professional bards, and almost the only persons willing to
      satisfy him. The <i>shenske pjesme</i>, or female poems, he had
      to catch by chance; and short as they are, it was easy to keep
      them in memory after having heard them once or twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these latter poems are mostly sung without any instrumental
      accompaniment in the spinning-rooms, in the pastures, or at the
      village dances; on the other hand the tavern, the public squares,
      the festive halls of the chiefs, are the places where the Guslè
      is heard which accompanies the heroic ballads. The bard chants
      two lines; then he pauses and gives a few plaintive strokes on
      his primitive instrument; then he chants again, and so on. He
      needs these short pauses for recollection, as well as for
      invention. Although these ballads are chiefly sung by blind men,
      yet no hero thinks it beneath him to chant them to the Guslè.
      Pirch, a Prussian officer, who travelled in Servia some twenty
      years ago, tells us, that the Knjas, his host, took the
      instrument from the hands of the lad, for whom he had sent to
      sing before his guest, because he did not satisfy him, and played
      and chanted himself with a superior skill. Clergymen themselves
      are not ashamed to do it. Nay, even Muhammedan-Bosnians, more
      Turks than Servians, have preserved this partiality for their
      national heroics. The great among them would not, indeed,
      themselves sing them; but they cause them to be chanted before
      them; and it happened, that a Christian prisoner in Semendria
      obtained his liberty by their intercession with the Kadi, which
      he owed merely to their fondness for his ballads. A considerable
      number of fine songs<span class="newpage"><a name="page_383" id=
      "page_383">[pg.383]</a></span> are marked in Vuk's collection as
      having been first heard from Muhammedan singers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the same ballads are not heard every where, yet the
      poetical feeling and productiveness seem to be pretty equally
      distributed over all the region inhabited by the Servian race.
      The heroic ballads originate mostly in the southern mountains of
      Servia, in Bosnia, Montenegro, and its Dalmatian neighbourhood.
      Towards the North-East the productiveness diminishes; the songs
      are still <i>known</i> in the Austrian provinces, but the
      recitation of them, and the Guslè itself, are left to blind men
      and beggars. Pirch heard, nevertheless, the ballads of Marko
      Kralyevitch in the vicinity of Neusatz, in Hungary. On the other
      hand, the amatory Servian ballads, and all those comprised under
      the name of female songs,&mdash;although by no means exclusively
      sung by women,&mdash;originate chiefly in those regions, where
      perhaps a glimpse of occidental civilization has somewhat refined
      the general feeling. The <i>villages</i> of Syrmia, the Banat,
      and the Batchva, are the home of most of them; in the Bosnian
      towns also they are heard; while in the <i>cities</i> of the
      Austrian provinces they have been superseded by modern airs of
      less value, perhaps, and certainly of less nationality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains to remark, that while in all the other Slavic popular
      poetry, the <i>musical</i> element is prominent, it is in the
      Servian completely crowded into the background. Even the little
      lyric pieces, or female ballads, are not only in a high degree
      monotonous, but even without the peculiar sweetness of most
      popular airs. They also are chanted rather than sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bulgarian language is said to be particularly rich in popular
      ballads; and it would hardly be credible, that the numerous
      nations with which they mixed for centuries, should not have
      influenced their poetry as well as their language. Nevertheless,
      those ballads we have met with are not distinguished in any way
      from the Servian; especially from those Servian ones<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_384" id="page_384">[pg.384]</a></span>
      sung in the provinces where intercourse with a Turkish population
      is more frequent. One specimen will be sufficient.

      The SLOVENZI or VINDES, that is, the Slavic inhabitants of
      Camiola and Carinthia, have of course their own ballads, which
      have been recently collected. That the influence of the German
      population, with whom they live intermingled, has been very
      great, even in these songs, cannot be matter of surprise. It is,
      however, chiefly discernible in the melodies they sing; which are
      said to be the same familiar to the German mountaineers of Styria
      and Tyrol. Several narrative ballads of some length
      are<span class="newpage"><a name="page_385" id=
      "page_385">[pg.385]</a></span> still extant among them, similar
      to the Servian, but rhymed. These have been communicated to the
      German public in a translation by their poet Anastasius Grun.
      They are all too long to be given here as specimens; we therefore
      confine ourselves to the following pretty little song:

      The field of popular poetry, which the Slavic nations of the
      WESTERN STEM present to us, promises a gleaning of a
      comparatively inferior value.

    <p>
      It appears from the Königshof manuscript, that five centuries ago
      the BOHEMIANS <i>had</i> a treasure of popular poetry. This
      document exhibits also the extraordinary fact, that almost the
      same ballads were sung in Bohemia in the thirteenth century,
      which are now heard from the lips of Russian and Servian peasant
      girls. The reader may compare the following songs, all of them
      faithfully translated.

      The Bohemians preserved their nationality, and very probably with
      it their ancient popular songs, down to the seventeenth century.
      During the thirty years' war, of which Bohemia was in part almost
      uninterruptedly the seat, a complete revolution in manners,
      institutions, and localities, took place. Whole villages
      emigrated, or were driven into the wide world, wandering about in
      scattered groups as fugitives and mendicants. Most of the ancient
      songs may have died at that time. The German influence increased
      rapidly during the remainder of the seventeenth century, mostly
      by force and reluctantly; still more during the<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_389" id="page_389">[pg.389]</a></span>
      eighteenth century by habit, intermarriages, education, etc. The
      Bohemians, the most musical nation in the world, are still a
      singing people; but many of their ditties are evidently borrowed
      from the German; in others, invented by themselves, they exhibit
      a spirit entirely different from that of their ancestors. These
      modern songs are mostly rhymed. The following specimen of songs
      still current among the peasantry of Bohemia, will show well the
      harmless, playful, roguish spirit that pervades them.

      In the following fine ballad the German influence is manifest. It
      is extant in two different texts. We give it in Bowring's
      version, which has less of amplification and embellishment than
      is usual in English translations.

      THE DEAD LOVE.
    </p>I sought the dark wood where the oat grass was growing;
    <br />
    The maidens were there and that oat grass were mowing.<span class=
    "newpage"><a name="page_391" id="page_391">[pg.391]</a></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    And I called to those maidens: "Now say if there be
    <br />
    The maiden I love 'midst the maidens I see?"
    <br />
    <br />
    And they sighed as they answered: "Ah no! alas no!
    <br />
    She was laid in the bed of the tomb long ago." <a name=
    "FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href=

    <br />
    <br />
    "Then show me the way where my footsteps must tread,
    <br />
    To reach that dark chamber, where slumber the dead."
    <br />
    <br />
    "The path is before thee, her grave will be known,
    <br />
    By the rosemary wreaths her companions have thrown."
    <br />
    <br />
    "And where is the church in church-yard, whose heaps
    <br />
    Will point out the bed where the blessed one sleeps?"
    <br />
    <br />
    So twice to the church-yard in sadness I drew,
    <br />
    But I saw no fresh heap and no grave that was new.
    <br />
    <br />
    I turned, and with heart-chilling terror I froze,
    <br />
    And a newly made grave at my feet slowly rose.
    <br />
    <br />
    And I heard a low voice, but it audibly said,
    <br />
    "Disturb not, disturb not the sleep of the dead!
    <br />
    <br />
    "Who treads on my bosom? what footsteps have swept
    <br />
    The dew from the bed where the weary one slept?"
    <br />
    <br />
    "My maiden, my maiden, so speak not to me,
    <br />
    My presents were once not unwelcome to thee!"
    <br />
    <br />
    "Thy presents were welcome, but none could I save,
    <br />
    Not one could I bring to the stores of the grave.
    <br />
    <br />
    "Go thou to my mother, and bid her restore
    <br />
    To thy hands every gift which I valued before.
    <br />
    <br />
    "Then fling the gold ring in the depth of the sea,
    <br />
    And eternity's peace shall be given to me.<span class=
    "newpage"><a name="page_392" id="page_392">[pg.392]</a></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    "And sink the white kerchief deep, deep in the wave,
    <br />
    That my head may repose undisturbed in the grave!"
    <br />

      The Slovaks, the Slavic inhabitants of the north-western
      districts of Hungary, are considered, as we have seen above, as
      the direct descendants of the first Slavic settlers in Europe.
      Although for nearly a thousand years past they have formed a
      component part of the Hungarian nation, they have nevertheless
      preserved their language and many of their ancient customs. Their
      literature, we know, is not to be separated from that of the
      Bohemians. Their popular effusions are original; although,
      likewise, between them and the popular poetry of their Bohemian
      brethren, a close affinity cannot be denied. The Slovaks are said
      to be still exceedingly rich in pretty and artless songs, both
      pensive and cheerful; but the original Slavic type is now very
      much effaced from them. The surrounding nations, and above all
      the Germans, have exercised a decided and lasting influence upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following ballads are still heard among the Slovaks. The
      first of them is also extant in an imperfect German shape. As the
      coarse dialect, in which the German ballad may be heard, is that
      of the "Kuhländchen," a small district of Silesia, where the
      Slavic neighbourhood has not been without influence, we have no
      doubt that the more complete Slavic ballad is the original.
    </p>THE MOTHER'S CURSE.
    <br />
    <br />
    The maiden went for water,
    <br />
    To the well o'er the meadow away;
    <br />
    She there could draw no water,
    <br />
    So thick the frost it lay.
    <br />
    <br />
    The mother she grew angry;
    <br />
    She had it long to bemoan;<span class="newpage"><a name="page_393"

    <br />
    "O daughter mine, O daughter,

    <br />
    <br />
    The maiden's water-pitcher
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew marble instantly;</span>
    <br />
    And she herself, the maiden,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Became a maple tree.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    There came one day two lads,

    were;</span>
    <br />
    "We've travelled far, my brother,

    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    They cut into the maple,&mdash;

    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">There splashed the blood so
    red;</span>
    <br />
    The lads fell on the ground,
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">So sore were they afraid.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    Then spake from within the maiden:
    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Wherefore afraid are you?</span>
    <br />
    Cut out of me one fiddle,

    SUN AND MOON.

      The reader will perceive that these Slovakian songs are rhymed.
      There are however also rhymeless verses extant among them; the
      measure of which seems to indicate a greater antiquity, and
      brings them nearer to the nations of the Eastern stock.<a name=

      Of all the Slavic nations, the POLES, as we have already
      remarked, had most neglected their popular poetry. There were
      indeed several collections of popular ballads published, partly
      by Polish editors, with the title of popular poetry in Poland.
      But they all, without exception, so far as we know, refer to the
      Ruthenian peasantry in Poland, who use a language different from
      the Polish, and essentially the same as the Malo-Russian. These
      tribes, inhabitants of Poland for centuries, may indeed
      be<span class="newpage"><a name="page_395" id=
      "page_395">[pg.395]</a></span> called <i>Poles</i> with perfect
      propriety. Yet this name is in a more limited sense applied to
      the Lekhian race exclusively; and it is in respect to them that
      we remarked above, that their songs had been collected for the
      first time only a few years ago.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id=
      "FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_383_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      That they also had national ballads of their own could hardly be
      a matter of doubt; and the neglect may easily be explained, in a
      nation among whom all that has any reference to mere boors and
      serfs has always been regarded with the utmost contempt. Their
      beautiful national dances, however, known all over the world, the
      graceful Polonaise, the bold Masur, the ingenious Cracovienne,
      are just as much the property of the peasantry, as of the
      nobility. Their dances were formerly always accompanied by
      singing; just as it was customary in olden times every where, and
      as it is still the usage among the Russian and Servian peasantry,
      to dance to the music of song instead of instruments. But these
      songs are always extemporized; and in Poland probably were never
      written down. The early refinement of the language secured to the
      upper classes a greater or lesser share in their national
      literature, which gave them apparently better things; although we
      have seen above, that, far from developing itself from its own
      resources, their literature was alternately ingrafted on a Latin,
      Italian, or French stock. Among the country gentry, and even at
      the convivial parties of the nobility, the custom of
      extemporizing songs, probably full of national reminiscences,
      continued even down to the beginning of our own century. Very
      little stress was naturally laid upon them; since the interest
      for all that is national, historical, or in any way connected
      with the people, belongs only to the most recent times. In our
      day, the local scenes of Lithuania have excited some interest,
      and the Ukraine has become the favourite theatre of Polish
      poets.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_396" id=

    </p>

      The Polish nation has an ancient hymn, which may be said to
      belong in some measure to popular poetry. It is known under the
      name of <i>Boga Rodzica</i>, or God's Mother; and is said to have
      been composed by St. Adalbert, who lived at the end of the tenth
      century. According to Niemcewicz, the Polish poet, it was still
      chanted in the year 1812 in the churches of Kola and Gnesen, the
      places where St. Adalbert lived and died. It is a prayer to the
      Virgin, ending with a sixfold Amen; and was formerly sung by the
      soldiers when advancing to battle. For that reason probably we
      find it frequently called a war song.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular ballads, published by Woicicki and Zegota Pauli, are
      not distinguished in any way from those still extant among the
      Slovakians, Bohemians, and Lusatian Sorabians. It can only be
      matter of surprise, that they have imbibed no more of the wild
      and romantic character of the ballads sung by the Ruthenians,
      with whom they live intermingled in several regions. They are
      ruder in form; and alternately rhymed, or distinguished from
      prose only by a certain irregular but prosodic measure, sometimes
      trochaic, but mostly dactylic. With the classical beauty of the
      Servian songs they can bear no comparison; in which latter the
      perfect absence of <i>vulgarity</i> may perhaps be partly
      accounted for, by their having been produced among a people where
      no privileged classes exist. Only in their wedding songs, and
      other similar ones, is there a striking affinity; it is in
      general in these relics of ancient times, that the popular poetry
      of the nations of the Eastern and of the Western Stems meet in
      one distinct and fundamental accord.

      Many of the more ancient ballads extant among the Poles we find
      also in one or other of the Western Slavic languages. For
      example, the following; which exists in the Vendish language in a
      shape more diffuse and twice as long; and also in Slovakian,
      still more sketchlike. That the Polish ballad is derived from a
      time, when the horrid invasions of the Tartars<span class=
      "newpage"><a name="page_397" id="page_397">[pg.397]</a></span>
      were at least still distinctly remembered, we may safely
      conclude. In the Slovakian ballad the invaders are called Turks;
      in the Vendish ballad, probably the latest of the three, they
      have lost all individual nationality, and have become merely
      "enemies," or "robbers."

    All the people fled,
    <br />
    Only a lad they met.
    <br />
    <br />
    "Where's thy lord, my lad?
    <br />
    Where and in what tower
    <br />
    Is thy lady's bower?"
    <br />
    <br />
    "I must not betray him,
    <br />
    Lest my lord should slay me."
    <br />
    <br />
    "Not his anger fear,
    <br />
    Thou shalt stay not here,
    <br />
    Thou shalt go with us."

    "My lord's and lady's bower
    <br />
    Is in the highest tower."

    Once the Tartars shot,
    <br />
    And they hit them not.

    Away, away it goes,
    <br />
    Over the green meadows,
    <br />
    Black, black the walls arose!
    <br />
    <br />
    "O lady, O turn back,
    <br />
    To thy walls so sad and black.
    <br />
    <br />
    "O walls, ye dreary walls!
    <br />
    So sad and black are you,
    <br />
    Because your lord they slew!
    <br />
    <br />
    "Because your lord is slain,
    <br />
    Your lady is dragged away
    <br />
    Into captivity!
    <br />
    A slave for life to be,
    <br />
    Far, far in Tartary!"

      Among the ballads of almost all nations we find some that
      illustrate the mournful and destitute state of <i>motherless
      orphans</i>. There seems to be hardly any feeling, which comes
      more directly home to the affectionate compassion of the human
      heart, than the pitiable and touching condition of helpless
      little beings left to the tender mercies of a <i>stepmother</i>;
      who, with her traditional severity, may be called a kind of
      standing bugbear of the popular imagination. The Danes have a
      beautiful ballad, in which the ghost of a mother is roused by the
      wailings and sufferings of her deserted offspring, to break with
      supernatural power the gravestone, and to re-enter, in the
      stillness of the night, the neglected nursery, in order to cheer,
      to nurse, to comb and wash the dear seven little ones, whom God
      once intrusted to her care. It is one of the most affecting
      pieces of popular poetry we ever have met with. The Slavic
      nations have nothing that can be<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_399" id="page_399">[pg.399]</a></span> compared with it in
      <i>beauty</i>; but most of them have several ballads on the same
      subject; and in a general collection, the "Orphan Ballads" would
      fill a whole chapter.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id=

      we give here as another specimen of Polish popular poetry,
      exceedingly rude as it is in its form, and even defective in
      rhyme and metre, cannot but please and touch us by its very
      simplicity.

    </p>Poor little orphan is wandering about,
    <br />
    Seeking its mother and weeping aloud.
    <br />
    <br />
    Jesus Christ met it, mildly to it spake:
    <br />
    "Where art thou roaming, poor little babe?
    <br />
    <br />
    "Go not, go not, babe, too far thou wilt roam,
    <br />
    And goest e'er so far, not to thy mother come.
    <br />
    <br />
    "Now turn and go, dear babe, to the green cemetery,
    <br />
    From out her deep grave thy mother will speak to thee."
    <br />
    <br />
    "Wo! at my grave who's knocking so wild?"
    <br />
    "Mother! dear mother! it's I, thy poor child!

    <br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Take me to thee, take me,</span>

    <br />
    "Go home, my babe, and thy strange mother tell,

    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    "Go thee home, my babe, the Lord thy tears will dry!"
    <br />
    And the babe went home, laid her down to cry.
    <br />
    <br />
    Laid her down to cry, one day only cried;
    <br />
    Groaned the second day, and the third day died.
    <br />
    <br />
    From his heaven our Lord did two angels send,
    <br />
    With the poor babe they did to heaven ascend.
    <br />
    <br />
    From the hell our Lord did two devils send;
    <br />
    They took the bad stepmother and down to hell they went.

      Of all the surviving Slavic tribes, we have seen that the
      nationality of the VENDES of Lusatia is most endangered. If
      formerly, as a race, they suffered from persecution and
      oppression, they have now for several centuries shared all the
      advantages of an enlightened education and wise institutions with
      their German countrymen; and it would therefore be erroneous to
      consider them still in the light of an oppressed or subjugated
      nation. Although their language cannot be said to be
      <i>favoured</i> by the government, they have their schools, their
      worship, their courts of justice, and, above all, their ballads,
      without let or hinderance; and if nevertheless the statistics of
      each year, especially in the plains of Lower Lusatia, show a
      diminution of the Slavic speaking population, we must attribute
      it rather to the natural and irresistible effect of time and
      circumstances, than to any despotic or arbitrary measures of the
      government. The Vendish villages<span class="newpage"><a name=
      "page_401" id="page_401">[pg.401]</a></span> are flourishing; the
      costumes of the peasants are heavy and rich; and to their general
      welfare the <i>cheerful</i> merry character of their ballads
      seems to bear testimony. Their melodies resemble the Bohemian, as
      much as their ballads do those of their neighbours; but German
      melodies also are frequently heard among them, and many
      translations of German popular ballads have become perfectly
      naturalized. That the language of Upper Lusatia approaches very
      near to the Bohemian, we have stated above. It is, however, much
      more interspersed with German words; although not to such a
      degree as the Lower Lusatian dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the Slavic popular ballads, we find in those of the
      Lusatians least of that chaste feeling, which is in general
      characteristic of Slavic love songs. The pleasures of illicit
      intercourse and their consequences, which make also a favourite
      theme of the common English and German ballads, are often grossly
      described; and we may conclude that the talent of extemporizing,
      or in general making pretty verses, has forsaken the female
      villagers in this German neighbourhood, and passed over to the
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      We give here two characteristic ballads of the Upper Lusatian
      language.

    </p>Far more unhappy in the world am I,
    <br />
    Than on the meadow the bird that doth fly.
    <br />
    <br />
    Little bird merrily flits to and fro,
    <br />
    Sings its sweet carol upon the green bough.<span class=

    <br />
    <br />
    I, alas, wander wherever I will,
    <br />
    Every where I am desolate still!
    <br />
    <br />
    No one befriends me, wherever I go.
    <br />
    But my own heart full of sorrow and woe!
    <br />
    <br />
    Cease thy grief, oh my heart, full of grief,
    <br />
    Soon will a time come that giveth thee relief.
    <br />
    <br />
    Never misfortune has struck mo so hard,
    <br />
    But I ere long again better have fared.

    God of all else in the world has enough;
    <br />
    Why not then widows and orphans enough?<a name="FNanchor_388_388"

      Merry ballads like these are usually sung at wedding feasts,
      where several of the old Slavic ceremonies are still preserved;
      among other things the bringing home of the bride in solemn
      procession. Many old verses, mostly fragments of half forgotten
      ballads, familiar to their ancestors, are in like manner
      occasionally recited. But the poetical atmosphere, which still
      weaves around the Russian or Servian maiden a mystical veil,
      through which she gazes, as in a dream full of golden illusions
      and images, into that condition of new existence feared and
      desired by her at once&mdash;that atmosphere is destroyed by the
      lights of the surrounding civilization, which show the sober
      reality of things in full glare. The flowers are withered that
      were wound around the chains; but the chains themselves have
      become lighter. The ancient wedding songs, full of pagan
      allusions, have been supplanted by glees mostly composed by their
      half German pastors; the only educated men who still speak their
      language. Indeed, not a few of their most popular ballads are
      written by their curates. How soon these will be superseded by
      German songs, no one can say; but it requires no great stretch of
      prophetic power to predict, that the time is near at
      hand.<span class="newpage"><a name="page_405" id=

        1842, supposes he has found the first Slavi already three
        centuries B.C. in the Veneti or Wendi on the Baltic. But as
        every connecting link between them and the <i>historical</i>
        Slavi is wanting, the fact seems of little importance.

        Schaffarik in his work on <i>Slavic Antiquities</i> attempts to

        Alanes and Osetenzes in the Caucasus.

        The name of the <i>Slavi</i> has generally been derived from
        <i>slava</i>, glory, and their national feelings have of course
        been gratified by this derivation. But the more immediate
        origin of the appellation, is to be sought in the word
        <i>slovo</i> word, speech. The change of <i>o</i> into <i>a</i>
        occurs frequently in the Slavic languages, (thus <i>slava</i>
        comes from <i>slovo</i>) but is in this case probably to be
        ascribed to foreigners, viz. Byzantines, Romans, and Germans.
        In the language of the latter, the <i>o</i> in names and words
        of Slavic origin in many instances becomes <i>a</i>. The
        radical syllable <i>slov</i> is still to be found in the
        appellations which the majority of the Slavic nations apply to
        themselves or kindred nations, e.g. Slovenzi, Slovaci, Slovane,
        Sloveni, etc. The Russians and Servians did not exchange the
        <i>o</i> for <i>a</i> before the seventh century. See
        Schaffarik's <i>Geschichte</i>, p. 5. n. 6. The same writer
        observes, p. 287. n. 8, "It is remarkable that, while all the
        other Slavic nations relinquished their original
        <i>national</i> names, and adopted <i>specific</i> names, as
        Russians, Poles, Silesians, Czekhes, Moravians, Sorabians,
        Servians, Morlachians, Czernogortzi, Bulgarians; nay, when most
        of them imitating foreigners altered the general name
        <i>Slovene</i> into <i>Slavene</i>, only those two Slavic
        branches, which touch each other on the banks of the Danube,
        the <i>Slovaks</i> and the <i>Slovenzi</i>, have retained in
        its purity their original national name."&mdash;According to
        Schaffarik's later opinion, as expressed in his
        <i>Antiquities</i>, the appellation Slavi, Slaveni, or
        Slovenians, is derived from one of their seats, that is, the
        country on the Upper Niemen, where the <i>Stloveni</i> or
        <i>Sueveni</i> of Ptolemy lived. It is said to be called by the
        Finns <i>Sallo</i> (like every woodland); by the Lithuanians,
        <i>Sallawa, Slawa</i>; in old Prussian, <i>Salava</i>; by the
        neighbouring Germans, <i>Schalauen</i>; in Latin,
        <i>Scalavia</i>. But it seems a more natural conclusion, that
        <i>vice versa</i> the name of the district was rather derived
        from Slavic settlers living in the midst of a German, Russian,
        and Finnish population&mdash;For the derivation from
        <i>slovo</i>, word, speech, the circumstance seems to speak,
        that in most Slavic languages the appellation for a German (and
        formerly for all foreigners) is <i>Njemetz</i>, i.e. one dumb,
        an impotent, nameless, speechless person. What more natural, in
        a primitive stage of culture, than to consider only those as
        speaking, who are <i>understood</i>; and those who seem to
        utter unmeaning sounds, as dumb, impotent beings?

        The earliest Slavic historian is the Russian monk Nestor, born
        in the year 1056. See below, in the History of the <i>Old
        Slavic</i> and of the <i>Russian</i> languages. The reader will
        there see, that even the authority and age of this writer has
        been in our days attacked by the hypercritical spirit of the
        modern Russian Historical school.

        The affinity of the Slavic and Greek languages it has recently
        been attempted to prove in several works. Dankovsky in his
        work, <i>Die Griechen als Sprachverwandte der Slaven</i>,
        Presburg 1828, contends that a knowledge of the Slavic language
        is of the highest importance for the Greek scholar, as the only
        means by which he may be enabled to clear up obscure passages
        and to ascertain the signification of doubtful words. Among the
        historical proofs, he furnishes a vocabulary containing 306
        Slavic and Greek words of striking analogy. "Of three sisters,"
        he observes, "<i>one</i> kept faithful to her mother
        tongue&mdash;the Slavic language; the <i>second</i> gave to
        that common heritage the highest cultivation&mdash;the Greek
        language; and the <i>third</i> mixed the mother tongue with a
        foreign idiom&mdash;the Latin language." A work of the same
        tendency has been published in the Greek language, by the Greek
        priest Constantine, Vienna 1828. It contains a vocabulary of
        800 pages of <i>Russian</i> and Greek words, corresponding in
        sound and meaning.&mdash;That these views are not new, is
        generally known; although they hardly ever have been carried so
        far, except perhaps by the author of the History of Russia,
        Levesque, who considers the Latins as a Slavic colony; or by
        Solarich, who derived all modern languages from the Slavic.
        Gelenius in his <i>Lexicon Symphonum</i>, 1557, made the first
        etymological attempt in respect to the Slavic languages. In
        modern times, great attention has been paid to Slavic etymology
        by Dobrovsky, Linde, Adelung, Bantkje, Fritsch, and others. An
        <i>Etymologicon Universale</i> was published in 1811, at
        Cambridge in England, by W. Whiter.&mdash;Galiffec, in his
        <i>Italy and its Inhabitants</i>, 1816 and 1817, started the
        opinion, that the <i>Russian</i> was the original language, and
        that the Old Slavonic and all the rest were only dialects.

        The t' signifies the <i>Yehr</i>, or <i>soft sign</i> of the
        Russians in addition to the <i>t</i>. This letter not existing
        in the English language, we have endeavoured to supply it in
        the best possible way by the aspirate of the Greek language,
        which when it follows [Greek: t], is not very unlike it; e.g.
        [Greek: <i>nukht êmeron</i>], written [Greek:

        That the Glagolitic alphabet, as has been affirmed, was the one

        afterwards known as the Cyrillic, is an untenable position;

        According to Vostokof, the dialects of all the Slavic nations
        deviated not only much less from each other at the time of
        Cyril's translation than they now do; but were even in the
        middle of the eleventh century still so similar, that the
        different nations were able to understand each other, about as
        well as the present inhabitants of the different provinces of
        Russia understand each other. The difference of the Slavic
        dialects was then almost exclusively limited to the lexical
        part of the language; the grammatical varieties, which exist
        among them at the present day, had not then arisen. The
        principal features which distinguish the Russian of the present
        day from the Old Slavic, are exhibited in an article <i>on
        Russian Literature</i> in the Foreign Quarterly Review, Vol. I.

        The Mongols and Tartars have been frequently confounded by
        historical writers; they are however two races perfectly
        distinct from each other, the first a North-Eastern, the second
        a South-Western Asiatic nation. The Mongols, however, between
        the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, conquerors of the
        Tartars as well as of half Asia, and of Europe as far as
        Silesia, and comparatively not numerous, amalgamated gradually
        with the subjugated Tartars among whom they settled. The
        present Mongols are partly under the sovereignty of China in
        the ancient Mongolia, the country whence Jenghis Khan came;
        partly Russian subjects, scattered through the government of
        Irkutzk, and mixed with Kalmucks and other Asiatic tribes.

        Constantinople and other Greek dignitaries, obtained 500 Greek
        MSS. of the whole or portions of the N. Test. Some of them

        known under the general appellation of <i>Illyrians</i>. With
        the exception of the Bulgarians, who never have been
        comprehended under it, this name has alternately been applied
        to the Southern Slavic nations; sometimes only to the
        Dalmatians and Slavonians; sometimes to them together with the
        Croatians and Vindes; by others again to the Turkish Servians
        and Bosnians, etc. The old Illyrians, i.e. the inhabitants of
        the Roman province Illyricum, were not Slavi, but a people
        related to the old Thracians, the forefathers of the present
        Albanians; see Schaffarik <i>Gesch</i>. p. 33, n. 2.
        <i>Illyricum Magnum</i> comprised in the fourth century nearly
        all the Roman provinces of eastern Europe. Napoleon affected to
        renew the names and titles of the ancient Roman empire, and
        called the territory ceded to him by Austria in 1809, viz.
        Carniola and all the country between the Adriatic, the Save,
        and the Turkish empire, his Illyrian provinces, and their
        inhabitants Illyrians. In the year 1815 a new kingdom of
        Illyria was founded as an Austrian province, comprehending
        Carniola, Carinthia, and Trieste with its territory. It was
        partly on account of this indefiniteness, that the name of
        <i>Illyrians</i> had been entirely relinquished by modern
        <br />
        <span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>philologists; until it was
        quite recently again token up by some Croatian and</i></span>
        <br />
        Dalmatian writers. In its stead the name of <i>Servians</i>, or
        more properly <i>Serbians, Serbs,</i> has been adopted as a
        general appellation by the best authorities. See below in § 1,
        on the Literature of the Servians of the Greek Church. The word
        <i>Srb, Serb, Sorab</i>, has been alternately derived from
        <i>Srp</i>, scythe; from <i>Siberi, Sever,</i> north; from
        <i>Sarmat</i>; from <i>Serbulja</i>, a kind of shoe or sock;
        from <i>servus</i>, servant, etc. The true derivation has not
        yet been settled. See Dobrovsky's History of the Bohemian
        Language, 1818; and also his <i>Inst. Ling. Slav</i>. 1822.

        The Servians, however, under the government of their own
        energetic countryman, Prince Milosh, for some years enjoyed a
        certain degree of freedom, which no doubt has had good results
        for the mental life of the nation. A good view of their
        country, constitution, and literature, is given in a modern
        German work: <i>Reise nach Serbien im Spätherbst</i> 1829, by
        Otto von Pirch, Berlin 1830. See also <i>Servia und Belgrade

        There is however still another Cyrillic printing office
        attached to an Armenian convent in Vienna. Since the printing
        of Vuk's second edition of the Servian popular songs at
        Leipsic, several other Servian books have also been printed
        there. The Vladika of Montenegro has also established a
        printing office at his residence of Tzetinja. Vuk's "Proverbs"
        have been printed there.

        The writings of this very productive philologist and historian
        are however more remarkable for boldness and singularity of
        assertion, than for depth. In his <i>Rimljani
        slavenstvovavshii</i>, Buda 1818, he undertakes to derive the
        entire Latin language from the Slavic. In an earlier work,
        written 1809, he contends that the German language was a
        corruption of the Slavic dialects spoken on the Elbe.

        See more on Servian popular poetry in Part IV. The title of
        Vuk's collection, a part of which appeared 1814-15 at Vienna,
        in two small volumes, is <i>Narodm Srpske pjesme</i>, Lpzg
        1823-24, three volumes. A fourth volume was published at Vienna
        1833, with a very instructive preface. Some of these remarkable
        songs have been made known to the English public in Bowring's
        Servian Popular Poetry, London 1827. This little collection
        contains also an able and spirited introduction, which serves
        to give a clear view not only of the state of the Servians in
        particular, but also of the relation of the Slavic nations to
        each other in general; with the exception of some mistakes in
        respect to classification.&mdash;In Germany a general interest
        for Servian national poetry was excited by Goethe; see his
        <i>Kunst und Alterthum</i>, Vol. V. Nos. I and II. German
        translations are: <i>Volkslieder der Serben</i>, by Talvj, 2
        vols. Halle 1825-26; from which work Bowring seems chiefly to
        have translated. <i>Die Wila</i>, by Gerhardt, 2 vols. Lpzg.
        1828. These two works contain nearly all the songs published by
        Vuk, in his first three volumes; but only half of those he has
        collected. <i>Serbische Volkslieder</i>, by v. Götze, St. Pet.
        and Lpzg. 1827. <i>Serbische Hochzeitlieder</i>, by Eugen
        Wesely, 1826. A French translation of these songs does not yet
        exist, although they have excited a deep interest among the
        literati of France. The work <i>la Guzla</i>, published at
        Paris in 1827 and purporting to contain translations of
        Dalmatian national songs, is not genuine; it was written by the
        French poet Mérimée, with much talent indeed, but without any
        knowledge of the Servian language.

        That is: Wolf, son of Stephan, belonging to the family of the
        Karadshians, inhabitants of a certain district or village. The
        Servians in Servia proper and Bosnia have not yet any family
        names. Those who emigrated in early years to other countries
        mostly adopted their fathers' names with the suffix of
        <i>vitch</i> as a family name; for instance Markovitch,
        Gregorovitch, i.q. Markson, Gregorson, etc. The Servian
        subjects of Turkey, who settle in other parts of the country,
        still mostly follow this rule. Vuk neglected this; and acquired
        therefore his literary fame under his Christian name of
        <i>Vuk</i>. But, as a father of a family and an Austrian
        citizen, he is called <i>Karadshitch</i> after his tribe; which
        for reasons we do not know he seems to have preferred to the
        name of Stephanovitch.

        We must correct here a mistake made by Dr. Henderson in his
        Biblical Researches, in respect to the Servian New Testament.
        He says, p. 263, "A version of the (Servian) New Testament was
        indeed executed some years ago, but its merits were not of such
        a description as to warrant the committee of the Russian Bible
        Society to carry it through the press; yet, as they were deeply
        convinced of the importance of the object, they were induced to
        engage a native Servian, of the name of Athanasius Stoïkovitch
        to make a new translation, the printing of which was completed
        in the year 1825, but owing to the cessation of the Society's
        operations, the distribution of the copies has hitherto been
        retarded." Dr. Henderson probably received his information at
        St. Petersburg, and felt himself of course entitled to depend
        on it, being very likely not acquainted with the great schism
        in modern Servian literature above mentioned. If we may confide
        in our own recollections, the translation, the merits of which
        the committee of the Russian Bible Society was so little
        disposed to acknowledge, was made by Vuk Stephanovitch, who
        knew better than any one else the wants of the Servian people,
        and who presented in the above mentioned Gospel of St. Luke a
        specimen to the learned world, which received the approbation
        of all those Slavic scholars entitled to judge of the subject.
        The committee of St. Petersburg, however, was probably composed
        of gentlemen of the opposite party; as indeed the Russian
        Servians are, in general, advocates of the mixed Slavo-Servian
        language, in which for about fifty years all books for the
        Servians were written, and which we have described above in
        Schaffarik's words; see p. 108. According to their ideas of the
        Servian language, the mere use of the common dialect of the
        people was sufficient to inspire doubts of the competency of
        the translator; although it was for the people, the unlearned,
        that the translation was professedly made. They engaged in
        consequence Professor Stoïkovitch, the author of several
        Russian and Slavo-Servian books (see above p. 112), and who had
        been for more than twenty years in the Russian service, to make
        a new translation. This person, who, to judge from our personal
        acquaintance with him, probably on this occasion read the
        Gospels for the first time in his life with any attention, took
        the rejected version for his basis; altered it, according to
        his views of the dignity of the Servian language, into the
        customary mixed Slavo-Servian Russian idiom; and received the
        reward from the Society. Whether this is the version afterwards
        printed at Leipsic and distributed in Servia by the English
        Bible Society, we are not informed. From private letters we
        know, that in the year 1827, that Society proposed to Vuk
        Stephanovitch to allow him £500, if after obtaining appropriate
        testimonies for the correctness of his version, he would print
        one thousand copies in Servia; and also authorized its
        correspondent in Constantinople, Mr. Leeves, to arrange the
        matter finally with Vuk. From M. Kopitar's remark however, that
        the translation for the Dalmatian Roman Catholics needed only
        to be transcribed with Cyrillic letters to come into use among
        the eastern Servians, we are entitled to conclude that the
        version now circulated, is not such as it ought to be; and a
        correct one, for that part of the nation, is still a
        desideratum. It would seem therefore that Vuk Stephanovitch
        cannot have accepted the offer in question. See Kopitar's
        Letter to the Editor of the Bibl. Repos. Vol. III. 1833, p.
        186.

        The country along the banks of the Upper Vistula. According to
        other writers, Belo-Chrobatia was the name of the country on
        both sides of the Carpathian chain. In some old chronicles the
        Czekhes are said to have come from <i>Croatia</i>, which
        induced more modern historians to suppose them to have
        emigrated from the present Croatia; others conclude that under
        this name Chrobatia was understood, as these names were
        frequently confounded.

        In writing Russian and Servian names, we have adapted our
        orthography to the English rules of pronunciation, so far
        namely as English letters are able to express sounds partly
        unknown to all but Slavic nations. The Poles and Bohemians
        however, who use the same characters as the English, have a
        right to expect that in writing their national names in the
        English language, their orthography should be preserved; just
        as it is in the case of the French, Spaniards, Italians, etc.
        No English writer would change French or Spanish names
        according to the English principles of pronunciation. We
        consequently alter letters only in cases where otherwise a
        foreigner, unacquainted with the Bohemian language, would find
        an absolute impossibility of pronouncing them
        correctly.&mdash;In both Polish and Bohemian <i>c</i> is in
        every case pronounced like <i>ts</i>; hence Janocky must be
        pronounced <i>Janotsky</i>; Rokycana, <i>Rokytsana</i>; Ctibor,
        <i>Tstibor</i>, etc. The Bohemian <i>cz</i> is equivalent to
        the English <i>ch</i> in <i>check</i>; so in their national
        name, <i>Czekhes</i>. The vowels <i>a, e, i, y</i>, are every
        where to be pronounced as in <i>father, they, machine,
        frisky</i>.

        but it is certain, that this institution was not organized
        before 1400; whilst the papal privilege granted for the

        This manuscript, which was sent in anonymously at the founding
        of the Museum in 1818, and which Dobrovsky was at first very
        much inclined to think a forgery, has since been published
        (1840) in the first volume of a collection of the most ancient
        documents of the Bohemian Language, edited by Palacki and

        In a chamber attached to the church of Königinhof or Kralodwor.
        It was published by Hanka in 1819, with a translation in modern
        Bohemian and in German, under the title <i>Rukopis
        Kralodworsky</i>, Manuscript of Königinhof. According to
        Dobrovsky, who formed his judgment from the writing, this
        remarkable manuscript belongs to the interval from about A.D.
        1290 to A.D. 1310. By the numbering of the chapters and books
        into which it is divided, it appears that the collection
        comprised three volumes; and that the manuscript thus
        accidentally rescued from oblivion, is only a small part of the
        third volume. Goethe honoured it with his peculiar attention
        and applause. Bowring has given some pleasing specimens of it,
        in his essay on Bohemian literature in the Foreign Quarterly
        Review, Vol. II. p. 151-153

        It was first published by Jeshin, A.D. 1620; later by
        Prochazka, Prague 1786. The author spurned no means to reach
        his patriotic object, viz. to inspire his nation with hatred
        against the Germans. The most absurd fables came through him
        into the early history of Bohemia. During the late rule of
        prince Metternich, this work was considered by the censors as
        too ultra-national, and was put on the list of the forbidden
        books. It is only quite recently (1849), that Hanka has been
        allowed to publish a new edition, carefully prepared by himself
        after the collation of several manuscripts.

        The History of Troy was one of the first works which issued
        from the Bohemian press, about A.D. 1476 according to
        Dobrovsky; and again A.D. 1488, and 1603. It was published for
        the fourth and last time by Kramerius in 1790. Even before it
        was printed, it appears to have been multiplied in a great many
        copies, as being a favourite book among the Bohemian knights
        and damsels. Its author was Guido di Colonna. See Dobrovsky's
        <i>Geschichte der böhm. Sprache</i>, p. 155. Another remarkable
        production of the fourteenth century is <i>Tkadleczek</i>, the
        Little Weaver, the manuscript of which is extant in several
        copies; but it has been printed only in an ancient German

        the Bohemian part last in 1767; the original author of which
        was the famous Jesuit Koniash, one of the most violent
        book-destroyers who ever lived. Not only all books written by
        the Hussites or their immediate predecessors, but even many
        catholic writers also of that period were put upon this list;

        The Bohemians, like the Germans, adopted the Latin alphabet;
        but the former, receiving it from the Germans, adopted it in
        the corrupted form of these latter, viz. they imitated the
        Gothic letters, so called, in which also all ancient Bohemian
        books are printed. In modern times the genuine Roman letters
        have nearly supplanted them; to which several different signs
        are added to adapt them to the Slavic sounds. The Bohemian
        alphabet can only be said to have forty-two letters, in so far
        as the same letter with or without a sign can be considered as
        two different letters. The English alphabet would be almost
        without number, if all the three or four modes of pronunciation
        connected with one and the same letter in that language, were
        indicated by certain signs, and these signs made three or four
        letters out of one.

        The Bohemian writings of Huss are extant partly in manuscript,
        partly in single printed pamphlets, but have never been
        collected. They consist of sermons, hymns, letters to his
        friends, postillae, and other interpretations of the
        Scriptures, etc. His complete Latin works were first printed in
        Wittenberg 1558, and repeatedly afterwards. They contain many
        pieces which were originally written in Bohemian; as were also
        the letters which Luther caused to be printed with a preface of
        his own, Wittenberg 1536. Luther translated several of his
        hymns. The letters written by Huss from the prison at Constance
        are the expressions of a pure and elevated mind, and present
        the best evidence of his spotless Christian character. Some of
        them might serve as beautiful specimens of the sublime.

        The Picardites, or Picards, who are also called Adamites,
        existed as early as 1491, when Zhizhka crushed them, without
        annihilating them entirely; the Utraquists detested them
        because they denied the doctrine of transubstantiation,
        although they agreed with them in their general principles.
        They were frequently confounded with the Taborites, among whom
        at last the remnants of them became lost. The Grubenheimer were
        the remnants of the Waldenses, who fled to Bohemia in the
        middle of the 14th century; where, under persecution and
        ridicule, they used to hide themselves in caves and pits,
        <i>Gruben</i>; hence their name. Under the shield of the
        Reformation they thought themselves safe; but met only with new
        oppressors and persecutors. There were numerous other sects,
        and still more different names of one and the same sect. A sect
        of the Taborites, for instance, founded by Nicholas Wlasenicky,
        were alternately called <i>Miculassenci</i> (i.e. Nicolaites,
        the Bohemian form for Nicholas being Miculass), or
        <i>Wlasenitzi</i>, from his name; <i>Pecynowshi</i>, from the
        place of their meetings; and <i>Plachtiwi</i>, i.e. the crying,
        from their manner. See Dobrovsky's <i>Gesch. der böhm.
        Sprache</i>, p. 234. It may be the place here to remark, that
        the Calixlins or Utraquists, although at first decidedly
        against the infallibility of the pope, nevertheless in forming
        the compact of Basle, submitted in the main to the doctrine of
        Rome, with these four conditions; viz. the free distribution of
        the Bible to the people; the administration of the sacrament in
        both kinds; reform of the clergy after the pattern of the
        Apostles; and punishment for "mortal sins" in proportion to
        their enormity.

        Cicero's Lælius and Paradoxa, several works of Jovian, etc.

        This venerable man was ten years president or bishop (Zprawce)
        of the United Brethren; and his whole life appears to have been
        devoted to religious purposes. He prepared the hymn-book in use
        among all the congregations of the Brethren; wrote an
        interpretation of the Apocalypse, 1501; of the Psalms, 1505; a
        treatise on Hope, 1503; on Oaths, etc. His writings, most of

        Simon Lomnicky of Budecz, was court poet; and in addition to
        the poetical crown, his talents procured him a patent of
        nobility. He wrote twenty-eight volumes, most of which are
        printed. For more general information respecting his works, and
        those of the other writers here mentioned, we must refer our

        Balbin was professor of rhetoric at Prague. His works are of
        importance for the literary history of Bohemia: <i>Epitome rer.
        Bohem</i>. Prague 1677. <i>Miscellanea hist rer. Bohem</i>.
        Prague 1680-88. After his death Unger edited in 1777-80 his
        <i>Bohemia docta</i>, and Pelzel in 1775 his <i>Dissertatio
        apologetica pro lingua Slavonica, præcipue Bohemica</i>. See

        More modern Slovakish popular songs are to be found in
        Czelakowsky's collection, <i>Slowanske narodni pisne</i>,
        Prague 1822, 1827; also in <i>Pisnie swietske lidu slowenskeho
        w Uhrich</i>, Pesth 1823, edited by Schaffarik. The little work
        <i>Slavische Volkslieder</i>, by Wenzig, Halle 1830, contains
        sixteen Slovakish songs, mostly taken from Czelakowsky's work,
        in a German translation. A large collection of Slovakish
        popular poetry was made in 1834 by the distinguished poet J.
        Kollar. It is said to contain 2300 pieces.

        George Palkowicz, both following the same pursuits, and both
        not without desert in respect to their countrymen, but
        nevertheless serving opposite interests according to their
        different views, must not be confounded. Professor Palkowicz
        prepared a new edition of the Bohemian Bible for the Slovaks;
        see p. 205 above. Canon Palkowicz translated the Scriptures
        into the Slovakian dialect. Professor P. published a Bohemian

        On the origin of these tribes, which seem to have been kindred
        nations with the ancient Livonians, Esthonians, and Borussians,
        many hypotheses have been started, but the truth has not yet
        been sufficiently ascertained. It seems evident to us, that
        they are not of Slavic origin; although this has been
        maintained by many historians, who were misled by local
        circumstances. Even Schaffarik in his Antiquities regards them
        as originally a Slavic race. See Parrot's <i>Versuch einer
        Entwickelung der Sprache, Abstammung, etc. der Liven, Letten,
        etc</i>. The Foreign Quarterly Review contains an interesting

        The statistical information respecting the Russian-Polish
        provinces is very imperfect, and contains the most striking
        contradictions. Benken gives the number of inhabitants at four
        millions; Wichmann in 1813, at 6,380,000; Arsenjef at seven
        millions. According to Brömsen's <i>Russland und das rüssische
        Reich,</i> Berl. 1819, there are not more than 850,000 Poles
        among them, nearly all noblemen; the lower classes are
        Russniaks and Lithuanians. In our statement of the number of
        Poles in these provinces, we have followed Schaffarik.

        These statements seem to disagree with those of Hassel, which
        rest on the authority of the returns of 1820. He states that
        Austrian Poland has 4,226,969 inhabitants; Prussian Poland,
        2,584,124. The population of the former consists however of a
        large proportion of Russniaks, and more especially of Jews; the
        latter has a similar proportion of German inhabitants.

        Zaluski and Minasovrez wrote verses with <i>counted</i> not
        <i>measured</i> syllables, without rhyme; Przybylski's and
        Staszye's translations of Homer are in hexameters. That rhyme
        is not natural to the Polish language, is evident from the
        ancient popular poetry of the other Slavic nations; which are
        all without rhyme. The author of the work <i>Volkslieder der
        Polen</i>, assumes the absence of rhyme in some of them as a
        proof of their antiquity. Of Slavic popular songs only those of
        the Malo-Russians or Ruthenians are rhymed; and none of these
        lay claim to great antiquity.

        This song, called <i>Boga Rodzica</i>, can be named a war-song,
        only because the Poles used to sing it when advancing to
        battle. It is rather a prayer to the Virgin, ending with a
        sixfold Amen. In a poetical respect it has no value. It is
        printed in Bowring's <i>Specimens of the Polish Poets</i>, p.
        12; together with the music, copied from a manuscript which is
        said to be from the twelfth century. No translation is added.
        It is remarkable that this hymn is still sung, or at least was
        so in the year 1812, in the churches of the places where St.
        Adalbert lived and died, viz. at Kola and Gnesen. Niemcewicz,
        who published it, states that he himself heard it at that time
        at the latter place.

        Among these sects were the Unitarians, called also
        Anti-trinitarians, modern Arians, and afterwards Socinians.
        They called themselves Polish Brethren. Their principal school
        and printing office was at Racow; several of their teachers
        were distinguished for learning, their communities were wealthy
        and flourishing, and not a few of the highest families of
        Poland belonged to them. The doctrines of the two exiled
        Italians, Lelio and Fausto Socini, uncle and nephew, found
        among them only a conditional approbation; most of them were
        unwilling to receive Fausto, who developed his views more
        openly than his uncle, into their community. Internal
        dissensions were the result, and the establishment of new and
        smaller congregations. A disturbance among the Students at
        Racow in 1638, gave to the Catholics and to the other
        Protestants a welcome pretext for persecuting them; in 1658
        their denomination was ultimately suppressed, and the choice
        left to them between the adoption of the Roman Catholic
        religion or exile within three years. A part of them emigrated
        to Germany, where they were soon merged in other Protestant
        denominations; others went to Transylvania, where the
        Unitarians, about fifty thousand in number, belonged and still
        belong to the denominations acknowledged by the state, and
        enjoy all civil rights. They have two high schools, at
        Klausenburg and at Thoarda; but are far from being
        distinguished for learning. See Meusel's

        An enumeration of the Polish versions of the Bible may be
        acceptable to the reader. The New Testament was first
        translated by the Lutheran Seklucyan, who was a Greek scholar,
        and printed at Königsberg 1551, three times reprinted before
        1555. Afterwards for Catholics by Leonard, from the Vulgate,
        reviewed by Leopolita, Cracow 1556. Of the Old Testament, the
        Psalter alone was several times translated and repeatedly
        printed. The whole Bible was first translated for the Catholics
        by Leonard, from the Vulgate, and reviewed by Leopolita, Cracow
        1561, reprinted in 1575 and 1577. Two years later by an
        anonymous translator from the original languages, for
        Calvinists, Brzesc 1563. Again from the original languages by
        Budny, an Unitarian clergyman, 1570, reprinted in 1572. From
        the Vulgate by the Jesuit Wuiek, Cracow 1599, reprinted at
        Breslau in 1740 in 8vo, and 1771 in 4to, with the Latin text.
        From the original languages by Paliurus, Wengiersciua, and
        Micolaievius, for Calvimsts, Dantzic 1632, the first Bible in
        8vo, all the former being in fol. or 4to; reprinted at
        Amsterdam 1660, at Halle 1726, at Königsberg 1738, 1779, and at
        Berlin 1810, by the Bibie Society. See Ringeltaube's

        The Polish senate was not a body, the members of which were
        elected for a certain term; as those not acquainted with the
        Polish constitution might be disposed to believe. It was
        composed of all the archbishops and bishops, the waiwodes and
        castellans, i.e. the titled nobility, and the principal
        ministers of the king. It was thus in some measure the organ of
        the government and of the clergy, in opposition to the national
        representatives or the mass of the nobility. This body was not
        established until towards the close of the fifteenth century.
        Before 1466-70, every nobleman who chose, made his personal
        appearance in the senate at the summons of the king; but
        Casimir, the son of Jagello, in his frequent want of money and
        men, repeated these summons so often, that the nobility found
        personal appearance inconvenient, and selected in their
        provincial conventions <i>nuntii</i>, to represent the nation,
        or rather the nobility; without however giving up the right of
        personal attendance. The <i>nuntii</i>, whose number was not
        fixed, were bound to appear, had the right to grant or to
        refuse duties, and to act as the advisers of the king. In 1505
        the law was passed, that without their consent the constitution
        could not be changed. At the diet in A.D. 1652 it occurred for
        the first time, that a single <i>nuntius</i> opposed and
        annulled by his <i>liberum veto</i> the united resolutions of
        the whole convention. On this example a regular right was very
        soon founded and acknowledged. Deputies of cities were
        occasionally invited to the diet, but only in extraordinary
        cases.

        Whether Copernicus is to be called a Pole or a German has been
        and is still a matter of dispute, and has been managed on the
        side of the Poles with the utmost bitterness and passion. The
        Poles have recently given expression to their claim upon him by
        erecting to him a monument at Cracow, and celebrating the third
        centennial anniversary of the completion of his system of the
        world, which took place in A.D. 1530. Let the question
        respecting Copernicus be decided as it may, Poland may
        doubtless lay claim to many other eminent natural philosophers
        as her sons; e.g. Vitellio-Ciolek, who was the first in Europe
        to investigate the theory of light, in the beginning of the
        thirteenth century; Brudzewski, the teacher of Copernicus;
        Martinus of Olkusz, the proper author of the new or Gregorian
        calendar, which was introduced sixty-four years after him, etc.

        The Polish works of this poet, who is still considered as the
        chief ornament of the Polish Parnassus, were first collected in
        four volumes, Cracow 1584-90. After going through several
        editions, they have recently been printed at Breslau, 1894, in
        a stereotype edition. Bowring gives among his 'Specimens' some
        of the sweetest pieces of Kochanowski.

        The oldest edition extant of his Polish pastorals, was printed
        at Zamosc, 1614, under the title <i>Sielanki</i>. They were

        of Mostowski, <i>Sielanki Polskie</i>, Warsaw 1805. There are

        This latter was honoured by his countrymen with the title of

        These <i>pacta conventa</i>, to which numerous articles were
        afterwards added, not only limiled the king in his quality as
        king, but even also as a private man, in a degree to which no
        freeman would willingly submit. For example, he was not allowed
        to marry except with the consent of the diet; and as each
        single nuntius had the right to oppose and render void the
        resolutions of the united estates by his <i>liberum veto</i>,
        the king could not marry whenever it occurred to any one of
        them to withhold his consent. In 1669 it was resolved, that no
        king should be allowed to abdicate.

        The Polish serfs were indeed never regular slaves; but merely
        <i>glebae adscripti</i>, i.e. they could not be sold separately
        as mere things, but only with the soil they cultivated, which
        they had no right to leave. They were not reduced even to this
        state before the fifteenth or sixteenth century; for one of the
        statutes of Casimir the Great allows them the privilege of
        selling their property and leaving whenever they were ill
        treated. Of the present state of the Polish peasantry, the
        author of "Poland under the dominion of Russia," (Bost. 1834,)
        says: "The Polish peasant might perhaps be about as free as my
        dog was in Warsaw; for I certainly should not have prevented
        the animal from learning, had he been so inclined, some tricks
        by which he could earn the reward of an extra bone. The freedom
        of the wretched Polish serfs is much the same as the freedom of
        their cattle; for they are brought up with as little of human
        cultivation," etc. p. 165. And again: "The Polish serf is in
        every part of the country extremely poor, and of all the living
        creatures I have met with in this world, or seen described in
        books of natural history, he is the most wretched." p. 176.

        Lemberg indeed can hardly be called a Polish university. All
        its professors are Germans, and the lectures are delivered in
        Latin or German. It has only three faculties, viz. the
        philosophical, theological, and juridical. For medicine it has
        only a preparatory school, the course being finished at Vienna.
        Among the 65 medical students of 1832, there were 41 Jews. The
        university had in that year, in all, 1291 students. For the
        theological and juridical courses, which, according to law,
        comprise each four years, a previous preparation of two years
        spent in philosophical studies is required by the government.
        Thus the regular course of an Austrian student lasts six years.
        The same measures were taken to Germanize Cracow during the
        Austrian administration; but when in 1815 Cracow became a free
        city, it parted with all its German professors, and became
        again a genuine Polish university.

        From the account given of the state of the Polish common people
        in note 42 above, we must conclude that this number is very
        small. Mr. Ljach Szyrma, the author of Letters on Poland,
        (Edinb. 1823,) says: "The lower classes, unfortunately, do not
        enjoy the advantage of being proportionally benefited by the
        learning requisite to their social condition. The parish
        schools are not sufficient to improve them in this respect; and
        the village schools, upon which their hopes chiefly rest,
        <i>are not numerous</i>."

        enough to look upon the profession of a physician with
        contempt. They had however in earlier times some very
        celebrated physicians, as Martin of Olkusc, Felix of Lowicz,
        and Struthius, who was called to Spain to save the life of
        Philip II, and even to the Turkish sultan Suliman II.

        The English reader will find further information on Polish
        literature in Bowring's Introduction to his Polish Anthology,
        Lond. 1827; in Ljach Szyrma's Letters on Poland, published in
        London; and in an article on Polish Literature in the Foreign
        Quarterly Review, Vol. XXV. No. 49. These are the only sources

        In grammatical and lexical works the Polish language is very
        rich; but the interest which the English have recently shown
        for the fate of the Poles seems not to extend to their
        language. The following are the principal works.

        "On a certain day all the inhabitants of Kief were assembled on
        the banks of the Dnieper, and on a signal from the monarch, all
        plunged into the river, some to the waist, others to the neck;
        parents held their children in their arms while the ceremony
        was performed by the priests in attendance. Thus a nation
        received baptism, not only without murmuring, but with
        cheerfulness; for all were convinced that a religion, embraced
        by the sovereign and boyards, must necessarily be the best in
        the world" Foreign Quart. Review, Art. on Karamsin's History of
        Russia, Vol. III. p. 160. Compare Henderson's Travels in

          "The Tshuvashes have a Penate, which they call Erich. This
          Erich is nothing but a bundle of broom, <i>cytisus</i>, tied
          together in the middle with the inner bark of the linden. It
          consists of fifteen branches of equal size, about four feet
          long; above is a piece of tin attached to it. Each house has
          such an Erich, which usually stands in a corner of the entry.
          Nobody ventures to touch it. When it becomes dry, a new Erich
          is tied together, and the old one placed in running water
          with great reverence." See <i>Stimmen des Russ. Volks</i>,
          von P.v. Goetze, Stuttg. 1828, page 17.&mdash;The Tshuvashes,
          however, are not a Slavic, but a Finnish race, living under
          the Russian dominion.

          We say, 'to judge from the language.' But their coincidence
          with Bohemian ballads of the thirteenth century, and various
          other indications (e.g. their frequent mention of the

          A Servian woman never would sit down in the presence of her
          husband. At table she stands behind him, and waits on him and
          his guests. Even the wife of prince Milosh did so; only with
          the restriction that she confined her services to her
          husband. The Morlachians&mdash;who seem indeed to be the
          <i>rudest</i> part of the Servian population&mdash;do not
          mention their wives to a stranger without adding: "With your

          <i>rhymes</i>, and accommodating them to the English way of
          feeling and expressing feelings; a proceeding which we have
          purposely avoided, because our only object is a
          <i>faithful</i> translation. Dr. Bowring has moreover
          translated mainly from our German translation.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
