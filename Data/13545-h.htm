<p>The incidents narrated in this book are based on fact, and, while not
absolutely true in every particular, the characters are all drawn from
real life. The photographs are true likenesses of the people they are
supposed to represent, and while in some instances the correct names
are not given (for reasons which the reader will readily understand),
the various scenes, relics, etc., are true historically and
geographically. The places described can be easily recognized by any
one who has ever visited the section of Pennsylvania in which the plot
(if it can really be called a plot) of the story is laid. Many of the
recipes given Mary by Pennsylvania German housewives, noted for the
excellence of their cooking, have never appeared in print.</p>

<h3>MARY'S LETTERS RECEIVED AT CLEAR SPRING FARM.</h3>
<br />

<p><img src='images/015.jpg' width='222' height='216' align='left' alt='' title=''>
One morning in early spring, John Landis, a Pennsylvania German farmer
living in Schuggenhaus Township, Bucks County, on opening his mail
box, fastened to a tree at the crossroads (for the convenience of
rural mail carriers) found one letter for his wife Sarah, the envelope
addressed in the well-known handwriting of her favorite niece, Mary
Midleton, of Philadelphia.</p>



<p>A letter being quite an event at &quot;Clear Spring&quot; farm, he hastened with
it to the house, finding &quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; as she was called by every one
(Great Aunt to Mary), in the cheery farm house kitchen busily engaged
kneading sponge for a loaf of rye bread, which she carefully deposited
on a well-floured linen cloth, in a large bowl for the final raising.</p>

<p>Carefully adjusting her glasses more securely over the bridge of her
nose, she turned at the sound of her husband's footsteps. Seeing the
letter in his hand she inquired: &quot;What news, John?&quot; Quickly opening
the letter handed her, she, after a hasty perusal, gave one of the
whimsical smiles peculiar to her and remarked decisively, with a
characteristic nod of her head: &quot;John, Mary Midleton intends to marry,
else why, pray tell me, would she write <a name='Page_10'></a>of giving up teaching her
kindergarten class in the city, to spend the summer with us on the
farm learning, she writes, to keep house, cook, economize and to learn
how to get the most joy and profit from life?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well! Mary is a dear girl, why should she not think of
marrying?&quot; replied her husband; &quot;she is nineteen. Quite time, I think,
she should learn housekeeping&mdash;something every young girl should know.
We should hear of fewer divorces and a less number of failures of men
in business, had their wives been trained before marriage to be good,
thrifty, economical housekeepers and, still more important, good
homemakers. To be a helpmate in every sense of the word is every
woman's duty, I think, when her husband works early and late to
procure the means to provide for her comforts and luxuries and a
competency for old age. Write Mary to come at once, and under your
teaching she may, in time, become as capable a housekeeper and as good
a cook as her Aunt Sarah; and, to my way of thinking, there is none
better, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p>Praise from her usually reticent husband never failed to deepen the
tint of pink on Aunt Sarah's still smooth, unwrinkled, youthful
looking face, made more charming by being framed in waves of silvery
gray hair, on which the &quot;Hand of Time,&quot; in passing, had sprinkled some
of the dust from the road of life.</p>

<p>In size, Sarah Landis was a little below medium height, rather stout,
or should I say comfortable, and matronly looking; very erect for a
woman of her age. Her bright, expressive, gray eyes twinkled
humorously when she talked. She had developed a fine character by her
years of unselfish devotion to family and friends. Her splendid sense
of humor helped her to overcome difficulties, and her ability to rise
above her environment, however discouraging their conditions,
prevented her from being unhappy or depressed by the small annoyances
met daily. She never failed to find joy and pleasure in the faithful
performance of daily tasks, however small or insignificant. Aunt Sarah
attributed her remarkably fine, clear complexion, seldom equalled in a
woman of her years, to good digestion and excellent health; her love
of fresh air, fruit and clear spring water. She usually drank from
four to five tumblerfuls of water a day. She never ate to excess, and
frequently remarked: &quot;I think more people suffer from over-eating than
from insufficient food.&quot; An advocate of deep breathing, she <a name='Page_11'></a>spent as
much of her time as she could spare from household duties in the open
air.</p>

<a name='AUNT_SARAH'></a><h3>AUNT SARAH</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/018.jpg' width='511' height='735' alt='AUNT SARAH' title=''>
</center>

<p>Sarah Landis was not what one would call beautiful, but good and
whole-souled looking. To quote her husband: &quot;To me Sarah never looks
so sweet and homelike when all 'fussed up' in her best black dress on
special occasions, as she does when engaged in daily household tasks
around home, in her plain, neat, gray calico dress.&quot;</p>

<p>This dress was always covered with a large, spotlessly clean, blue
gingham apron of small broken check, and she was very particular about
having a certain-sized check. The apron had a patch pocket, which
usually contained small twists or little wads of cord, which, like
&quot;The Old Ladies in Cranford,&quot; she picked up and saved for a possible
emergency.</p>

<p>One of Aunt Sarah's special economies was the saving of twine and
paper bags. The latter were always neatly folded, when emptied, and
placed in a cretonne bag made for that purpose, hanging in a
convenient corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's gingham apron was replaced afternoons by one made from
fine, Lonsdale cambric, of ample proportions, and on special occasions
she donned a hemstitched linen apron, inset at upper edge of hem with
crocheted lace insertion, the work of her own deft fingers. Aunt
Sarah's aprons, cut straight, on generous lines, were a part of her
individuality.</p>

<p>Sarah Landis declared: &quot;Happiness consists in giving and in serving
others,&quot; and she lived up to the principles she advocated. She
frequently quoted from the &quot;Sons of Martha,&quot; by Kipling:</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;Lift ye the stone or cleave the wood, to make a path more fair or flat,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Not as a ladder from earth to heaven, not as an altar to any creed,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>But simple service, simply given, to his own kind in their human need.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;I think this so fine,&quot; said Aunt Sarah, &quot;and so true a sentiment that
I am almost compelled to forgive Kipling for saying 'The female of the
species is more deadly than the male.'&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's goodness was reflected in her face and in the <a name='Page_12'></a>tones of
her voice, which were soft and low, yet very decided. She possessed a
clear, sweet tone, unlike the slow, peculiar drawl often aiding with
the rising inflection peculiar to many country folk among the
&quot;Pennsylvania Germans.&quot;</p>

<p>The secret of Aunt Sarah's charm lay in her goodness. Being always
surrounded by a cheery atmosphere, she benefited all with whom she
came in contact. She took delight in simple pleasures. She had the
power of extracting happiness from the common, little every-day tasks
and frequently remarked, &quot;Don't strive to live without work, but to
find more joy in your work.&quot; Her opinions were highly respected by
every one in the neighborhood, and, being possessed of an unselfish
disposition, she thought and saw good in every one; brought out the
best in one, and made one long to do better, just to gain her
approval, if for no higher reward. Sarah Landis was a loyal friend and
one would think the following, by Mrs. Craik, applied to her:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort, of feeling safe with a
person&mdash;having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but
pouring them all right out, just as they are&mdash;chaff and grain
together, certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep
what is worth keeping and then with the breath of kindness blow the
rest away.&quot;</p>

<p>She was never so happy as when doing an act of kindness for some poor
unfortunate, and often said. &quot;If 'twere not for God and good people,
what would become of the unfortunate?&quot; and thought like George
McDonald, &quot;If I can put one touch of rosy sunset into the life of any
man or woman (I should add child) I shall feel that I have worked with
God.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's sweet, lovable face was the first beheld by many a
little, new-born infant; her voice, the first to hush its wailing
cries as she cuddled it up to her motherly breast, and oft, with
loving hands, softly closed the lids over eyes no longer able to see;
whom the Gracious Master had taken into His keeping.</p>

<p>One day I overheard Aunt Sarah quote to a sorrowing friend these fine,
true lines from Longfellow's &quot;Resignation&quot;: &quot;Let us be patient, these
severe afflictions not from the ground arise, but celestial
benedictions assume the dark disguise.&quot;</p>

<h3>MARY'S ARRIVAL AT THE FARM.</h3>
<br />

<p>The day preceding that of Mary's arrival at the farm was a busy one
for Aunt Sarah, who, since early morning, had been preparing the
dishes she knew Mary enjoyed. Pans of the whitest, flakiest rolls, a
large loaf of sweetest nut-brown, freshly-baked &quot;graham bread,&quot; of
which Mary was especially fond; an array of crumb-cakes and pies of
every description covered the well-scrubbed table in the summer
kitchen, situated a short distance from the house. A large, yellow
earthenware bowl on the table contained a roll of rich, creamy &quot;smier
kase&quot; just as it had been turned from the muslin bag, from which the
&quot;whey&quot; had dripped over night; ready to be mixed with cream for the
supper table. Pats of sweet, freshly-churned butter, buried in clover
blossoms, were cooling in the old spring-house near by.</p>

<p>The farm house was guiltless of dust from cellar to attic. Aunt Sarah
was a model housekeeper; she accomplished wonders, yet never appeared
tired or flurried as less systematic housekeepers often do, who, with
greater expenditure of energy, often accomplish less work. She took no
unnecessary steps; made each one count, yet never appeared in haste to
finish her work.</p>

<p>Said Aunt Sarah, &quot;The lack of system in housework is what makes it
drudgery. If young housekeepers would sit down and plan their work,
then do it, they would save time and labor. When using the fire in the
range for ironing or other purposes, use the oven for preparing dishes
of food which require long, slow cooking, like baked beans, for
instance. Bake a cake or a pudding, or a pan of quickly-made corn pone
to serve with baked beans, for a hearty meal on a cold winter day. A
dish of rice pudding placed in the oven requires very little
attention, and when baked may be placed on ice until served. If this
rule be followed, the young housewife will be surprised to find how
much easier will be the task of preparing a meal later in the day,
especially in hot weather.&quot;</p>

<p><a name='Page_14'></a>The day following, John Landis drove to the railroad station, several
miles distant, to meet his niece. As Mary stepped from the train into
the outstretched arms of her waiting Uncle, many admiring glances
followed the fair, young girl. Her tan-gold naturally wavy, masses of
hair rivaled ripened grain. The sheen of it resembled corn silk before
it has been browned and crinkled by the sun. Her eyes matched in color
the exquisite, violet-blue blossoms of the chicory weed. She possessed
a rather large mouth, with upturned corners, which seemed made for
smiles, and when once you had been charmed with them, she had made an
easy conquest of you forever. There was a sweet, winning personality
about Mary which was as impossible to describe as to resist. One
wondered how so much adorable sweetness could be embodied in one small
maid. But Mary's sweetness of expression and charming manner covered a
strong will and tenacity of purpose one would scarcely have believed
possible, did they not have an intimate knowledge of the young girl's
disposition. Her laugh, infectious, full of the joy of living, the
vitality of youth and perfect health and happiness, reminded one of
the lines: &quot;A laugh is just like music for making living sweet.&quot;</p>

<p>Seated beside her Uncle in the carriage, Mary was borne swiftly
through the town out into the country. It was one of those
preternaturally quiet, sultry days when the whole universe appears
lifeless and inert, free from loud noise, or sound of any description,
days which we occasionally have in early Spring or Summer, when the
stillness is oppressive.</p>

<p>Frequently at such times there is borne to the nostrils the faint,
stifling scent of burning brush, indicating that land is being cleared
by the forehanded, thrifty farmer for early planting. Often at such
times, before a shower, may be distinctly heard the faintest twitter
and &quot;peep, peep&quot; of young sparrows, the harsh &quot;caw, caw&quot; of the crow,
and the song of the bobolink, poised on the swaying branch of a tall
tree, the happiest bird of Spring; the dozy, drowsy hum of bees; the
answering call of lusty young chanticleers, and the satisfied cackle
of laying hens and motherly old biddies, surrounded by broods of
downy, greedy little newly-hatched chicks. The shrill whistle of a
distant locomotive startles one with its clear, resonant intonation,
which on a less quiet day would pass unnoticed. Mary, with the zest of
youth, enjoyed to the full the change from the past months of
confine<a name='Page_15'></a>ment in a city school, and missed nothing of the beauty of the
country and the smell of the good brown earth, as her Uncle drove
swiftly homeward.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle John,&quot; said Mary, &quot;'tis easy to believe God made the country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; rejoined her Uncle, &quot;the country is good enough for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With the exception of the one day in the month, when you attend the
'Shriners' meeting' in the city,&quot; mischievously supplemented Mary, who
knew her Uncle's liking for the Masonic Lodge of which he was a
member, &quot;and,&quot; she continued, &quot;I brought you a picture for your
birthday, which we shall celebrate tomorrow. The picture will please
you, I know. It is entitled, 'I Love to Love a Mason, 'Cause a Mason
Never Tells.'&quot;</p>

<p>They passed cultivated farms. Inside many of the rail fences,
inclosing fields of grain or clover, were planted numberless sour
cherry trees, snowy with bloom, the ground underneath white with
fallen petals. The air was sweet with the perfume of the half-opened
buds on the apple trees in the near-by orchards and rose-like pink
blossoms of the &quot;flowering&quot; crab-apple, in the door yards. Swiftly
they drove through cool, green, leafy woods, crossing a wooden bridge
spanning a small stream, so shallow that the stones at the bottom were
plainly to be seen. A loud splash, as the sound of carriage wheels
broke the uninterrupted silence, and a commotion in the water gave
evidence of the sudden disappearance of several green-backed frogs,
sunning themselves on a large, moss-grown rock, projecting above the
water's edge; from shady nooks and crevices peeped clusters of early
white violets; graceful maidenhair ferns, and hardier members of the
fern family, called &quot;Brake,&quot; uncurled their graceful, sturdy fronds
from the carpet of green moss and lichen at the base of tree trunks,
growing along the water's edge. Partly hidden by rocks along the bank
of the stream, nestled a few belated cup-shaped anemones or &quot;Wind
Flowers,&quot; from which most of the petals had blown, they being one of
the earliest messengers of Spring. Through the undergrowth in the
woods, in passing, could be seen the small buds of the azalea or wild
honeysuckle, &quot;Sheep's Laurel,&quot; the deep pink buds on the American
Judas tree, trailing vines of &quot;Tea Berry,&quot; and beneath dead leaves one
caught an occasional glimpse of fragrant, pink arbutus. In marshy
places beside the creek, <a name='Page_16'></a>swaying in the wind from slender stems, grew
straw-colored, bell-shaped blossoms of &quot;Adder's Tongue&quot; or &quot;Dog Tooth
Violet,&quot; with their mottled green, spike-shaped leaves. In the shadow
of a large rock grew dwarf huckleberry bushes, wild strawberry vines,
and among grasses of many varieties grew patches of white and
pink-tinted Alsatian clover.</p>

<p>Leaving behind the spicy, fragrant, &quot;woodsy&quot; smell of wintergreen,
birch and sassafras, and the faint, sweet scent of the creamy,
wax-like blossoms of &quot;Mandrake&quot; or May apple, peeping from beneath
large, umbrella-like, green leaves they emerged at last from the dim,
cool shadows of the woods into the warm, bright sunlight again.</p>

<p>Almost before Mary realized it, the farm house could be seen in the
distance, and her Uncle called her attention to his new, red barn,
which had been built since her last visit to the farm, and which, in
her Uncle's estimation, was of much greater importance than the house.</p>

<p>Mary greeted with pleasure the old landmarks so familiar to her on
former visits. They passed the small, stone school house at the
crossroads, and in a short time the horses turned obediently into the
lane leading to the barn a country lane in very truth, a tangle of
blackberry vines, wild rose bushes, by farmers called &quot;Pasture Roses,&quot;
interwoven with bushes of sumach, wild carrots and golden rod.</p>

<p>Mary insisted that her Uncle drive directly to the barn, as was his
usual custom, while she was warmly welcomed at the farm house gate by
her Aunt. As her Uncle led away the horses, he said, &quot;I will soon join
you, Mary, 'to break of our bread and eat of our salt,' as they say in
the 'Shrine.'&quot;</p>

<p>On their way to the house, Mary remarked: &quot;I am so glad we reached
here before dusk. The country is simply beautiful! Have you ever
noticed, Aunt Sarah, what a symphony in green is the yard? Look at the
buds on the maples and lilacs&mdash;a faint yellow green&mdash;and the
blue-green pine tree near by; the leaves of the German iris are
another shade; the grass, dotted with yellow dandelions, and blue
violets; the straight, grim, reddish-brown stalks of the peonies
before the leaves have unfolded, all roofed over with the
blossom-covered branches of pear, apple and 'German Prune' trees.
Truly, this must resemble Paradise!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; assented her Aunt, &quot;I never knew blossoms to remain on <a name='Page_17'></a>the
pear trees so long a time. We have had no 'blossom shower' as yet to
scatter them, but there will be showers tonight, I think, or I am no
prophet. I feel rain in the atmosphere, and Sibylla said a few moments
ago she heard a 'rain bird' in the mulberry tree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; inquired Mary, &quot;is the rhubarb large enough to use?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed, we have baked rhubarb pies and have had a surfeit of
dandelion salad or 'Salat,' as our neighbors designate it. Your Uncle
calls 'dandelion greens' the farmers' spring tonic; that and
'celadine,' that plant you see growing by the side of the house. Later
in the season it bears small, yellow flowers not unlike a very small
buttercup blossom, and it is said to be an excellent remedy for chills
and fevers, and it tastes almost as bitter as quinine. There are
bushels of dandelion blossoms, some of which we shall pick tomorrow,
and from them make dandelion wine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what use will my thrifty Aunt make of the blue violets?&quot;
mischievously inquired Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;The violets,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;I shall dig up carefully with some
earth adhering to their roots and place them in a glass bowl for a
centrepiece on the table for my artistic and beauty-loving niece; and
if kept moist, you will be surprised at the length of time they will
remain 'a thing of beauty' if not 'a joy forever.' And later, Mary,
from them I'll teach you to make violet beads.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, notice that large robin endeavoring to pull a worm from
the ground. Do you suppose the same birds return here from the South
every Summer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainty, I do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That old mulberry tree, from the berries of which you made such
delicious pies and marmalade last Summer, is it dead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; only late about getting its Spring outfit of leaves.&quot;</p>

<h3>SCHUGGENHAUS TOWNSHIP.</h3>
<br />

<p>&quot;Schuggenhaus,&quot; said Sarah Landis, speaking to her niece, Mary
Midleton, &quot;is one of the largest and most populous townships in Bucks
County, probably so named by the early German settlers, some of whom,
I think, were my father's ancestors, as they came originally from
Zweibrucken, Germany, and settled in Schuggenhaus Township.
Schuggenhaus is one of the most fertile townships in Bucks County and
one of the best cultivated; farming is our principal occupation, and
the population of the township today is composed principally of the
descendants of well-to-do Germans, frequently called 'Pennsylvania
Dutch.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have often heard them called by that name,&quot; said Mary. &quot;Have you
forgotten, Aunt Sarah, you promised to tell me something interesting
about the first red clover introduced in Bucks County?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Red clover,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;that having bright, crimson-pink
heads, is the most plentiful and the most common variety of clover;
but knowing how abundantly it grows in different parts of the country
at the present time, one would scarcely have believed, in olden times,
that it would ever be so widely distributed as it now is.</p>

<p>&quot;One reason clover does so well in this country is that the
fertilization of the clover is produced by pollenation by the busy
little bumble-bee, who carries the pollen from blossom to blossom, and
clover is dependent upon these small insects for fertilization, as
without them clover would soon die out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I admire the feathery, fuzzy, pink-tipped, rabbit-foot clover,&quot; said
Mary; &quot;it is quite fragrant, and usually covered with butterflies. It
makes such very pretty bouquets when you gather huge bunches of it.&quot;</p>

<a name='THE_OLD_MILL_WHEEL'></a><h3>THE OLD MILL WHEEL</h3>

<img src='images/029.jpg' width='535' height='400' alt='THE OLD MILL WHEEL' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;No, Mary, I think you are thinking of Alsatian clover, which is
similar to white clover. The small, round heads are cream color,
tinged with pink; it is very fragrant and sweet and grows along <a name='Page_19'></a>the
roadside and, like the common white clover, is a favorite with bees.
The yellow hop clover we also find along the roadside. As the heads of
clover mature, they turn yellowish brown and resemble dried hops;
sometimes yellow, brown and tan blossoms are seen on one branch. The
cultivation of red clover was introduced here a century ago, and when
in bloom the fields attracted great attention. Being the first ever
grown in this part of Bucks County, people came for miles to look at
it, the fence around the fields some days being lined with spectators,
I have been told by my grandfather. I remember when a child nothing
appeared to me more beautiful than my father's fields of flax; a mass
of bright blue flowers. I also remember the fields of broom-corn. Just
think! We made our own brooms, wove linen from the flax raised on our
farm and made our own tallow candles. Mary, from what a thrifty and
hard-working lot of ancestors you are descended! You inherit from your
mother your love of work and from your father your love of books. Your
father's uncle was a noted Shakespearean scholar.&quot;</p>

<p><a name='Page_20'></a>Many old-time industries are passing away. Yet Sarah Landis, was a
housewife of the old school and still cooked apple butter, or &quot;Lodt
Varrik,&quot; as the Germans call it; made sauerkraut and hard soap, and
naked old-fashioned &quot;German&quot; rye bread on the hearth, which owed its
excellence not only to the fact of its being hearth baked but to the
rye flour being ground in an old mill in a near-by town, prepared by
the old process of grinding between mill-stones instead of the more
modern roller process. This picture of the old mill, taken by Fritz
Schmidt, shows it is not artistic, but, like most articles of German
manufacture, the mill was built more for its usefulness than to please
the eye.</p>

<a name='THE_OLD_MILL'></a><h3>THE OLD MILL</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/030.jpg' width='534' height='414' alt='THE OLD MILL' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, what is pumpernickel?&quot; inquired Mary, &quot;is it like rye
bread?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, my dear, not exactly, it is a dark-colored bread, used in some
parts of Germany. Professor Schmidt tells me the bread is usually
composed of a mixture of barley flour and rye flour. Some I have eaten
looks very much like our own brown bread. Pumpernickel is considered a
very wholesome bread by the Germans&mdash;and I presume one might learn to
relish it, but I should prefer <a name='Page_21'></a>good, sweet, home-made rye bread. I
was told by an old gentleman who came to this country from Germany
when a boy, that pumpernickel was used in the German army years ago,
and was somewhat similar to 'hard tack,' furnished our soldiers in the
Civil War. But I cannot vouch for the truth of this assertion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; said Mary later, &quot;Frau Schmidt tells me the Professor
sends his rye to the mill and requests that every part of it be ground
without separating&mdash;making what he calls 'whole rye flour,' and from
this Frau Schmidt bakes wholesome, nutritious bread which they call
'pumpernickel,' She tells me she uses about one-third of this 'whole
rye flour' to two-thirds white bread flour when baking bread, and she
considers bread made from this whole grain more wholesome and
nutritious than the bread made from our fine rye flour.&quot;</p>

<h3>JOHN LANDIS.</h3>
<br />

<p>The Bucks County farmer, John Landis, rather more scholarly in
appearance than men ordinarily found in agricultural districts, was
possessed of an adust complexion, caused by constant exposure to wind
and weather; tall and spare, without an ounce of superfluous fat;
energetic, and possessed of remarkable powers of endurance. He had a
kindly, benevolent expression; his otherwise plain face was redeemed
by fine, expressive brown eyes. Usually silent and preoccupied, and
almost taciturn, yet he possessed a fund of dry humor. An
old-fashioned Democrat, his wife was a Republican. He usually
accompanied Aunt Sarah to her church, the Methodist, although he was a
member of the German Reformed, and declared he had changed his
religion to please her, but change his politics, never. A member of
the Masonic Lodge, his only diversion was an occasional trip to the
city with a party of the &quot;boys&quot; to attend a meeting of the &quot;Shriners.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah protested. &quot;The idea, John, at your age, being out so late
at night and returning from the city on the early milk train the
following morning, and then being still several miles from home. It's
scandalous!&quot;</p>

<p>He only chuckled to himself; and what the entertainment had been,
which was provided at Lulu Temple, and which he had so thoroughly
enjoyed, was left to her imagination. His only remark when questioned
was: &quot;Sarah, you're not in it. You are not a 'Shriner.'&quot; And as John
had in every other particular fulfilled her ideal of what constitutes
a good husband, Sarah, like the wise woman she was, allowed the
subject to drop.</p>

<p>A good, practical, progressive farmer, John Landis constantly read,
studied and pondered over the problem of how to produce the largest
results at least cost of time and labor. His crops were skillfully
planted in rich soil, carefully cultivated and usually harvested
earlier than those of his neighbors. One summer he raised potatoes so
large that many of them weighed one pound each, and <a name='Page_23'></a>new potatoes and
green peas, fresh from the garden, invariably appeared on Aunt Sarah's
table the first of July, and sometimes earlier. I have known him to
raise cornstalks which reached a height of thirteen feet, which were
almost equaled by his wife's sunflower stalks, which usually averaged
nine feet in height.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah, speaking one day to Mary, said: &quot;Your Uncle John is an
unusually silent man. I have heard him remark that when people talk
continuously they are either <i>very</i> intelligent or tell untruths.&quot; He,
happening to overhear her remark, quickly retorted:</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;The man who speaks a dozen tongues,<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>When all is said and done,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Don't hold a match to him who knows<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>How to keep still in one.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When annoyed at his wife's talkativeness, her one fault in her
husband's eyes, if he thought she had a fault, he had a way of saying,
&quot;Alright, Sarah, Alright,&quot; as much as to say &quot;that is final; you have
said enough,&quot; in his peculiar, quick manner of speaking, which Aunt
Sarah never resented, he being invariably kind and considerate in
other respects.</p>

<p>John Landis was a successful farmer because he loved his work, and
found joy in it. While not unmindful of the advantages possessed by
the educated farmer of the present day, he said, &quot;'Tis not college
lore our boys need so much as practical education to develop their
efficiency. While much that we eat and wear comes out of the ground,
we should have more farmers, the only way to lower the present high
cost of living, which is such a perplexing problem to the housewife.
There is almost no limit to what might be accomplished by some of our
bright boys should they make agriculture a study. Luther Burbank says,
'To add but one kernel of corn to each ear grown in this country in a
single year would increase the supply five million bushels.'&quot;</p>

</div>

<p>The old unpainted farm house, built of logs a century ago, had changed
in the passing years to a grayish tint. An addition had been built to
the house several years before Aunt Sarah's occupancy, The sober hue
of the house harmonized with the great, gnarled old trunk of the
meadow willow near-by. Planted when the house was built, it spread its
great branches protectingly over it. A wild clematis growing at the
foot of the tree twined its tendrils around the massive trunk until in
late summer they had become an inseparable part of it, almost covering
it with feathery blossoms.</p>

<p>Near by stood an antique arbor, covered with thickly-clustering vines,
in season bending with the weight of &quot;wild-scented&quot; grapes, their
fragrance mingling with the odor of &quot;Creek Mint&quot; growing near by a
small streamlet and filling the air with a delicious fragrance. The
mint had been used in earlier years by Aunt Sarah's grandfather as a
beverage which he preferred to any other.</p>

<p>From a vine clambering up the grape arbor trellies, in the fall of the
year, hung numerous orange-colored balsam apples, which opened, when
ripe, disclosing bright crimson interior and seeds. These apples, Aunt
Sarah claimed, if placed in alcohol and applied <a name='Page_25'></a>externally, possessed
great medicinal value as a specific for rheumatism.</p>

<a name='THE_OLD_FARM_HOUSE'></a><h3>THE OLD FARM HOUSE</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/035.jpg' width='549' height='309' alt='THE OLD FARM HOUSE' title=''>
</center>

<p>A short distance from the house stood the newly-built red barn, facing
the pasture lot. On every side stretched fields which, in summer,
waved with wheat, oats, rye and buckwheat, and the corn crib stood
close by, ready for the harvest to fill it to overflowing. Beside the
farm house door stood a tall, white oleander, planted in a large,
green-painted wooden tub. Near by, in a glazed earthenware pot, grew
the old-fashioned lantana plant, covered with clusters of tiny
blossoms, of various shades of orange, red and pink.</p>

<p>In flower beds outlined by clam shells which had been freshly
whitewashed blossomed fuchsias, bleeding hearts, verbenas, dusty
millers, sweet clove-scented pinks, old-fashioned, dignified, purple
digitalis or foxglove, stately pink Princess Feather, various
brilliant-hued zinnias, or more commonly called &quot;Youth and Old Age,&quot;
and as gayly colored, if more humble and lowly, portulacas; the
fragrant white, star-like blossoms of the nicotiana, or &quot;Flowering
Tobacco,&quot; which, like the yellow primrose, are particularly fragrant
at sunset. Geraniums of every hue, silver-leaved and rose-scented;
yellow marigolds and those with brown, velvety petals; near by the
pale green and white-mottled leaves of the plant called &quot;Snow on the
Mountain&quot; and in the centre of one of the large, round flower beds,
grew sturdy &quot;Castor Oil Beans,&quot; their large, copper-bronze leaves
almost covering the tiny blue forget-me-nots growing beneath. Near the
flower bed grew a thrifty bush of pink-flowering almonds; not far
distant grew a spreading &quot;shrub&quot; bush, covered with fragrant brown
buds, and beside it a small tree of pearly-white snowdrops.</p>

<p>Sarah Landis loved the wholesome, earthy odors of growing plants and
delighted in her flowers, particularly the perennials, which were
planted promiscuously all over the yard. I have frequently heard her
quote: &quot;One is nearer God's heart in a garden than any place else on
earth.&quot; And she would say, &quot;I love the out-of-door life, in touch with
the earth; the natural life of man or woman.&quot; Inside the fence of the
kitchen garden were planted straight rows of both red and yellow
currants, and several gooseberry bushes. In one corner of the garden,
near the summer kitchen, stood a large bush of black currants, from
the yellow, sweet-scented blossoms of which Aunt Sarah's bees, those
&quot;<a name='Page_26'></a>Heaven instructed mathematicians,&quot; sucked honey. Think of Aunt
Sarah's buckwheat cakes, eaten with honey made from currant, clover,
buckwheat and dandelion blossoms!</p>

<p>Her garden was second to none in Bucks County. She planted tomato
seeds in boxes and placed them in a sunny window, raising her plants
early; hence she had ripe tomatoes before any one else in the
neighborhood. Her peas were earlier also, and her beets and potatoes
were the largest; her corn the sweetest; and, as her asparagus bed was
always well salted, her asparagus was the finest to be had.</p>

<p>Through the centre of the garden patch, on either side the walk, were
large flower beds, a blaze of brilliant color from early Spring, when
the daffodils blossomed, until frost killed the dahlias, asters,
scarlet sage, sweet Williams, Canterbury bells, pink and white
snapdragon, spikes of perennial, fragrant, white heliotrope; blue
larkspur, four o'clocks, bachelor buttons and many other dear,
old-fashioned flowers. The dainty pink, funnel-shaped blossoms of the
hardy swamp &quot;Rose Mallow'&quot; bloomed the entire Summer, the last flowers
to be touched by frost, vying in beauty with the pink monthly roses
planted near by.</p>

<p>Children who visited Aunt Sarah delighted in the small Jerusalem
cherry tree, usually covered with bright, scarlet berries, which was
planted near the veranda, and they never tired pinching the tiny
leaves of the sensitive plant to see them quickly droop, as if dead,
then slowly unfold and straighten as if a thing of life.</p>

<p>Visitors to the farm greatly admired the large, creamy-white lily-like
blossoms of the datura. Farthest from the house were the useful herb
beds, filled with parsley, hoarhound, sweet marjoram, lavender,
saffron, sage, sweet basil, summer savory and silver-striped rosemary
or &quot;old man,&quot; as it was commonly called by country folk.</p>

<p>Tall clusters of phlox, a riot of color in midsummer, crimson-eyed,
white and rose-colored blossoms topping the tall steins, and clusters
of brilliant-red bergamot near by had been growing, from time
immemorial, a cluster of green and white-striped grass, without which
no door yard in this section of Bucks County was considered complete
in olden times. Near by, silvery plumes of pampas grass gently swayed
on their reed-like stems. Even the garden was not without splashes of
color, where, between rows of vegetables, grew pale, pink-petaled
poppies, seeming to have <a name='Page_27'></a>scarcely a foothold in the rich soil. But
the daintiest, sweetest bed of all, and the one that Mary enjoyed
most, was where the lilies of the valley grew in the shade near a
large, white lilac bush. Here, on a rustic bench beneath an old apple
tree, stitching on her embroidery, she dreamed happy dreams of her
absent lover, and planned for the life they were to live together some
day, in the home he was striving to earn for her by his own manly
exertions; and she assiduously studied and pondered over Aunt Sarah's
teaching and counsel, knowing them to be wise and good.</p>

<p>A short distance from the farm house, where the old orchard sloped
down to the edge of the brook, grew tall meadow rue, with feathery
clusters of green and white flowers; and the green, gold-lined,
bowl-shaped blossoms of the &quot;Cow Lily,&quot; homely stepsisters of the
fragrant, white pond lily, surrounded by thick, waxy, green leaves,
lazily floated on the surface of the water from long stems in the bed
of the creek, and on the bank a carpet was formed by golden-yellow,
creeping buttercups.</p>

<p>In the side yard grew two great clumps of iris, or, as it is more
commonly called, &quot;Blue Flag.&quot; Its blossoms, dainty as rare orchids,
with lily-like, violet-veined petals of palest-tinted mauve and
purple.</p>

<p>On the sunny side of the old farm house, facing the East, where at
early morn the sun shone bright and warm, grew Aunt Sarah's pansies,
with velvety, red-brown petals, golden-yellow and dark purple. They
were truly &quot;Heart's Ease,&quot; gathered with a lavish hand, and sent as
gifts to friends who were ill. The more she picked the faster they
multiplied, and came to many a sick bed &quot;sweet messengers of Spring.&quot;</p>

<p>If Aunt Sarah had a preference for one particular flower, 'twas the
rose, and they well repaid the time and care she lavished on them. She
had pale-tinted blush roses, with hearts of deepest pink; rockland and
prairie and hundred-leaf roses, pink and crimson ramblers, but the
most highly-prized roses of her collection were an exquisite, deep
salmon-colored &quot;Marquis De Sinety&quot; and an old-fashioned pink moss
rose, which grew beside a large bush of mock-orange, the creamy
blossoms of the latter almost as fragrant as real orange blossoms of
the sunny Southland. Not far distant, planted in a small bed by
themselves, grew old-fashioned, sweet-scented, double petunias,
ragged, ripple, ruffled corollas of white, with splotches of brilliant
crimson and purple, <a name='Page_28'></a>their slender stems scarcely strong enough to
support the heavy blossoms.</p>

<p>In one of the sunniest spots in the old garden grew Aunt Sarah's
latest acquisition. &quot;The Butterfly Bush,&quot; probably so named on account
of its graceful stems, covered with spikes of tiny, lilac-colored
blossoms, over which continually hovered large, gorgeously-hued
butterflies, vying with the flowers in brilliancy of color, from early
June until late Summer.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's sunflowers, or &quot;Sonnen Blume,&quot; as she liked to call them,
planted along the garden fence to feed chickens and birds alike, were
a sight worth seeing. The birds generally confiscated the larger
portion of seeds. A pretty sight it was to see a flock of wild
canaries, almost covering the tops of the largest sunflowers, busily
engaged picking out the rich, oily seeds.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah loved the golden flowers, which always appeared to be
nodding to the sun, and her sunflowers were particularly fine, some
being as much as fifty inches in circumference.</p>

<p>A bouquet of the smaller ones was usually to be seen in a quaint, old,
blue-flowered, gray jar on the farm house veranda in Summertime.
Earlier in the season blossoms of the humble artichoke, which greatly
resemble small sunflowers, or large yellow daisies, filled the jar.
Failing either of these, she gathered large bouquets of golden-rod or
wild carrot blossoms, both of which grew in profusion along the
country lanes and roadside near the farm. But the old gray jar never
held a bouquet more beautiful than the one of bright, blue &quot;fringed
gentians,&quot; gathered by Aunt Sarah in the Fall of the year, several
miles distant from the farm.</p>

<h3>MARY CONFIDES IN AUNT SARAH AND GIVES HER VIEWS ON SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN.</h3>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;There's no deny'n women are foolish,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>God A'mighty made them to match the men.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />

<p>A short time after her arrival at the farm Mary poured into the
sympathetic ear of Aunt Sarah her hopes and plans. Her lover, Ralph
Jackson, to whom she had become engaged the past Winter, held a
position with the Philadelphia Electric Company, and was studying hard
outside working hours. His ambition was to become an electrical
engineer. He was getting fair wages, and wished Mary to marry him at
once. She confessed she loved Ralph too well to marry him, ignorant as
she was of economical housekeeping and cooking.</p>

<p>Mary, early left an orphan, had studied diligently to fit herself for
a kindergarten teacher, so she would be capable of earning her own
living on leaving school, which accounted for her lack of knowledge of
housework, cooking, etc.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah, loving Mary devotedly, and knowing the young man of her
choice to be clean, honest and worthy, promised to do all in her power
to make their dream of happiness come true. Learning from Mary that
Ralph was thin and pale from close confinement, hard work and study,
and of his intention of taking a short vacation, she determined he
should spend it on the farm, where she would be able to &quot;mother him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You acted sensibly, Mary,&quot; said her Aunt, &quot;in refusing to marry Ralph
at the present time, realizing your lack of knowledge of housework and
inability to manage a home. Neither would you know how to spend the
money provided by him economically and wisely, and, in this age of
individual efficiency, a business knowledge of housekeeping is almost
as important in making a happy home as is love. I think it quite as
necessary that a woman who marries should understand housekeeping in
all its varied branches <a name='Page_30'></a>as that the man who marries should understand
his trade or profession; for, without the knowledge of means to gain a
livelihood (however great his love for a woman), how is the man to
hold that woman's love and affection unless he is able by his own
exertions to provide her with necessities, comforts, and, perhaps, in
later years, luxuries? And in return, the wife should consider it her
duty and pleasure to know how to do her work systematically; learn the
value of different foods and apply the knowledge gained daily in
preparing them; study to keep her husband in the best of health,
physically and mentally. Then will his efficiency be greater and he
will be enabled to do his 'splendid best' in whatever position in life
he is placed, be he statesman or hod-carrier. What difference, if an
honest heart beat beneath a laborer's hickory shirt, or one of fine
linen? 'One hand, if it's true, is as good as another, no matter how
brawny or rough.' Mary, do not think the trivial affairs of the home
beneath your notice, and do not imagine any work degrading which tends
to the betterment of the home. Remember, 'Who sweeps a room as for Thy
law, makes that and the action fine.'</p>

<p>&quot;Our lives are all made up of such small, commonplace things and this
is such a commonplace old world, Mary. 'The commonplace earth and the
commonplace sky make up the commonplace day,' and 'God must have loved
common people, or He would not have made so many of them.' And, what
if we are commonplace? We cannot all be artists, poets and sculptors.
Yet, how frequently we see people in commonplace surroundings,
possessing the soul of an artist, handicapped by physical disability
or lack of means! We are all necessary in the great, eternal plan.
'Tis not good deeds alone for which we receive our reward, but for the
performance of duty well done, in however humble circumstances our lot
is cast. Is it not Lord Houghton who says: 'Do not grasp at the stars,
but do life's plain, common work as it comes, certain that daily
duties and daily bread are the sweetest things of life.' I consider a
happy home in the true sense of the word one of the greatest of
blessings. How important is the work of the housemother and homemaker
who creates the home! There can be no happiness there unless the
wheels of the domestic machinery are oiled by loving care and kindness
to make them run smoothly, and the noblest work a woman can do is
training and rearing her children. Suffrage, the right of woman to
vote; will it not take <a name='Page_31'></a>women from the home? I am afraid the home will
then suffer in consequence. Will man accord woman the same reverence
she has received in the past? Should she have equal political rights?
A race lacking respect for women would never advance socially or
politically. I think women could not have a more important part in the
government of the land than in rearing and educating their children to
be good, useful citizens. In what nobler work could women engage than
in work to promote the comfort and well-being of the ones they love in
the home? I say, allow men to make the laws, as God and nature
planned. I think women should keep to the sphere God made them
for&mdash;the home. Said Gladstone, 'Woman is the most perfect when most
womanly.' There is nothing, I think, more despicable than a masculine,
mannish woman, unless it be an effeminate, sissy man. Dr. Clarke
voiced my sentiments when he said: 'Man is not superior to woman, nor
woman to man. The relation of the sexes is one of equality, not of
better or worse, of higher and lower. The loftiest ideal of humanity
demands that each shall be perfect in its kind and not be hindered in
its best work. The lily is not inferior to the rose, nor the oak
superior to the clover; yet the glory of the lily is one and the glory
of the oak is another, and the use of the oak is not the use of the
clover.'</p>

<p>&quot;This present-day generation demands of women greater efficiency in
the home than ever before. And Mary, many of the old-time industries
which I had been accustomed to as a girl have passed away. Electricity
and numerous labor-saving devices make household tasks easier,
eliminating some altogether. When housekeeping you will find time to
devote to many important questions of the day which we old-time
housekeepers never dreamed of having. Considerable thought should be
given to studying to improve and simplify conditions of the home-life.
It is your duty. Obtain books; study food values and provide those
foods which nourish the body, instead of spending time uselessly
preparing dainties to tempt a jaded appetite. Don't spoil Ralph when
you marry him. Give him good, wholesome food, and plenty of it; but
although the cooking of food takes up much of a housekeeper's time, it
is not wise to allow it to take up one's time to the exclusion of
everything else. Mary, perhaps my views are old-fashioned. I am not a
'new woman' in any sense of the word. The new woman may take her place
beside man in the business world and prove equally <a name='Page_32'></a>as efficient, but
I do not think woman should invade man's sphere any more than he
should assume her duties.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, I am surprised to hear you talk in that manner about
woman's sphere,&quot; replied Mary, &quot;knowing what a success you are in the
home, and how beautifully you manage everything you undertake. I felt,
once you recognized the injustice done woman in not allowing them to
vote, you would feel differently, and since women are obliged to obey
the laws, should they not have a voice in choosing the lawmakers? When
you vote, it will not take you out of the home. You and Uncle John
will merely stop on your way to the store, and instead of Uncle John
going in to write and register what he thinks should be done and by
whom it should be done, you too will express your opinion. This will
likely be twice a year. By doing this, no woman loses her womanliness,
goodness or social position, and to these influences the vote is but
another influence. I know there are many things in connection with the
right of equal suffrage with what you do not sympathize.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, let me tell you about a dear friend of mine who taught
school with me in the city. Emily taught a grammar grade, and did not
get the same salary the men teachers received for doing the same work,
which I think was unfair. Emily studied and frequently heard and read
about what had been done in Colorado and other States where women
vote. She got us all interested, and the more we learned about the
cause the harder we worked for it. Emily married a nice, big, railroad
man. They bought a pretty little house in a small town, had three
lovely children and were very happy. More than ever as time passed
Emily realized the need of woman's influence in the community. It is
true, I'll admit, Aunt Sarah, housekeeping and especially home-making
are the great duties of every woman, and to provide the most
wholesome, nourishing food possible for the family is the duty of
every mother, as the health, comfort and happiness of the family
depend so largely on the <i>common sense</i> (only another name for
efficiency) and skill of the homemaker, and the wise care and though
she expends on the preparation of wholesome, nutritious food in the
home, either the work of her own hands or prepared under her
direction. You can <i>not</i> look after these duties without getting
<i>outside</i> of your home, especially when you live like Emily, in a
town where the conditions are so different from living as you <a name='Page_33'></a>do on a
farm in the country. Milk, bread and water are no longer controlled by
the woman in her home, living in cities and towns; and just because
women want to look out for their families they should have a voice in
the larger problems of municipal housekeeping. To return to Emily, she
did not bake her own bread, as you do, neither did she keep a cow, but
bought milk and bread to feed the children. Wasn't it her duty to
leave the home and see where these products were produced, and if they
were sanitary? And, knowing the problem outside the home would so
materially affect the health, and perhaps lives, of her children, she
felt it her distinctive duty to keep house in a larger sense. When the
children became old enough to attend school, Emily again took up her
old interest in schools. She began to realize how much more just it
would be if an equal number of women were on the school board.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what did the husband think of all this?&quot; inquired Aunt Sarah,
dubiously.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Tom studied the case, too, at first just to tease Emily, but he
soon became as enthusiastic as Emily. He said, 'The first time you are
privileged to vote, Emily, I will hire an automobile to take you to
the polls in style.' But poor Emily was left alone with her children
last winter. Tom died of typhoid fever. Contracted it from the bad
drainage. They lived in a town not yet safeguarded with sewerage. Now
Emily is a taxpayer as well as a mother, and she has no say as far as
the town and schools are concerned. There are many cases like that,
where widows and unmarried women own property, and they are in no way
represented. And think of the thousands and thousands of women who
have no home to stay in and no babies to look after.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mercy, Mary! Do stop to take breath. I never thought when I started
this subject I would have an enthusiastic suffragist with whom to
deal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad you started the subject, Aunt Sarah, because there is so
much to be said for the cause. I saw you glance at the clock and I see
it is time to prepare supper. But some day I'm going to stop that old
clock and bring down some of my books on 'Woman's Suffrage' and you'll
he surprised to hear what they have done in States where equal
privileges were theirs. I am sure 'twill not be many years before
every State in the Union will give women the right of suffrage.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><a name='Page_34'></a>After Mary retired that evening Aunt Sarah had a talk with her John,
whom she knew needed help on the farm. As a result of the conference,
Mary wrote to Ralph the following day, asking him to spend his
vacation on the farm as a &quot;farm hand.&quot; Needless to say, the offer was
gladly accepted by Ralph, if for no other reason than to be near the
girl he loved.</p>

<p>Ralph came the following week&mdash;&quot;a strapping big fellow,&quot; to quote
Uncle John, being several inches over six feet.</p>

<p>&quot;All you need, young chap,&quot; said Mary's Uncle, &quot;is plenty of good,
wholesome food of Sarah's and Mary's preparing, and I'll see that you
get plenty of exercise in the fresh air to give you an appetite to
enjoy it, and you'll get a healthy coat of tan on your pale cheeks
before the Summer is ended.&quot;</p>

<p>Ralph Jackson, or &quot;Jack,&quot; as he was usually called by his friends, an
orphan like Mary, came of good, old Quaker stock, his mother having
died immediately after giving birth to her son. His father, supposed
to be a wealthy contractor, died when Ralph was seventeen, having lost
his fortune through no fault of his own, leaving Ralph penniless.</p>

<p>Ralph Jackson possessed a good face, a square, determined jaw, sure
sign of a strong will and quick temper; these Berserker traits he
inherited from his father; rather unusual in a Quaker. He possessed a
head of thick, coarse, straight brown hair, and big honest eyes. One
never doubted his word, once it had been given. 'Twas good as his
bond. This trait he inherited also from his father, noted for his
truth and integrity. Ralph was generous to a fault. When a small boy
he was known to take off his shoes and give them to a poor little
Italian (who played a violin on the street for pennies) and go home
barefoot.</p>

<p>Ralph loved Mary devotedly, not only because she fed him well at the
farm, as were his forefathers, the &quot;Cave Men,&quot; fed by their mates in
years gone by, but he loved her first for her sweetness of disposition
and lovable ways; later, for her quiet unselfishness and lack of
temper over trifles&mdash;so different from himself.</p>

<p>When speaking to Mary of his other fine qualities, Aunt Sarah said:
&quot;Ralph is a manly young fellow; likeable, I'll admit, but his hasty
temper is a grave fault in my eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary replied, &quot;Don't you think men are very queer, anyway, Aunt Sarah?
I do, and none of us is perfect.&quot;</p>

<img src='images/047.jpg' width='521' height='748' alt='RALPH JACKSON' title=''>
</center>

<p><a name='Page_35'></a>To Mary, Ralph's principal charm lay in his strong, forceful way of
surmounting difficulties, she having a disposition so different. Mary
had a sweet, motherly way, seldom met with in so young a girl, and
this appealed to Ralph, he having never known &quot;mother love,&quot; and
although not at all inclined to be sentimental, he always called Mary
his &quot;Little Mother Girl&quot; because of her motherly ways.</p>

</center>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued Mary's Aunt, &quot;a quick temper is one of the most
difficult faults to overcome that flesh is heir to, but Ralph, being a
young man of uncommon good sense, may in time curb his temper and
learn to control it, knowing that unless be does so it will handicap
him in his career. Still, a young girl will overlook many faults in
the man she loves. Mary, ere marrying, one should be sure that no love
be lacking to those entering these sacred bonds. 'Tis not for a day,
but for a lifetime, to the right thinking. Marriage, as a rule, is too
lightly entered into in this Twentieth Century of easy divorces, and
but few regard matrimony in its true holy relation, ordained by our
Creator. If it be founded on the tower of enduring love and not
ephemeral passion, it is unassailable, lasting in faith and honor
until death breaks the sacred union and annuls the vows pledged at
God's holy altar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied Mary, as her Aunt paused to take breath, &quot;I am sure of
my love for Ralph.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_36'></a>God grant you may both be happy,&quot; responded her Aunt.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, did you ever hear this Persian proverb? You will understand why
I have so much to say after hearing it.&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;'Says a proverb of Persia provoking mirth;<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>When this world was created by order divine.<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Ten measures of talk were put down on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>And the woman took nine.'&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Speaking to Mary of life on the farm one day, Ralph laughingly said:
&quot;I am taught something new every day. Yesterday your Uncle told me it
was 'time to plant corn when oak leaves were large as squirrels'
ears.'&quot; Ralph worked like a Trojan. In a short time both his hands and
face took on a butternut hue. He became strong and robust. Mary called
him her &quot;Cave Man,&quot; and it taxed the combined efforts of Aunt Sarah
and Mary to provide food to satisfy the ravenous appetite Mary's &quot;Cave
Man&quot; developed. And often, after a busy day, tired but happy, Mary
fell asleep at night to the whispering of the leaves of the Carolina
poplar outside her bedroom window.</p>

<p>But country life on a farm has its diversions. One of Mary's and
Ralph's greatest pleasures after a busy day at the farm was a drive
about the surrounding country early Summer evenings, frequently
accompanied by either Elizabeth or Pauline Schmidt, their nearest
neighbors.</p>

<p>One of the first places visited by them was a freak of nature called
&quot;Rocky Valley,&quot; situated at no great distance from the farm.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VII'></a><h2><a name='Page_37'></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>PROFESSOR SCHMIDT.</h3>
<br />

<p>A small country place named &quot;Five Oaks,&quot; a short distance from &quot;Clear
Spring&quot; farm, was owned by a very worthy and highly-educated, but
rather eccentric, German professor. He came originally from
Heidelberg, but had occupied the position of Professor of German for
many years in a noted university in a near by town. A kind,
warm-hearted, old-fashioned gentleman was the Professor; a perfect
Lord Chesterfield in manners. Very tall, thin almost to emaciation,
although possessed of excellent health; refined, scholarly looking: a
rather long, hooked nose, faded, pale-blue eyes; snowy, flowing &quot;Lord
Dundreary&quot; whiskers, usually parted in the centre and twisted to a
point on either side with the exceedingly long, bony fingers of his
well-kept, aristocratic-looking white hands. He had an abrupt, quick,
nervous manner when speaking. A fringe of thin, white hair showed at
the lower edge of the black silk skull cap which he invariably wore
about home, and in the absence of this covering for his bald head, he
would not have looked natural to his friends.</p>

<p>The Professor always wore a suit of well-brushed, &quot;shiny&quot; black
broadcloth, and for comfort old-fashioned soft kid &quot;gaiters,&quot; with
elastic in the sides. He was a man with whom one did not easily become
acquainted, having very decided opinions on most subjects. He
possessed exquisite taste, a passionate love of music, flowers and all
things beautiful; rather visionary, poetical and a dreamer; he was not
practical, like his wife; warm-hearted, impulsive, energetic Frau
Schmidt, who was noted for her executive abilities. I can imagine the
old Professor saying as Mohammed has been quoted as saying, &quot;Had I two
loaves, I would sell one and buy hyacinths to feed my soul.&quot;
Impulsive, generous to a fault, quick to take offense, withal
warm-hearted, kind and loyal to his friends, he was beloved by the
students, who declared that &quot;Old Snitzy&quot; always played fair when he
was obliged to reprimand them for their numerous pranks, which ended
sometimes, I am <a name='Page_38'></a>obliged to confess, with disastrous results. The
dignified old Professor would have raised his mild, blue, spectacled
eyes in astonishment had he been so unfortunate as to have overheard
the boys, to whom he was greatly attached, call their dignified
preceptor by such a nickname.</p>

<p>The Professor's little black-eyed German wife, many years younger than
her husband, had been, before her marriage, teacher of domestic
science in a female college in a large city. &quot;She was a most excellent
housekeeper,&quot; to quote the Professor, and &quot;a good wife and mother.&quot;</p>

<p>The family consisted of &quot;Fritz,&quot; a boy of sixteen, with big, innocent,
baby-blue eyes like his father, who idolized his only son, who was
alike a joy and a torment. Fritz attended the university in a near-by
town, and was usually head of the football team. He was always at the
front in any mischief whatever, was noted for getting into scrapes
innumerable through his love of fun, yet he possessed such a
good-natured, unselfish, happy-go-lucky disposition that one always
forgave him.</p>

<p>Black-eyed, red-cheeked Elizabeth was quick and impulsive, like her
mother. A very warm and lasting friendship sprung up between merry
Elizabeth and serious Mary Midleton during Mary's Summer on the farm,
although not at all alike in either looks or disposition, and
Elizabeth was Mary's junior by several years.</p>

<p>The third, last and least of the Professor's children was Pauline, or
&quot;Pollykins,&quot; as she was always called by her brother Fritz, the
seven-year-old pet and baby of the family. A second edition of Fritz,
the same innocent, questioning, violet-blue eyes, fair complexion, a
kissable little mouth and yellow, kinky hair, she won her way into
every one's heart and became greatly attached to Mary, who was usually
more patient with the little maid (who, I must confess, was sometimes
very willful) than was her sister Elizabeth. Mary, who had never been
blessed with a sister, dearly loved children, and thought small
&quot;Polly&quot; adorable, and never wearied telling her marvelous fairy tales.</p>

<h3>USES OF AN OLD-FASHIONED WARDROBE.</h3>
<br />

<p>Shortly after Mary's advent at the farm she one day said: &quot;Aunt Sarah,
the contents of this old trunk are absolutely worthless to me; perhaps
they may be used by you for carpet rags.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mary Midleton!&quot; exclaimed Aunt Sarah, in horrified tones, &quot;you
extravagant girl. I see greater possibilities in that trunk of
partly-worn clothing than, I suppose, a less economically-inclined
woman than I ever would have dreamed of.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary handed her Aunt two blue seersucker dresses, one plain, the other
striped. &quot;They have both shrunken, and are entirely too small for me,&quot;
said Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said her Aunt, considering, &quot;they might be combined in one
dress, but you need aprons for kitchen work more useful than those
little frilly, embroidered affairs you are wearing. We should make
them into serviceable aprons to protect your dresses. Mary, neatness
is an attribute that every self-respecting housewife should
assiduously cultivate, and no one can be neat in a kitchen without a
suitable apron to protect one from grime, flour and dust.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a pretty challis dress; its cream-colored ground sprinkled over
with pink rose buds!&quot;</p>

<p>Mary sighed. &quot;I always did love that dress, Aunt Sarah, 'Twas so
becoming, and he&mdash;he&mdash;admired it so!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And HE, can do so still,&quot; replied Aunt Sarah, with a merry twinkle in
her kind, clear, gray eyes, &quot;for that pale-green suesine skirt,
slightly faded, will make an excellent lining, with cotton for an
interlining, and pale green Germantown yarn with which to tie the
comfortable. At small cost you'll have a dainty, warm spread which
will be extremely pretty in the home you are planning with HIM. I have
several very pretty-old-style patchwork quilts in a box in the attic
which I shall give you when you start housekeeping. That pretty
dotted, ungored Swiss skirt will make dainty, ruffled sash curtains
for bedroom windows. Mary, sometimes <a name='Page_40'></a>small beginnings make great
endings; if you make the best of your small belongings, some day your
homely surroundings will be metamorphosed into what, in your present
circumstances, would seem like extravagant luxuries. An economical
young couple, beginning life with a homely, home-made rag carpet, have
achieved in middle age, by their own energy and industry, carpets of
tapestry and rich velvet, and costly furniture in keeping; but,
never&mdash;never, dear, are they so valued, I assure you, as those
inexpensive articles, conceived by our inventive brain and
manufactured by our own deft fingers during our happy Springtime of
life when, with our young lover husband, we built our home nest on the
foundation of pure, unselfish, self-sacrificing love.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah sighed; memory led her far back to when she had planned her
home with her lover, John Landis, still her lover, though both have
grown gray together, and shared alike the joys and sorrows of the
passing years. Aunt Sarah had always been the perfect &quot;housemother&quot; or
&quot;Haus Frau,&quot; as the Germans phrase it, and on every line of her
matured face could be read an anxious care for the family welfare.
Truly could it be said of her, in the language of Henry Ward Beecher:
&quot;Whoever makes home seem to the young dearer and happier is a public
benefactor.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah said earnestly to Mary, &quot;I wish it were possible for me to
impart to young, inexperienced girls, about to become housewives and
housemothers, a knowledge of those small economics, so necessary to
health and prosperity, taught me by many years of hard work, mental
travail, experience and some failures. In this extravagant Twentieth
Century economy is more imperative than formerly. We feel that we need
so much more these days than our grandmothers needed; and what we
need, or feel that we need, is so costly. The housemother has larger
problems today than yesterday.</p>

<p>&quot;Every husband should give his wife an allowance according to his
income, so that she will be able to systematize her buying and
occasionally obtain imperishable goods at less cost. Being encouraged
thus to use her dormant economical powers; she will become a powerful
factor in the problem of home-making along lines that will essentially
aid her husband in acquiring a comfortable competency, if not a
fortune. Then she will have her husband's interest truly at heart;
will study to spend his money carefully, and to the best advantage;
and she herself, even, will <a name='Page_41'></a>be surprised at the many economies which
will suggest themselves to save his hard-earned money when she handles
that money herself, which certainly teaches her the saving habit and
the value of money.</p>

<p>&quot;The majority of housewives of today aren't naturally inclined to be
extravagant or careless. It is rather that they lack the knowledge and
experience of spending money, and spending it to the best advantage
for themselves and their household needs.</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis a compulsory law in England, I have heard, to allow a wife pin
money, according to a man's means. 'Tis a most wise law. To a loyal
wife and mother it gives added force, dignity and usefulness to have a
sufficient allowance and to be allowed unquestioningly to spend that
money to her best ability. Her husband, be he a working or
professional man, would find it greatly to his advantage in the home
as well as in his business and less of a drain on his bank account
should he give his wife a suitable allowance and trust her to spend it
according to her own intelligence and thrift.</p>

<p>&quot;Child, many a man is violently prejudiced against giving a young wife
money; many allow her to run up bills, to her hurt and to his, rather
than have her, even in her household expenditure, independent of his
supervision. I sincerely hope, dear, that your intended, Ralph
Jackson, will be superior to this male idiosyncrasy, to term it
mildly, and allow you a stated sum monthly. The home is the woman's
kingdom, and she should be allowed to think for it, to buy for it, and
not to be cramped by lack of money to do as she thinks best for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Aunt Sarah, some housewives are so silly that husbands cannot
really be blamed for withholding money from them and preventing them
from frittering it away in useless extravagance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, wise wives should not suffer for those who are silly and
extravagant. I don't like to be sarcastic, but with the majority of
the men, silliness appeals to them more than common sense. Men like to
feel their superiority to us. However, though inexperienced, Mary, you
aren't silly or extravagant, and Ralph could safely trust you with his
money. It makes a woman so self-respecting, puts her on her mettle, to
have money to do as she pleases with, to be trusted, relied upon as a
reasoning, responsible being. A man, especially a young husband, makes
a grave mistake <a name='Page_42'></a>when he looks upon his wife as only a toy to amuse
him in his leisure moments and not as one to be trusted to aid him in
his life work. A trusted young housewife, with a reasonable and
regular allowance at her command, be she ever so inexperienced, will
soon plan to have wholesome, nutritious food at little cost, instead
of not knowing until a half hour before meal time what she will serve.
She would save money and the family would be better nourished;
nevertheless, I would impress it on the young housewife not to be too
saving or practice too close economy, especially when buying milk and
eggs, as there is nothing more nutritious or valuable. A palatable
macaroni and cheese; eggs or a combination of eggs and milk, are
dishes which may be substituted occasionally, at less expense, for
meat. A pound of macaroni and cheese equals a pound of steak in food
value. Take time and trouble to see that all food be well cooked and
served, both in an attractive and appetizing manner. Buy the cheaper
cuts of stewing meats, and by long, slow simmering, they will become
sweet and tender and of equal nutritive value as higher priced
sirloins and tenderloins.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Mary, I've not yet finished that trunk and its contents. That
slightly-faded pink chambray I'll cut up into quilt blocks. Made up
with white patches, and quilted nicely, a pretty quilt lined with
white, will be evolved. I have such a pretty design of pink and white
called the 'Winding Way,' very simple to make. The beauty of the quilt
consists altogether in the manner in which the blocks are put
together, or it might be made over the pattern called 'The Flying
Dutchman.' From that tan linen skirt may be made a laundry bag, shoe
pocket, twine bag, a collar bag and a table runner, the only expense
being several skeins of green embroidery silk, and a couple yards of
green cord to draw the bags up with, and a couple of the same-hued
skirt braids for binding edges, and,&quot; teasingly, &quot;Mary, you might
embroider Ralph Jackson's initials on the collar and laundry bag.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary blushed rosily red and exclaimed in an embarrassed manner, most
bewitchingly, &quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah laughed. She thought to have Mary look that way 'twas worth
teasing her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mary, we can in leisure moments, from that coarse, white linen
skirt which you have discarded, make bureau scarfs, sideboard cover,
or a set of scalloped table mats to place under hot dishes on your
dining-room table. I will give you pieces of <a name='Page_43'></a>asbestos to slip between
the linen mats when finished. They are a great protection to the
table. You could also make several small guest towels with deep,
hemstitched ends with your initials on. You embroider so beautifully,
and the drawn work you do is done as expertly as that of the Mexican
women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Sarah, how ingenious you are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And, Mary, your rag carpet shall not be lacking. We shall tear up
those partly-worn muslin skirts into strips one-half inch in width,
and use the dyes left over from dyeing Easter eggs. I always save the
dye for this purpose, they come in such pretty, bright colors. The
rags, when sewed together with some I have in the attic, we'll have
woven into a useful carpet for the home you are planning.'</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Aunt Sarah,&quot; exclaimed Mary, &quot;do you mean a carpet like the one
in the spare bedroom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear, exactly like that, if you wish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed I do, and I think one like that quite good enough to have in a
dining-room. I think it so pretty. It does not look at all like a
common rag carpet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, my dear, it is nothing very uncommon. It is all in the way it is
woven. Instead of having two gay rainbow stripes about three inches
wide running through the length of the carpet, I had it woven with the
ground work white and brown chain to form checks. Then about an inch
apart were placed two threads of two shades of red woolen warp,
alternating with two threads of two shades of green, across the whole
width, running the length of the carpet. It has been greatly admired,
as it is rather different from that usually woven. All the rag carpets
I found in the house when we moved here, made by John's mother,
possessed very wide stripes of rainbow colors, composed of shaded
reds, yellows, blues and greens. You can imagine how very gorgeous
they were, and so very heavy. Many of the country weavers use linen
chain or warp instead of cotton, and always use wool warp for the
stripes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, I want something so very much for the Colonial bedroom I
should like to have when I have a home of my very own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, dear? Anything, e'en to the half of my kingdom,&quot;
laughingly replied her Aunt.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I'd love to have several rag rugs like those in your bedroom,
which you call 'New Colonial' rugs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_44'></a>Certainly, my dear. They are easily made from carpet rags. I have
already planned in my mind a pretty rag rug for you, to be made from
your old, garnet merino shirtwaist, combined with your discarded
cravenette stormcoat.</p>

<p>&quot;And you'll need some pretty quilts, also,&quot; said her Aunt.</p>

<p>&quot;I particularly admire the tree quilts,&quot; said Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;You may have any one you choose; the one called 'Tree of Paradise,'
another called 'Pineapple Design,' which was originally a border to
'Fleur de lis' quilt or 'Pine Tree,' and still another called 'Tree of
Life,' and 'The Lost Rose in the Wilderness.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are all so odd,&quot; said Mary, &quot;I scarcely know which one I think
prettiest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All are old-fashioned quilts, which I prize highly,&quot; continued her
Aunt. &quot;Several I pieced together when a small girl, I think old-time
patchwork too pretty and useful an accomplishment to have gone out of
fashion.</p>

<p>&quot;You shall have a small stand cover like the one you admired so
greatly, given me by Aunt Cornelia. It is very simple, the materials
required being a square of yard-wide unbleached muslin. In the centre
of this baste a large, blue-flowered handkerchief with cream-colored
ground, to match the muslin. Turn up a deep hem all around outside
edge; cut out quarter circles of the handkerchief at each of four
corners; baste neatly upon the muslin, leaving a space of muslin the
same width as the hem around each quarter circle; briarstitch all
turned-in edges with dark-blue embroidery silk, being washable, these
do nicely as covers for small tables or stands on the veranda in
Summertime.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; ecstatically exclaimed Mary, &quot;you are a wizard to plan
so many useful things from a trunk of apparently useless rags. What a
treasure Uncle has in you. I was fretting about having so little to
make my home attractive, but I feel quite elated at the thought of
having a carpet and rugs already planned, besides the numerous other
things evolved from your fertile brain.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah loved a joke. She held up an old broadcloth cape. &quot;Here is
a fine patch for Ralph Jackson's breeches, should he ever become
sedentary and need one.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary reddened and looked almost offended and was at a loss for a
reply.</p>

<p>Greatly amused, Aunt Sarah quoted ex-President Roosevelt: &quot;<a name='Page_45'></a>'Tis time
for the man with the patch to come forward and the man with the dollar
to step back,'&quot; and added, &quot;Never mind, Mary, your Ralph is such an
industrious, hustling young man that he will never need a patch to
step forward, I prophesy that with such a helpmeet and 'Haus Frau' as
you, Mary, he'll always be most prosperous and happy. Kiss me, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary did so, and her radiant smile at such praise from her honored
relative was beautiful to behold.</p>

<h3>POETRY AND PIE.</h3>
<br />

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; questioned Mary one day, &quot;do you mind if I copy some of
your recipes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not, my dear,&quot; replied her Aunt.</p>

<p>&quot;And I'd like to copy some of the poems, also, I never saw any one
else have so much poetry in a book of cooking recipes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;but you know, Mary, I believe in
combining pleasure with my work, and our lives are made up of poetry
and prose, and some lives are so very prosy. Many times when too tired
to look up a favorite volume of poems, it has rested me to turn the
pages of my recipe book and find some helpful thought, and a good
housewife will always keep her book of recipes where it may be readily
found for reference. I think, Mary, the poem 'Pennsylvania,' by Lydia
M.D. O'Neil, a fine one, and I never tire of reading it over and over
again. I have always felt grateful to my old schoolmaster. Professor
T&mdash;&mdash;, for teaching me, when a school girl, to love the writing of
Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant, Tennyson and other well-known poets. I
still, in memory, hear him repeat 'Thanatopsis,' by Bryant and 'The
Builders,' by Longfellow. The rhymes of the 'Fireside Poet' are easily
understood, and never fail to touch the heart of common folk. I know
it appears odd to see so many of my favorite poems sandwiched in
between old, valued cooking recipes, but, Mary, the happiness of the
home life depends so largely on the food we consume. On the
preparation and selection of the food we eat depends our health, and
on our health is largely dependent our happiness and prosperity. Who
is it has said, 'The discovery of a new dish makes more for the
happiness of man than the discovery of a star'? So, dearie, you see
there is not such a great difference between the one who writes a poem
and the one who makes a pie. I think cooking should be considered one
of the fine arts&mdash;and the woman who prepares a dainty, appetizing dish
of food, which appeals to the sense of taste, should be considered as
worthy of <a name='Page_47'></a>praise as the artist who paints a fine picture to gratify
our sense of sight. I try to mix all the poetry possible in prosaic
every-day life. We country farmers' wives, not having the
opportunities of our more fortunate city sisters, such as witnessing
plays from Shakespeare, listening to symphony concerts, etc., turn to
'The Friendship of Books,' of which Washington Irving writes: 'Cheer
us with the true friendship, which never deceived hope nor deserted
sorrow.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mary, &quot;but remember, Aunt Sarah, Chautauqua will be held
next Summer in a near-by town, and, as Uncle John is one of the
guarantors, you will wish to attend regularly and will, I know, enjoy
hearing the excellent lectures, music and concerts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yea,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;Chautauqua meetings will commence the latter
part of June, and I will expect you and Ralph to visit us then. I
think Chautauqua a godsend to country women, especially farmers'
wives; it takes them away from their monotonous daily toil and gives
them new thoughts and ideas.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can readily understand, Aunt Sarah, why the poem, 'Life's Common
Things,' appeals to you; it is because you see beauty in everything.
Aunt Sarah, where did you get this very old poem, 'The Deserted
City'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, that was given me by John's Uncle, who thought the poem fine.&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;Sad is the sight, the city once so fair!<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>An hundred palaces lie buried there;<br /></span>

<span class='i4'>&quot;Once in the gardens, lovely girls at play,<br /></span>

<span class='i6'>The smoke has ceased&mdash;the spider there has spread<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>His snares in safety&mdash;and all else is dead.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_48'></a>Indeed, it is a 'gem,'&quot; said Mary, after slowly reading aloud parts
of several stanzas.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;Professor Schmidt tells me the poem was
written by Kalidasa (the Shakespeare of Hindu literature), and was
written 1800 years before Goldsmith gave us his immortal work, 'The
Deserted Village.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I like the poem, 'Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel,'&quot; said Mary, &quot;and I
think this true by Henry Ward Beecher:&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;'Do not be troubled because you have not great virtues,<br /></span>

<span class='i4'>Only have enough of little virtues and common fidelities,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And you need not mourn because you are neither a hero nor a saint.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;This is a favorite little poem of mine, Aunt Sarah. I'll just write
it on this blank page in your book.&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

</div></div>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, I see there is still space on this page to write another

<h3>SIBYLLA LINSABIGLER.</h3>
<br />

<p>A very original character was Sibylla Linsabigler, who had been a
member of the Landis household several years. She was Aunt Sarah's
only maid servant, but she disliked being referred to as a servant,
and when she overheard &quot;Fritz&quot; Schmidt, as he passed the Landis farm
on his way to the creek for a days fishing, call to Mary: &quot;Miss
Midleton, will you please send the butter over with the servant today,
as I shall not return home in time for dinner&quot; Sibylla said, &quot;I ain't
no servant. I'm hired girl What does that make out if I do work here?
Pop got mad with me 'cause I wouldn't work at home no more for him and
Mom without they paid me. They got three more girls to home yet that
can do the work. My Pop owns a big farm and sent our 'Chon' to the
college, and it's mean 'fer' him not to give us girls money for dress,
so I work out, 'Taint right the way us people what has to work are
treated these days,&quot; said Sibylla to herself, as she applied the broom
vigorously to the gay-flowered carpet in the Landis parlor. &quot;Because
us folks got to work ain't no reason why them tony people over to the
Perfessor's should call me a 'servant.' I guess I know I milk the
cows, wash dishes, scrub floors, and do the washin' and ir'nin' every
week, but I'm no 'servant,' I'm just as good any day as that
good-fer-nothin' Perfesser's son,&quot; continued Sibylla, growing red in
the face with indignation. &quot;Didn't I hear that worthless scamp, Fritz
Schmidt, a-referrin' to me and a-sayin' to Miss Midleton fer the
'servant' to bring over the butter? Betch yer life this here 'servant'
ain't a-goin' to allow eddicated people to make a fool of her. First
chance I get I'll give that Perfesser a piece of my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Sibylla's opportunity came rather unexpectedly. The gentle,
mild-mannered Professor was on good terms with his sturdy, energetic
neighbor, John Landis, and frequently visited him for a neighborly
chat. On this particular day he called as usual and found Sibvlla in
the mood described.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_52'></a>Good afternoon, Sibylla,&quot; said the Professor, good-naturedly. &quot;How
are you today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd be a whole lot better if some people weren't so smart,&quot; replied
Sibylla, venting her feelings on the broom. &quot;Should think a Perfesser
would feel himself too big to talk to a 'servant'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the contrary, my dear girl, I feel honored. I presume you are not
feeling as well as usual. What makes you think it is condescension for
me to address you?&quot; asked the genial old man, kindly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, since you ask me, I don't mind a-tellin' you. Yesterday your
son insulted me, I won't take no insult from nobody, I am just as good
as what you are, even if I hain't got much book larnin'.&quot;</p>

<p>With this deliverance, Sibylla felt she had done full justice to the
occasion and would have closed the interview abruptly had not the
Professor, with a restraining hand, detained her.</p>

<p>&quot;We must get to the bottom of this grievance, Sibylla. I am sure there
is some mistake somewhere. What did my son say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you want to know,&quot; replied the irate domestic, 'I'll tell
you. He called me a 'servant.' I know I'm only a working girl, but
your son nor nobody else ain't got no right to abuse me by callin' me
a 'servant'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! I see. You object to the term 'servant' being applied to you,&quot;
said the Professor, comprehendingly. &quot;The word 'servant' is
distasteful to you. You feel it is a disgrace to be called a servant.
I see! I see!&quot; In a fatherly way, the old man resumed: &quot;In a certain
sense we are all servants. The history of human achievements is a
record of service. The men and women who have helped the world most
were all servants&mdash;servants to humanity. The happiest man is he who
serves. God calls some men to sow and some to reap; some to work in
wood and stone; to sing and speak. Work is honorable in all,
regardless of the capacity in which we serve. There is no great
difference, after all, between the ordinary laborer and the railroad
president; both are servants, and the standard of measurement to be
applied to each man is the same. It is not so much a question of
station in life as it is the question of efficiency. Best of all, work
is education. There is culture that comes without college and
university. He who graduates from the college of hard work is as
honorable as he who takes a degree at Yale or Harvard; for wisdom can
be <a name='Page_53'></a>found in shop and foundry, field and factory, in the kitchen amid
pots and kettles, as well as in office and school. The truly educated
man is the man who has learned the duty and responsibility of doing
something useful, something helpful, something to make this old world
of ours better and a happier place in which to live. The word
'servant,' Sibylla, is a beautiful one, rightly understood. The
greatest man who ever lived was a servant. All His earthly ministry
was filled with worthy deeds. When man pleaded with Him to rest, He
answered: 'My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.' When one of
Christ's followers desired to express the true nature of his work and
office, he called himself a servant. He used a word, 'doulos,' which
means, in the Greek language, a slave or a bond-servant. By the word
'doulos' he meant to say that his mission in life was to work, to do
good, to serve. This man was a great preacher, but it is possible for
any one to become a 'doulos' in so far as he is willing to serve God
and his fellowman. You see, Sibylla, the spirit of Christian work and
brotherly love is the spirit of 'doulos.' The word has been
transformed by service and unselfish devotion to duty. Great men who
have blessed the world, and good and noble women who have helped to
uplift humanity, have done it through service. It is just as honorable
to bake well, and cook well, and to do the humblest daily tasks
efficiently, as it is to play well on the piano and talk fluently
about the latest books.&quot;</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the Professor's little talk on the dignity of
labor, a new light shone in Sibylla's eyes and a new thought gripped
her soul. The spirit of &quot;doulos&quot; had displaced her antipathy toward
the word servant.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take that butter over to the Professer's home right away,&quot; she
said, to herself.</p>

<p>Before leaving Sibylla, the Professor quoted from the &quot;Toiling of
Felix,&quot; by Henry Vandyke:</p>

<div class='blkquot'><p>&quot;Hewing wood and drawing water, splitting stones and cleaving
     sod, All the dusty ranks of labour, in the regiment of God, March
     together toward His triumph, do the task His hands prepare;
     Honest toil is holy service, faithful work is praise and prayer.&quot;</p>

<p>     <a name='Page_54'></a>They who work without complaining, do the holy will of God.</p>

<p>     Heaven is blest with perfect rest, but the blessing of earth is
     toil. </p></div>

<p>Sibylla Linsabigler was a healthy, large-boned, solidly-built, typical
&quot;Pennsylvania German&quot; girl. Her clear, pinkish complexion looked as if
freshly scrubbed with soap and water. A few large, brown freckles
adorned the bridge of her rather broad, flat nose. She possessed red
hair and laughing, red-brown eyes, a large mouth, which disclosed
beautiful even, white teeth when she smiled, extraordinary large feet
and hands, strong, willing and usually good-natured, although
possessed of a quick temper, as her red hair indicated. Kind-hearted
to a fault, she was of great assistance to Aunt Sarah, although she
preferred any other work to that of cooking or baking. She kept the
kitchen as well as other parts of the house, to quote Aunt Sarah,
&quot;neat as a pin,&quot; and did not object to any work, however hard or
laborious, as long as she was not expected to do the thinking and
planning. She was greatly attached to both Aunt Sarah and Mary, but
stood rather in awe of John Landis, who had never spoken a cross word
to her in the three years she had lived at the farm.</p>

<p>Sarah Landis, knowing Sibylla to be an honest, industrious girl,
appreciated her good qualities, thought almost as much of Sibylla as
if she had been her daughter, and treated her in like manner, and for
this reason, if for no other, she received willing service from the
girl.</p>

<p>Sibylla, a swift worker at all times, never finished work so quickly
as on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, when she &quot;kept company&quot; with
Jake Crouthamel. &quot;Chake,&quot; as Sibylla called him, was a sturdy,
red-faced young farmer, all legs and arms. He appeared to be put
together loosely at the joints, like a jumping-jack, and never
appeared at ease in his ill-fitting &quot;store clothes.&quot; He usually wore
gray corduroy trousers and big cowhide boots, a pink and white striped
shirt and red necktie.</p>

<p>Sibylla did not notice his imperfections, and thought him handsome as
a Greek god.</p>

<p>Jake, an honest, industrious young fellow, worked on a near-by <a name='Page_55'></a>farm,
owned his own carriage, and had the privilege of using one of the farm
horses when he wished, so he and Sibylla frequently took &quot;choy rides,&quot;
as Sibylla called them.</p>

<p>Jake Crouthamel was usually called &quot;Boller-Yockel,&quot; this name having
been accorded him on account of his having delivered to a purchaser a
load of hay largely composed of rag-weed. The man called him an old
&quot;Boller-Yockel,&quot; and the name had clung to Jake for years.</p>

<h3>&quot;NEW COLONIAL&quot; RAG RUGS.</h3>
<br />

<p>Several days had elapsed since that on which Mary's Aunt had planned
to use the contents of her trunk to such good advantage, when Mary,
coming into the room where her Aunt was busily engaged sewing,
exclaimed: &quot;Don't forget, Auntie, you promised to teach me to crochet
rag rugs!&quot;</p>
<a name='A_HIT_AND_MISS_RUG'></a><h3>A &quot;HIT-AND-MISS&quot; RUG</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/078.jpg' width='499' height='484' alt='A &quot;HIT-AND-MISS&quot; RUG' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;Indeed, I've not forgotten, and will make my promise good at once,&quot;
said Aunt Sarah. &quot;We shall need quantities of carpet rags cut about
one-half inch in width, the same as those used for <a name='Page_57'></a>making rag carpet.
Of course, you are aware, Mary, that heavier materials should be cut
in narrower strips than those of thinner materials. You will also
require a long, wooden crochet needle, about as thick as an ordinary
wooden lead pencil, having a hook at one end, similar to a common bone
crochet needle, only larger. For a circular rug, crochet about twelve
stitches (single crochet) over one end of a piece of candle wick or
cable cord; or, lacking either of these, use a carpet rag of firm
material; then draw the crocheted strip into as small a circle as
possible, fasten and crochet round and round continuously until
finished. The centre of a circular or oblong rug may be a plain color,
with border of colored light and dark rags, sewed together
promiscuously, called 'Hit and Miss.'</p>

<a name='A_BROWN_AND_TAN_RUG'></a><h3>A BROWN AND TAN RUG</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/079.jpg' width='536' height='531' alt='A BROWN AND TAN RUG' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;Or you might have a design similar to a 'Pin-wheel' in centre <a name='Page_58'></a>of the
circular rug, with alternate stripes, composed of dark and
light-colored rags.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like one made in that manner from different shades that
harmonize, browns and tans, for instance,&quot; said Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;You may easily have a rug of that description,&quot; continued her Aunt.
&quot;With a package of brown dye, we can quickly transform some light,
woolen carpet rags I possess into pretty shades of browns and tans.&quot;</p>

<a name='RUG'></a><h3>RUG</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/080.jpg' width='428' height='457' alt='RUG' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;For a circular rug, with design in centre resembling a pin-wheel,
commence crocheting the rug same as preceding one. Crochet three rows
of one color, then mark the rug off into four parts, placing a pin to
mark each section or quarter of the rug. At each of four points
crochet one stitch of a contrasting shade. Crochet once around the
circle, using a shade similar to that of the centre of rug for design,
filling in between with the other shade. For the following row,
crochet two stitches beneath the one stitch (not directly underneath
the stitch, but one stitch beyond), filling in between with the other
color. The third row, <a name='Page_59'></a>add three stitches beneath the two stitches in
same manner as preceding row, and continue, until design in centre is
as large as desired, then crochet 'Hit or Miss' or stripes. Do not cut
off the carpet rags at each of the four points after crocheting
stitches, but allow each one to remain and crochet over them, then
pick up on needle and crochet every time you require stitches of
contrasting shade. Then crochet several rows around the rug with
different shades until rug is the required size. The under side should
be finished off as neatly as the right, or upper side. Mary, when not
making a design, sew the rags together as if for weaving carpet. When
crocheting circular rugs, occasionally stretch the outside row to
prevent the rug from curling up at edges when finished, as it would be
apt to do if too tightly crocheted. If necessary, occasionally add an
extra stitch. Avoid also crocheting it too loosely, as it would then
appear like a ruffle. The advantage of crocheting over a heavy cord is
that the work may be easily drawn up more tightly if too lose.&quot;</p>

<h3>MARY IMITATES NAVAJO BLANKETS.</h3>
<br />

<p>On her return from an afternoon spent at Professor Schmidt's, Mary
remarked to Aunt Sarah, &quot;For the first time in my life I have an
original idea!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do tell me child, what it is!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The 'New Colonial' rag rugs we have lately finished are fine, but I'd
just love to have a Navajo blanket like those owned by Professor
Schmidt; and I intend to make a rag rug in imitation of his Navajo
blanket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered her Aunt, &quot;I have always greatly admired them myself,
especially the large gray one which covers the Professor's own chair
in the library. The Professor brought them with him when he returned
from 'Cutler's Ranch' at Rociada, near Las Vegas, New Mexico, where he
visited his nephew, poor Raymond, or rather, I should say, fortunate
Raymond, an only child of the Professor's sister. A quiet, studious
boy, he graduated at the head of his class at an early age, but he
inherited the weak lungs of his father, who died of consumption.
Raymond was a lovable boy, with a fund of dry humor and wit&mdash;the idol
of his mother, who, taking the advice of a specialist, accompanied her
boy, as a last resort, to New Mexico, where, partly owing to his
determination to get well, proper food and daily rides on the mesa, on
the back of his little pinto pony, he regained perfect health, and
today is well, happily married and living in Pasadena, California, so
I have been told by Frau Schmidt, who dearly loves the boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Mary, forgive an old woman for rambling away from the subject in
which you are interested&mdash;Navajo blankets. Ever since we planned to
make a rug with a swastika in the centre, I nave been trying to evolve
from my brain (and your Uncle John says my bump of inventiveness is
abnormally large) a Navajo rag rug for the floor of the room you
intend to furnish as Ralph's den, in the home you are planning. Well,
my dear, a wooden <a name='Page_61'></a>crochet hook in your deft fingers will be the magic
wand which will perform a miracle and transform into Navajo blankets
such very commonplace articles as your discarded gray eiderdown
kimona, and a pair of your Uncle's old gray trousers, which have
already been washed and ripped by Sibylla, to be used for making
carpet rags. These, combined with the gray skirt I heard you say had
outlived its day of usefulness, will furnish the background of the
rug. The six triangles in the centre of the rug, also lighter stripes
at each end of the rug, we will make of that old linen chair-cover and
your faded linen skirt, which you said I might use for carpet rags;
and, should more material be needed, I have some old, gray woolen
underwear in my patch bag, a gray-white, similar to the real Navajo.
The rows of black with which we shall outline the triangles may be
made from those old, black, silk-lisle hose you gave me, by cutting
them round and round in one continuous strip. Heavy cloth should be
cut in <i>very</i> narrow strips. Sibylla will do that nicely; her hands
are more used to handling large, heavy shears than are yours. The
linen-lawn skirt you may cut in strips about three-fourths of an inch
in width, as that material is quite thin. I would sew rags of one
color together like carpet rags, not lapping the ends more than
necessary to hold them together. The rug will be reversible, both
sides being exactly alike when finished. I should make the rug about
fifty-three stitches across. This will require about six and
one-fourth yards of carpet rags, when sewed together, to crochet once
across. I think it would be wise to cut all rags of different weight
materials before commencing to crochet the rug, so they may be well
mixed through. I will assist you with the work at odd moments, and in
a short time the rug will be finished.&quot;</p>

<p>The rug, when finished, was truly a work of art, and represented many
hours of labor and thought. But Mary considered it very fascinating
work, and was delighted with the result of her labor&mdash;a rug the exact
imitation of one of the Professor's genuine Indian Navajo blankets,
the work of her own hands, and without the expenditure of a penny.</p>

<p>Mary remarked: &quot;I do not think all the triangles in my rug are the
exact size of the paper pattern you made me, Aunt Sarah. The two in
the centre appear larger than the others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; remarked her Aunt, &quot;if you examine closely the blankets owned
by Professor Schmidt, you will find the <a name='Page_62'></a>on the ones woven by Navajo
Indians are not of an equal size.&quot;</p>

<p>'Tis said Navajo blankets and Serapes will become scarce and higher in
price in the future, on account of the numerous young Indians who have
been educated and who prefer other occupations to that of weaving
blankets, as did their forefathers; and the present disturbance in
Mexico will certainly interfere with the continuance of this industry
for a time.</p>

</center>

<p>&quot;Mary, while you have been planning your Navajo rug, I have been
thinking how we may make a very attractive as well as useful rug. You
remember, we could not decide what use to make of your old, tan
cravenette stormcoat? I have been think<a name='Page_63'></a>ing we might use this, when
cut into carpet rags, for the principal part of the rug, and that old,
garnet merino blouse waist might be cut and used for the four corners
of a rug, and we might have gay stripes in the centre of the rug to
form a sort of design, and also put gay stripes at each end of the
rug.</p>

<p>&quot;And you might crochet a rug, plain 'Hit or Miss,' of rather
bright-colored rags.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mary, &quot;I think I will crochet a swastika in the centre of
a rug, as you suggest, of bright orange, outlined with black, and a
stripe of orange edged with black at each end of the rug to match the
centre. Don't you think that would be pretty, Aunt Sarah?&quot;</p>

<a name='HIT_OR_MISS_RUG_WITH_SWASTIKA_CENTRE'></a><h3>&quot;HIT-OR-MISS&quot; RUG WITH SWASTIKA CENTRE</h3>

</center>

<p>&quot;Yes indeed, but Mary, don't you think the swastika would show more
distinctly on a rug with a plain background?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps it would,&quot; replied Mary, &quot;but I think I'll crochet one of
very gayly-colored rags, with a swastika in the centre.&quot;</p>

<a name='A_PRAYER_RUG_OF_SILK_SCRAPS'></a><h3>A &quot;PRAYER RUG&quot; OF SILK SCRAPS.</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/087.jpg' width='547' height='400' alt='A &quot;PRAYER RUG&quot; OF SILK SCRAPS.' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; said Mary, &quot;do tell me how that pretty little rug
composed of silk scraps is made.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that <i>silk</i> rug; 'twas given me by Aunt Cornelia, who finished it
while here on a visit from New York. I never saw another like it, and
it has been greatly admired. Although possessed of an ordinary amount
of patience, I don't think I'll ever make one for myself. I don't
admire knitted rugs of any descrip<a name='Page_64'></a>tion, neither do I care for braided
rugs. I think the crocheted ones prettier. But, Mary, this small silk
rug is easily made should you care to have one. I will commence
knitting one for you at once. You will then find a use for the box of
bright-colored silks you possess, many of which are quite too small to
be used in any other manner. Professor Schmidt calls this a 'Prayer
Rug.' He said: 'This rug, fashioned of various bright-hued silks of
orange, purple and crimson, a bright maze of rich colors, without any
recognizable figure or design, reminds me of the description of the
'Prayer Carpet' or rugs of the Mohammedans. They are composed of
rich-hued silks of purple, ruby and amber. 'Tis said their delicacy of
shade is marvelous and was suggested by the meadows of variegated
flowers.' But this is a digression; you wished directions for making
the rug.</p>

<p>&quot;Use tiny scraps of various bright-hued silks, velvets and satins, cut
about 3 inches long and about one-half inch in width. Ends should
always be cut slanting or bias; never straight. All you will require
besides the silk scraps, will be a ball of common cord or twine, or
save all cord which comes tied around packages, as I do, and use that
and two ordinary steel knitting needles. When making her rug, Aunt
Cornelia knitted several strips a couple of inches in width and the
length she wished the finished rug to be. The strips when finished she
sewed together with strong linen thread on the wrong side of the rug.
She commenced the rug by knitting two rows of the twine or cord. (When
I was a girl we called this common knitting 'garter stitch.') Then,
when commencing to knit third row, slip off first stitch onto your
other needle; knit one stitch, then lay one of the tiny scraps of silk
across or between the two needles; knit one stitch with the cord. This
holds the silk in position. Then fold or turn one end of silk back on
the other piece of silk and knit one stitch of cord to hold them in
place, always keeping silk on one side, on the top of rug, as this rug
is not reversible. Continue in this manner until one row is finished.
Then knit once across plain with cord, and for next row lay silk
scraps in and knit as before. Always knit one row of the cord across
plain after knitting in scraps of silk, as doing this holds them
firmly in position. Of course, Mary, you will use judgment and taste
in combining light and dark, bright and dull colors. Also, do not use
several scraps of velvet together. Use velvet, silk and satin
alternately. Should any <a name='Page_65'></a>scraps of silk be longer than others after
knitting, trim off evenly so all will be of uniform size. When her rug
was finished, Aunt Cornelia spread it, wrong side uppermost, on an
unused table, covered it with a thick boiled paste, composed of flour
and water, allowed it to dry thoroughly, then lined the rug with a
heavy piece of denim. This was done to prevent the rug from curling up
at edges, and caused it to lie flat on floor; but I think I should
prefer just a firm lining or foundation of heavy burlap or denim.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Aunt Sarah, for your explicit directions. I cannot fail to
know just how to knit a silk rug, should I ever care to do so. I think
the work would be simply fascinating.&quot;</p>

<h3>THE GIRLS' CAMPFIRE, ORGANIZED BY MARY.</h3>
<br />

<p>One day in early June, when all nature seemed aglow with happiness, we
find Mary earnestly discussing with Elizabeth Schmidt the prosaic,
humdrum life of many of the country girls, daughters of well-to-do
farmers in the vicinity.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish,&quot; said Mary, wrinkling her forehead thoughtfully, &quot;I could
think of some new interest to introduce into their lives; some way of
broadening their outlook; anything to bring more happiness into their
commonplace daily toil; something good and helpful for them to think
about.&quot;</p>

<p>All at once Mary, who was not usually demonstrative, clapped her
hands, laughed gleefully and said: &quot;I have it, Elizabeth. The very
thing! Suppose we start a 'girls' campfire,' right here in the
country? I don't think we shall have any trouble to organize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you, because you understand all about it, will be the Guardian,&quot;
said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>At first Mary demurred, but, overcome by Elizabeth's pleading, finally
gave a reluctant consent. They then made out a list of the girls they
thought might be willing to join, Mary promising to write at once for
a handbook. They separated, Elizabeth to call to see the girls, and
Mary to interview their parents. Their efforts were rewarded with
surprisingly gratifying results, for many of the girls had read about
the &quot;Campfire Girls&quot; and were anxious to become members.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One afternoon, several weeks later, had you gone into the old apple
orchard, at the farm, you would have seen thirteen eager young girls,
ranging in age from fourteen to sixteen, listening intently to Mary,
who was telling them about the &quot;Campfire Girls.&quot; What she told them
was something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;Now girls, we are going to have a good time. Some of our good times
will be play and some work. When you join, you will <a name='Page_67'></a>become a 'Wood
Gatherer,' and after three months' successful work, if you have met
certain qualifications, you will be promoted to the rank of 'Fire
Maker.' Later on, when you come to realize what it means to be a
'Torch Bearer,' you will be put in that rank. The first law which you
learn to follow is one which you must apply to your daily life. It is:
Seek beauty, give service, pursue knowledge, be trustworthy, hold on
to health, glorify work, be happy. 'The Camp Fire' has meant so much
to girls I have known, for their betterment, and has been so helpful
in many ways, you surely will never regret becoming a member of the
organization, or be anything but happy if you keep their laws. There
will be no dues, except what is collected for good times, and no
expense except the cost of your ceremonial costume, epaulettes and
honor beads. The latter are quite inexpensive. The honors are divided
into several classes, and for each honor a bead is given as a symbol
of your work. A special colored bead is given for each class. We shall
meet about once every week. The monthly meeting is called the 'Council
Fire.' I will tell you later about the 'Wohelo' ceremony. By the way,
girls, 'Wohelo' stands for work, health and love. You see, the word is
composed of the first two letters of each word.&quot;</p>

<p>The girls appeared to be greatly interested, and Mary felt very much
encouraged. Some of the girls left to talk it over with the homefolks,
while others, wishing to learn more of the organisation, plied Mary
with numerous questions. Finally, in desperation, she said: &quot;Girls, I
will read you the following from the 'Camp Fire Girls' Handbook, which
I received this morning:&quot;</p>

<p>'The purpose of this organization is to show that the common things of
daily life are the chief means of beauty, romance and adventure; to
aid in the forming of habits making for health and vigor, the
out-of-door habit and the out-of-door spirit; to devise ways of
measuring and creating standards to woman's work, and to give girls
the opportunity to learn how to &quot;keep step,&quot; to learn team work,
through doing it; to help girls and women serve the community, the
larger home, in the same way they have always served the individual
home; to give status and social recognition to the knowledge of the
mother, and thus restore the intimate relationship of mothers and
daughters to each other.'</p>

<p>&quot;Well, girls,&quot; said Mary, as she laid aside the book, &quot;I think you all
understand what a benefit this will be to you, and I will <a name='Page_68'></a>do all in
my power to help you girls, while I am at the farm this summer. It is
too late to tell you any more today. The information I have given you
will suffice for the present. Three cheers for our Camp Fire! which
will be under way in two months, I trust.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The members of &quot;Shawnee&quot; Camp Fire held their first Council Fire, or
Ceremonial Meeting, the second week in July. The girls, all deeply
interested, worked hard to secure honors which were awarded for
engaging in domestic duties well known to the home, for studying and
observing the rules of hygiene and sanitation, and for learning and
achievements in various ways. They held weekly meetings and studied
diligently to win the rank of Fire Maker.</p>

<p>A girl, when she joins, becomes a Wood Gatherer; she then receives a
silver ring.</p>

<p>The weeks pass swiftly by, and it is time for another Camp Fire. The
girls selected as their meeting place for this occasion farmer
Druckenmuller's peach orchard, to which they walked, a distance of
about three miles from the home of Elizabeth Schmidt. They left about
two o'clock in the afternoon, intending to return home before
nightfall, a good time being anticipated, as they took with them lunch
and materials for a corn-roast.</p>

<p>The peach orchard in question, covering many acres, was situated at
the foot of a low hill. Between the two flowed an enchanting,
fairy-like stream, the cultivated peach orchard on one side, and on
the opposite side the forest-like hill, covered with an abundance of
wild flowers.</p>

<p>When the afternoon set for the Council Fire arrived, had you happened
to meet the fifteen merry, chattering girls, accompanied by two older
girls, Mary and Lucy Robbins (the country school teacher), as
chaperones, wending their way to the orchard, you, without a doubt,
would have smiled and a question might naturally have arisen regarding
their sanity. They certainly possessed intelligent faces, but why
those queer-shaped Indian dresses? And such an awkward length for a
young girl's dress! And why was their hair all worn hanging in one
braid over each shoulder, with a band over the forehead? Why so many
strings of gaudy beads around their necks? These questions may all be
answered in one <a name='Page_69'></a>single sentence: The girls are dressed in Ceremonial
Costume.</p>

</center>

<p>A great many delays along the way were caused by girls asking the
names of the different wild flowers and weeds they noticed in passing.
One of the girls stopped to examine a prickly-looking plant about two
feet high, with little, blue flowers growing along the stem, and asked
if any one knew the name of it. They were about to look it up in a
small &quot;Flower Guide&quot; owned by one of the girls, when some one said:
&quot;Why, that is a weed called 'Vipers Bougloss,'&quot; They also found
cardinal flower, thorn apple, monkey flower and jewel-weed in
abundance, wild sunflower, ginseng, early golden rod, &quot;Joe-pie-weed,&quot;
marshallow, black cohosh and purple loose-trifle. The girls also
noticed various birds.</p>

<p>On a tall tree one of the girls espied a rose-breasted Grosbeak, rare
in this part of Bucks County. They all stopped and watched for a short
time a white-bellied Nut-hatch. The girls were startled as a Scarlet
Tanger flew past to join his mate, and they at last reached their
rendezvous, the orchard.</p>

<p>By half-past three they were all seated in a circle waiting for the
ceremonies to begin. Mary Midleton, their Guardian, stepped to the
front, saying: &quot;Sunflower, light the fire.&quot; Sunflower, through several
months of daily attainment, had become a Fire-maker and was very proud
of the Fire-maker's bracelet she was entitled to wear. Sunflower was
given that name because she always looked on the bright side of
everything; she looked like a sunflower, too, with her tanned face and
light, curly hair.</p>

<p>All the girls had symbolical names given them. &quot;Lark&quot; was so named
because of her sweet voice and because she loved to sing; &quot;Sweet
Tooth,&quot; on account of her love for candy; &quot;Quick Silver,&quot; because she
was quick, bright and witty; &quot;Great Buffalo,&quot; a girl who was very
strong; Elizabeth Schmidt, &quot;Laughing Water,&quot; so named because she
laughed and giggled at everybody and everything; &quot;Babbling Brook,&quot;
because it seemed an utter impossibility for her to stop talking;
&quot;Burr,&quot; because she sticks to ideas and friends; &quot;Faith,&quot; quiet and
reserved; &quot;Comet,&quot; comes suddenly and brings a lot of light; &quot;Black
Hawk,&quot; always eager at first, but inclined to let her eagerness wear
off: &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; because she never can hurry; &quot;Ginger Foot,&quot; a
fiery temper, &quot;Gypsy,&quot; so named on account of her black hair; &quot;Bright
Eyes,&quot; for her bright, blue eyes; &quot;Rainbow,&quot; for her many ways, and
because she is pretty.</p>

<p><a name='Page_70'></a>As &quot;Sunflower&quot; took the matches and knelt by the pile of wood and
lighted the fire, she recited the Ode to the Fire:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Fire! Long years ago, when our fathers fought with great beasts,
you were their protector. From the cruel cold of winter you saved.
When they needed food, you changed the flesh of beasts into savory
meat for them. Through all ages your mysterious flame has been a
symbol of the Great Spirit to them. Tonight we light this fire in
remembrance of the Great Spirit Who gave you to us.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the girls sang the chant or chanted:</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>Wohelo for aye,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Wohelo for aye,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Wohelo for aye,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Wohelo for work,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Wohelo for health,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Wohelo,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Wohelo for love.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then they recited the Wood-gatherer's Desire:</p>

<p>&quot;It is my desire to be a Campfire Girl and keep the law of the Camp
Fire, which is 'To Seek Beauty, Give Service, Pursue Knowledge, Be
Trustworthy, Hold onto Health, Glorify Work, Be Happy,'&quot;</p>

<p>None had yet attained the highest rank, that of Torch Bearer, won by
still greater achievement, the Camp having been organized so recently.
Their motto was &quot;The light which has been given to me, I desire to
pass undimmed to others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gypsy,&quot; the secretary, then read the &quot;Count&quot; for the last meeting and
called the roll, and the girls handed in the list of honors they had
won in the last month. Some amused themselves playing games, while
others gathered more wood.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the corn and white and sweet potatoes were in the fire
roasting. A jolly circle of girls around the fire were busily engaged
toasting &quot;Weiners&quot; for the feast, which was finally pronounced ready
to be partaken of. The hungry girls &quot;fell to&quot; and everything eatable
disappeared as if by magic; and last, but not least, was the toasting
of marshmallows, speared on the points of long, two-pronged sticks
(broken from near-by trees), which were held over the fire until the
marshmallows turned a delicate <a name='Page_71'></a>color. When everything had been eaten,
with the exception of several cardboard boxes, corn cobs and husks,
the girls quickly cleared up. Then, seated around the fire, told what
they knew of Indian legends and folklore.</p>

<p>Noticing the sun slowly sinking in the West, they quickly gathered
together their belongings and started homeward singing, &quot;My Country,
'tis of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus broke up the second Council Fire, and in the heart of each girl
was the thought of how much the Campfire was helping them to love God
and His works.</p>

<h3>MARY MAKES &quot;VIOLET&quot; AND &quot;ROSE LEAF&quot; BEADS.</h3>
<br />

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; exclaimed Mary one day, &quot;you promised to tell me exactly
how you made those 'Rose Beads' you have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear, and you must make the beads before the June roses are
gone. The process is very simple. If you would have them very sweet,
get the petals of the most fragrant roses. I used petals of the
old-fashioned, pink 'hundred leaf' and 'blush roses.' Gather a
quantity, for you will need them all. Grind them to a pulp in the food
chopper, repeat several times and place the pulp and juice into an
<i>iron</i> kettle or pan. This turns the pulp black, which nothing but an
iron kettle will do; cook, and when the consistency of dough it is
ready to mold into beads. Take a bit of the dough, again as large as
the size you wish your beads to be when finished, as they shrink in
size when dried, and make them of uniform size, or larger ones for the
centre of the necklace, as you prefer. Roll in the palms of your
hands, until perfectly round, stick a pin through each bead, then
stick the pins into a bake board. Be careful the bead does not touch
the board, as that would spoil its shape. Allow the beads to remain
until perfectly dry. If they are to have a dull finish, leave as they
are. If you wish to polish them, take a tiny piece of vaseline on the
palm of the hand and rub them between the palms until the vaseline is
absorbed. Then string them on a linen thread. Keep in a closed box to
preserve their fragrance. Those I showed you, Mary, I made many years
ago, and the scent of the roses clings 'round them still.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know, Mary, that beads may be made from the petals of the
common wild blue violet in exactly the same manner as they are made
from rose leaves?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, indeed, but I don't think the making of beads from the petals of
roses and violets as wonderful as the beads which you raise in the
garden. Those shiny, pearl-like seeds or beads of silvery-gray, called
'Job's Tears,' which grow on a stalk resembling <a name='Page_73'></a>growing corn; and to
think Professor Schmidt raised those which Elizabeth strung on linen
thread, alternately with beads, for a portiere in their sitting-room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear, the beads must be pierced before they become hard;
later they should be polished. Did you ever see them grow, Mary? The
beads or 'tears' grow on a stalk about fifteen inches high and from
the bead or 'tear' grows a tiny, green spear resembling oats. They are
odd and with very little care may he grown in a small garden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They certainly are a curiosity,&quot; said Mary.</p>

<h3>MARY AND ELIZABETH VISIT SADIE SINGMASTER.</h3>
<br />

<p>Farmer Landis, happening to mention at the breakfast table his
intention of driving over to the &quot;Ax Handle Factory&quot; to obtain wood
ashes to use as a fertilizer, his wife remarked, &quot;Why not take Mary
with you, John? She can stop at Singmaster's with a basket of carpet
rags for Sadie. I've been wanting to send them over for some time.&quot;
Turning to Mary, she said: &quot;Poor little, crippled Sadie! On account of
a fall, which injured her spine, when a small child, she has been
unable to walk for years. She cuts and sews carpet rags, given her by
friends and neighbors, and from their sale to a carpet weaver in a
near-by town, helps her widowed mother eke out her small income.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd love to go see her,&quot; said Mary. Elizabeth Schmidt also expressed
her willingness to go, when asked, saying: &quot;I am positive mother will
add her contribution to the carpet rags for Sadie, I do pity her so
very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mary's Aunt, &quot;she is poor and proud. She will not accept
charity, so we persuade her to take carpet rags, as we have more than
we can possibly use.&quot;</p>

<p>On reaching the Singmaster cottage, the girls alighted with their
well-filled baskets, Mary's Uncle driving on to the &quot;Ax Handle
Factory,&quot; promising to call for the girls on his return. The sad,
brown eyes of Sadie, too large for her pinched, sallow face, shone
with pleasure at sight of the two young girls so near her own age, and
she smiled her delight on examining the numerous bright-colored
patches brought by them. Thinking the pleasure she so plainly showed
might appear childish to the two girls, she explained: &quot;I do get so
dreadfully tired sewing together so many dull homely rags. I shall
enjoy making balls of these pretty, bright colors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sadie,&quot; Mary inquired, &quot;will you think me inquisitive should I ask
what the carpet weaver pays you for the rags when you have sewed and
wound them into balls?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_75'></a>Certainly not,&quot; replied Sadie. &quot;Four cents a pound is what he pays
me. It takes two of these balls to make a pound,&quot; and she held up a
ball she had just finished winding.</p>

<p>&quot;Is <i>that all</i> you get?&quot; exclaimed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever made rag rugs?&quot; inquired Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I have never even seen one. Are they anything like braided mats?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they are somewhat similar to them, but I crochet mine and think
them prettier. I have made several, with Aunt Sarah's assistance. I'll
come over and teach you to make them one of these days, should you
care to learn, and I'm positive you will find ready sale for them. In
fact, I've several friends in the city who have admired the ones I
have, and would like to buy rugs for the Colonial rooms they are
furnishing. Sadie, can you crochet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes. I can do the plain stitch very well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is all that will be necessary. You will become very much
interested in inventing new designs, it is very fascinating work, and
it will be more remunerative than sewing carpet rags. Aunt Sarah will
send you more carpet rags if you require them, and should you wish
dull colors of blue or pink, a small package of dye will transform
white or light-colored rags into any desired shade, to match the
furnishings of different rooms. I think the crocheted rugs much
prettier than the braided ones, which are so popular in the 'Nutting'
pictures, and the same pretty shades may be used when rugs are
crocheted.&quot;</p>

<p>When Farmer Landis came for the girls, he found them too busily
engaged talking to hear his knock at the door. During the drive home
Mary could think and talk of nothing but Sadie Singmaster, and the
rugs she had promised to teach her to make at an early day. Elizabeth,
scarcely less enthusiastic, said: &quot;I've a lot of old things I'll give
her to cut up for carpet rags.&quot;</p>

<p>Reaching home, Mary could scarcely wait an opportunity to tell Aunt
Sarah all her plans for Sadie's betterment. When she finally did tell
her Aunt, she smiled and said: &quot;Mary, I'm not surprised. You are
always planning to do a kind act for some one. You remind me of the
lines, 'If I Can Live,' by Helen Hunt Jackson.&quot; And she repeated the
following for Mary:</p>

<p><a name='Page_76'></a>IF I CAN LIVE.</p>

<h3>OLD PARLOR MADE BEAUTIFUL (MODERNIZED).</h3>
<br />

<p>When John Landis came into possession of &quot;Clear Spring&quot; Farm, where
his mother had lived during her lifetime, she having inherited it from
her father, the rooms of the old farm house were filled with quaint,
old-fashioned furniture of every description. &quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; on coming
to the farm to live, had given a personal touch and cheery, homelike
look to every room in the house, with one exception, the large,
gloomy, old-fashioned parlor, which was cold, cheerless and damp. She
confessed to Mary she always felt as if John's dead-and-gone
ancestors' ghostly presences inhabited the silent room. The windows
were seldom opened to allow a ray of sunlight to penetrate the dusk
with which the room was always enveloped, except when the regular
weekly sweeping day arrived; when, after being carefully swept and
dusted, it was promptly closed. A room every one avoided, Aunt Sarah
was very particular about always having fresh air and sunlight in
every other part of the house but his one room. The old fireplace had
been boarded up many years before Aunt Sarah's advent to the farm, so
it could not be used. One day Mary noticed, while dusting the room
(after it had been given a thorough sweeping by Sibylla, Aunt Sarah's
one maid servant), that the small, many-paned windows facing the East,
at one end of the parlor, when opened, let in a flood of sunshine; and
in the evening those at the opposite end of the long room gave one a
lovely view of the setting sun&mdash;a finer picture than any painted by
the hand of a master. Mary easily persuaded her Aunt to make some
changes in the unlivable room. She suggested that they consult her
Uncle about repapering and painting the room and surprise him with the
result when finished.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah, who never did things by halves, said: &quot;Mary, I have long
intended 'doing over' this room, but thought it such a great
undertaking. Now, with your assistance, I shall make a sweep of these
old, antiquated heirlooms of a past generation. <a name='Page_78'></a>This green carpet,
with its gorgeous bouquets of roses, we shall have combined with one
of brown and tan in the attic. Your Uncle shall take them with him
when he drives to town and have them woven into pretty, serviceable
rugs for the floor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And, oh! Aunt Sarah,&quot; cried Mary, &quot;do let's have an open fireplace.
It makes a room so cheery and 'comfy' when the weather gets colder, on
long winter evenings, to have a fire in the grate. I saw some lovely,
old brass andirons and fender in the attic, and some brass
candlesticks there also, which will do nicely for the mantel shelf
over the fireplace. I'll shine 'em up, and instead of this
hideously-ugly old wall paper with gay-colored scrawley figures, Aunt
Sarah, suppose we get an inexpensive, plain, tan felt paper for drop
ceiling and separate it from the paper on the side wall, which should
be a warm, yellow-brown, with a narrow chestnut wood molding. Then
this dull, dark, gray-blue painted woodwork; could any one imagine
anything more hideously ugly? It gives me the 'blues' simply to look
at it. Could we not have it painted to imitate chestnut wood? And
don't you think we might paint the floor around the edges of the rug
to imitate the woodwork? Just think of those centre panels of the door
painted a contrasting shade of pale pink. The painter who did this
work certainly was an artist. A friend of mine in the city, wishing to
use rugs instead of carpets on her floors, and not caring to go to the
expense of laying hardwood floors, gave the old floors a couple of
coats of light lemon, or straw-colored paint, then stained and grained
them a perfect imitation of chestnut, at small expense. The floors
were greatly admired when finished, and having been allowed to dry
thoroughly after being varnished, proved quite durable. I will write
to my friend at once and ask her exactly how her floors were treated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Mary, about this old-style furniture. The old grandfather clock
standing in the corner, at the upper end of the room, I should like to
have remain. It is one hundred and fifty years old and belonged to my
folks, and, although old-fashioned, is highly valued by me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Mary, &quot;we'll certainly leave that in the room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Also,&quot; said Aunt Sarah, &quot;allow the old cottage organ and large,
old-fashioned bookcase belonging to your Uncle to remain. He has
frequently spoken of moving his bookcase into the next <a name='Page_79'></a>room, when he
was obliged to come in here for books, of which he has quite a
valuable collection.&quot;</p>

<a name='A_24'></a>

<img src='images/104.jpg' width='557' height='973' alt='' title=''>

<h3>A-24 Seed Wreath<br />
A-25 Wax Fruit<br />
A-26 Old Parlor Mantel<br />
A-27 Old Clock<br />
A-28 Boquet of Hair Flowers</h3>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Mary, &quot;no need of that. We will move Uncle John in here,
near the bookcase, when we get our room fixed up. Aunt Sarah, we will
leave that old-fashioned table, also, with one leaf up against the
wall, and this quaint, little, rush-bottomed rocker, which I just dote
on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, dear,&quot; exclaimed Aunt Sarah, &quot;there are several chairs to match
it in the attic, which you may have when you start housekeeping for
your very own. And,&quot; laughingly, said her Aunt, &quot;there is another old,
oval, marble-topped table in the attic, containing a large glass case
covering a basket of wax fruit, which you may have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Aunt Sarah,&quot; said Mary, &quot;I don't believe I want the fruit, but I
will accept your offer of the table. Well, Aunt Sarah, I know you
won't have this old, black what-not standing in the corner of the
room. I do believe it is made of spools, strung on wire, as supports
for the shelves; then all painted black, imitation of ebony, I
suppose. It must have been made in the Black Age, at the same time the
old corner cupboard was painted, as Uncle John told me he scraped off
three different layers of paint before doing it over, and one was
black. It was originally made of cherry. It certainly looks fine now,
with those new brass hinges and pretty, old-fashioned glass knobs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Mary,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;and there is an old corner cupboard in
the attic which belonged to my father, that you may have, and, with a
very little labor and expense, Ralph can make it look as well as mine.
It has only one door and mine possesses two.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; exclaimed Mary, &quot;you are a dear! How will I ever repay
you for all your kindness to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By passing it on to some one else when you find some one needing
help,&quot; said Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>&quot;Such a collection of odd things, Aunt Sarah, as are on this what-not
I never saw. Old ambrotypes and daguerreotypes of gone and forgotten
members of the 'freinshoft,' as you sometimes say. I don't believe you
know any of them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, the red plush frame on the mantel shelf contains a picture of
John's Uncle, a fine-looking man, but he possessed 'Wanderlust' and
has lived in California for many years.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_80'></a>Oh, you mean the picture on the mantel standing near those twin
gilded china vases, gay with red and blue paint?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; and that small china and gilt stand with little bowl and pitcher
was given me when a small child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose I bring a basket and we will fill it with articles from the
mantel and what-not,&quot; said Mary, &quot;and carry them all to the attic,
until you have a rummage sale some day. We'll burn these 'everlasting'
and 'straw' flowers, and pampas grass, and this large apple stuck full
of cloves. Here is a small china dog and a little china basket with a
plaited china handle decorated with gilt, and tiny, pink-tinted china
roses. And these large, glass marbles containing little silver eagles
inside; also this small, spun-glass ship and blue-and-pink-striped
glass pipe. Aunt Sarah, some of your ancestors must have attended a
glass blowers' exhibition in years past.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This branch of white coral, these large snail shells (when a child I
remember holding them to my ear to hear a noise resembling the roar of
the ocean), and this small basket, fashioned of twigs and tendrils of
grape vine, then dipped in red sealing wax, certainly is a good
imitation of coral, and this plate, containing a miniature ship
composed of green postage stamps, we will place in your corner
cupboard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And, Aunt Sarah, I suppose this deep, glass-covered picture frame
containing a bouquet of hair flowers, most wonderfully and fearfully
made, was considered a work of art in days past and gone, as was also
the crescent in a frame on the opposite side of the room, composed of
flowers made of various seeds of grain and garden vegetables. Those
daisies, made of cucumber seeds with grains of red corn for centres,
and those made of tiny grains of popcorn with a watermelon seed in
centre, are cute. The latter look like breastpins with a circle of
pearls around the edge. And this glass case on the table, containing a
white cross, covered with wax tube roses, ivy leaves and fuchsias
drooping from the arms of the cross, sparkling with diamond dust! The
band of green chenille around its base matches the mat underneath,
composed of green zephyr of different shades, knitted, then raveled to
imitate moss, I suppose; and, no doubt, this marble-topped table has
stood here for fifty years, in this same spot, for the express purpose
of holding this beautiful (?) work of art.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_81'></a>The hair flowers and the seed wreath were made by John's sister,&quot;
replied Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; exclaimed Mary, &quot;I've an original idea. This oval,
marble-topped table has such strong, solid legs of black walnut,
suppose we remove the marble slab and have a large, circular top made
of wood at the planing mill? Wait; I'll get my tape measure. About
thirty-two inches in diameter will do. The new top we shall stain to
match the walnut frame, and it could be easily fastened to the table
with a couple of screws; and, after the marble top has been well
scoured, we'll use it in the kitchen as a bake board on which to roll
out pie crust.&quot;</p>

<p>Her Aunt as usual acquiesced to all Mary's suggestions.</p>

<p>&quot;You're a dear, Aunt Sarah!&quot; exclaimed Mary, as she gave her a hug,
&quot;and I'll embroider big, yellow daisies with brown centres of French
knots on gray linen for a new table cover. Won't they look just
sweet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Mary, and I'll buy a large, new lamp with a pretty shade, as I
feel sure your Uncle will like to sit here evenings to read his papers
and farm journals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And don't forget the Shriners' little magazine, <i>The Crescent</i>, which
amuses him so greatly. Aunt Sarah, I do wish those stiff,
starchy-looking, blue-white Nottingham lace curtains at the windows
had grown yellow with age. They would be ever so much prettier and
softer looking, and they are such a pretty, neat design, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;that may be easily remedied. I'll just dip
them into a little weak liquid coffee and that will give them a creamy
tint, and take out the stiffness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Mary, &quot;what shall we do with these stiff, ugly,
haircloth-covered chairs and sofa?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; replied Aunt Sarah, &quot;we shall buy cretonne or art cloth, in
pretty shades of brown and tan or green, to harmonize with the wall
paper, and make slip covers for them all. We could never think of
dispensing with the sofa. It is a very important article of furniture
in German households. The hostess usually gives the person of greatest
distinction among her guests the place of honor beside her on the
sofa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;These chairs have such strong, well-made, mahogany frames it would be
a pity not to use them. Now,&quot; continued Mary, &quot;about the pictures on
the wall. Can't we consign them all to the <a name='Page_82'></a>attic? We might use some
of the frames. I'll contribute unframed copies of 'The Angelus' and
'The Gleaners,' by Millet; and I think they would fit into these plain
mahogany frames which contain the very old-fashioned set of pictures
named respectively 'The Lovers,' 'The Declaration,' 'The Lovers'
Quarrel' and 'The Marriage.' They constitute a regular art gallery.
I'll use a couple of the frames for some small Colonial and apple
blossom pictures I have, that I just love, by Wallace Nutting. Mine
are all unframed; 'Maiden Reveries,' 'A Canopied Roof' and a 'Ton of
Bloom,' I think are sweet. Those branches of apple trees, covered with
a mass of natural-looking pink blossoms, are exquisite.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; remarked Aunt Sarah, &quot;they look exactly like our old Baldwin,
Winesap and Cider apple trees in the old, south meadow in the Spring.
And, Mary, we'll discard those two chromos, popular a half century
ago, of two beautiful cherubs called respectively, 'Wide Awake' and
'Fast Asleep,' given as premiums to a popular magazine. I don't
remember if the magazine was 'Godey's,' 'Peterson's' or 'Home Queen';
they have good, plain, mahogany frames which we can use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And, Aunt Sarah,&quot; said Mary, &quot;we can cut out the partition in this
large, black-walnut frame, containing lithograph pictures of General
George Washington, 'the Father of his Country' (we are informed in
small letters at the bottom of the picture), and of General Andrew
Jackson, 'the hero of New Orleans.' Both men are pictured on
horseback, on gayly-caparisoned, prancing white steeds, with scarlet
saddle cloth, edged with gold bullion fringe. The Generals are
pictured clad in blue velvet coats with white facings of cloth or
satin vest and tight-fitting knee breeches, also white and long boots
reaching to the knee. Gold epaulettes are on their shoulders, and both
are in the act of lifting their old-fashioned Continental hats, the
advancing army showing faintly in the background. How gorgeously they
are arrayed! We will use this frame for the excellent, large copy you
have of 'The Doctor' and the pictured faces of the German
composers&mdash;Beethoven, Wagner, Mendelssohn, Haydn, Schubert and Mozart,
which I have on a card with a shaded brown background, will exactly
fit into this plain frame of narrow molding, from which I have just
removed the old cardboard motto, 'No place like home,' done with
green-shaded zephyr in cross-stitch.&quot;</p>

<h3>A-29 An Old Sampler<br />
A-30 Old Woven Basket<br />
A-31 Wax Cross<br />
A-32 Old Spinning Wheel</h3>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_83'></a>Now, Mary, with the couple of comfortable rockers which I intend
purchasing, I think we have about finished planning our room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you are willing, Aunt Sarah, I should like to make some pretty
green and brown cretonne slips to cover those square sofa pillows in
place of the ones made of small pieces of puffed silk and the one of
colored pieces of cashmere in log cabin design, I do admire big, fat,
plain, comfortable pillows, for use instead of show. And we must have
a waste paper basket near the table beside Uncle John's chair. I shall
contribute green satin ribbon for an immense bow on the side of the
basket. Oh! Aunt Sarah! You've forgotten all about this odd, woven
basket, beside the what-not, filled with sea shells. I don't care for
the shells, but the basket would make a lovely sewing basket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may have the basket, Mary, if you like it. It came from Panama,
or perhaps it was bought at Aspinwall by John's Uncle, many years ago,
when he came home on a visit from California, by way of the Isthmus,
to visit old friends and relatives. John's Mother always kept it
standing on the floor in one corner of the room beside the what-not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, why was straw ever put under this carpet?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The straw was put there, my dear, to save the carpet, should the
boards on the floor be uneven. My Mother was always particular about
having <i>cut rye straw</i>, because it was softer and finer than any
other. It was always used in those days instead of the carpet linings
we now have. I remember sometimes, when the carpet had been newly
laid, in our home, immediately after house cleaning time, the surface
of the floor looked very odd; full of bumps and raised places in
spots, until frequent walking over it flattened down the straw. This
room happens to have a particularly good, even floor, as this part of
the house was built many years later than the original, old farm
house, else it would not do to have it painted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, may I have the old spinning wheel in the attic? I'd love
to furnish an old Colonial bedroom when I have a home of my very own.
I'll use the rag carpet you made me for the floor, the old-fashioned,
high-post bed Uncle John said I might have, and the 'New Colonial'
rugs you taught me to make.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear, and there is another old grandfather's clock <a name='Page_84'></a>in the
attic which you may have; and a high-boy also, for which I have no
particular use.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, we shall not put away this really beautiful old sampler
worked in silk by Uncle John's grandmother when a girl of nine years.
It is beautifully done, and is wonderful, I think. And what is this
small frame containing a yellowed piece of paper cut in intricate
designs, presumably with scissors?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look on the back of the picture and see what is written there, my
dear,&quot; said her Aunt.</p>

<p>Mary slowly read: &quot;'This is the only picture I owned before my
marriage. I earned the money to buy it by gathering wheat heads.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It belonged to my grandmother,&quot; said Aunt Sarah. &quot;In old times, after
the reapers had left the field, the children were allowed to gather up
the wheat remaining, and, I suppose, grandmother bought this picture
with the money she earned herself, and considered it quite a work of
art in her day. It is over one hundred years old.&quot;</p>

<h3>AN OLD SONG EVENING.</h3>
<br />

<p>Aunt Sarah and Mary spent few idle moments while carrying out their
plans for &quot;doing over&quot; the old parlor. Finally, 'twas finished. Mary
breathed a sigh of satisfaction as the last picture was hung on the
wall. She turned to her Aunt, saying, &quot;Don't you think the room looks
bright, cheery and livable?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;and what is more essential, homey, I have
read somewhere, 'A woman's house should be as personal a matter as a
spider's web or a snail's shell; and all the thought, toil and love
she puts into it should be preserved a part of its comeliness and
homelikeness forever, and be her monument to the generations.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Aunt Sarah,&quot; replied Mary, &quot;I guess we've earned our monument.
The air that blows over the fields, wafted in from the open window, is
sweet with the scent of grain and clover, and certainly is refreshing.
I'm dreadfully tired, but so delighted with the result of our labors.
Now we will go and 'make ready,' as Sibylla says, before the arrival
of Ralph from the city. I do hope the ice cream will be frozen hard.
The Sunshine Sponge Cake, which I baked from a recipe the Professor's
wife gave me, is light as a feather. 'Tis Ralph's favorite cake. Let's
see; besides Ralph there are coming all the Schmidts, Lucy Robbins,
the school teacher, and Sibylla entertains her Jake in the kitchen. I
promised to treat him to ice cream; Sibylla was so good about helping
me crack the ice to use for freezing the cream. We shall have an 'Old
Song Evening' that will amuse every one.&quot;</p>

<p>Quite early, as is the custom in the country, the guests for the
evening arrived; and both Mary and Aunt Sarah felt fully repaid for
their hard work of the past weeks by the pleasure John Landis evinced
at the changed appearance of the room.</p>

<p>The Professor's wife said, &quot;It scarcely seems possible to have changed
the old room so completely.&quot;</p>

<p><a name='Page_86'></a>Aunt Sarah replied, &quot;Paint and paper do wonders when combined with
good taste, furnished by Mary.&quot;</p>

<p>During the evening one might have been forgiven for thinking Professor
Schmidt disloyal to the Mother Country (he having been born and
educated in Heidelberg) had you overheard him speaking to Ralph on his
favorite subject, the &quot;Pennsylvania German.&quot; During a lull in the
general conversation in the room Mary heard the Professor remark to
Ralph: &quot;The Pennsylvania Germans are a thrifty, honest and industrious
class of people, many of whom have held high offices. The first
Germans to come to America as colonists in Pennsylvania were, as a
rule, well to do. Experts, when examining old documents of Colonial
days, after counting thousands of signatures, found the New York
'Dutch' and the Pennsylvania 'Germans' were above the average in
education in those days. Their dialect, the so-called 'Pennsylvania
German' or 'Dutch,' as it is erroneously called by many, is a dialect
which we find from the Tauber Grund to Frankfurt, A.M. As the German
language preponderated among the early settlers, the language of
different elements, becoming amalgamated, formed a class of people
frequently called 'Pennsylvania Dutch'.&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Harbaugh, D.D., has written some beautiful poems in
Pennsylvania German which an eminent authority, Professor Kluge, a
member of the Freiburg University, Germany, has thought worthy to be
included among the classics. They are almost identical with the poems
written by Nadler in Heidelberger Mundart, or dialect.</p>

<p>Mary, who had been listening intently to the Professor, said, when he
finished talking to Ralph: &quot;Oh, please, do repeat one of Professor
Harbaugh's poems for us.&quot;</p>

<p>He replied, &quot;I think I can recall several stanzas of 'Das Alt
Schulhaus an der Krick.' Another of Professor Harbaugh's poems, and I
think one of the sweetest I have ever read, is 'Heemweeh.' Both poems
are published in his book entitled 'Harbaugh's Harfe,' in Pennsylvania
German dialect, and possess additional interest from the fact that the
translations of these poems, in the latter part of the same book, were
made by the author himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, do repeat all that you remember of both the poems,&quot; begged Mary.</p>

<p>The Professor consented, saying: &quot;As neither you nor Mr. Jackson
understand the Pennsylvania German dialect, I shall <a name='Page_87'></a>translate them
for you, after repeating what I remember. 'Heemweeh' means
Homesickness, but first I shall give you 'Das Alt Schulhaus an der
Krick'.&quot;</p>

<p>At the conclusion of his recital, Mary heartily thanked the Professor,
and, at his request, obediently seated herself at the old, but still
sweet-toned cottage organ, and expressed her willingness to play any
old-time songs or hymns requested, and saying, &quot;I know Aunt Sarah's
favorite,&quot; commenced playing, &quot;My Latest Sun is Sinking Fast,&quot;
followed by &quot;This Old-Time Religion,&quot; &quot;Jesus, Lover of My Soul,&quot; &quot;One
of the Sweet Old Chapters,&quot; &quot;Silver Threads Among the Gold&quot; and the
sweet old hymn, &quot;In the Summer Land of Song,&quot; by Fanny Crosby.</p>

<p><a name='Page_93'></a>At John Landis' request, she played and sang &quot;Auld Lang Syne.&quot; &quot;When
You and I Were Young, Maggie,&quot; &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; and &quot;Old Black
Joe.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucy Robbins, when asked for her favorites, replied; &quot;In the
Gloaming,&quot; &quot;The Old, Old Home'&quot; &quot;The Lost Chord&quot; and &quot;Better Bide a
Wee.&quot;</p>

<p>The Professor then asked his daughter Elizabeth to give them the music
of a song from German Volkslied, or Folk Song, with the words of which
all except Mary and Ralph were familiar. Professor Schmidt sang in his
high, cracked voice to Elizabeth's accompaniment the words of the
German song, beginning:</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>Du, Du liegest mir in Herzen<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>Du, Du liegst mir in Sinn<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Du, Du machst mir viel Schmerzen<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>Weist nicht wie gut ich Dir binn<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>Ja, ja, ja, ja, Du weist nicht wie gut ich Dir bin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The young folks all joined in the chorus. Fritz Schmidt asked
Elizabeth to play &quot;Polly Wolly Doodle&quot; for little Pollykins, which
Frit sang with gusto. Fritz then sang the rollicking German song,
&quot;Lauderbach,&quot; to an accompaniment played by Mary, and followed by
singing &quot;Johnny Schmoker,&quot; with appropriate gestures in the chorus
commencing &quot;My Pilly, Willy Wink, das is mein fifa,&quot; etc., ending with
&quot;My fal, lal, lal, my whach, whach, das ist mein doodle soch,&quot; which
he emphasised by shrugging his shoulders, to the no small enjoyment of
the young folks, who thought the silly, old German song no end of fun.
This was followed by a favorite college song, &quot;Mandalay,&quot; by Fritz.</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth Schmidt played and sang a pretty little German song
called &quot;Meuhlen Rad,&quot; meaning The Mill Wheel, taught her by her
mother.</p>
<br />

<p>MEUHLEN RAD.</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>In einen kuhlen grunde<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>Da steht ein meuhlen rad;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Mein libste ist versch wunden,<br /></span>

<span class='i4'>Sie hat die treu gebrochen,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>She translated it for the benefit of Ralph and Mary: &quot;In a cool,
pleasant spot, stands a mill. My loved one, who lived there, has
disappeared. She promised to be true to me, and I gave her a ring. She
broke her promise and the ring broke in two.&quot;</p>

<p>Fritz then caught his little sister Pauline around the waist and
waltzed her to one end of the long room, saying: &quot;Mary, play the
piece, 'Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet,' and Pollykins and I will do the
cakewalk for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Polly, who had become quite a proficient little dancer under her
sister's teaching, was very willing to do her share in the evening's
entertainment, and it was pronounced a decided success.</p>

<p>Mary then said, &quot;I'll play my favorite schottische, composed by our
old friend, the Professor. I have not yet procured a copy of his
latest piece of music, 'The Passing of the Dahlias.' I think it is
still with the publishers.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary, after playing &quot;Rock of Ages,&quot; left the room to see about serving
refreshments, when Elizabeth Schmidt took her place at the instrument.
After playing &quot;The Rosary,&quot; she turned to Ralph, who had been greatly
amused by the German songs on the program, all of which were quite new
to him, and said: &quot;What shall I play for you?&quot;</p>

<p>He replied, &quot;'My Little Irish Rose'&mdash;no, I mean 'The River Shannon.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you mean 'That Grand Old Name Called Mary?'&quot; mischievously
inquired Fritz Schmidt, who could not refrain from teasing Ralph,
which caused a laugh at his expense, as all present were aware of his
love for Mary. Elizabeth, to cover Ralph's confusion, quickly replied:
&quot;I'll play my favorite, 'The End of a Perfect Day.'&quot;</p>

<p>The party was pronounced a success, and broke up at a late hour for
country folks. Before leaving, Mary's Uncle said: &quot;Now, let's sing
'Home, Sweet Home,' and then all join in singing that grand old hymn,
'My Country, 'Tis of Thee,' to the new tune by our friend, the Bucks
County Editor.&quot;</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO THE &quot;PENNSYLVANIA PALISADES,&quot; AS THE &quot;NARROWS&quot; OF THE
DELAWARE RIVER ARE CALLED.</h3>
<br />

<p>All hailed with delight Aunt Sarah's proposal that the Schmidt and
Landis families, on the Fourth of July, drive over to the Narrows,
visit Aunt Sarah's old home at Nockamixon, and see the &quot;Ringing Rocks&quot;
and &quot;High Falls,&quot; situated a short distance from the rocks, near which
place picnics were frequently held. John Landis readily agreed to the
proposed plan, saying, &quot;The meadow hay and clover are cut, and I'll
not cut the wheat until the fifth day of July.&quot;</p>

<p>The third of July was a busy day at both farm houses, preparing savory
food of every description with which to fill hampers for the next
day's outing. Small Polly Schmidt was so perfectly happy, at the
thought of a proposed picnic, she could scarcely contain herself, and
as her sister Elizabeth said, &quot;did nothing but get in every one's
way.&quot; Little Polly, being easily offended, trudged over to the Landis
farm to see Mary, with whom she knew she was a great favorite.</p>

<p>The morning of the Fourth dawned bright and clear. Quite early, while
the earth was still enveloped in a silvery mist, and on the lattice
work of filmy cobwebs, spun over weeds and grass, dewdrops, like tiny
diamonds, sparkled and glistened, until dissolved by the sun's warm
rays, the gay party left home, for the &quot;Palisades&quot; were quite a
distance from the farm, to drive being the only way of reaching the
place, unless one boarded the gasoline motorcar, called the &quot;Cornfield
Express&quot; by farmers living in the vicinity of Schuggenhaus Township.</p>

<p>There is something indescribably exhilarating about starting for an
early drive in the country before sunrise on a bright, clear morning
in midsummer, when &quot;the earth is awaking, the sky and the ocean, the
river and forest, the mountain and plain.&quot; Who has not felt the sweet
freshness of early morning before &quot;the sunshine is all on the wing&quot; or
the birds awaken and begin to chatter and <a name='Page_96'></a>to sing? There is a hush
over everything; later is heard the lowing of cattle, the twitter of
birds and hum of insect life, proclaiming the birth of the new day.
Passing an uncultivated field, overgrown with burdock, wild carrots,
mullein, thistle and milk weed, Mary alighted and gathered some of the
pods of the latter, inclosing imitation of softest down, which she
used later for filling sofa pillows.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at those pretty wild canaries!&quot; exclaimed Aunt Sarah, &quot;yellow as
gold, swinging on the stem of a tall weed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Professor Schmidt, can you tell me the name of that weed?&quot; questioned
Mary. &quot;I have always admired the plant, with its large leaves and
long, drooping racemes of crimson seeds.</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; replied the Professor, &quot;is a foreign plant, a weed called
Equisetum from 'Equi,' a horse, and 'Setum'&mdash;tail. The country folk
hereabout call it 'Horsetail.' It belongs to the Crptogamous or
flowerless plants. There are only four specimens of this plant in
America. I, too, have always greatly admired the plant.&quot;</p>

<p>The Professor was quite a noted botanist. There were few flowers,
plants or weeds of which he was ignorant of the name or medicinal
value. Another bird lazily picked seeds from the thistle blossoms.
&quot;See,&quot; exclaimed Aunt Sarah, &quot;one bird has a spear of grass in its
mouth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yellow star grass,&quot; said the Professor, &quot;with which to make a nest.
They never mate until the last of June, or first part of July. The
tiny, little robbers ate up nearly all my sunflower seeds in the
garden last summer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; replied Mary, &quot;you know, Professor, the birds must have food.
They are the farmer's best friend. I hope you don't begrudge them a
few sunflower seeds, I love birds. I particularly admire the
'Baltimore Oriole,' with their brilliant, orange-colored plumage; they
usually make their appearance simultaneously with the blossoms in the
orchard in the south meadow; or so Aunt Sarah tells me. I love to
watch them lazily swinging on the high branches of tall trees. On the
limb of a pear tree in the orchard one day, I saw firmly fastened, a
long, pouch-like nest, woven with rare skill. Securely fastened to the
nest by various colored pieces of twine and thread was one of smaller
size, like a lean-to added to a house, as if the original nest had
been found too small to accommodate the family of young birds when
hatched. <a name='Page_97'></a>The oriole possesses a peculiar, sweet, high-whistled trill,
similar to this&mdash;'La-la-la-la,' which always ends with the rising
inflection.&quot;</p>

<p>Fritz Schmidt, who had been listening intently to Mary, gravely
remarked, &quot;An oriole built a nest on a tall tree outside my bedroom
window, and early every morning, before the family arise, I hear it
sing over and over again what sounds exactly like 'Lais Die Beevil!'
which translated means 'Read your Bible'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even the birds are 'Dutch,' I believe, in Bucks County,&quot; said Fritz.
&quot;I think these must be German Mennonites, there being quite a
settlement of these honest, God-fearing people living on farms at no
great distance from our place.&quot;</p>

</center>

<p>As they drove along the country road, parallel with the Delaware
River, just before reaching the Narrows. Mary was greatly attracted by
the large quantities of yellow-white &quot;sweet clover,&quot; a weed-like plant
found along the Delaware River, growing luxuriantly, with tall, waving
stems two to four feet high. The clover-like flowers, in long, loose
racemes, terminating the branches, were so fragrant that, like the
yellow evening primrose, the scent was noticeable long before one
perceived the flowers. And, strange to tell, sweet clover was never
known to grow in this locality until the seed was washed up on the
bank of the <a name='Page_98'></a>river some ten or twelve years previous to the date of my
story, when the Delaware River was higher than it was ever before
known to be.</p>

<p>&quot;The first place we shall visit,&quot; said Aunt Sarah, &quot;will be my
grandmother's old home, or rather, the ruins of the old home. It
passed out of our family many years ago; doors and windows are missing
and walls ready to tumble down. You see that old locust tree against
one side the ruined wall of the house?&quot; and with difficulty she broke
a branch from the tree saying, &quot;Look, see the sharp, needle-shaped
thorns growing on the branch! They were used by me when a child to pin
my dolls' dresses together. In those days, pins were too costly to
use; and look at that large, flat rock not far distant from the house!
At the foot of that rock, when a child of ten, I buried the 'Schild
Krote Family' dolls, made from punk (when told I was too big a girl to
play with dolls). I shed bitter tears, I remember. Alas! The sorrows
of childhood are sometimes deeper than we of maturer years realize.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you give your family of dolls such an odd name, Aunt Sarah?&quot;
questioned Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not remember,&quot; replied her Aunt. &quot;Schild Krote is the German
name for turtle. I presume the name pleased my childish fancy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose we visit my great-great-grandfather's grave in the near-by
woods. I think I can locate it, although so many years have passed
since I last visited it.&quot;</p>

<p>Passing through fields overgrown with high grass, wild flowers and
clover, they came to the woods. Surprising to say, scarcely any
underbrush was seen, but trees everywhere&mdash;stately Lebanon cedars,
spruce and spreading hemlock, pin oaks, juniper trees which later
would be covered with spicy, aromatic berries; also beech trees. Witch
hazel and hazel nut bushes grew in profusion. John Landis cut a large
branch from a sassafras tree to make a new spindle on which to wind
flax, for Aunt Sarah's old spinning wheel (hers having been broken),
remarking as he did so, &quot;My mother always used a branch of sassafras
wood, having five, prong-like branches for this purpose, when I was a
boy, and she always placed a piece of sassafras root with her dried
fruit.&quot;</p>

<p>The Professor's wife gathered an armful of yarrow, saying, &quot;This is an
excellent tonic and should always be gathered before <a name='Page_99'></a>the flowers
bloom. I wonder if there is any boneset growing anywhere around here.&quot;</p>

<p>Boneset, a white, flowering, bitter herb, dearly beloved and used by
the Professor's wife as one of the commonest home remedies in case of
sickness, and equally detested by both Fritz and Pauline.</p>

</center>

<p>Mary gathered a bouquet of wild carrot, or &quot;Queen Anne's Lace,&quot; with
its exquisitely fine, lace-like flowers with pale green-tinted
centres. Mary's Uncle could not agree with her in praise of the dainty
wild blossoms. He said: &quot;Mary, I consider it the most detested weed
with which I am obliged to contend on the farm.&quot;</p>

<a name='TOP_ROCK'></a><h3>TOP ROCK</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/130.jpg' width='384' height='616' alt='TOP ROCK' title=''>
</center>

<p>After quite a long, tiresome walk in the hot sun, they discovered the
lonely grave, covered with a slab of granite surrounded by a small
iron railing and read the almost illegible date&mdash;&quot;Seventeen Hundred
and Forty.&quot; Ralph said, &quot;If he ever sighed for a home in some vast
wilderness, his wish is granted.&quot; It certainly was a lonely grave in
the deep woods, and gave all the members of the party a sad and eerie
feeling as they wended their way out into the sunlight again, to the
waiting carriages, and <a name='Page_101'></a>were soon driving swiftly along the Narrows,
as they have been called from time immemorial by the inhabitants,
although I prefer the name of Pennsylvania Palisades, as they are
sometimes called.</p>

<p>Said Professor Schmidt: &quot;Numerous tourists visit the Narrows every
year. The Narrows are said to resemble somewhat the Palisades on the
Hudson. I have seen, the latter and think these greatly resemble them
and are quite as interesting and picturesque.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The name Narrows is derived from the fact that at this place the
Delaware River has forced itself through the rocky barrier,&quot; continued
the Professor, &quot;hedged in on one side by cliffs of perpendicular rock,
three hundred feet high, extending some distance along the river,
leaving scarcely room at some places for the river and the canal. Some
quite rare plants grow here, said to be found in few other localities
in the United States. You see the highest flat rock along the Narrows?
It is called 'Top Rock' and rises to a height of more than three
hundred feet. We shall drive around within a short distance of it;
then, after passing a small house, we are obliged to walk across a
field of ploughed ground; follow the well-beaten path between trees
and undergrowth, and 'Top Rock' is before us. Stepping upon the high
ledge of rock projecting out over the road beneath, we discover it may
also be reached by following a precipitous path and clinging to bushes
and trees, but none of the party venture. Recently the body of a man
who had been searching for rare birds' eggs on the side of this
self-same rock was found dead on the path below the rocks. What caused
his fall is not known. No wonder Aunt Sarah says it makes her dizzy
when you boys skip stones across the river while standing on the
rock.&quot;</p>

<p>The beautiful view of the Delaware River and the scenery on the
opposite side was something long to be remembered. While the party
were going into raptures over the beautiful sight, Professor Schmidt
turned to Mary and remarked: &quot;In those rocks which rise in
perpendicular bluffs, several hundred feet above the level of the
river, are evidence that prehistoric man may have inhabited the caves
in these same walls of rock along the Delaware. From implements and
weapons found, it does not require any great effort of imagination to
believe the 'Cave Man' dwelt here many centuries ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Fritz Schmidt was much interred in his father's conversa<a name='Page_102'></a>tion, and
from that time on called Ralph Jackson Mary's &quot;Cave Man.&quot;</p>

<p>Leaving Top Rock, the party wended their way back to the waiting
carriages in the road, and drove to the &quot;Ringing or Musical Rocks.&quot;
They had been informed that their nearest approach to the rocks was to
drive into the woods to reach them. Passing a small shanty at the
roadside, where a sign informed the passerby that soft drinks were to
be obtained, the party dismounted and found, to their surprise, a
small pavilion had been erected with bench, table and numerous seats
composed of boards laid across logs, where camp meetings had formerly
been held. As the large trees furnished shade, and a spring of fresh
water was near by, they decided to &quot;strike&quot; camp and have lunch before
going farther into the woods.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah and the Professor's wife spread a snowy cloth over the
rough wooden table, quickly unpacked the hampers, and both were soon
busily engaged preparing sandwiches of bread, thinly sliced, pink cold
ham and ground peanuts, fried chicken and beef omelette; opening jars
of home-made pickles, raspberry jam and orange marmalade.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Pauline, &quot;I'm so hungry for a piece of chocolate cake. Let
me help shell the eggs, so we can soon have dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here's your fresh spring water,&quot; called Fritz, as he joined the
party, a tin pail in his hand, &quot;We had such an early breakfast, I'm as
hungry as a bear.&quot;</p>

<p>The party certainly did full justice to the good things provided with
a lavish hand by Frau Schmidt and Aunt Sarah. All were in high
spirits. The Professor quoted from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough.<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Beside me singing in the wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And wilderness is Paradise enow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ralph cast a look at Marry, unnoticed by any one else, as much as to
say, &quot;The old tentmaker voiced my sentiments.&quot;</p>

<p>After the hampers had been repacked and stowed away in the carriages,
they with the horses were left in the shade while the party walked to
&quot;High Falls,&quot; at no great distance from the <a name='Page_103'></a>camp. &quot;High Falls,&quot; a
beautiful waterfall about thirty feet high and fifty feet wide, is
situated several hundred feet east of the Ringing Rocks. The water,
before dashing below, passes over a large, solid, level floor of rock.
After gazing at the Falls and picturesque surroundings, they searched
through the woods for the Ringing Rocks, a peculiar formation of rocks
of irregular shape and size, branching out from a common centre <a name='Page_104'></a>in
four directions. The rocks vary in size from a few pounds to several
tons in weight. Arriving there, Aunt Sarah said: &quot;Ralph, you will now
find use for the hammer which I asked you to bring.&quot; Ralph struck
different rocks with the hammer, and Fritz Schmidt struck rocks with
other pieces of rock, and all gave a peculiar metallic sound, the
tones of each being different. The rocks are piled upon each other to
an unknown depth, not a particle of earth being found between them,
and not a bush or spear of grass to be seen. They occupy a space of
about four and a half acres and are a natural curiosity well worth
seeing. The young folks scrambled over the rocks for a time, and,
having made them ring to their hearts' content, were satisfied to
return to camp and supper.</p>

<p>&quot;Not far distant from High Falls,&quot; said John Landis, when all were
comfortably seated near the table, with a sandwich in hand, &quot;is a
place called Roaring Rocks, also a freak of nature. I remember, when a
boy, I always went there in the fall of the year, after the first hard
frost, to pick persimmons. The water could he distinctly heard running
underneath the rocks at a considerable depth.&quot;</p>

<p>Ralph Jackson remarked to Aunt Sarah: &quot;I never imagined <a name='Page_105'></a>there were so
many interesting, natural features right here in Bucks County.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; exclaimed the impressible Fritz Schmidt, &quot;we have a few
things besides pigs and potatoes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Ralph,&quot; said the Professor, &quot;there are still several places of
interest you will like to see. 'Stony Garden' is another very
interesting freak of nature. It is about two and a half miles from the
small town of 'Snitzbachsville,' as Fritz calls the hamlet, and 'tis a
wild spot. About an acre is covered with trap rock. The stones are of
odd shapes and sizes and appear as if thrown into the forest in the
wildest confusion. No earth or vegetation is found about them. 'Tis
said the rocks are similar to those found at Fingal's Cave, Ireland,
and also at the Palisades on the Hudson, and are not found anywhere
else in this section of the country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Ralph,&quot; said Fritz, &quot;I want to show you 'Big Rock,' at Avondale,
where a party of us boys camped one summer for two weeks. Oh! but I
remember the good pies given us by a farmer's wife who sold us milk
and eggs, and who lived just across the fields from our camp.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think,&quot; said John Landis, &quot;it is time we began hitching up our
horses and starting for home. We have a long drive before us, and,
therefore, must make an early start. Sarah, get the rest of the party
together and pack up your traps.&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment the Professor came in sight with an armful of ferns,
the rich loam adhering to their roots, and said: &quot;I'm sure these will
grow.&quot; Later he planted them on a shady side of the old farm house at
&quot;Five Oaks,&quot; where they are growing today. Professor Schmidt, after a
diligent search, had found clinging to a rock a fine specimen of
&quot;Seedum Rhodiola,&quot; which he explained had never been found growing in
any locality in the United States except Maine. Little Pauline, with a
handful of flowers and weeds, came trotting after Mary, who carried an
armful of creeping evergreen called partridge berry, which bears
numerous small, bright, scarlet berries later in the season. Ralph
walked by her side with a basket filled to overflowing with quantities
of small ferns and rock moss, with which to border the edge of the
waiter on which Mary intended planting ferns; tree moss or lichens,
hepaticas, wild violets, pipsissewa or false wintergreen, with dark
green, waxy leaves veined with a lighter shade of <a name='Page_106'></a>green; and wild
pink geraniums, the foliage of which is prettier than the pink
blossoms seen later, and they grow readily when transplanted.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah had taught Mary how to make a beautiful little home-made
fernery. By planting these all on a large waiter, banking moss around
the edges to keep them moist and by planting them early, they would be
growing finely when taken by her to the city in the fall of the
year&mdash;a pleasant reminder of her trip to the &quot;Narrows&quot; of the Delaware
River. Frau Schmidt brought up the rear, carrying huge bunches of
mint, pennyroyal and the useful herb called &quot;Quaker Bonnet.&quot;</p>

<p>Driving home at the close of the day, the twinkling lights in farm
house windows they swiftly passed, were hailed with delight by the
tired but happy party, knowing that each one brought them nearer home
than the one before. To enliven the drowsy members of the party, Fritz
Schmidt sang the following to the tune of &quot;My Old Kentucky Home,&quot;
improvising as he sang:</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>The moon shines bright on our &quot;old Bucks County home,&quot;<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>The meadows with daisies are gay,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>The song of the whipporwill is borne on the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>With the scent of the new mown hay.<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Oh! the Narrows are great with their high granite peaks,<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>And Ringing Rocks for ages the same;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'><a name='Page_107'></a>But when daylight fades and we're tired and cold,<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>There's no place like &quot;hame, clear alt hame.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last lingering rays of the sun idealized the surrounding fields
and woods with that wonderful afterglow seen only at the close of day.
The saffron moon appeared to rise slowly from behind the distant
tree-tops, and rolled on parallel with them, and then ahead, as if to
guide them on their way, and the stars twinkled one by one from out
the mantle of darkness which slowly enveloped the earth. The trees
they swiftly passed, when the moonbeams touched them, assumed
gigantic, grotesque shapes in the darkness. Mary quoted from a

<h3>MARY IS TAUGHT TO MAKE PASTRY, PATTIES AND &quot;ROSEN KUCHEN.&quot;</h3>
<br />

<p>Mary's Aunt taught her to make light, flaky pastry and pies of every
description. In this part of Bucks County a young girl's education was
considered incomplete without a knowledge of pie-making. Some of the
commonest varieties of pies made at the farm were &quot;Rivel Kuchen,&quot; a
pie crust covered with a mixture of sugar, butter and flour crumbled
together; &quot;Snitz Pie,&quot; composed of either stewed dried apples or
peaches, finely mashed through a colander, sweetened, spread over a
crust and this covered with a lattice-work of narrow strips of pastry
laid diamond-wise over the top of the pie; &quot;Crumb&quot; pies, very popular
when served for breakfast, made with the addition of molasses or
without it; Cheese pies, made of &quot;Smier Kase;&quot; Egg Custard, Pumpkin
and Molasses pie.</p>

<p>Pies were made of all the different fruits and berries which grew on
the farm. When fresh fruits were not obtainable, dried fruits and
berries were used. Pie made from dried, sour cherries was an especial
favorite of Farmer Landis, and raisin or &quot;Rosina&quot; pie, as it was
usually called at the farm, also known as &quot;Funeral&quot; pie, was a standby
at all seasons of the year, as it was invariably served at funerals,
where, in old times, sumptuous feasts were provided for relatives and
friends, a regular custom for years among the &quot;Pennsylvania Germans,&quot;
and I have heard Aunt Sarah say, &quot;In old times, the wives of the
grave-diggers were always expected to assist with the extra baking at
the house where a funeral was to be held.&quot;</p>

<p>It would seem as if Bucks County German housewives did not like a
dessert without a crust surrounding it.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania German farmers' wives, with few exceptions, serve the
greatest variety of pies at a meal of any class of people I know; not
alone as a dessert at twelve o'clock dinner, but frequently serve
several different varieties of pie at breakfast and at each meal
during the day. No ill effects following the <a name='Page_109'></a>frequent eating of pie I
attribute to their active life, the greater part of which, during the
day, was usually spent in the open air, and some credit may he due the
housewife for having acquired the knack of making <i>good</i> pie crust,
which was neither very rich nor indigestible, if such a thing be
possible.</p>

<p>The combination of fruit and pastry called pie is thought to be of
American invention. Material for pies at a trifling cost were
furnished the early settlers in Bucks County by the large supply of
fruit and vegetables which their fertile farms produced, and these
were utilized by the thrifty German housewives, noted for their wise
management and economy.</p>

<p>The Professor's wife taught Mary to make superior pastry, so flaky and
tender as to fairly melt in one's mouth; but Mary never could learn
from her the knack of making a dainty, crimped edge to her pies with
thumb and forefinger, although it looked so very simple when she
watched &quot;Frau Schmidt&quot; deftly roll over a tiny edge as a finish to the
pie.</p>

<p>Mary laughingly told the Professor's wife (when speaking of pies) of
the brilliant remark she made about lard, on first coming to the farm.
Her Aunt Sarah, when baking pies one day, said to her, &quot;Look, Mary,
see this can of snowy lard, rendered from pork, obtained from our fat
pigs last winter!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Aunt Sarah!&quot; exclaimed Mary, &quot;is lard made from pork fat? I
always thought lard was made from milk and butter was made from
cream.&quot;</p>

<p>The Professor's wife possessed, besides a liking for pies, the
German's fondness for anything pertaining to fritters. She used a set
of &quot;wafer and cup irons&quot; for making &quot;Rosen Kuchen,&quot; as she called the
flat, saucer-like wafer; and the cup used for serving creamed
vegetables, salads, etc., was similar to pattie cases.</p>

<p>&quot;The 'Wafer and Cup Irons,'&quot; said Frau Schmidt, &quot;were invented by a
friend of mine, also a teacher and an excellent cook, besides; she
gave me several of her original recipes, all to be served on wafers or
in patties. You shall have a set of the irons when you start
housekeeping. Mary. You will be surprised at the many uses you will
find for them. They are somewhat similar to Rosette Irons, but I think
them an improvement. They are pieces of fluted steel fastened to a
long handle and one is cup-shaped. This latter is particularly fine
for making <a name='Page_110'></a>patties. Then the cup may be filled and served on
saucer-like wafers, which I call 'Rosen Kuchen,' or the 'Rosen Kuchen'
may be simply dusted with a mixture consisting of one cup of sugar,
one teaspoonful of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoonful of powdered
cardamon seed, and served on a plate, as dainty cakes or wafers.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah, when cooking fritters, always used two-thirds lard and
one-third suet for deep frying, but &quot;Frau Schmidt&quot; taught Mary to use
a good brand of oil for this purpose, as she thought food fried in oil
more digestible and wholesome than when fried in lard. The patties or
wafers were easily made. &quot;Frau Schmidt&quot; placed the long-handled iron
in hot fat, the right temperature for frying fritters. When the iron
was heated she quickly and carefully wiped off any surplus fat, then
at once dipped the hot wafer iron into a bowl containing the batter
she had prepared (the recipe for which she gave Mary), then dipped the
iron into the hot fat; when the batter had lightly browned she gently
dropped it from the iron onto brown paper, to absorb any fat which
might remain. These are quickly and easily prepared and, after a few
trials, one acquires proficiency. Pattie cases or cup-shapes are made
in a similar manner. They are not expensive and may be kept several
weeks in a cool, dry place. When wanted for table use, place in a hot
oven a few minutes to reheat. They make a dainty addition to a
luncheon by simply dusting the &quot;Rosen Kuchen&quot; with pulverised sugar.
Creamed vegetables of any variety may be served on them by placing a
spoon of cream dressing on top of each, over which grate yolk of hard
boiled egg; or use as a foundation on which to serve salads; or serve
fruit on them with whipped cream. The patties or cups may be used to
serve creamed chicken, oysters, or sweetbreads if no sugar be used in
the batter. These pattie cases are exactly like those sold at
delicatessen counters, in city stores, and are considered quite an
addition to a dainty luncheon. They are rather expensive to buy, and
we country housewives cannot always procure them when wanted, and they
may be made at home with a small amount of labor and less expense.</p>

<p>&quot;The Germans make fritters of almost everything imaginable,&quot; continued
the Professor's wife. &quot;One day in early Spring I saw a German neighbor
gathering elderberry blossoms, of which she said she intended making
fritters. I asked her how they were <a name='Page_111'></a>made, being curious, I will
confess. She sent me a plate of the fritters and they were delicious.
I will give you her recipe should you care for it. Mary, have you ever
eaten a small, sweet wafer called 'Zimmet Waffle?' My mother made them
at Christmas time, in Germany. Should I be able to procure a small
'waffle,' or I should call it wafer, iron, in the city, I will teach
you how they are made. I think them excellent. My mother made a cake
dough similar to that of pound cake. To one portion she added
cinnamon, to the other chocolate, and the last portion was flavored
with vanilla. A piece of dough the size of a small marble was placed
in the wafer iron, which was then pressed together and held over the
fire in the range, by a long handle, until the wafer was crisp and
brown. They are delicious and will keep indefinitely.&quot;</p>

<p>The Professor's wife finished speaking to Mary, and turned to her
daughter Elizabeth, saying, &quot;It is time I mix the dough if we are to
have 'Boova Shenkel' for dinner today. I see the potatoes have steamed
tender.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, goody!&quot; said Pauline, &quot;I just love 'Boova Shenkel!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; said her Mother, &quot;run down into the cellar and get me three
eggs for them, and Mary, I'll write off the recipe for you, if you
wish it, as I feel sure you'll like them as well as Pauline. And
Elizabeth, dust powdered sugar over this plate of 'Rosen Kuchen,' and
you, Mary and Pauline, leave this hot kitchen and have lunch out in
the 'Espalier,' as your Father calls it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think,&quot; said Mary to Elizabeth, after they were seated in the
shade, prepared to enjoy the &quot;Rosen Kuchen,&quot; &quot;this little, natural,
home-grown summer-house is the oddest and prettiest little place I've
ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; assented Elizabeth, &quot;Father said he made it as nearly like as
possible to a large one at Weisbaden, no great distance from his old
home in Germany. He says the 'Frauer Esche,' meaning Weeping Ash, at
Weisbaden, had tables and benches placed beneath spreading branches of
the tree, and picnics were frequently held there. This one was made by
the larger branches of the Weeping Ash, turning downward, fastened by
pieces of leather to a framework nailed to the top of posts in the
ground, about two yards apart, surrounding the tree. The posts, you
notice, are just a little higher than an ordinary man, and when the
leaves thickly cover the tops and sides, protecting one from <a name='Page_112'></a>the
sun's rays, it is an ideal Summer-house. We frequently sit here
evenings and afternoons; Mother brings her sewing and Pauline her doll
family, which, you know, is quite numerous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never saw a Summer-house at all like it,&quot; said Mary.</p>

<p>The Professor's wife not only taught Mary the making of superior
pastry and the cooking of German dishes, but what was of still greater
importance, taught her the value of different foods; that cereals of
every description, flour and potatoes, are starchy foods; that cream,
butter, oil, etc., are fat foods; that all fruits and vegetables
contain mineral matter; and that lean meat, eggs, beans, peas and milk
are muscle-forming foods. These are things every young housekeeper
should have a knowledge of to be able to plan nourishing, wholesome,
well-balanced meals for her family. And not to serve at one time a
dish of rice, cheese and macaroni, baked beans and potatoes. Serve
instead with one of these dishes fruit, a vegetable or salad. She
said, &quot;beans have a large percentage of nutriment and should be more
commonly used.&quot; She also said graham and corn bread are much more
nutritious than bread made from fine white flour, which lacks the
nutritious elements. Indian corn is said to contain the largest amount
of fat of any cereal. It is one of our most important cereal foods and
should be more commonly used by housewives; especially should it be
used by working men whose occupation requires a great amount of
physical exercise. Particularly in cold weather should it be
frequently served, being both cheap and wholesome.</p>

<p>The Professor's wife laughingly remarked to Mary, &quot;When I fry fritters
or 'Fast Nacht' cakes, Fritz and Pauline usually assist such a large
number of them in disappearing before I have finished baking, I am
reminded of 'Doughnutting Time,' by J.W. Foley. Have you never read
the poem? I sometimes feel that it must have been written by me.&quot;</p>

<br />
<p>The Professor's wife gave Mary what she called her most useful recipe.
She said, &quot;Mary, this recipe was almost invaluable to me when I was a
young housekeeper and the strictest economy was necessary. Sift into a
bowl, one cup of flour, one even teaspoonful of baking powder (I use
other baking powders occasionally, but prefer 'Royal'), then cut
through the flour either one tablespoonful of butter or lard, add a
pinch of salt, and mix into a soft dough with about one-half cup of
sweet milk. Mix dough <a name='Page_114'></a>quickly and lightly, handling as little as
possible. Drop large spoonfuls of the batter in muffin pans and bake
in a quick oven for tea biscuits; or, sift flour thickly over the
bread board, turn out the dough, roll several times in the flour, give
one quick turn with the rolling-pin to flatten out dough, and cut out
with small cake cutter, (I prefer using a small, empty tin,  pound
baking powder can, to cut out cakes.) Place close together in an agate
pan and bake, or bake in one cake in a pie tin and for shortcake; or
place spoonfuls of the dough over veal or beef stew and potatoes or
stewed chicken, and cook, closely covered, about fifteen minutes. Of
course, you will have sufficient water in the stew pan to prevent its
boiling away before the pot-pie dumplings are cooked, and, of course,
you know, Mary, the meat and potatoes must be almost ready to serve
when this dough is added. Then I frequently add one teaspoonful of
sugar to the batter and place spoonfuls over either freshly stewed or
canned sour cherries, plums, rhubarb or apples. In fact, any tart
fruit may be used, and steam, closely covered, or place large
tablespoonful of any fruit, either canned or stewed, in small custard
cups, place tablespoonfuls of batter on top and steam or bake, and
serve with either some of the stewed fruit and fruit juice, sugar and
cream, or any sauce preferred.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The varieties of puddings which may be evolved from this one
formula,&quot; continued the Professor's wife, &quot;are endless, and, Mary, I
should advise you to make a note of it. This quantity of flour will
make enough to serve two at a meal, and the proportions may be easily
doubled if you wish to serve a large family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, Mary, I have a recipe taken from the 'Farmers' Bulletin' for
dumplings, which I think fine. You must try it some time. Your Aunt
Sarah thinks them 'dreadfully extravagant.' They call for four
teaspoonfuls of baking powder to two cups of flour, but they are
perfect puff balls, and this is such a fast age, why not use more
baking powder if an advantage? I am always ready to try anything new I
hear about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Mary, &quot;I just love to try new recipes, I will
experiment with the dumplings one of these days. Aunt Sarah says I
will never use half the recipes I have; but so many of them have been
given me by excellent and reliable old Bucks County cooks, I intend to
copy them all in a book, and keep for reference after I leave the
farm.&quot;</p>

<h3>OLD POTTERIES AND DECORATED DISHES.</h3>
<br />

<p>One day, looking through the old corner cupboard, Mary exclaimed,
&quot;Aunt Sarah, you certainly possess the finest collection of quaint old
china dishes I have ever seen. I just love those small saucers and
cups without handles; yes, and you have plates to match decorated with
pinkish, lavender peacock feathers, and those dear little cups and
saucers, decorated inside with pink and outside with green flowers,
are certainly odd; and this queerly-shaped cream jug, sugar bowl and
teapot, with pale green figures, and those homely plates, with dabs of
bright red and green, they surely must be very old!&quot;</p>

<center>
<img src='images/147.jpg' width='307' height='299' alt='Old Earthenware Dish' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear, they all belonged to either John's mother or mine. All
except this one large, blue plate, which is greatly valued by me, as
it was given me many years ago by a dear old friend, Mary Butler, a
descendant of one of the oldest families in Wyoming Valley, whose,
forefathers date back to the time of the 'Wyoming Massacre,' about
which so much has been written in song and story.</p>

<p>&quot;The very oddest plates in your collection are those two large
earthenware dishes, especially that large circular dish, with sloping
sides and flat base, decorated with tulips.&quot;</p>

</center>

<p>&quot;Yes, Mary, and it is the one I value most highly. It is called
sgraffito ware. A tulip decoration surrounds a large red star in <a name='Page_116'></a>the
centre of the plate. This belonged to my mother, who said it came from
the Headman pottery at Rockhill Township, about the year 1808. I know
of only two others in existence at the present time; one is in a
museum in the city of Philadelphia and the other one is in the Bucks
County Historical Society at Doylestown, Pa. The other earthenware
plate you admire, containing marginal inscription in German which when
translated is 'This plate is made of earth, when it breaks the potter
laughs,' is the very oldest in my collection, the date on it, you see,
is 1786. Those curved, shallow earthenware pie plates, or 'Poi
Schissel,' as they are frequently called in this part of Bucks County,
I value, even if they are quite plain and without decoration, as they
were always used by my mother when baking pies, and I never thought
pies baked in any other shaped dish tasted equally as good as hers.
These pie plates were manufactured at one of the old potteries near
her home. All the old potters have passed away, and the buildings have
crumbled to the ground. Years ago, your mother and I, when visiting
the old farm where the earlier years of our childhood were passed,
stopped with one of our old-time friends, who lived <a name='Page_117'></a>directly opposite
the old Herstine pottery, which was then in a very dilapidated
condition; it had formerly been operated by Cornelius Herstine (we
always called him 'Neal' Herstine).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Together we crossed the road, forced our way through tangled vines
and underbrush, and, peering through windows guiltless of glass, we
saw partly-finished work of the old potters crumbling on the ground.
The sight was a sad one. We realized the hand of time had crumbled to
dust both the potter and his clay. Still nearer my old home was the
McEntee pottery. From earliest childhood our families were friends. We
all attended the 'Crossroads' School, where years later a more modern
brick structure was built, under the hill; not far distant from 'The
Narrows' and the 'Ringing Rocks.' Yes, Mary, my memory goes back to
the time when the McEntee pottery was a flourishing industry, operated
by three brothers, John, Patrick and Michael. When last I visited them
but few landmarks remained.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was there a pottery on your father's farm, Aunt Sarah?&quot; inquired
Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;No. The nearest one was the McEntee pottery, but the grandson of the
old man who purchased our old farm at my father's death had a limekiln
for the purpose of burning lime, and several miles distant, at the
home of my uncle, was found clay suitable for the manufacture of
bricks. Only a few years ago this plant was still in operation. My
father's farm was situated in the upper part of Bucks County, in what
was then known as the Nockamixon Swamp, and at one time there were in
that neighborhood no less than seven potteries within two miles of
each other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; exclaimed Mary, &quot;were there so many potteries in that
locality?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Twas due, no doubt, to the large deposits of clay found there, well
suited to the manufacture of earthenware. The soil is a clayey loam,
underlaid with potter's clay. The old German potters, on coming to
this country, settled mostly in Eastern Pennsylvania, in the counties
of Bucks and Montgomery. The numerous small potteries erected by the
early settlers were for the manufacture of earthenware dishes, also
pots of graded sizes. These were called nests, and were used
principally on the farm for holding milk, cream and apple-butter. Jugs
and pie plates were also manufactured. The plates were visually quite
plain, but they pro<a name='Page_118'></a>duced occasionally plates decorated with
conventionalized tulips, and some, more elaborate, contained besides
figures of animals, birds and flowers. Marginal inscriptions in
English and German decorate many of the old plates, from which may be
learned many interesting facts concerning the life and habits of the
early settlers. I think, judging from the inscriptions I have seen on
some old plates, it must have taxed the ingenuity of the old German
potters to think up odd, original inscriptions for their plates.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, how was sgraffito ware made? Is it the same as
slip-decorated pottery?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, my dear, the two are quite different. The large plate you so
greatly admired is called sgraffito or scratched work, sometimes
called slip engraving. It usually consists of dark designs on a
cream-colored ground. After the plates had been shaped over the mold
by the potter, the upper surface was covered by a coating of white
slip, and designs were cut through this slip to show the earthenware
underneath. This decoration was more commonly used by the old potters
than slip decorating, which consisted in mixing white clay and water
until the consistency of cream. The liquid clay was then allowed to
run slowly through a quill attached to a small cup, over the
earthenware (before burning it in a kiln) to produce different
designs. The process is similar to that used when icing a cake, when
you allow the icing to run slowly from a pastry tube to form fanciful
designs. I have watched the old potters at their work many a time when
a child. The process employed in the manufacture of earthenware is
almost the same today as it was a century ago, but the appliances of
the present day workmen are not so primitive as were those of the old
German potters. Mary, a new pottery works has been started quite
lately in the exact locality where, over one hundred years ago, were
situated the Dichl and Headman potteries, where my highly-prized, old
sgraffito plate was manufactured. I hear the new pottery has improved
machinery for the manufacture of vases, flower pots, tiles, etc. They
intend manufacturing principally 'Spanish tiles' from the many acres
of fine clay found at that place. The clay, it is said, burns a
beautiful dark, creamy red. As you are so much interested in this
subject, Mary, we shall visit this new pottery some day in the near
future, in company with your Uncle John. It is no great distance from
the farm. Quite an interesting story I have heard in connection with a
pottery <a name='Page_119'></a>owned by a very worthy Quaker in a near-by town may interest
you, as your father was a Philadelphia Quaker and Ralph's parents were
Quakers also.&quot;</p>

<h3>A-38 Schmutz Amschel<br />
A-39 Antiquated Tin Lantern<br />
A-40 Schmutz Amschel<br />
A-41 Fluid Lamp<br />
A-42 Candle Mould</h3>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed, Aunt Sarah! I'd love to hear the story.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This Quaker sympathized with the colored race, or negroes, in the
South. This was, of course, before slavery was abolished. You don't
remember that time, Mary, You are too young. It is only history to
you, but I lived it, and when the slaves ran away from their owners
and came North to Philadelphia they were sent from there, by
sympathizers, to this Quaker, who kept an underground station. The
slaves were then placed, under his direction, in a high 'pot wagon,'
covered with layers or nests of earthenware pots of graduated sizes. I
heard the driver of one of these pot wagons remark one time that when
going down a steep hill, he put on the brake and always held his
breath until the bottom of the hill was reached, fearing the pots
might all be broken. The wagon-load containing earthenware and slaves
was driven to Stroudsburg, where the pots were delivered to a
wholesale customer. Here the runaways were released from their cramped
quarters and turned over to sympathizing friends, who assisted them in
reaching Canada and safety. I have frequently met the fine-looking,
courtly old gentleman who owned the pottery, and old Zacariah Mast,
the skilled German potter whom he employed. They were for many years
familiar figures in the little Quaker town, not many miles distant.
Both passed away many years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary, who still continued her explorations of the corner cupboard,
exclaimed: &quot;Oh! Aunt Sarah! Here is another odd, old plate, way back
on the lop shelf, out of sight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear, that belonged to your Uncle John's mother. It has never
been used and was manufactured over one hundred years ago at an old
pottery in Bedminister Township, Bucks County. Some of those other
quaint, old-fashioned plates also belonged to John's mother. Your
Uncle loves old dishes and especially old furniture; he was so anxious
to possess his grandfather's old 'Solliday' clock. In the centre of
the face of the clock a hand indicated the day of the month and
pictures of two large, round moons on the upper part of the clock's
face (resembling nothing so much as large, ripe peaches) represented
the different phases of the moon. If new moon, or the first or last
quar<a name='Page_120'></a>ter, it appeared, then disappeared from sight. It was valued
highly, being the last clock made by the old clockmaker; but John
never came into possession of it, as it was claimed by an elder
sister. I value the old clock which stands in the parlor because 'twas
my mother's, although it is very plain. This old cherry, corner
cupboard was made for my grandmother by her father, a cabinetmaker, as
a wedding gift, and was given me by my mother. Did you notice the
strong, substantial manner in which it is made? It resembles mission
furniture.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do tell me, Aunt, what this small iron boat, on the top shelf, was
ever used for? It must be of value, else 'twould not occupy a place in
the cupboard with all your pretty dishes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dearie, 'twas my grandmother's lamp, called in old times a
'Schmutz Amschel' which, translated, means a grease robin, or bird. I
have two of them. I remember seeing my grandmother many a time, when
the 'Amschel' was partly filled with melted lard or liquid fat, light
a piece of lamp wick hanging over the little pointed end or snout of
the lamp. The lamp was usually suspended from a chain fastened to
either side. A spike on the chain was stuck into the wall, which was
composed of logs. This light, by the way, was not particularly
brilliant, even when one sat close beside it, and could not be
compared with the gas and electric lights of our present day and
generation. That was a very primitive manner of illumination used by
our forefathers.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, did you notice the gayly-decorated, old-fashioned coffee pot
and tea caddy in the corner cupboard? They belonged to my grandmother;
also that old-fashioned fluid lamp, used before coal-oil or kerosene
came into use; and that old, perforated tin lantern also is very
ancient.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, have you ever read the poem, The Potter and the Clay?' No? Then
read it to me, dear, I like it well; 'tis a particular favorite of
mine, I do not remember by whom it was written.&quot;</p>

<h3>THE VALUE OF WHOLESOME, NUTRITIOUS FOOD.</h3>
<br />

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear,&quot; said Frau Schmidt (continuing a conversation which had
occurred several days previously between herself and Mary), &quot;we will
have more healthful living when the young housewife of the present day
possesses a knowledge of different food values (those food products
from which a well-balanced meal may be prepared) for the different
members of her household. She should endeavor to buy foods which are
most nourishing and wholesome; these need not necessarily consist of
the more expensive food products. Cheaper food, if properly cooked,
may have as fine a flavor and be equally as nutritious as that of
higher price.</p>

<p>&quot;And, Mary, when you marry and have a house to manage, if possible, do
your own marketing, and do not make the mistake common to so many
young, inexperienced housewives, of buying more expensive food than,
your income will allow. Some think economy in purchasing food
detrimental to their dignity and to the well-being of their families;
often the ones most extravagant in this respect are those least able
to afford it. Frequently the cause of this is a lack of knowledge of
the value of different foods. The housewife with a large family and
limited means should purchase cheaper cuts of meat, which become
tender and palatable by long simmering. Combine them with different
vegetables, cooked in the broth, and serve as the principal dish at a
meal, or occasionally serve dumplings composed of a mixture of flour
and milk, cooked in the broth, to extend the meat flavor. Frequently
serve a dish of rice, hominy, cornmeal and oatmeal, dried beans and
peas. These are all nutritious, nourishing foods when properly cooked
and attractively served. And remember, Mary, to always serve food well
seasoned. Many a well-cooked meal owes its failure to please to a lack
of proper seasoning. This is a lesson a young cook must learn. Neither
go to the other extreme and salt food too liberally. Speaking of salt,
my dear, have you read the poem, 'The King's Daughters,' by Margaret
Vandegrift? If not, read it, and then copy it in your book of
recipes.&quot;</p>
<br />

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_123'></a>THE KING'S DAUGHTERS.&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>The King's three little daughters, 'neath the palace window straying,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Had fallen into earnest talk that put an end to playing;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And the weary King smiled once again to hear what they were saying;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>&quot;It is I who love our father best,&quot; the eldest daughter said;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>&quot;I am the oldest princess,&quot; and her pretty face grew red;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>&quot;What is there none can do without? I love him more than bread.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Then said the second princess, with her bright blue eyes aflame;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>&quot;Than bread, a common thing like bread! Thou hast not any shame!<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Glad am I, it is I, not thou, called by our mother's name;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>I love him with a better love than one so tame as thine,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>More than&mdash;Oh! what then shall I say that is both bright and fine?<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And is not common? Yes, I know. I love him more than wine.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Then the little youngest daughter, whose speech would sometimes halt,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>For her dreamy way of thinking, said, &quot;Nay, you are both in fault.<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>'Tis I who love our father best, I love him more than salt.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Shrill little shrieks of laughter greeted her latest word,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>As the two joined hands exclaiming. &quot;But this is most absurd!&quot;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And the King, no longer smiling, was grieved that he had heard,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>For the little youngest daughter, with her eyes of steadfast grey,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Could always move his tenderness, and charm his care away;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>&quot;She grows more like her mother dead,&quot; he whispered day by day,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>&quot;But she is very little and I will find no fault,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>That while her sisters strive to see who most shall me exalt,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>She holds me nothing dearer than a common thing like salt.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>The portly cook was standing in the courtyard by the spring,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>He winked and nodded to himself, &quot;That little quiet thing<br /></span>

<span class='i4'>That afternoon, at dinner, there was nothing fit to eat.<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>The King turned angrily away from soup and fish and meat,<br /></span>

<h3>A VARIETY OF CAKES EVOLVED FROM ONE</h3>
<br />

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah,&quot; questioned Mary one day, &quot;will you tell me how it is
possible to evolve a number of cakes from one recipe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly I will, my dear,&quot; said her Aunt. &quot;For instance, take the
simple recipe from which I have for years baked layer cake. You may
have other recipes given you, equally as good, but I feel positive
none better. The cake made from this recipe is not rich enough to be
unwholesome, but a good, reliable, inexpensive, easily-made cake, with
which I have never had a failure.</p>

<p>&quot;The recipe, as you know, consists of 1 cups of granulated sugar,
 cup of a mixture of butter and sweet lard (or use all butter), 
cup sweet milk, 2 cups flour and 2 teaspoonfuls baking powder. 3 eggs.</p>

<p>&quot;The simplest manner of baking this cake is in two square cake pans.
When baked, take from pans and ice each cake with a boiled chocolate
icing and put together as a layer cake, or ice each cake with a plain,
boiled white icing and, when this is cold, you may spread over top of
each cake unsweetened chocolate, which has been melted over steam
after being grated. When cake is to be served, cut in diamonds or
squares. Or add to the batter 1 cup of chopped hickory nut meats, bake
in 2 layers and cut in squares.</p>

<p>&quot;For a chocolate loaf cake, add two generous tablespoonfuls of
unsweetened melted chocolate to the batter just before baking. If you
wish a chocolate layer cake, use the same batter as for the chocolate
loaf cake, bake in two layer pans and put together with white boiled
icing.</p>

<p>&quot;Or, add to this same batter one scant teaspoonful of cinnamon,
ginger,  teaspoonful of grated nutmeg and cloves, a cup of raisins
or dried currants, and you have a small fruit cake.</p>

<p>&quot;Or, add a small quantity of thinly-shaved citron to the original
recipe, flavor with lemon, bake in a loaf and spread a white <a name='Page_126'></a>icing
flavored with lemon extract over top of cake, and you have a lemon
cake.</p>

<p>&quot;Or, add chocolate and spices to one-half the batter (about one-half
as much chocolate and spices as were used in batter for fruit cake)
and place spoonfuls of the light and dark batter alternately in a cake
pan, until all batter has been used, and you will have a cheap,
old-fashioned Marble cake.</p>

<p>&quot;Or, bake cake over original recipe, in two-layer pans, placing
between layers either tart jelly, a creamy cornstarch filling, grated
cocoanut, apple cream filling, or you might even use half the recipe
given for the delicious icing or filling for Lady Baltimore cake.</p>

<p>&quot;Lastly, bake small cakes from this same recipe. Mary, you should have
small pans for baking these delicious little cakes, similar to those I
possess, which I ordered made at the tinsmith's. I took for a pattern
one Frau Schmidt loaned me. They are the exact size of one-quarter
pound boxes of Royal baking powder. Cut the box in three pieces of
equal height, and your cakes will be equally as large in diameter as
the baking powder box, but only one-third as high. I think I improved
on Frau Schmidt's cake tins, as hers were all separate, I ordered
twelve tins, similar to hers, to be fastened to a piece of sheet iron.
I had two of these iron sheets made, containing twenty-four little
pans. I place a generous tablespoonful of the batter in each of the
twenty-four small pans, and cakes rise to the top of pans. Usually I
have batter remaining after these are filled. Ice all the cake except
the top with a white boiled icing or chocolate icing. These small
cakes keep exceedingly well, and are always liked by young folks and
are particularly nice for children's parties&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of cakes, Aunt Sarah,&quot; said Mary, &quot;have you ever used
Swansdown cake flour? I have a friend in the city who uses it for
making the most delicious Angel cake, and she gave me a piece of Gold
cake made over a recipe in 'Cake Secrets,' which comes with the flour,
and it was fine. I'll get a package of the flour for you the first
time I go to the city. The flour resembles a mixture of ordinary flour
and cornstarch. It is not a prepared flour, to be used without baking
powder, and you use it principally for baking cakes. I have the recipe
for both the Gold and Angel cakes, with the instructions for baking
same. They are as follows:&quot;</p>
<br />

<p><a name='Page_127'></a>ANGEL CAKE.</p>

<p>&quot;For the Angel cake, use one even cupful of the whites of egg (whites
of either eight large or nine small eggs); a pinch of salt, if added
when beating eggs, hastens the work. One and one-quarter cups
granulated sugar, 1 cup of Iglehart's Swansdown cake flour. Sift flour
once, then measure and sift three times. Beat whites of eggs about
half, add  teaspoonful of cream of tartar then beat whites of eggs
until they will stand of their own weight. Add sugar, then flour, not
by stirring, but by folding over and over, until thoroughly mixed.
Flavor with  teaspoonful of vanilla or a few drops of almond
extract. As much care should be taken in baking an Angel Food cake as
in mixing. Bake in an ungreased patent pan. Place the cake in an oven
that is just warm enough to know there is a fire inside the range. Let
the oven stay just warm through until the batter has raised to the top
of the cake pan, then increase the heat gradually until the cake is
well browned over. If by pressing the top of the cake with the finger
it will spring back without leaving the impression of the finger, the
cake is done through. Great care should be taken that the oven is not
too hot to begin with, as the cake will rise too fast and settle or
fall in the baking. It should bake in from 35 to 40 minutes' time.
When done, invert the pan and let stand until cold before removing it.
Should you see cake browning before it rises to top of pan, throw your
oven door open and let cold air rush in and cool your oven instantly.
Be not afraid. The cold air will not hurt the cake. Two minutes will
cool any oven. Watch cake closely. Don't be afraid to open oven door
every three or four minutes. This is the only way to properly bake
this cake. When cake has raised above top of pan, increase your heat
and finish baking rapidly. Baking too long dries out the moisture,
makes it tough and dry. When cake is done it begins to shrink. Let it
shrink back to level of pan. Watch carefully at this stage and take
out of oven and invert immediately. Rest on centre tube of pan. Let
hang until perfectly cold, then take cake carefully from pan. When
baking Angel cake always be sure the oven bakes good brown under
bottom of cake. If cake does not crust under bottom it will fall out
when inverted and shrink in the fall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never invert my pans of Angel cake on taking them from oven,&quot; said
Mary's Aunt, &quot;as the cakes are liable to fall out even if <a name='Page_128'></a>the pan is
not greased. I think it safer to allow the pans containing the cakes
to stand on a rack and cool without inverting the pan.</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose, Mary, we bake a Gold cake over the recipe from 'Cake
Secrets,' as eggs are plentiful; but we haven't any Swansdown flour. I
think we will wait until we get it from the city.&quot;</p>
<br />

<p>GOLD CAKE.</p>

<p>Yolks of 8 eggs; 1 cups granulated sugar,  cup of butter, 
cup water, 2 cups of Swansdown cake flour, 2 heaping teaspoonfuls
of baking powder,  teaspoonful lemon extract. Sift flour once, then
measure. Add baking powder and sift three times. Cream butter and
sugar thoroughly; beat yolks to a stiff froth; add this to creamed
butter and sugar, and stir thoroughly through. Add flavor, add water,
then flour. Stir very hard. Place in a slow oven at once. Will bake in
from 30 to 40 minutes. Invert pan immediately it is taken from oven.</p>

<p>Mary, this batter may also be baked in layers with any kind of filling
desired. The Angel cake receipt is very similar to an original recipe
Frau Schmidt gave me; she uses cornstarch instead of Swansdown flour
and she measures the eggs in a cup instead of taking a certain number;
she thinks it more exact.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, did you know Frau Schmidt, instead of using flour alone
when baking cakes, frequently uses a mixture of flour and cornstarch?
She sifts together, several times, six cups of flour and one cup of
cornstarch, and uses this instead of using flour alone.</p>

<p>&quot;I dearly love the Professor's wife&mdash;she's been so very good to me,&quot;
exclaimed Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied her Aunt, &quot;she has very many lovable qualities.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary's liking for bright, energetic Frau Schmidt was not greater than
the affection bestowed on Mary by the Professor's wife, who frequently
entertained Mary with tales of her life when a girl in Germany, to all
of which Mary never tired listening. One Aunt, a most estimable woman,
held the position of valued and respected housekeeper and cook for the
Lord Mayor of the city wherein she resided. Another relative, known as
&quot;Schone Anna,&quot; for many years kept an inn named &quot;The Four Seasons,&quot;
noted for <a name='Page_129'></a>the excellent fare served by the fair chatelaine to her
patrons. The inn was made famous by members of the King's household
stopping there while in the town during the Summer months, which was
certainly a compliment to her good cooking. One of the things in which
she particularly excelled was potato cakes raised with yeast. Frau
Schmidt had been given a number of these valuable recipes by her
mother, all of which she offered to Mary. One recipe she particularly
liked was &quot;Fast Nacht Cakes,&quot; which the Professor's wife baked always
without fail on Shrove Tuesday (or &quot;Fast Nacht&quot; day), the day before
the beginning of Lent. This rule was as &quot;unchangeable as the law of
Medes and Persians,&quot; and it would have been a very important event,
indeed, which would have prevented the baking of these toothsome
delicacies on that day.</p>

<h3>OLD TAUFSCHIEN</h3>

<br />

<p>Aunt Sarah had long promised to show Mary her Grandmother's
&quot;Taufschien,&quot; and she reverently handled the large old family Bible,
which contained between its sacred pages the yellowed paper, being the
birth and christening certificate of her grandmother, whom we read was
born in 1785, in Nockamixon Township, was confirmed in 1802, and was
married in 1805 to the man who was later Aunt Sarah's grandfather. The
old certificate was signed by a German Reformed minister named Wack,
who history tells us was the first young man of that denomination to
be <a name='Page_131'></a>ordained to the ministry in America. Folded with this &quot;Taufschien&quot;
is another which has never been filled out. This is printed in German.
Pictures of women, perhaps they are intended to represent angels, with
golden wings, clothed in loose-flowing crimson drapery and holding
harps in their hands; birds with gayly-colored plumage of bluish
green, crimson and yellow, perched on branches of what presumably
represent cherry trees, also decorate the page. Religious hymns
printed on the &quot;Taufschiens,&quot; encircled with gay stripes of light blue
and yellow, dotted with green, further embellish them. On one we read:</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;Infinite joy or endless woe,<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>Attend on every breath;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And yet, how unconcerned we go<br /></span>
<span class='i6'>Upon the brink of death.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;Mary, this old 'Taufschien' of my grandmother's is one of my most
cherished possessions. Would you like to see your Uncle's old deed,
which he came into possession of when he inherited the farm from his
father?&quot;</p>

<p>Carefully unfolding the stiff old parchment or pigskin deed, yellowed
and brown spotted with age, Mary could faintly decipher the writing
wherein, beautifully written, old-fashioned penmanship of two hundred
years ago stated that a certain piece of land in Bucks County,
Beginning at a Chestnut Oak, North to a post; then East to a large
rock, and on the South unsettled land, which in later years was
conveyed to John Landis.</p>

<p>&quot;This deed,&quot; said Mary's Aunt, &quot;was given in 1738, nearly two hundred
years ago, by John, Thomas and Richard Penn, sons of William Penn by
his second marriage, which occurred in America. His eldest son, John
Penn, you have no doubt heard, was called 'The American,' he having
been born in this country before William Penn's return to Europe,
where he remained fifteen years, as you've no doubt heard.&quot;</p>

<p>At the bottom of the deed a blue ribbon has been slipped through cuts
in the parchment, forming a diamond which incloses what is supposed to
be the signature of Thomas Penn.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Sarah, I am not surprised that you value this old deed of the
farm and these 'Taufschiens' of your grandmother I should frame them,
so they may be preserved by future generations.&quot;</p>

<h3>THE OLD STORE ON THE RIDGE ROAD.</h3>
<br />

<p>Aunt Sarah found in Mary a willing listener when talking of the time
in years past when her grandfather kept a small &quot;Country Store&quot; on the
Ridge Road in Bucks County. She also remembered, when a child of ten,
accompanying her grandfather on one of his trips when he drove to
Philadelphia to purchase goods for his store.</p>

<p>&quot;They had no trolley cars in those days?&quot; asked Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;No, my dear, neither did they have steam cars between the different
towns and cities as we have now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At grandfather's store could be bought both groceries and dry goods.
The surrounding farmers' wives brought to the store weekly fresh print
butter, eggs, pot cheese and hand-case, crocks of apple-butter, dried
sweet corn, beans, cherries, peach and apple 'Snitz,' taking in
exchange sugar, starch, coffee, molasses, etc. My father tapped his
sugar maples and mother cooked down the syrup until thick, and we used
that in place of molasses. They also took in exchange shaker flannel,
nankeen, indigo blue and 'Simpson' gray calico, which mother
considered superior to any other, both for its washing and wearing
qualities. The farmers who came occasionally to the store to shop for
different members of the family frequently bought whole pieces of
calico of one pattern, and,&quot; affirmed Aunt Sarah, &quot;I knew of one
farmer who bought several whole pieces of one pattern with rather
large figures on a dark wine ground, resembling somewhat the gay
figures on an old paisley shawl. He said 'twas a good, serviceable
color, and more economical to buy it all alike, and remarked: 'What's
the difference, anyway? Calico is calico.' From the same piece of
calico his wife made dresses, aprons and sunbonnets for herself and
daughters, shirts for the farmer and his sons (the boys were young,
fortunately), and patchwork quilts and comfortables from the
remainder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather monotonous, I should think,&quot; said Mary. &quot;I am sur<a name='Page_133'></a>prised his
wife did not make him wear coat and trousers made from the same piece
of calico.&quot;</p>

<center>
<img src='images/169.jpg' width='528' height='388' alt='THE OLD STORE ON RIDGE ROAD' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;The dry goods,&quot; continued Aunt Sarah, &quot;retained the scent of coffee,
cheese and dried fruits some time after being purchased but no one
minded that in those days. I still remember how perfectly wonderful to
me when a child appeared the large, wide-mouthed glass jars containing
candy. There were red and white striped mint sticks, striped yellow
and white lemon sticks and hoarhound and clear, wine-colored sticks
striped with lines of white, flavored with anise-seed. One jar
contained clear lemon-colored 'Sour Balls,' preferred by us children
on account of their lasting qualities, as also were the jujubees,
which resembled nothing so much as gutta percha, and possessed equally
as fine flavor; also pink and yellow sugar-frosted gumdrops. In a case
at one end of the counter were squares of thick white paper covered
with rows of small pink, also white, 'peppermint buttons,' small
sticks, two inches in length, of chewing gum in waxed paper, a white,
tasteless, crystalline substance resembling paraffine. What longing
eyes I frequently cast at the small scalloped cakes of maple <a name='Page_134'></a>sugar,
prohibitive as regards cost. They sold for a nickel, am I was always
inordinately fond of maple sugar, but the price was prohibitive. I
seldom possessed more than a penny to spend in those days, and not
always that. Father raised a large family, money was never plentiful,
and we relished the plain, cheap candies usually sold in those days
more than many children of the present day do the finest and most
expensive cream chocolates, to many of whom in this extravagant age a
dollar is not valued more highly than was a penny by us in years gone
by. And 'Candy Secrets!' I don't believe you know what they are like.
I've not seen any for years. They were small, square pieces of
taffy-like candy, wrapped in squares of gilt or silver paper,
inclosing a small strip of paper containing a couple of sentimental
lines or jingle. Later came 'French Secrets.' They consisted of a
small oblong piece of candy about an inch in length, wrapped in tissue
paper of different colors, having fringed ends, twisted together at
either end. These also inclosed a tiny strip of paper containing a
line or two. Small, white candy hearts contained the words in pink
letters, 'Little Sweetheart,' 'I Love You,' 'Name the Day,' etc. These
were invariably distributed among the young folks at small parties and
created no end of merriment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, old as I am, I still remember the delight I experienced when a
little, rosy-cheeked urchin surreptitiously passed me around the
corner of my desk at the old 'Cross Roads School' a 'Secret,' with the
words, 'Do you love me?' My grandmother always kept a supply of
hoarhound and peppermint lozenges in her knitting basket to give us
children should we complain of hoarseness. My, but 'twas astonishing
to hear us all cough until grandmother's supply of mints was
exhausted. I think. Mary, I must have had a 'sweet tooth' when a
child, as my recollections seem to be principally about the candy kept
in my grandfather's store. I suppose in those early days of my
childhood candy appealed to me more than anything else, as never
having had a surfeit of sweets, candy to me was a rare treat. I
remember, Mary, when a little child, my thrifty mother, wishing to
encourage me to learn to knit my own stockings, she, when winding the
skein of German yarn into a ball, occasionally wound a penny in with
the yarn. I was allowed to spend the penny only after I had knitted
the yarn and the penny had fallen from the ball. What untold wealth
that penny represented! And planning how to <a name='Page_135'></a>spend it was greater
pleasure still. Many a pair of long old-fashioned, dark blue and
red-striped stockings, were finished more quickly than otherwise would
have been done without the promised reward. I became proficient in
knitting at an early age,&quot; continued Aunt Sarah; &quot;a truly feminine
occupation, and as I one time heard a wise old physician remark,
'Soothing to the nerves,' which I know to be true, having knitted many
a worry into the heel of a sock. I learned at an early age the value
of money, and once having acquired the saving habit, it is not
possible to be wasteful in later life.&quot;</p>

<h3>AN ELBADRITCHEL HUNT.</h3>
<br />

<p>Fritz Schmidt, like many another Bucks County boy, had frequently
heard the rural tale of a mythical bird called the &quot;Elbadritchel,&quot;
supposed to be abroad, particularly on cold, dark, stormy nights, when
the wind whistled and blew perfect gales around exposed corners of
houses and barns. 'Twas a common saying among &quot;Pennsylvania Germans,&quot;
at such times, &quot;'Tis a fine night to catch 'Elbadritchels.'&quot;</p>

<a name='CATCHING_ELBADRITCHELS'></a><h3>CATCHING ELBADRITCHELS</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/172.jpg' width='500' height='347' alt='CATCHING ELBADRITCHELS' title=''>
</center>

<p>For the information of those who may not even have heard of this
remarkable creature, it is described as being a cross between a
swallow, a goose and a lyre bird. Have you ever seen an
&quot;Elbadritchel?&quot; No one has to my certain knowledge, so I cannot vouch
for the truth of this description of it.</p>

<p>Fritz Schmidt had never taught to question the truth of the tale. So,
when one cold, stormy night several boys from neigh<a name='Page_137'></a>boring farms drove
up to the Schmidt homestead and asked Fritz to join them in a hunt for
&quot;Elbadritchels,&quot; he unhesitatingly agreed to make one of the number,
unaware that he had been selected as the victim of a practical joke,
and, as usual, was one of the jolliest of the crowd. They drove
through a blinding downpour of rain and dismounted on reaching a
lonely hill about three miles distant. They gave Fritz a bag to hold.
It was fashioned of burlap and barrel hoops, inside of which they
placed a lighted candle, and Fritz was instructed how to hold it in
order to attract the &quot;Elbadritchel.&quot; They also gave him a club with
which to strike the bird when it should appear.</p>

<p>The boys scampered off in different directions, ostensibly to chase up
the birds, but in reality they clambered into the waiting wagon and
were rapidly driven home, leaving Fritz alone awaiting the coming of
the &quot;Elbadritchel.&quot; When Fritz realized the trick played on him, his
feelings may be better imagined than described. He trudged home, cold
and tired, vowing vengeance on the boys, fully resolved to get even
with them.</p>

<h3>THE OLD SHANGHAI ROOSTER.</h3>
<br />

<p>Much of Aunt Sarah's spare time was devoted to her chickens, which
fully repaid her for the care given them. She was not particular about
fancy stock, but had quite a variety&mdash;White Leghorns, Brown Leghorns,
big, fat, motherly old Brahma hens that had raised a brood of as many
as thirty-five little chicks at one time, a few snow-white, large
Plymouth Rocks and some gray Barred one. The <i>latter</i> she <i>liked</i>
particularly because she said they were much, more talkative than any
of the others; they certainly did appear to chatter to her when she
fed them. She gave them clean, comfortable quarters, warm bran mash on
cold winter mornings, alternating with cracked corn and &quot;scratch feed&quot;
composed of a mixture of cracked corn, wheat and buckwheat, scattered
over a litter of dried leaves on the floor of the chicken house, so
they were obliged to work hard for their food.</p>

<a name='Old_Egg_Basket'></a><h3>Old Egg Basket</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/174.jpg' width='251' height='225' alt='Old Egg Basket' title=''>
</center>

<p>A plentiful supply of fresh water was always at hand, as well as
cracked oyster shell. She also fed the chickens all scraps from the
table, cutting all meat scraps fine with an old pair of scissors hung
conveniently in the kitchen.</p>

<p>She was very successful with the little chicks hatched out when she
&quot;set&quot; a hen and the yield of eggs from her hens was usually greater
and the eggs larger in size than those of any of her neighbors. This I
attribute to her excellent care of them, generous diet, but
principally to the fact of the elimination of all the roosters among
the flock during the season between the &quot;first of May and December
first,&quot; with one exception. &quot;Brigham,&quot; an <a name='Page_139'></a>immensely large, old, red
Shanghai rooster, a most pompous and dignified old chap. A special pet
of Aunt Sarah's, she having raised him from a valuable &quot;setting&quot; of
eggs given her, and as the egg from which &quot;Brigham,&quot; as he was called,
emerged, was the only one of the lot which proved fertile, he was
valued accordingly and given a longer lease of life than the other
roosters, and was usually either confined or allowed to roam outside
the chicken yard during the summer months; in the winter, being a
swift runner, he usually gobbled up two shares of food before the hens
arrived. That accounted for his great size. The old rooster was also
noted for his loud crowing.</p>

<p>One day in early Spring, John Landis came into the house hurriedly,
saying, &quot;Sarah, your old Shanghai rooster is sick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered his wife, &quot;I missed hearing him crow this morning; he
is usually as regular as an alarm clock.&quot;</p>

<p>She hurried to the barnyard, picked up poor Brigham, wrapped him
carefully in a piece of blanket and laid him in a small shed. The next
morning she was awakened by the lusty crowing of Brigham, who was
apparently as well as ever. The next day the same thing happened. Aunt
Sarah found him, as she supposed, in a dying condition, and the
following morning he was fully recovered. It was quite puzzling until
one day John Landis came into the kitchen laughing heartily and said,
&quot;Sarah, I am sorry to inform you of the intemperate habits of your
pet, Brigham. He is a most disreputable old fellow, and has a liking
for liquor. He has been eating some of the brandied cherries which
were thrown into the barnyard when the jug containing them was
accidentally broken at house cleaning time.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Sarah, old Brigham was not sick at all&mdash;only 'ingloriously'
drunk.&quot; In the fall of the same year Aunt Sarah spied Brigham one day
on top of one of the cider barrels in the shed busily engaged eating
the pummace which issued from the bung-hole of the barrel. John
Landis, on hearing of Brigham's last escapade, decided, as the rooster
was large as an ordinary-turkey, to serve him roasted at Mary's
wedding.</p>

<p>Fritz Schmidt remarked one day in the presence of Sibylla: &quot;Chickens
must possess some little intelligence; they know enough to go to bed
early. Yes, and without an 'alarm clock,' too, Sibylla, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>She walked away without a word to Fritz. The alarm clock <a name='Page_140'></a>was a sore
subject with her, and one about which she had nothing to say. Sibylla
had never quite forgiven Fritz for the prank played on her. He,
happening to hear John Landis tell Sibylla a certain hour he thought a
proper time for Jake Crouthamel to take his departure Sunday evenings,
Fritz conceived the brilliant (?) idea of setting the alarm clock to
&quot;go off&quot; quite early in the evening. He placed the clock at the head
of the stairs, and in the midst of an interesting conversation between
the lovers the alarm sounded with a loud, whizzing noise, which
naturally made quick-tempered Sibylla very angry. She said on seeing
Fritz the next morning: &quot;It was not necessary to set the 'waker' to go
off, as I know enough to send 'Chake' home when it's time.&quot;</p>

<p>Fritz, happening to tell the story to the editor of a small German
Mennonite paper, edited in a near-by town, it was printed in that
paper in German, which caused Sibylla, on hearing it, to be still more
angry at the Professor's son.</p>

<h3>&quot;A POTATO PRETZEL.&quot;</h3>
<br />

<p>In the early part of September Mary's Aunt suggested she try to win
the prize offered at the Farmers' Picnic in a near-by town for the
best &quot;Raised Potato Cake.&quot; Aunt Sarah's rye bread invariably captured
first prize, and she proposed sending both bread and cake with Sibylla
and Jake, who never missed picnic or fair within a radius of one
hundred miles.</p>

<a name='POTATO_PRETZEL'></a><h3>&quot;POTATO PRETZEL&quot;</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/177.jpg' width='452' height='385' alt='&quot;POTATO PRETZEL&quot;' title=''>
</center>

<p>Mary set a sponge the evening of the day preceding that of the picnic,
using recipe for &quot;Perfection Potato Cake,&quot; which Aunt Sarah considered
her best recipe for raised cakes, as 'twas one used by her mother for
many years.</p>

<p>On the day of the picnic, Mary arose at five o'clock, and while her
Aunt was busily engaged setting sponge for her loaf of rye bread, Mary
kneaded down the &quot;potato cake&quot; sponge, set to <a name='Page_142'></a>rise the previous
evening, now rounded over top of bowl and light as a feather.</p>

<p>She filled a couple of pans with buns, molded from the dough, and set
them to rise. She then, under her Aunt's direction, fashioned the
&quot;Pretzel&quot; as follows: She placed a piece of the raised dough on a
large, well-floured bake board, rolled it over and over with both
hands until a long, narrow roll or strip was formed about the width of
two fingers in thickness and placed this strip carefully on the baking
sheet, which was similar to the one on which Aunt Sarah baked rye
bread; shaped the dough to form a figure eight (8) or pretzel,
allowing about two inches of space on either side of baking sheet to
allow for raising. She then cut a piece of dough into three portions,
rolled each as thick as a finger, braided or plaited the three strips
together and placed carefully on top of the figure eight, or pretzel,
not meeting by a space of about two inches. This braided piece on the
top should not be quite as thick as bottom or first piece of the
pretzel. She then rolled three small pieces of dough into tiny strips
or rolls the size of small lead pencils, wound them round and round
and round into small scrolls, moistened the lower side with water to
cause them to adhere, and placed them on the dividing line between the
two halves of the figure eight. She placed an old china coffee cup
without a handle, buttered on outside, in centre of each half of the
figure eight, which kept the pretzel from spreading over the pan. With
a small, new paint brush she brushed over the top of Pretzel and Buns,
a mixture, consisting of one yolk of egg, an equal quantity of cream
or milk (which should be lukewarm so as not to chill the raised dough)
and one tablespoon of sugar. This causes the cakes, etc., to be a rich
brown when baked, a result to be obtained in no other manner.</p>

<p>When the pretzel was raised and had doubled in size 'twas baked in a
moderately hot oven.</p>

<p>Mary's surprise and delight may easily be imagined when Sibylla, on
her return from the picnic, handed her the prize she had won, a
two-pound box of chocolates, remarking, &quot;Mary, you and Aunt Sarah both
got a prize&mdash;her's is in the box what Jake's got.&quot;</p>

<p>The box on being opened by Aunt Sarah contained a very pretty,
silver-plated soup ladle, the prize offered for the best loaf of rye
bread.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name='Page_143'></a>Aunt Sarah,&quot; inquired Mary one day, &quot;do you think it pays a
housekeeper to bake her own bread?&quot;</p>

<a name='LOAF_OF_RYE_BREAD'></a><h3>LOAF OF RYE BREAD</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/179.jpg' width='525' height='315' alt='LOAF OF RYE BREAD' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;Certainly, it pays, my dear. From a barrel of flour may be baked
three hundred or more one-pound loaves of bread; should you pay five
cents a loaf, the bread which may be made from one barrel of flour if
bought from a bake shop would cost you fifteen dollars. Now, you add
to the cost of a barrel of flour a couple of dollars for yeast, salt,
etc., which altogether would not possibly be more than ten dollars,
and you see the housewife has saved five dollars. It is true it is
extra work for the housewife, but good, wholesome bread is such an
important item, especially in a large family, I should advise the
thrifty housekeeper to bake her own bread and bake less pie and cake,
or eliminate less important duties, to be able to find time to bake
bread. From the bread sponge may be made such a number of good, plain
cakes by the addition of currants or raisins, which are more wholesome
and cheaper than richer cakes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think what you say is true, Aunt Sarah,&quot; said Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;Frau Schmidt always bakes her own bread, and she tells me she sets a
sponge or batter for white bread, and by the addition <a name='Page_144'></a>of Graham
flour, cornmeal or oatmeal, always has a variety on her table with a
small expenditure of time and money.&quot;</p>

<h3>FAITHFUL SERVICE.</h3>
<br />

<p>The home-making instinct was so strongly developed in Mary that her
share in the labor of cooking and baking became a pleasure.
Occasionally she had failures&mdash;what inexperienced cook has not?&mdash;yet
they served only to spur her on to fresh efforts. She had several
small scars on her wrist caused by her arm coming in contact with the
hot oven when baking. She laughingly explained: &quot;One bar on my arm
represents that delicious 'Brod Torte' which Frau Schmidt taught me to
bake; the other one I acquired when removing the sponge cake from the
oven which Uncle John said 'equaled Aunt Sarah's' (which I consider
highest praise), and the third bar I received when taking from the
oven the 'Lemon Meringue,' Ralph's favorite pie, which he pronounced
'fine, almost too good to eat.'&quot; Mary was as proud of her scars as a
young, non-commissioned officer of the chevron on his sleeve, won by
deeds of valor.</p>

<p>The lessons Mary learned that summer on the farm while filling her
hope chest and preparing her mind for wifehood were of inestimable
value to her in later years. She learned not only to bake, brew and
keep house, but from constant association with her Aunt she acquired a
self-poise, a calm, serene manner, the value of which is beyond price
in this swift, restless age.</p>

<p>One day, while having a little heart-to-heart talk with Mary, her Aunt
said: &quot;My dear, never allow an opportunity to pass for doing a kind
act. If ever so small, it may cheer some sad, lonely heart. Don't wait
to do <i>big things</i>. The time may never come. If only a kind word,
speak it at once. Kind words cost so little, and we should all be more
prodigal with them; and to a tired, sad, discouraged soul, a kind word
or act means so very much; and who is there that has not at some time
in life known sorrow and felt the need of sympathy? Were our lives all
sunshine we could not feel in touch with sorrowing friends. How
natural it is for our hearts to go out in sympathy to the one who says
'I have suf<a name='Page_146'></a>fered.' Give to your friend the warm hand-clasp and cheery
greeting' which cost us nothing in the giving. 'Tis the little lifts
which help us over stones in our pathway through life. We think our
cross the heaviest when, did we but know the weight of others, we'd
not willingly exchange; and remember Mary, 'there are no crown-bearers
in Heaven that were not cross-bearers below.' Have you ever read the
poem, 'The Changed Cross?' No? Well, I will give it to you to copy in
your book of recipes. Should you ever, in future years, feel your
cross too heavy to bear, read the poem. How many brave, cheery little
women greet us with a smile as they pass. But little do we or any one
realize that instead of a song in their hearts the smiles on their
lips conceal troubles the world does not suspect, seeking to forget
their own sorrows while doing kindly acts for others. They are the
real heroes whom the world does not reward with medals for bravery,
'To stand with a smile upon your face against a stake from which you
cannot get away, that, no doubt, is heroic; but the true glory is not
resignation to the inevitable. To stand unchained, with perfect
liberty to go away, held only by the higher claims of duty, and let
the fire creep up to the heart, that is heroism.' Ah! how many good
women have lived faithful to duty when 'twould have been far easier to
have died!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;THE CHANGED CROSS.&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>It was a time of sadness, and my heart,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Although it knew and loved the better part,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Felt wearied with the conflict and the strife,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And all the needful discipline of life.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>And while I thought on these as given to me,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>My trial tests of faith and love to be,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>It seemed as if I never could be sure<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>That faithful to the end I should endure.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>And thus, no longer trusting to His might,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Who says, &quot;We walk by faith and not by sight&quot;;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Doubting and almost yielding to despair,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>The thought arose&mdash;My cross I cannot bear.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>Far heavier its weight must surely be<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Than those of others which I daily see;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Oh! if I might another burden choose,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Methinks I should not fear my crown to lose.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>A solemn silence reigned on all around,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>E'en nature's voices uttered not a sound;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>The evening shadows seemed of peace to tell,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And sleep upon my weary spirit fell.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'><a name='Page_148'></a>A moment's pause and then a heavenly light<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Beamed full upon my wondering, raptured sight;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Angels on silvery wings seemed everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And angels' music filled the balmy air.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>Then One more fair than all the rest to see&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>One to whom all the others bowed the knee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Came gently to me as I trembling lay,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And, &quot;Follow Me!&quot; He said, &quot;I am the Way.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>Then speaking thus, He led me far above,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And there, beneath a canopy of love,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Crosses of divers shapes and sizes were seen,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Larger and smaller than my own had been.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>And one there was, most beauteous to behold,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>A little one, with jewels set in gold;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Ah! this methought, I can with comfort wear,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>For it will be an easy one to bear.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>And so, the little cross I quickly took,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>But all at once, my frame beneath it shook;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>The sparkling jewels fair were they to see,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>But far too heavy was their weight for me.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>&quot;This may not be,&quot; I cried, and looked again<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>To see if there was any here could ease my pain;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>But one by one I passed them slowly by,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Till on a lovely one I cast my eye.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>Fair flowers around its sculptured form entwined,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And grace and beauty seemed in it combined;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Wondering, I gazed and still I wondered more,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>To think so many should have passed it o'er.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>But Oh! that form so beautiful to see,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Soon made its hidden sorrows known to me;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Thorns lay beneath those flowers and colors fair;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Sorrowing, I said. &quot;This cross I may not bear.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'><a name='Page_149'></a>And so it was with each and all around,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Not one to suit my need could there be found;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Weeping, I laid each heavy burden down,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>As my guide gently said: &quot;No cross, no crown.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>At length to him I raised my saddened heart,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>He knew its sorrows, bid its doubts depart;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>&quot;Be not afraid,&quot; He said, &quot;but trust in Me,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>My perfect love shall now be shown to thee.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>And then with lightened eyes and willing feet,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Again I turned my earthly cross to meet;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>With forward footsteps, turning not aside<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>For fear some hidden evil might betide.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>And there, in the prepared, appointed way,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Listening to hear, and ready to obey,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>A cross I quickly found of plainest form,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>With only words of love inscribed thereon.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>With thankfulness, I raised it from the rest,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And joyfully acknowledged it the best;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>The only one of all the many there<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>That I could feel was good for me to bear.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>And while I thus my chosen one confessed,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>I saw a heavenly brightness on it rest;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>And as I bent my burden to sustain,<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>I recognized my own old cross again.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i4'>But, oh! how different did it seem to be!<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Now I had learned its preciousness to see;<br /></span>

<span class='i4'>&quot;Perhaps another is a better way.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<h3>MARY, RALPH, JAKE AND SIBYLLA VISIT THE ALLENTOWN FAIR.</h3>
<br />

<p>Late in September Jake and Sibylla drove to the Allentown Fair. It was
&quot;Big Thursday&quot; of Fair week. They started quite early, long before
Ralph Jackson, who had come from the city the day previous, to take
Mary to the Fair, had arisen.</p>

</center>

<p>Mary, while appreciating Sibylla's good qualities, never failed to be
amused at her broad &quot;Pennsylvania German&quot; dialect.</p>

<p>The morning of the &quot;Fair,&quot; Mary arose earlier than usual to allow
Sibylla and Jake to get an early start, as it was quite a distance
from the farm to the Fair grounds. As they were about to drive away,
Sibylla, alighting from the carriage, said, &quot;I forgot <a name='Page_152'></a>my
'Schnupftuch.'&quot; Returning with it in her hand, she called, as she
climbed into Jake's buggy, &quot;Gut-by, Mary, it looks fer rain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&quot; said Jake, &quot;I think it gives rain before we get back yet. The
cornfodder in the barn this morning was damp like it had water on it.&quot;</p>

<p>And said Mary, &quot;The fragrance of the flowers was particularly
noticeable early this morning.&quot; Jake, as it happened, was no false
prophet. It did rain before evening.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Mary and Ralph drove to a near-by town, leaving
horse and carriage at the hotel until their return in the evening, and
boarded a train for Allentown. On arriving there, they decided to walk
up Hamilton Street, and later take a car out to the Fair grounds. As
they sauntered slowly up the main street, Mary noticed a small church
built between two large department stores and stopped to read a tablet
on the church, which informed the passerby that &quot;this is to
commemorate the concealment of the Liberty Bell during the
Revolutionary War. This tablet was erected by the Liberty Bell Chapter
of the Daughters of the Revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>The First Zion's Reformed Church was founded in 1762. In front of the
Church a rough block of granite, erected to the memory of John Jacob
Mickley, contained the following inscription: &quot;In commemoration of the
saving of the Liberty Bell from the British in 1777. Under cover of
darkness and with his farm team, he, John Mickley, hauled the Liberty
Bell from Independence Hall, Philadelphia, through the British lines,
to Bethlehem, where the wagon broke down. The Bell was transferred to
another wagon, brought to Allentown, placed beneath the floor of the
<i>Second</i> Church building of Zion's Reformed Church, where it remained
secreted nearly a year. This <i>tablet</i> was placed by the order of the
Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, June 2nd, 1907, under
the auspices of the Pennsylvania Daughters of the Revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>This was all very interesting to a girl who had been born and reared
in Philadelphia; one who in earliest childhood had been taught to love
and venerate the &quot;old Bell.&quot;</p>

<p>Ralph was quite as interested in reading about the old Bell as was
Mary, and said; &quot;Did you know that the City of Philadelphia purchased
the State House property, which included the Bell, in 1818, in
consideration of the sum of seventy thousand <a name='Page_153'></a>dollars? No building is
ever to be erected on the ground inside the wall on the south side of
the State House, but it is to remain a public green and walk forever?&quot;</p>

<a name='Liberty_Bell_Tablet'></a><h3>Liberty Bell Tablet</h3>
<center>
<img src='images/189.jpg' width='357' height='720' alt='' title=''>
</center>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Mary, &quot;I did not know that. I don't think we will see
anything of greater interest than this at the Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Ralph, &quot;this is the third church building <a name='Page_154'></a>built
on this site, where the original church stood in which the Bell was
secreted.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary, possessing a fair share of the curiosity usually attributed to
the &quot;female of the species,&quot; on noticing the church door standing
ajar, asked Ralph to step inside with her, thinking to find the
caretaker within; but no one was visible. A deep silence reigned in
the cool, dim interior of the House of God.</p>

<p>One could almost feel the silence, 'twas so impressive. Slowly they
walked up the wide church aisle and stood before the quaint baptismal
font. A stray sunbeam glancing through one of the beautiful,
variously-colored memorial windows, lighted up the pictured saint-like
faces over the chancel, making them appear as if imbued with life.
Mary softly whispered to Ralph, as if loath to profane the sacredness
of the place by loud talking, &quot;I seem to hear a voice saying, 'The
Lord is in His holy temple.'&quot; Quietly retracing their steps, they,
without meeting any one, emerged into the bright sunlight and were
soon in the midst of the turmoil and traffic incident to the principal
business street of a city.</p>

<p>The young folks boarded a trolley and in a short time reached the Fair
grounds, which offered many attractions to Ralph as well as Mary. The
latter was interested in the fine display of needlework, fruits,
flowers and vegetables of unusual size. Aunt Sarah's bread won a
prize. A blue ribbon attached to Frau Schmidt's highly-prized,
old-fashioned, patchwork quilt, showed it to be a winner. Ralph, being
interested in the pens of fancy chickens, prize cattle, etc., Mary
reluctantly left the woman's department of fancy work, and other
interesting things, and accompanied him. On their way to the outlying
cattle sheds they noticed two lovers sitting on a bench. Upon a second
glance they were convinced that it was Jake and Sibylla. Jake, beaming
with happiness, said, &quot;Sibylla vos side by me yet?&quot; They were busily
engaged eating a lunch consisting of rolls with hot &quot;weiners&quot; between
the two halves, or, as Jake called them, &quot;Doggies,&quot; munching pretzels
and peanuts between sips of strong coffee, both supremely happy. A
yearly visit to the Allentown Fair on &quot;Big Thursday,&quot; was <i>the event</i>
in their dull, prosaic lives.</p>

<h3>FRITZ SCHMIDT EXPLORES DURHAM CAVE.</h3>
<br />

<p>It appeared to be nothing new for Fritz Schmidt to get into trouble;
rather the contrary. One day in early Fall, after the first frost, he,
in company with a number of boys, drove to Durham, not many miles
distant from his home, in search of persimmons, the crop of which, on
account of the severity of the preceding winter, old farmers had
predicted would be exceedingly heavy.</p>

<p>Fritz did not tell the boys of his intention to explore a cave which
he had been told was in the neighborhood, thinking it would be a good
joke to explore the cave first, then tell the boys later of his
adventure.</p>

<p>The old gentleman from whom Fritz gained his information relative to
the cave aroused the boy's curiosity by saying, &quot;Very many years ago,
a skeleton was found in Durham cave and one of the bones, on
examination, proved to be the thigh bone of a human being. How he came
there, or the manner of his death, was never known.&quot; A large room in
the cave is known as &quot;Queen Esther's Drawing Room,&quot; where, tradition
has it &quot;Queen Esther,&quot; or Catharine Montour, which was her rightful
name, at one time inhabited this cave with some of her Indian
followers.</p>

<p>Fritz accidentally stumbled upon the mouth of the cave. None of the
other boys being in sight, Fritz quickly descended into the cave,
which was dark as night. By lighting a second match as quickly as one
was burned, he explored quite a distance, when, accidentally dropping
his box of matches, the burning match in his hand, at the same moment,
flickered faintly, then went out, leaving Fritz in darkness. Imagine
the feelings of the boy, as he groped unsuccessfully on the floor of
the cavern for the lost match box. Finally, he gave up in despair.
Fritz was not a cowardly boy, but while searching for the matches, he,
without thinking, had turned around several times, lost his bearings
and knew not in which direction to go to reach the opening of the
cave. He heard strange noises which he imagined were bats flopping
their wings. <a name='Page_156'></a>There appeared to be something uncanny about the place,
and Fritz devoutly wished himself out in the sunshine, when a
quotation he had frequently heard his father use came into his mind:
&quot;More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.&quot; So
Fritz knelt down and prayed as he had been taught to pray at his
mother's knee, but more earnestly than he had ever prayed before in
his life, that God would help him find his way out of the cave,
believing that his prayer would be answered. And who shall say it was
not answered? For, stumbling onward in the darkness, not knowing if he
were coming toward the cave's entrance or going in the opposite
direction, he eventually hailed with joy a faint streak of light which
he followed, and it soon brought him to the mouth of the cave. He was
surprised on joining his companions to find they had not been alarmed
at his absence. He had been in the cave only thirty minutes, but to
him it had seemed hours. Fritz says to this day he has a horror of
Durham Cave or &quot;The Devil's Hole,&quot; as it was formerly called.</p>

<h3>MARY'S MARRIAGE.</h3>
<br />

<p>His vacation ended, after a busy season at the farm, Ralph Jackson
returned to his work in the city, strong and robust. He had acquired
the coat of tan which Mary's Uncle had predicted. Physically strong as
the &quot;Cave Man&quot; of old, he felt capable of moving mountains, and as was
natural, he being only a human man, longed for the mate he felt God
had intended should one day be his, as men have done since our first
gardener, Adam, and will continue to do until the end of time.</p>

<p>When visiting the farm, an event which occurred about every two weeks,
Ralph constantly importuned Mary to name an early day for their
marriage.</p>

<p>Mary, with a young girl's impulsiveness, had given her heart
unreservedly into the keeping of Ralph Jackson, her first sweetheart.
Mary was not naturally cold or unresponsive, neither was she lacking
in passion. She had had a healthy girlhood, and a wholesome home life.
She had been taught the conventional ideals of the marriage relations
that have kept the race strong throughout the centuries. Mary
possessed great strength of character and fine moral courage.
Frequently, not wishing to show her real feeling for the young man;
too well poised to be carried off into the wrong channel, defended and
excused by many over-sentimental and light-headed novelists of the
day, she sometimes appeared almost indifferent to the impetuous youth
with warm, red blood leaping in his veins, who desired so ardently to
possess her.</p>

<p>Mary's Aunt had taught her the sanctity of parenthood, also that women
are not always the weaker sex. There are times when they must show
their superiority to &quot;mere man&quot; in being the stronger of the two,
mentally if not physically, and Ralph Jackson knew when he called Mary
&quot;wife&quot; she would endow him with all the wealth of her pure womanhood,
sacredly kept for the clean-<a name='Page_158'></a>souled young man, whose devotion she
finally rewarded by promising to marry him the second week in October.</p>

<p>Sibylla Linsabigler, a good but ignorant girl, accustomed to hearing
her elder brothers speak slightingly regarding the sanctity of love
and marriage, was greatly attached to Mary, whom she admired
exceedingly, and looked up to almost as a superior being. She
unconsciously imitated many of Mary's ways and mannerisms, and sought
to adopt her higher ideals of life and standard of morals.</p>

<p>One Sunday, as Jake Crouthamel was spending the evening with Sibylla,
as was his usual custom, he attempted some slight familiarity, which
annoyed Sibylla greatly. Jake, noticing the young girl's displeasure
at his action, remarked, &quot;I think me Sibylla, you are stuck up yet&quot; (a
grave fault in the Bucks County farm hand's opinion).</p>

<p>&quot;No, Chake,&quot; Sibylla replied, &quot;I ain't, but Mary, she say a man gives
a girl more respect what keeps herself to herself before she is
married, and I lofe you Chake and want that you respect me if we
marry.&quot;</p>

<p>Fritz and Elizabeth Schmidt, on hearing the news of Mary's approaching
marriage, promptly begged the privilege of decorating the old farm
house parlor for the expected ceremony. They scoured the surrounding
woods and countryside for decorations; along old stone fences and
among shrubbery by the roadside they gathered large branches of Bitter
Sweet. Its racemes of orange-colored fruit, which later in the season
becomes beautiful, when the orange gives place to a brilliant red, the
outer covering of the berry turns back upon the stems, forming one of
the prettiest pictures imaginable in late Autumn. They also gathered
branches of feathery wild clematis, which, after the petals had
fallen, resembled nothing so much as a cluster of apple seeds, each
seed tipped with what appeared like a tiny osprey feather. From the
woods near the farm they gathered quantities of trailing ground pine
and rainbow-tinted leaves from the numerous brilliant scarlet and
yellow maples, which appeared brighter in contrast to the sober-hued
trees of shellbark, oak and chestnut.</p>

<center>
<img src='images/199.jpg' width='481' height='688' alt='POLLY SCHMIDT.' title=''>
</center>

<p>The wedding gifts sent to Mary were odd, useful and numerous. The
Campfire Girls, to whom she became endeared, gave her a &quot;Kitchen
Shower,&quot; consisting of a clothes basket (woven by an old basketmaker
from the willows growing not far distant), <a name='Page_159'></a>filled to overflowing with
everything imaginable that could possibly be useful to a young
housekeeper, from the half dozen neatly-hemmed linen, blue ribbon
tied, dish clothes, to really handsome embroidered articles from the
girls to whom she had given instructions in embroidery during the past
summer.</p>

<p>Sibylla's wedding present to Mary was the work of her own strong,
willing hands, and was as odd and original as useful. 'Twas a &quot;door
mat&quot; made from corn husks, braided into a rope, then sewed round and
round and formed into an oval mat. Mary laughingly told Sibylla she
thought when 'twas placed on her kitchen doorstep she'd ask every one
to please step over it, as it was too pretty to be trod on, which
greatly pleased the young girl, who had spent many hours of loving
thought and labor on the simple, inexpensive gift.</p>

<p>Mary received from Professor Schmidt a small but excellent copy of one
of the world's most famous pictures, &quot;The Night Watch,&quot; painted by
Rembrandt, in 1642.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear,&quot; said the old Professor, &quot;I saw what <i>was said to be</i> the
original of this painting, the property of Queen Wilhelmina of
Holland, at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904. It was in a small,
separate building. The size of the picture was fifteen feet by twenty
feet. It is the largest and best known of Rembrandt's works. It
acquired the wrong title of 'Night Watch' in a period when, owing to
the numerous coats of varnish and the effect of smoke and dust, it had
gotten so dark in appearance that only the most lucid parts could be
discerned. Nowadays, nobody doubts that the light falling from the
left on the boisterous company is that of the sun. The musketeers are
remarching out of the high archway of their hall, crossing the street
in front of it, and going up a bridge. The architecture of the
building is a product of Rembrandt's imagination. The steps, also,
which we see the men descending, were put there simply to make those
at the back show out above those in the front ranks. The march out was
to be above all a portrait group. Sixteen persons had each paid their
contributions, a hundred guilders on the average, to have their
likenesses transmitted to posterity, and every one of them was
therefore to be fully visible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is certainly a wonderful picture,&quot; said Mary, &quot;and while I have
seen few pictures painted by old masters, I think, even with my
limited knowledge of art, I cannot fail to appreciate this ex<a name='Page_160'></a>cellent
copy, and I thank you heartily. Professor, and shall always be
reminded of you when I look at this copy of a great work.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary would not go empty-handed to Ralph at her marriage. Her &quot;hope
chest&quot; in the attic was full to overflowing, and quite unique in
itself, as it consisted of an old, in fact ancient, wooden dough-tray
used in times past by Aunt Sarah's grandmother. Beside it stood a
sewing table, consisting of three discarded broom handles supporting a
cheese-box cover, with wooden cheese-box underneath for holding Mary's
sewing; stained brown and cretonne lined. Mary valued it as the result
of the combined labor of herself and Ralph Jackson. A roll of new,
home-made rag carpet, patchwork quilts and &quot;New Colonial&quot; rugs, jars
of fruit, dried sweet corn, home-made soap, crocks of apple butter,
jellies, jams and canned vegetables all bore evidence of Mary's busy
Summer at the farm.</p>

<p>The day of Mary's marriage, the twelfth of October, dawned clear and
bright, sunshine warm as a day in June. In the centre of the
gayly-decorated old farm house parlor, wearing a simple, little,
inexpensive dress of soft, creamy muslin, we find Mary standing beside
Ralph, who is looking supremely satisfied and happy, although a trifle
pale and nervous, listening to the solemn words of the minister.
Ralph's &quot;I will&quot; sounded clearly and distinctly through the long room.
Mary, with a sweet, serious, faraway look in her blue eyes, repeated
slowly after the minister, &quot;I promise to love, honor and&quot;&mdash;then a long
pause. She glanced shyly up at the young man by her side as if to make
sure he was worth it, then in a low, clear tone, added, &quot;obey.&quot;</p>

<p>Ralph Jackson certainly deserved the appellation &quot;Cave Man&quot; given him
by Fritz Schmidt. He was considerably more than six feet in height,
with broad, square shoulders, good features, a clear brain and a sound
body. He had never used intoxicants of any description. He sometimes
appeared quite boyish in his ways, for on account of his matured look
and great size he was frequently judged to be older than he really
was.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah had provided a bounteous repast for the few friends
assembled, and while looking after the comfort of her guests tears
dimmed the kindly, gray eyes at the thought of parting from Mary.</p>

<p>Small Polly Schmidt, as flower girl at the wedding, was so excited she
scarcely knew if she should laugh or cry, and finally <a name='Page_161'></a>compromised by
giving Mary what she called a &quot;bear hug,&quot; much to Mary's amusement.
Fritz gravely said: &quot;Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. Jackson,&quot; and
turning to Mary, &quot;I wish you a beautiful and happy life, Mrs.
Jackson.&quot; Mary blushed becomingly on hearing her new name for the
first time.</p>

<p>Bidding farewell to friends, Mary and Ralph, accompanied by her Uncle,
were driven by &quot;Chake&quot; to the depot in a near-by town, where they
boarded the train for the little, newly-furnished home in the suburbs
of Philadelphia, the deed of which was Mary's wedding gift from her
Uncle, in appreciation of her faithful service on the farm during the
summer and for the brightness she had brought into his life and the
lives of those with whom she had come in contact, as every one at the
farm had felt the captivating charm and winning sweetness of the young
girl.</p>

<p>As the train came in sight, the old gentleman, in a voice husky with
emotion, bade the young couple, just starting the journey of life
together, an affectionate farewell, and repeated solemnly, almost as a
benediction, &quot;Es Salamu Aleikum.&quot;</p>

<p><b>SMALL ECONOMIES, &quot;LEFT-OVERS&quot; OR &quot;IVERICH BLEIBST&quot; AS AUNT SARAH
CALLED THEM.</b></p>
<br />

<p>&quot;The young housewife,&quot; said Aunt Sarah to Mary, in a little talk on
small economies in the household, &quot;should never throw away pieces of
hard cheese. Grate them and keep in a cool, dry place until wanted,
then spread lightly over the top of a dish of macaroni, before baking;
or sprinkle over small pieces of dough remaining after baking pies,
roll thin, cut in narrow strips like straws, and bake light brown in a
hot oven, as 'Cheese Straws.'&quot;</p>

<p>Wash and dry celery tips in oven, and when not wished for soup they
may be used later for seasoning. The undesirable outer leaves of a
head of lettuce, if fresh and green, may be used if cut fine with
scissors, and a German salad dressing added. The heart of lettuce
should, after washing carefully, be placed in a piece of damp cheese
cloth and put on ice until wanted, then served at table &quot;au natural,&quot;
with olive oil and vinegar or mayonnaise dressing to suit individual
taste. Should you have a large quantity of celery, trim and carefully
wash the roots, cut them fine and add to soup as flavoring. Almost all
vegetables may be, when well cooked, finely mashed, strained, and when
added to stock, form a nourishing soup by the addition of
previously-cooked rice or barley. Add small pieces of meat,
well-washed bones cut from steaks or roasts, to the stock pot. Small
pieces of ham or bacon (left-overs), also bacon or ham <i>gravy</i> not
thickened with flour may be used occasionally, when making German
salad dressing <a name='Page_163'></a>for dandelion, endive, lettuce or water cress, instead
of frying fresh pieces of bacon.</p>

<img src='images/205.jpg' width='510' height='730' alt='AN OLD FASHIONED BUCKS COUNTY BAKE OVEN' title=''>
</center>

<p>It is a great convenience, also economical, to keep a good salad
dressing on hand, and when the white of an egg is used, the yolk
remaining may he added at once to the salad dressing (previously
prepared). Mix thoroughly, cook a minute and stand away in a cool
place. Young housekeepers will be surprised at the many vegetables,
frequently left-overs, from which appetizing salads may be made by the
addition of a couple tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise, besides nut meats,
lettuce, watercress, celery and fruit, all of which may be used to
advantage. A good potato salad is one of the cheapest and most easily
prepared salads. A German dressing for dandelions, lettuce or potatoes
may be prepared in a few minutes by adding a couple of tablespoonfuls
of salad dressing (which the forehanded housewife will always keep on
hand) to a little hot ham or bacon gravy. Stirring it while hot over
the salad and serving at once.</p>

<p>A cup of mashed potatoes, left over from dinner, covered and set aside
in a cool place, may be used the next day, with either milk or potato
water, to set a sponge for &quot;Dutch Cake,&quot; or cinnamon buns with equally
good results as if they had been freshly boiled (if the potatoes be
heated luke-warm and mashed through a sieve); besides the various
other ways in which cold boiled potatoes may be used.</p>

<p>Fruit juices or a couple tablespoonfuls of tart jelly or preserved
fruit may be added to mincemeat with advantage. Housewives should make
an effort to give their family good, plain, nourishing, wholesome
food. The health of the family depends so largely on the quality of
food consumed. When not having time, strength or inclination to bake
cake, pies or puddings, have instead good, sweet, home-made bread and
fruit; if nothing else, serve stewed fruit or apple sauce. Omit meat
occasionally from the bill of fare and serve instead a dish of
macaroni and cheese and fruit instead of other dessert. Serve a large,
rich, creamy rice pudding for the children's lunch. When eggs are
cheap and plentiful make simple custards, old-fashioned cornmeal
puddings, tapioca, bread puddings and gelatine with fruits. These are
all good, wholesome, and not expensive, and in Summer may be prepared
in the cool of the early morning with small outlay of time, labor or
money. Plan your housework well the day before and have <a name='Page_164'></a>everything in
readiness. The pudding may be placed in the oven and baked white
preparing breakfast, economizing coal and the time required for other
household duties.</p>

<p>Every wife and mother who does her own housework and cooking these
days (and their number is legion) knows the satisfaction one
experiences, especially in hot weather, in having dinner and luncheon
planned and partly prepared early in the morning before leaving the
kitchen to perform other household tasks.</p>

<p>Another small economy of Aunt Sarah's was the utilizing of cold mashed
potatoes in an appetizing manner. The mashed potatoes remaining from a
former meal were put through a small fruit press or ricer to make them
light and flaky. To one heaped cup of mashed potatoes (measured before
pressing them through fruit press) she added  cup of soft, stale
bread crumbs,  cup of flour sifted with  teaspoonful of baking
powder. Mix in lightly with a fork yolk of one egg, then the stiffly
beaten white, seasoned with salt and a little minced onion or parsley,
or both. With well-floured hands she molded the mixture into balls the
size of a shelled walnut, dropped into rapidly boiling water and
cooked them uncovered from 15 to 20 minutes, then skimmed them from
the water and browned in a pan with a little butter and served on
platter with meat, a pot roast or beef preferred. From the above
quantity of potatoes was made five potato balls.</p>

<a name='THE_MANY_USES_OF_STALE_BREAD'></a><p><b>THE MANY USES OF STALE BREAD</b></p>

<p>Never waste stale bread, as it may be used to advantage in many ways.
The young housewife will be surprised at the many good, wholesome and
appetizing dishes which may be made from stale bread, with the
addition of eggs and milk.</p>

<p>Take a half dozen slices of stale bread of equal size and place in a
hot oven a few minutes to become crisped on the outside so they may be
quickly toasted over a hot fire, a delicate brown. Butter them and for
breakfast serve with a poached egg on each slice.</p>

<p>A plate of hot, crisp, nicely-browned and buttered toast is always a
welcome addition to the breakfast table.</p>

<p>Serve creamed asparagus tips on slices of toast for luncheon.</p>

<p>The economical housewife carefully inspects the contents of her bread
box and refrigerator every morning before planning her <a name='Page_165'></a>meals for the
day, and is particular to use scraps of bread and left-over meat and
vegetables as quickly as possible. Especially is this necessary in hot
weather. Never use any food unless perfectly sweet and fresh. If
otherwise, it is unfit for use.</p>

<p>Loaves of bread which have become stale can be freshened if wrapped in
a damp cloth for a few minutes, then remove and place in a hot oven
until heated through.</p>

<p>For a change, toast slices of stale bread quite crisp and serve a
plate of hot, plain toast at table, to be eaten broken in small pieces
in individual bowls of cold milk. Still another way is to put the
stiffly-beaten white of an egg on the centre of a hot, buttered slice
of toast, carefully drop the yolk in the centre of the beaten white
and place in hot oven a few minutes to cook. Serve with a bit of
butter on top, season with pepper and salt. Serve at once.</p>

<p>Another way to use stale bread is to toast slices of bread, spread
with butter, pour over 1 cup of hot milk, in which has been beaten 1
egg and a pinch of salt. Serve in a deep dish. Or a cup of hot milk
may be poured over crisply-toasted slices of buttered bread, without
the addition of an egg.</p>

<a name='BROD_GRUMMELLA'></a><p><b>&quot;BROD GRUMMELLA&quot;</b></p>

<p>In a bowl containing 1 cup of soft bread crumbs pour 1 cup of sweet
milk, then add the slightly-beaten yolks of three eggs, a little
pepper and salt, then the stiffly-beaten whites of the three eggs.
Place in a fry-pan a tablespoonful of butter and 1 of lard or
drippings; when quite hot pour the omelette carefully in the pan. When
it begins to &quot;set&quot; loosen around the edges and from the bottom with a
knife. When cooked turn one side over on the other half, loosen
entirely from the pan, then slide carefully on a hot platter and serve
at once. Garnish with parsley.</p>

<a name='CROUTONS_AND_CRUMBS'></a><p><b>CROUTONS AND CRUMBS</b></p>

<p>Still another way is to make croutons. Cut stale bread into small
pieces, size of dice, brown in hot oven and serve with soup instead of
serving crackers. Small pieces of bread that cannot be <a name='Page_166'></a>used otherwise
should be spread over a large pan, placed in a moderate oven and dried
until crisp. They may then be easily rolled fine with a rolling-pin or
run through the food chopper and then sifted, put in a jar, stood in a
dry place until wanted, but not in an air-tight jar. Tie a piece of
cheese-cloth over the top of jar. These crumbs may be used for
crumbing eggplant, oysters, veal cutlets or croquettes. All should be
dipped in beaten white of eggs and then in the crumbs, seasoned with
salt and pepper, then floated in a pan of hot fat composed of &#8532; lard
and &#8531; suet. All except veal cutlets. They should be crumbed, not
floated in deep fat, but fried slowly in a couple tablespoonfuls of
butter and lard.</p>

<p>Also fry fish in a pan of hot fat. Shad is particularly fine, prepared
in this manner (when not baked). Cut in small pieces, which when
breaded are floated in hot fat. If the fat is the right temperature
when the fish is put in, it absorbs less fat than when fried in a
small quantity of lard and butter.</p>

<p>Cut wheat bread in slices not too thin. Place in a warm, not hot,
oven, and allow it to remain until thoroughly dry and crisp. Place in
a toaster or a wire broiler over a hot fire and toast a golden brown
and allow it to remain in the oven until toasted. Keep in cool place
until used. Zweibach is considered more wholesome than fresh bread.</p>

<a name='GERMAN_EGG_BREAD'></a><p><b>&quot;GERMAN&quot; EGG BREAD</b></p>

<p>Cut stale bread into slices about  inch thick. Cut slices in half,
and soak for a few minutes, turning frequently, in the following
mixtures: 1 pint of sweet milk, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoonful flour mixed
smooth with a little of the cold milk and a pinch of salt. Fry half
dozen slices of thinly-sliced bacon in a pan. Put bacon, when fried,
in oven to keep hot. Dip the slices of soaked bread in fine, dried
bread crumbs and fry quickly in the bacon fat (to which has been added
one tablespoon of butter) to a golden brown. Serve at once on the same
platter with the bacon, or instead of <a name='Page_167'></a>using bacon fat, fry the
crumbed bread in sweet drippings, or a tablespoonful each of lard and
butter. This is an appetizing and wholesome breakfast or luncheon
dish, served with a tart jelly, either currant or grape.</p>

<p>Partly fill a large tureen with slices of crisply-browned and buttered
toast. (Slices of bread which have become dry and hard may be used for
this dish.) When ready to serve, not before, pour over the toasted
slices 1 quart of hot milk to which 1 teaspoonful of flour or
cornstarch has been added, after being mixed smoothly with a little
cold milk or water and cooked a few minutes until thick as cream. Add
also a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>If milk is not plentiful, prepare one pint of milk and dip each slice
of toasted bread quickly in a bowl of hot water; place in a deep dish
and quickly pour over the hot milk, to which a tablespoonful of butter
has been added, and serve at once.</p>

<a name='BREAD_AND_ROLLS'></a><p><b>BREAD AND ROLLS</b></p>

<p>Bread, called the &quot;Staff of Life,&quot; on account of its nutritive value,
should head the list of foods for human consumption. Bread making
should stand first in the &quot;Science of Cooking,&quot; as there is no one
food upon which the comfort, health and well-being of the average
family so largely depends as upon good bread. There is absolutely no
reason why the housewife of the present day should not have good,
sweet, wholesome, home-made bread, if good yeast, good flour and
common-sense are used. The milk or water used to mix with flour for
making bread sponge should be lukewarm. If too hot, the loaves will be
full of holes and coarse grained. If too cold the bread, chilled, will
not rise as it should have done had the liquid used been the right
temperature. Good bread may be made by using milk, potato water or
whey (drained from thick sour milk), and good bread may be made by
simply using lukewarm water. I prefer a mixture of milk and water to
set sponge. Milk makes a fine-grained, white bread, but it soon dries
out and becomes stale. Bread rises more slowly when milk is used. When
<a name='Page_168'></a>mashed potatoes are used, the bread keeps moist a longer time. Should
you wish extra fine, white, delicate bread, add one cup of sweet cream
to the liquid when setting sponge. When milk is used the dough is
slower in rising, but makes a creamy-looking and fine-flavored bread.
When one Fleischman yeast cake is used in any recipe the ordinary
half-ounce cake of compressed yeast is intended, twenty-eight cakes in
a pound. These are usually kept in a large refrigerator in a
temperature of 44 degrees and should not be kept longer in the home
than three days in Summer or six days in Winter, and should always be
kept in a cool place until used, if the cook would have success when
using.</p>

<p>Use the best hard, Spring wheat flour obtainable for baking bread, or
any sponge raised with yeast, as this flour contains a greater
quantity of gluten and makes bread of high nutritive value.</p>

<p>Winter wheat maybe used for cake-making and for baking pastry with
excellent results, although costing less than Spring wheat.</p>

<p>Always sift flour before using, when setting sponge for bread. When
mixing sponge use one quart liquid to about three pounds of flour.
&quot;Aunt Sarah&quot; always cut several gashes with a sharp knife on top of
loaves when ready to be placed in oven. She also made several cuts
across the top of loaves with a hot knife when set to rise to allow
gas to escape. If an impression made on a loaf of bread with the
finger remains, the bread is light. If the dent disappears, then the
loaf is not light enough to be placed in the oven; give it more time
to rise. An experienced cook, noted for the excellence and size of her
loaves of bread, said she always inverted a pail over the pan
containing loaves of bread when set to rise, and allowed the bread to
remain covered after being placed in the oven. Loaves will rise to a
greater height if this is done. Remove the covering to allow loaves to
brown a short time before taking them from the oven. &quot;Aunt Sarah&quot;
frequently placed four loaves in her large roasting pan, covered the
pan, when set to rise, and allowed the cover to remain until loaves
were nearly baked. She brushed the top and sides of loaves with melted
butter when set to rise to allow of their being broken apart easily. A
more crusty loaf is secured by placing each loaf singly in
medium-sized bread tins.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah considered Fleischman's compressed yeast the best
commercial yeast in use, both quick and reliable, but thought better
bread was never made than that made by her mother, as <a name='Page_169'></a>she had been
taught to make it in years past, by the old-fashioned and slower
&quot;sponge method.&quot; She was invariably successful in making sweet,
wholesome bread in that manner. She used home-made potato yeast or
&quot;cornmeal yeast cakes,&quot; under different names, always with good
results.</p>

<p>Good bread may be made either by the old-fashioned &quot;sponge&quot; method or
&quot;straight.&quot; Sponge method consists of a batter mixed from liquid yeast
(usually home-made potato yeast is used) and a small part of the flour
required for making the bread. This batter was usually set to rise at
night and mixed up in the centre of a quantity of flour, in an
old-fashioned wooden dough tray. The following morning enough flour
was kneaded in to form a dough, and when well-raised and light, this
dough was formed into loaves and placed in pans for the final rising.
The more easily and more quickly made &quot;straight&quot; dough, when using
Fleischman's compressed yeast, is mixed in the morning and all the
ingredients necessary are added at one time. It is then set to rise
and, when the dough has doubled in bulk, it is kneaded down and when
risen to once and half its size, shaped into loaves, placed in pans to
rise and, when risen to top of pans, bake.</p>

<p>Better bread may be made from flour not freshly milled. Flour should
be kept in a dry place; it improves with moderate age. Stand flour in
a warm place to dry out several hours before using if you would have
good bread.</p>

<p>When baking bread the heat of the oven should not be <i>too great</i> at
<i>first</i>, or the outside of the bread will harden too quickly and
inside the loaves will not be thoroughly baked before the crust is
thick and dark. The temperature of the oven and time required for
baking depend upon the size of the loaves, yet the bread should be
placed in rather a quick oven, one in which the loaves should brown in
about fifteen minutes, when the heat may be reduced, finishing the
baking more slowly.</p>

<p>Small biscuits and rolls can stand a much hotter oven and quicker
baking than large loaves, which must be heated slowly, and baked a
longer time. A one-pound loaf should bake about one hour. On being
taken from the oven, bread should be placed on a sieve, so that the
air can circulate about it until it is thoroughly cooled. In the
<i>Farmers' Bulletin</i>, we read: &quot;The lightness and sweetness depend as
much on the way bread is made as on the materials used.&quot; The greatest
care should be used in pre<a name='Page_170'></a>paring and baking the dough and in cooking
and keeping the finished bread. Though good housekeepers agree that
light, well-raised bread can readily be made, with reasonable care and
attention, heavy, badly-raised bread is unfortunately very common.
Such bread is not palatable and is generally considered to be
unwholesome, and probably more indigestion has been caused by it than
by any other badly-cooked food. As compared with most meats and
vegetables, bread has practically no waste and is very completely
digested, but it is usually too poor in proteins to be fittingly used
as the sole article of diet, but when eaten with due quantities of
other food, it is invaluable and well deserves its title of &quot;Staff of
Life.&quot;</p>

<p>When the housewife &quot;sets&quot; bread sponge to rise over night, she should
mix the sponge or dough quite late, and early in the morning mold it
at once into shapely-looking loaves (should the sponge have had the
necessary amount of flour added the night before for making a stiff
dough).</p>

<p>Being aware of the great nutritive value of raisins and dried
currants, Aunt Sarah frequently added a cup of either one or the
other, well-floured, to the dough when shaping into loaves for the
final rising.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah frequently used a mixture of butter and lard when baking on
account of its being more economical, and for the reason that a lesser
quantity of lard may be used; the shortening qualities being greater
than that of butter. The taste of lard was never detected in her bread
or cakes, they being noted for their excellence, as the lard she used
was home-rendered, almost as sweet as dairy butter, free from taste or
odor of pork. She always beat lard to a cream when using it for baking
cakes, and salted it well before using, and I do not think the small
quantity used could be objected to on hygienic principles.</p>

<p>I have read &quot;bread baking&quot; is done once every three or four weeks, no
oftener, in some of the farm houses of Central Europe, and yet stale
bread is there unknown. Their method of keeping bread fresh is to
sprinkle flour into a large sack and into this pack the loaves, taking
care to have the top crusts of bread touch each other. If they have to
lie bottom to bottom, sprinkle flour between them. Swing the sack in a
dry place. It must swing and there must be plenty of flour between the
loaves. It sounds more odd than reasonable, I confess.</p>

</center>

<p>Pour 1 quart of luke-warm milk in a bowl holding 7 quarts. Add butter,
sugar and salt, 1 quarts rye flour and 1 cup of yeast, or one
Fleischman's yeast cake, dissolved in a little lukewarm water. Beat
thoroughly, cover with cloth, and set in a warm place to rise about
three hours, or until it almost reaches the top of bowl. When light,
stir in the remaining 1 quarts of rye flour, in which one cup of
wheat is included; turn out on a well-floured bake board and knead
about twenty minutes. Shape dough into one high, round loaf, sprinkle
flour <i>liberally</i> over top and sides of loaf, and place carefully into
the clean bowl on top of a <i>well-floured</i> cloth. Cover and set to rise
about one hour, when <a name='Page_172'></a>it should be light and risen to top of bowl.
Turn the bowl containing the loaf carefully upside down on the centre
of a hot sheet iron taken from the hot oven and placed on top of
range. A tablespoonful of flour should have been sifted over the sheet
iron before turning the loaf out on it. Remove cloth from dough
carefully after it has been turned from bowl and place the sheet iron
containing loaf <i>immediately in the hot oven</i>, as it will then rise at
once and not spread. Bake at least sixty minutes. Bread is seldom
baked long enough to be wholesome, especially graham and rye bread.
When baked and still hot, brush the top of loaf with butter and wash
the bottom of loaf well with a cloth wrung out of cold water, to
soften the lower, hard-baked crust. Wrap in a damp cloth and stand
aside to cool where the air will circulate around it. Always set rye
bread to rise early in the morning of the same day it is to be baked,
as rye sponge sours more quickly than wheat sponge. The bread baked
from this recipe has the taste of bread which, in olden times, was
baked in the brick ovens of our grandmother's day, and that bread was
unexcelled. I know of what I am speaking, having watched my
grandmother bake bread in an old-fashioned brick oven, and have eaten
hearth-baked rye bread, baked directly on the bottom of the oven, and
know, if this recipe be closely followed, the young housewife will
have sweet, wholesome bread. Some Germans use Kumel or Caraway seed in
rye bread.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's loaves of rye bread, baked from the above recipe, were
invariably 3 inches high, 14 inches in diameter and 46 inches
in circumference and always won a blue ribbon at Country Fairs and
Farmers' Picnics.</p>

<p>In the oven of Aunt Sarah's range was always to be found a piece of
sheet iron 17 inches in length by 16 inches in width. The three edges
of the sheet iron turned down all around to a depth of half an inch,
the two opposite corners being cut off about a half inch, to allow of
its being turned down. It is a great convenience for young housewives
to possess two of these sheet-iron tins, or &quot;baking sheets,&quot; when
baking small cakes or cookies, as being raised slightly from the
bottom of the oven, cakes are less liable to scorch and bake more
evenly. One sheet may be filled while baking another sheetful of
cakes. In this manner a large number of cakes may be baked in a short
time. This baking sheet was turned the opposite way, upside down, when
baking a loaf of <a name='Page_173'></a>rye bread on it, and when the loaf of bread was
partly baked the extra baking sheet was slipped under the bottom of
the one containing the loaf, in case the oven was quite hot, to
prevent the bottom of the bread scorching. Wheat bread may be baked in
the same manner as rye bread, substituting wheat flour for rye. These
baking sheets may be made by any tinsmith, and young housewives, I
know, would not part with them, once they realize how invaluable they
are for baking small cakes on them easily and quickly.</p>

<p>To one quart of potato water, drained from potatoes which were boiled
for mid-day dinner, she added about  cup of finely-mashed hot
potatoes and stood aside. About four o'clock in the afternoon she
placed one pint of lukewarm potato water and mashed potatoes in a bowl
with  cup of granulated sugar and  a dissolved Fleischman's
yeast cake, beat all well together, covered with a cloth and stood in
a warm place until light and foamy. About nine o'clock in the evening
she added the reserved pint of (lukewarm) potato water and 
tablespoonful of salt to the yeast sponge, with enough warmed,
well-dried flour to stiffen, and kneaded it until dough was
fine-grained. She also cut through the dough frequently with a sharp
knife. When the dough was elastic and would not adhere to
molding-board or hands, she placed it in a bowl, brushed melted lard
or butter over top to prevent a crust forming, covered warmly with a
cloth and allowed it to stand until morning. Frau Schmidt always rose
particularly early on bake day, for fear the sponge might fall or
become sour, if allowed to stand too long. She molded the dough into
four small loaves, placed it in pans to rise until it doubled its
original bulk. When light she baked it one hour. Bread made according
to these directions was fine-grained, sweet and wholesome. She always
cut several gashes across top of loaf with a sharp knife when loaves
were set to rise, to allow gas to escape.</p>

<p>At 6.30 A.M. place in a quart measure  cup of sweet cream <a name='Page_174'></a>and
3 cups of milk, after being scalded (1 quart all together). When
lukewarm, add 1 Fleischman yeast cake, dissolved in a little of the
luke warm milk, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar and 1 tablespoonful salt. Add 3
cups each of white bread flour and 3 cups of graham flour (in all 6
cups or 1 quarts of flour). Mix well together and stand in a warm
place, closely covered, a couple of hours, until well-risen. Then stir
sponge down and add about 2 cups each of graham and of white
flour. (Sponge for graham bread should not be quite as stiff as a
sponge prepared from white flour.) Set to rise again for an hour, or
longer; when light, stir down sponge and turn on to a well-floured
board. Knead well, divide into four portions, mold into four small,
shapely loaves, brush with soft butter, place in well-greased pans,
set to rise, and in about one hour they should be ready to put in a
moderately-hot oven. Bake about fifty minutes. Graham bread should be
particularly well-baked. Brush loaves, when baked, with butter, which
makes a crisp crust with a nutty flavor.</p>

<p>Should cream not be available, one quart of scalded milk, containing
one tablespoonful of butter, may be used with good results. If cream
be used with the milk, no shortening is required in the bread. Bread
is considered more wholesome when no shortening is used in its
preparation.</p>

<li>1 tablespoonful butter.</li>
<li>Flour, about 1 quarts.</li></ul>

<p>This makes good bread and, as bread is apt to chill if set over night
in a cold kitchen, or sour if allowed to stand over night in summer,
set this sponge early in the morning. Stiffen with flour and knead
about 25 minutes; place the dough in a covered bowl in a warm place to
rise about two hours and when well-risen and light, knead and stand
one hour. Then mold into shapely loaves, place in pans, brush tops of
loaves with melted butter, and when doubled in bulk, in about 45
minutes put in an oven which is so hot you can hold your hand in only
while you count thirty, or if a little flour browns in the oven in
about six minutes, it is hot enough for bread. The oven should be hot
enough to brown the bread slightly five minutes after being put in.
Medium-sized loaves of bread require from  of an hour to one hour
to bake. When bread is sufficiently baked it can be told by turning
the loaf over and rapping with the knuckles on the bottom of the loaf.
If it sounds hollow, it is thoroughly baked, and should be taken from
the oven. Stand loaves up on end against some object, where the air
can circulate around them, and brush a little butter over the top to
soften the crust. An authority on the chemistry of foods cautious
housewives against cooling loaves of bread too rapidly after taking
from the oven, and I should like to add a word of caution against
eating fresh breads of any kind. Bread should be baked at least twelve
hours before being eaten. The sponge for this bread was set at 6
o'clock in the morning; bread was baked at 10.30.</p>

<p>From 1 pint of liquid, 1 cake of yeast and about 1 quarts of flour
were made two loaves of bread. More yeast is required to raise a
sponge containing sugar, eggs and shortening than is required to raise
bread sponge containing only liquid, flour and yeast.</p>

<p>Should you care to have a couple of loaves of graham bread instead of
all-wheat, take a generous cup of the above sponge <a name='Page_176'></a>before it is
stiffened beyond a thick batter, and add one tablespoonful of brown
sugar or molasses, stiffen with graham flour (not quite as stiff as
when making wheat bread), rub butter or lard on top of dough, cover
and set in a warm place to rise. When light, mold into one small loaf
(never make graham bread into large loaves), place in oblong pan,
cover, let stand until light, about 1 hours, when it should have
doubled in size; put in oven and bake thoroughly. When the loaf is
taken from the oven, brush butter over the top. This keeps the crust
moist.</p>

<p>If a wholesome loaf of &quot;Corn Bread&quot; is wished, use fine, yellow,

<a name='FRAU_SCHMIDTS_QUICK_BREAD'></a><p><b>FRAU SCHMIDTS &quot;QUICK BREAD&quot;</b></p>

<p>The Professor's wife seldom used any liquid except water to set a
sponge for bread. She seldom used any shortening. She taught Mary to
make bread by the following process, which she considered superior to
any other. From the directions given, housewives may think more time
devoted to the making of a couple of loaves of bread than necessary;
also, that too great a quantity of yeast was used; but the bread made
by &quot;Frau Schmidt&quot; was excellent, quickly raised and baked.</p>

<p>The whole process consumed only about four hours' time, and how could
time be more profitably spent than in baking sweet, crusty loaves of
bread, even in these strenuous days when the efficient housekeeper
plans to conserve strength, time and labor?</p>

<p>First, two Fleischman's compressed yeast cakes were placed in a bowl
and dissolved with 4 tablespoonfuls of luke-warm water; she then added
1 cup of lukewarm water,  tablespoonful of sugar and 
teaspoonful of salt and stirred all well together. The bowl containing
this yeast foam was allowed to stand in a warm place, closely covered,
one hour.</p>

<p>At the end of that time the yeast mixture should be light and foamy.
It was then poured into the centre of a bowl containing about 4
cups of <i>warmed</i> flour, mixing the foamy yeast with a <i>portion</i> of the
flour to make a soft sponge, leaving a wall of flour around the inside
edge of bowl, as our grandmothers used to do in olden times when they
mixed a sponge for bread of liquid flour and yeast, in one end of the
old-fashioned wooden &quot;dough tray,&quot; using a wooden stick or small
paddle for stirring together the mixture.</p>

<p>The bowl containing the sponge was placed in a warm place to rise. In
about 15 or 20 minutes  cup of lukewarm water was added to the
sponge, stirring in all the outside wall of flour until a dough, the
proper consistency for bread, was formed. The dough was turned out on
the molding board and given a couple of <a name='Page_178'></a>quick, deft turns with the
hands for several minutes, then placed in the bowl and again set to
rise in a warm place, free from draughts, for 25 or 30 minutes. When
light, with hands slightly greased with butter, she kneaded the dough
a short time, until smooth and elastic, divided the dough into two
portions, placed each loaf in warmed, well-greased bread pans and
stood in a warm place about  hour. Then turned the contents of
bread pans onto bake-board, one at a time. Cut each loaf into three
portions, rolled each piece into long, narrow strips with the palms of
the hands. Pinched ends of the three strips together and braided or
plaited them into a braid almost the length of bread pan. Placed each
braided loaf in a bread pan and set to raise as before. When
well-raised, brush the top of loaves with melted butter. Bake about
three-quarters of an hour in a moderately-hot oven. An old-fashioned
way of testing the heat of the oven was to hold the hand in the oven
while counting thirty. Should one be unable to bear the heat of oven a
longer time, then the temperature was correct for baking bread. Should
one be able to allow the hand to remain in the oven a longer time, the
heat of the oven should be increased.</p>

<p>As a result of carefully following these minute directions, even an
inexperienced housewife should have sweet, wholesome bread.</p>

<p>Frau Schmidt insisted that rolling portions of dough separately before
combining in a loaf, as for braided loaves, caused the bread to have a
finer texture than if just shaped into round loaves.</p>

<a name='AN_OATMEAL_LOAF'></a><p><b>AN &quot;OATMEAL LOAF&quot;</b></p>

<p>For a loaf of oatmeal bread, place 1 cup of crushed oats, or common
oatmeal, in a bowl, pour over  cup of hot milk. When luke warm, add
1 cup of sponge, or batter, reserved from that raised over night for
making loaves of white bread; 1 teaspoonful butter, 1 teaspoonful
sugar and  teaspoonful salt, and about 2 scant cups of white flour.
Knead a few minutes, set to rise in a warm place, closely covered,
about one hour or until doubled in bulk. Then knead down and form into
a shapely loaf, place in a pan, brush melted butter over lop (this
improves crust), and when raised, doubled in bulk (in about one hour),
place in a moderately hot oven and bake from 40 to 45 minutes. Raisins
may be added <a name='Page_179'></a>to this loaf, if liked. Mary preferred this oatmeal loaf
to graham bread.</p>

<p>The sponge or batter from which this oatmeal-loaf was made had been
prepared in the following manner:</p>

<p>To 1 cups of luke-warm potato water was added 1 teaspoonful of
sugar, 1 cake of yeast; when dissolved, add 1 cups of white bread
flour. Beat all together well, stand closely-covered in a warm place
until the following morning. From one cup of this sponge was made one
oatmeal loaf, and to the other cup of sponge white flour was added for
a loaf of white bread or rolls.</p>

<p>Prepare the following &quot;Yeast Sponge&quot; at noon, the day preceding that
on which you bake bread: Place in a bowl (after the mid-day meal) 1
quart of potato water (containing no salt), in which potatoes were
boiled; also two medium-sized, finely-mashed potatoes, 1 tablespoonful
of sugar and, when luke warm, add 1 cup of good home-made or baker's
yeast. Mix all well together; then divide this mixture and pour each
half into each of two 1-quart glass fruit jars. Place covers tightly
on jars and shake each jar well, to mix yeast and potato-water
thoroughly. Stand yeast in a warm place near the kitchen range over
night. Jars should be <i>covered only</i> with a napkin. The sponge should
become light and foamy. In the morning use this freshly-prepared yeast
to set sponge for bread.</p>

<p>When preparing to set bread, place in a large bowl 1 pint of potato
water, 1 tablespoonful of sugar, 1 pint of the yeast sponge, 
teaspoonful of salt, and use about 3 pounds of sifted flour,
well-dried and warmed. Knead from 15 to 20 minutes, until a stiff
dough is formed. The dough should be fine-grained and elastic and not
stick to bake board. Place dough in the bowl to rise; this should lake
about four hours. When well-risen and light knead down and set to rise
again, about 1 hours. When light, mold into three large, shapely
loaves; place in pans and allow to stand one hour. When loaves have
doubled in bulk, are very light and show signs of cracking, invert a
pan over top of loaves (if that was not done when loaves were put in
pans), and place in a rather hot oven to bake. Brush melted butter
over loaves of bread when <a name='Page_180'></a>set to rise, it will cause bread to have a
crisp crust when baked. The old-fashioned way of testing the heat of
an oven was to hold the hand in the oven, if possible, while one
counted thirty.</p>

<p>The pint of yeast remaining in jar may be kept in a cool place one
week, and may be used during this time in making fresh &quot;yeast foam.&quot;
This should always be prepared the day before baking bread. Always
prepare double the quantity of &quot;yeast foam.&quot; Use half to set bread,
and reserve half for next baking. Bread baked from this recipe has
frequently taken first prize at County Fairs and Farmers' Picnics.</p>

<p>When baking bread, the oven should be quite hot when bread is first
placed therein, when the bread should rise about an inch; then the
heat of the oven should he lessened and in a half hour a brown crust
should begin forming; and during the latter part of the hour (the time
required for baking an ordinary-sized loaf) the heat of the oven
should be less, causing the bread to bake slowly. Should the heat of
the oven not be great enough, when the loaves are placed within for
baking, then poor bread would be the result. This method of making
bread will insure most satisfactory results, although more troublesome
than ordinary methods.</p>

<p>The whole recipe will make 12 loaves of bread.</p>

<p>This delicious German bread was usually made by &quot;Aunt Sarah&quot; one week
before Christmas. It may be kept two weeks, and at the end of that
time still be good. It is rather expensive as regards fruit and nuts,
but as no eggs are used, and a very small quantity of butter; and as
bread containing fruit is so much more wholesome than rich fruit cake.
I think American housewives would do well to bake this German bread
occasionally. Mary took one-fourth the quantity of everything called
for in the recipe, except yeast. She used  of a cake of
Fleischman's yeast and  of each of the other ingredients, and from
these baked three loaves of bread. The prunes and pears should be
covered with cold water at night and allowed to stand until the
following morning, when, after stewing until tender, the juice should
be drained from the fruit and water added to the fruit-juice to
measure two quarts. Remove pits from prunes, cut pears and prunes in
small pieces; stand aside. Clean currants and raisins, blanch and
shred almonds, chop walnut meats, citron, orange peel and figs; add
cinnamon, cloves and anise seed. Mix together flour and one quart of
the fruit juice; add the compressed yeast cakes (dissolved in a little
warm water), knead well, set a sponge as for ordinary bread; when
raised, add the remaining quart of fruit juice, sugar, butter and
salt. A small quantity of brandy or sherry may be added, but if not
liked, fruit juice may be substituted.</p>

<p>Add the remaining ingredients, and knead thoroughly. Allow <a name='Page_182'></a>dough to
raise from two to three hours and when light form into loaves and
allow to stand an hour, when bake. This quantity of dough should be
made into twelve small loaves. Should the flour and liquid used be
warmed before mixing, the dough will raise more quickly. It simplifies
the work if the fruits and nuts be prepared the day before the bread
is baked.</p>

<p>At 9 o'clock in the evening put in a large bowl the mashed potato, the
quart of luke-warm potato water (water in which potatoes were boiled
for dinner), butter or sweet lard, sugar, salt, and mix with flour
into a batter, to which add the Fleischman's or any good yeast cake,
dissolved in a little luke-warm water. Beat well and stir in flour
until quite stiff, turn out on a well-floured bake-board and knead
well about 25 minutes, until the dough is smooth, fine-grained and
elastic, and does not stick lo the bake-board or hands. Chop a knife
through the dough several times; knead and chop again. This makes the
bread finer and closer-grained, or, so Aunt Sarah thought. Knead in
all the flour necessary when first mixing the bread. When sufficiently
kneaded, form into a large, round ball of dough, rub all over with
soft lard, or butter, to prevent forming a crust on top and keep from
sticking to bowl, and set to rise, closely-covered with a cloth and
blanket, in a warm place until morning. In the morning the bread
should be very light, doubled in quantity. Take out enough dough for
an ordinary loaf, separate this into three parts, roll each piece with
the hand on the bake-board into long, narrow pieces. Pinch the three
pieces together at one end and braid, or plait, into a narrow loaf.
Brush over top with melted butter; set to rise in a warm place in a
bread pan, closely-covered, until it doubles in size&mdash;or, if
preferred, mold into ordinary-shaped loaves, and let rise until
<a name='Page_183'></a>doubled in size, when bake in a moderately-hot oven with steady heat.</p>

<p>Frequently, when the &quot;Twist&quot; loaves of bread were quite light and
ready to be placed in the oven, Aunt Sarah brushed the tops with yolk
of egg, or a little milk, then strewed &quot;Poppy Seeds&quot; thickly over. The
poppy seeds give an agreeable flavor to the crust of the bread.</p>

<p>This excellent, nutritious bread, is made from the whole-ground grain.
Every part of the grain is used in the flour, when <a name='Page_184'></a>ground. To bake
this bread, sift together one quart of this &quot;whole-ground&quot; rye flour
and two quarts of white-bread flour. Early in the morning of the day
on which bread is to be baked, prepare a thick batter, or sponge,
consisting of one quart of potato water (or the same quantity of
luke-warm, scalded milk, or a mixture of the two); add one
tablespoonful of a mixture of lard and butter and two boiled, mashed
potatoes. Two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one-half tablespoonful of salt
and one Fleischman's compressed yeast cake, dissolved in a small
quantity of water; add about five cups of the mixed, sifted flour,
beat the batter well, and stand in a warm place, covered, from one and
a half to two hours. When well-risen and light, stir in balance of
flour gradually, until all except one cup has been added; then turn
onto a bake-board and knead well. This sponge should not be quite as

<a name='AN_OLD_RECIPE_FOR_GOOD_BREAD'></a><p><b>&quot;AN OLD RECIPE&quot; FOR GOOD BREAD</b></p>

<p>This country cook invariably baked good bread and always used
potato-water in preference to any other liquid for setting <a name='Page_185'></a>sponge.
She stood aside water, in which potatoes had been boiled for dinner
(usually about one quart or less) and added two finely-mashed
potatoes. About 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the day <i>before</i>
that on which she intended baking bread, she dissolved one cake of
yeast (she used the small cornmeal commercial yeast cakes, sold under
different names, such as National, Magic, etc.) in a half-cup of
luke-warm water, added  teaspoon of salt and sufficient warmed,
well-dried flour to make a thin batter. She placed all in a bowl and
stood it in a warm place, closely-covered, until about 9 o'clock in
the evening, when she added this sponge, which should be light and
foamy, to the potato water, which should be lukewarm. She also added 1
tablespoon of salt and enough flour to make a rather thick batter.
Heat thoroughly and allow this sponge to stand, well-covered, in a
warm place until morning, when add 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon
butter or lard and warmed flour enough to make a stiff dough. Turn out
on the bread board and knead for about twenty minutes, until the dough
does not stick to the hands. Place stiffened dough into howl; allow it
to rise until bulk is doubled. Mold into loaves, adding as little
extra flour as possible. Cut several gashes on top of loaves, brush
with melted butter, place in bread pans, and when loaves have doubled
in bulk, place in moderately hot oven and bake about one hour.</p>

<p>Place in a bowl  cup graham flour and  cup of yellow, granulated
cornmeal. Sift into this  cup of white flour, 1 teaspoonful of
baking powder and  teaspoonful of salt. Mix all ingredients
together to form a batter by adding 1 cup of sour milk, in which has
been dissolved  teaspoonful of soda. Then add 2 tablespoonfuls of
molasses. Pour into a well-greased quart can (the tin cans in which
coffee is frequently sold will answer nicely), cover closely, place in
a kettle of boiling water, steam about three hours; stand in oven a
short time after being steamed. Cut in slices and serve as bread, or,
by the addition of raisins or currants, and a little grated nutmeg or
other flavoring, a very appetizing and wholesome pudding may be served
hot, with sugar and cream or any pudding sauce preferred.</p>

before the day on which the bread is to be baked).</p>

<p>Then drain the juice from stewed pears, which should measure 1 pint;
when lukewarm, add 1 yeast cake, dissolved in a small quantity of
lukewarm water, and about 3 cups of flour and a pinch of salt. Stand,
closely-covered, in a warm place over night to raise.</p>

<p>The following morning, add  teaspoonful of baking soda, dissolved
in a little warm water, to counteract any acidity of batter. Cream
together sugar, butter and lard, add eggs one at a time, men the
well-floured, diced pears, also raisins, cinnamon and fennel seed, and
enough flour to stiffen as for ordinary bread. Knead well, let rise;
it will require some time, as the fruit retards the <a name='Page_187'></a>raising process.
When light, turn onto a bake-board, cut into four portions, mold into
four shapely loaves, place in pans, brush with melted butter and when
quite light, place in a moderate oven and bake one hour. This bread
will keep well several weeks, if kept in a tin cake box.</p>

<p>For this old-fashioned, &quot;country&quot; bread, set a sponge in the evening,
consisting of 1 cup of luke-warm water, 1 Fleischman's compressed
yeast cake and 2 tablespoonfuls of saffron water, obtained by steeping
 tablespoonful of dried saffron flowers in a small quantity of
boiling water a short time. Use about 2 cups of flour to stiffen the
sponge. Cover bowl containing sponge and stand in a warm place until
morning, when add the following:  cup of soft A sugar,  cup lard
and &#8539; cup of butter (beaten to a cream); then add one egg. Beat
again and add this mixture to the well-risen sponge. Add also  cup
of seeded raisins and about 1 cups of flour.</p>

<p>The dough should be almost as stiff as ordinary bread dough. Set to
rise about one hour. Then divide the dough and mold into two shapely
loaves. Place in oblong bread pans. Let rise about 1 hours. Brush
melted butter over top of loaves and bake in a moderately hot oven, as
one would bake ordinary bread.</p>

<p>This bread is a rich, golden yellow, with a distinctive, rather
<a name='Page_189'></a>bitter, saffron flavor, well-liked by some people; saffron is not
unwholesome.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of saffron bread,&quot; said John Landis, to his niece, Mary, &quot;I
am reminded of the lines I was taught when quite a small boy:&quot;</p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

<span class='i4'>Eier, butter un schmalz, milch, zucker un mehl;<br /></span>
<span class='i4'>Un saffron mach die kuchen gehl.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;Of course, Mary, you do not understand what that means. I will
translate it for you. 'Who would have good cakes, he must have seven
things&mdash;eggs, butter and lard, milk, sugar and flour, and saffron
makes the cakes yellow.'&quot;</p>

<ul><li>2 quarts of sifted flour.</li>
<li>1 pint of boiled milk (lukewarm).</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sugar.</li>
<li> cup butter and lard, mixed.</li>
<li> cake compressed yeast, or  cup yeast.</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt.</li></ul>

<p>At 5 o'clock P.M. set sponge with half or three-fourths of the flour
and all the other ingredients.</p>

<p>About 9 o'clock in the evening, knead well, adding the balance of the
flour. Cover and let stand in a warm place until morning. In the
morning, roll out about  of an inch thick, cut into small rolls,
place in baking pans far enough apart so they will not touch, and when
raised quite light, bake.</p>

<p>Or, take the same ingredients as above (with one exception; take one
whole cake of compressed yeast), dissolved in half a cup of luke-warm
water, and flour enough to make a thin batter. Do this at 8.30 in the
morning and let rise until 1 o'clock; then knead enough flour in to
make a soft dough, as soft as can be handled. Stand in a warm place
until 4.30, roll out quite thin; cut with small, round cake-cutter and
fold over like a pocketbook, putting a small piece of butter the size
of a pea between the folds; set in a warm place until 5.30, or until
very light; then bake a delicate brown in a hot oven. If made quite
small, 70 rolls may be made from this dough.</p>

<p><a name='Page_190'></a>To cause rolls of any kind to have a rich, brown glaze, when baked,
before placing the pan containing them in the oven, brush over the top

<li> cup of sugar.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>2 Fleischman's yeast cakes.</li>
<li>Whites of 2 eggs.</li>
<li>Flour.</li></ul>

<p>Quite early in the morning dissolve the two yeast cakes in a little of
the milk; add these, with one-half the quantity of sugar and salt in
the recipe, to the remainder of the quart of milk; add also 4 cups of
flour to form the yeast foam. Beat well and stand in a warm place,
closely-covered, one hour, until light and foamy.</p>

<p>Beat the sugar remaining and the butter to a cream; add to the yeast
foam about 7 to 8 cups of flour, and the stiffly-beaten whites of the
two eggs.</p>

<p>Turn out on a well-floured bread board and knead about five minutes.
Place in a bowl and let rise again (about one hour or longer) until
double in bulk, when roll out about one inch in thickness. Cut small
biscuits with a  pound Royal Baking Powder can.</p>

<p>Brush tops of biscuits with a mixture consisting of yolk of one egg, a
teaspoonful of sugar and a little milk; this causes the biscuits to
have a rich brown crust when baked.</p>

<p>Place biscuits on pans a short distance apart, let rise until doubled
in bulk; bake in a rather quick oven.</p>

<p>From this recipe was usually made 55 biscuits. One-half of this recipe
would be sufficient for a small family.</p>

<p>Mary's Aunt taught her the possibilities of what she called a &quot;Dutch&quot;
sponge&mdash;prepared from one Fleischman's yeast cake. And the variety a
capable housewife may give her family, with the expenditure of a small
amount of time and thought.</p>

<p>About 9 o'clock in the evening Mary's Aunt placed in a bowl <a name='Page_191'></a>2 cups of
potato water (drained from potatoes boiled for dinner). In this she
dissolved one Fleischman's yeast cake, stirred into this about 3 cups
of well-warmed flour, beat thoroughly for about ten minutes. Allowed
this to stand closely covered in a warm place over night. On the
following morning she added to the foamy sponge 1 cups lukewarm,
scalded milk, in which had been dissolved 1 tablespoonful of a mixture
of butter and lard, 2 generous tablespoonfuls of sugar and 1
teaspoonful of salt. About 6 cups of well-dried and warmed flour;
she stirred in a part of the flour, then added the balance. Kneaded
well a short time, then set to raise closely covered in a warm place
2 to 3 hours.</p>

<p>When dough was light it was kneaded down in bowl and allowed to stand
about one hour, and when well risen she placed 2 cups of light bread
sponge in a bowl, and stood aside in warm place; this later formed the
basis of a &quot;Farmers' Pound Cake,&quot; the recipe for which may be found
among recipes for &quot;Raised Cakes.&quot;</p>

<p>From the balance of dough, or sponge, after being cut into 3 portions,
she molded from the one portion 12 small turn-over rolls, which were
brushed with melted butter, folded together and placed on tins a
distance apart and when <i>very</i> light baked in a quick oven.</p>

<p>From another portion of the sponge was made a twist or braided loaf.</p>

<p>And to the remaining portion of dough was added  cup of currants or
raisins, and this was called a &quot;Currant&quot; or &quot;Raisin Loaf,&quot; which she
served for dinner the following day.</p>

<p>The rolls were placed in the oven of the range a few minutes before
breakfast and served hot, broken apart and eaten with maple syrup or
honey and the delicious &quot;Farmers' Pound Cake&quot; was served for supper.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah baked these on ironing day. The kitchen being unusually
warm, as a result of the extra heat required in the range for heating
flatirons, caused the dough to rise more quickly than otherwise would
have been the case.</p>

<p>Frau Schmidt thought bread more easily digested and wholesome if
ingredients of a loaf be stirred together instead of kneaded. This is
the method she taught Mary. She poured into <a name='Page_192'></a>a bowl 3 cups of
luke-warm water, added 1 cake of Fleischman's yeast, dissolved in a
little of the water; sifted in gradually about 8 cups of flour,
added 1 tablespoonful of sugar,  teaspoonful of salt, mixed all
well together with a spoon until a stiff dough was formed, which she
molded into two shapely loaves, handling as little as possible; placed
in bread pans, allowed to stand several hours to raise, and when light
baked. Mary said, &quot;This bread may be more wholesome than old-fashioned
bread, which has been kneaded, but I prefer Aunt Sarah's bread,
well-kneaded, fine-grained and sweet,&quot; but, she continued, &quot;I will
make an exception in favor of Aunt Sarah's 'Stirred Oatmeal' bread,
which, I think, fine.&quot;</p>

salt was added, the eggs were beaten in, one at a time, next was added
the sponge containing the yeast, the lukewarm cream, and the sifted
flour. Grease slightly warmed Gem pans, sift a little flour over them,
fill two-thirds full with the soft dough, set in a warm place to rise
to tops of pans, and when quite light bake in a medium hot oven about
25 minutes. The oven should be hot enough to allow them to rise
quickly. Put something underneath the pans in the oven to prevent
bottom of cakes from burning. These may be set about 8 o'clock in the
morning if cakes are wished for lunch at noon. These are not cheap, as
this quantity makes only 12 cakes, but they are light as puffballs.
The Professor's wife served them when she gave a &quot;Kaffee Klatch.&quot; She
doubled the recipe, baked the cakes in the morning, and placed them in
the oven to heat through before serving. The cakes should be broken
apart, not cut. The cakes made from this recipe are particularly fine.</p>

very old recipe used by Aunt Sarah's grandmother, and similar to the
well-known German cakes called &quot;Schwing Felders.&quot;</p>

a cup of shortening (a mixture of lard and butter), (or use Aunt
Sarah's substitute for butter); one cup of A sugar and 1 teaspoonful
salt.</p>

<p>Beat all to a cream. When lukewarm, add 2 eggs and either 1 yeast cake
dissolved in 1 cup of lukewarm water, or 1 cup of potato yeast; use
about 2 cups of flour to make a thin batter. Set to raise over night
or early in the morning. When well risen add about 4 cups of flour.
Make about as stiff a dough as can be stirred well with a mixing
spoon. Place soft dough on a bake-board; roll out into a sheet about
one-half inch thick; cut into squares about the size of a common soda
cracker; bring each of the four corners together in the centre like an
envelope; pinch together; place a small piece of butter (about
one-eighth teaspoonful) on the top where the four corners join. Stand
in a warm place to rise. When well risen and light place in the oven.
When baked, take from oven, and while hot dip all sides in melted
butter <a name='Page_198'></a>and dust granulated or pulverized sugar over top. These are
not as much trouble to prepare as one would suppose from the
directions for making. The same dough may be cut in doughnuts with a

consisting of:


<ul><li>1 pink milk.</li>
<li>3 eggs.</li>
<li> cup mixture butter and lard.</li>
<li>1 yeast cake (Fleischman's).</li>
<li>About 7 cups flour.</li></ul>

<p>Set to rise early in the morning. When well risen (in about <a name='Page_199'></a>3 hours),
roll dough into a sheet about  inch in thickness, cut with a
half-pound baking powder can into small, round biscuits, brush top of
each one with melted butter (use a new, clean paint brush for this
purpose), place another biscuit on top of each one of these, and when
raised very light and ready for oven brush top of each biscuit with a
mixture consisting of half of one yolk of egg (which had been reserved
from the ones used in baking), mixed with a little milk. Biscuits
should have been placed on a baking sheet some distance apart, let
rise about one hour until quite light, then placed in a quick but not
<i>too hot</i> an oven until baked a golden brown on top.</p>

<p>Mary gave these the name of &quot;Quaker Bonnet&quot; Biscuits, as the top
biscuit did not raise quite as much as the one underneath and greatly
resembled the crown of a Quaker bonnet.</p>

<p>From this quantity of dough was made three dozen biscuits. These are
not cheap, but extra fine.</p>

<p>Explicit directions for the making of these excellent raised cakes was
given Mary by an old, experienced Pennsylvania German cook. They were
prepared from the following recipe: Early in the morning 1 pint of
milk was scalded. When lukewarm, add 3 cups of flour and 1 cake of
Fleischman's compressed yeast (which had been dissolved in 1
tablespoonful of lukewarm water). Beat the mixture well. Cover and
stand in a warm place to rise. When well risen, which should be in
about 2 hours, add the following mixture, composed of  cup of sugar
and  cup of butter, creamed together;  teaspoonful of salt; 1
egg was beaten into the mixture, and about 2 cups of flour were added,
enough to make a dough as stiff as can be stirred with a spoon. Dough
should not be as stiff as for bread. Let stand about 1 hour. When well
risen and light, divide into four portions. Roll out each piece of
dough to thickness of one inch. Place cakes in medium-sized pie tins
and allow them to stand about one hour. When well risen, doubled in
bulk, make half dozen deep impressions on top of each cake with the
forefinger. Brush top of each cake with  tablespoonful of melted
butter. Sprinkle over 2 tablespoonfuls of soft A sugar and sift over a
little <a name='Page_200'></a>pulverized cinnamon, if liked, just before placing cakes in
oven. Bake cakes from 20 to 25 minutes in a moderately hot oven. From
this dough may be made four cakes.</p>

<p>Excellent biscuits may also be made from this same dough, by simply
moulding it into small biscuits and place in a pan some distance
apart. Let rise and brush tops of biscuits with a mixture composed of
a part of an egg yolk, a tablespoonful of milk and  teaspoonful
sugar. This causes the biscuits to have a rich, brown color when
baked.</p>

<p>The sponge from which these cakes or biscuits were made was mixed and
set to rise at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the baking was finished
at 11 o'clock. Sponge should be set to rise in a warm room. If these
directions are carefully followed the housewife will invariably have
good results. Always use hard Spring wheat for bread or biscuits,
raised with yeast; and Winter wheat, which costs less, will answer for
making cake and pastry. In cold weather always warm flour before
baking, when yeast is used for baking raised cakes. Soft A sugar or a
very light brown is to be preferred to granulated.</p>

<li>1 cake Fleischman's yeast.</li>
<li>2 eggs.</li>

<p>At 7 o'clock in the morning Mary mixed a sponge consisting of a cup of
mashed potatoes, 1 cup scalded milk,  cup sugar, 1 cups of
flour and the cake of Fleischman's yeast, dissolved in half a cup of
lukewarm potato water. This was set to rise in a warm place near the
range for several hours until light. Then she creamed together  cup
of sugar, 2 eggs and  cup of butter and lard, or use instead the
&quot;Substitute for Butter.&quot; Added the creamed sugar, butter and eggs to
the well-risen sponge and about 4 cups of flour. Sift a couple of
tablespoons of flour over top of sponge, and set to rise again about
1 hours. When light, take cut pieces of the sponge on a
well-floured bread-board, knead for a minute or two, then roll out
with a rolling-pin inlo pieces about one inch thick, place in
well-greased small pie tins, over which a dust of flour has been
sifted, set to rise about 1 hours. When light and ready for oven
brush top with milk, strew crumbs over or brush with melted butter and
strew sugar over top; after punching half dozen holes in top of each
cake, bake in a moderately hot oven from 20 to 25 minutes until a rich
brown, when cakes should be baked. Five potato cakes may be made from
this sponge, or four cakes and one pan of biscuits if preferred. Use
soft &quot;A&quot; sugar rather than granulated for these cakes, and old
potatoes are superior to new. Or when these same cakes were raised,
ready to be placed in the oven, Mary frequently brushed the tops of
cakes with melted butter, strewing over the following: 1 cup of flour
mixed with  cup of sugar and yolk of 1 egg, and a few drops of
vanilla. This mixture rubbed through a coarse sieve and scattered over
cakes Mary called &quot;Streusel Kuchen.&quot;</p>

This will take about 1 hours to rise. When the sponge is light add
about 3 cups more of flour. The dough, when stiff as can be stirred
with a spoon, will be right. Take about 2 cups of this sponge out on a
well-floured bake-board, divide in three pieces, and braid and form
into a wreath or &quot;Krantz,&quot; or they may be made out into flat cakes and
baked in pie tins after they have been raised and are light. Sprinkle
sugar thickly over top after brushing with milk containing a little
sugar, before placing in oven. These should rise in about 1 hours.

<li>&#8531; cup butter.</li>
<li>2 tablespoons rock candy.</li>
<li>1 orange.</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped almonds.</li>
<li>Flour.</li></ul>

<p>Set to rise early in the morning. To the scalded milk, when lukewarm,
add the yeast and flour enough to make a batter, cover, set to rise
until light, near the range, which will take several hours. Then add
the sugar, butter and eggs beaten to a cream, grated rind and juice of
orange, a couple tablespoons finely-chopped almonds, and add enough
flour to make a soft dough, as stiff as can be stirred with a spoon;
set to rise again, and when light, divide the dough in two portions,
from which you form two wreaths. Roll half the dough in three long
strips on the floured bake-board with the hands, then braid them
together. Place a large coffee cup or bowl inverted on the centre of a
large, round or oval, well-greased pan, lay the wreath around the
bowl. The bowl in the centre of the pan prevents the dough from
running together and forming a cake. Brush the top of the wreath with
a little milk, containing teaspoon of sugar, over the top of the
wreath, stick blanched, well-dried almonds, and strew thickly with
crushed rock candy or very coarse sugar.</p>

<p>Let rise until light, then bake. This makes two quite large wreaths.</p>

<p>The Professor's wife told Mary when she gave her this recipe, this
almond wreath was always served at the breakfast <a name='Page_204'></a>table on Christmas
morning at the home of her parents in Germany, and was always baked by
her mother, who gave her this recipe, and it was found on the

<p>Without fail, every year on Shrove Tuesday, or &quot;Fast Nacht,&quot; the day

quart of flour; add 1 Fleischman's yeast cake, dissolved in a very
little water. Beat well together, set in a warm place to rise over
night, or several hours, and when light, add the following, which has
been creamed together: eggs, butter and lard, a little flour and the
honey. Beat well, and then add the balance of the flour, reserving a
small quantity to flour the board later. Set to rise again, and when
quite light roll out on a well-floured board, cut into circles with a
doughnut cutter, cut holes in the centre of cakes, let rise, and then
fry in deep fat; dust with pulverised sugar and cinnamon, if liked.
These are regular German doughnuts, and are never very sweet. If liked
sweeter, a little sugar may be added. From this batter Mary made 18

morning or the night before being baked. Scald 2 cups sweet milk and
set aside to cool. Cream together in a bowl 1 heaped cup of A sugar,
 cup butter and lard and the yolk of egg. Add this to the lukewarm
milk alternately with 6 cups flour and the yeast cake dissolved in
&#8531; cup lukewarm water. Beat all together, and, lastly, add the
stiffly-beaten white of egg. Cover and set in a warm place to rise
over night, or, if set to rise in the morning, stand about 2 hours
until light. Put an extra cup of flour on the bake-board, take out
large spoonfuls of the dough, mix in just enough flour to roll out
into flat cakes, spread on well-greased pie tins, stand in a warm
place until light, about 1 hours. When the cakes are ready for the
oven, brush melted butter over the top, strew thickly with brown
sugar, or spread rivels over top, composed of  cup sugar,  cup
flour and 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, crumbled together. Strew these
over the cakes just before placing them in the oven of range.</p>

<p>For these German-raised cakes, take  cup mashed potatoes and 
cup of potato water,  cup lard and butter mixed, creamed with 
cup sugar. Mix with these ingredients about 3 cups of flour and 1
cup of yeast. Set this sponge to rise at night in a warm place, well
covered. The next morning add to the light, well-risen sponge, 2 eggs,
 cup sugar and about 1 cups flour. Let stand in a warm place
until light. Then roll out pieces size of a plate, one inch thick;
place on well-greased pie tins, let rise, and when light and ready for
the oven brush over tops with melted butter and strew over the tops of
cakes the following: Mix <a name='Page_208'></a>1 cup of flour,  cup of sugar and yolk of
1 egg. Flavor with a few drops of vanilla (or use vanilla sugar, which
is made by placing several vanilla beans in a jar of sugar a short
time, which flavors sugar). Rub this mixture of flour, sugar and yolk
of egg through a coarse sieve and strew over tops of cakes.</p>

<p>Or, this same recipe may be used by taking, instead of 1 cup of yeast,
one Fleischman yeast cake, dissolved in 1 cup of lukewarm water.
Instead of sponge being set to rise the night before the day on which
the cakes are to be baked, the sponge might be set early in the
morning of the same day on which they are to be baked&mdash;exactly in the
same manner as if sponge was set the night before; when light, add
eggs, sugar and balance of flour to sponge, and proceed as before.</p>

<p>Use 1 scant cup of liquid to 1 good cup of flour, usually, for
&quot;Griddle Cake&quot; batter. Use baking powder with sweet milk, 1 heaping
teaspoonful of Royal baking powder is equivalent to 1 teaspoonful of
cream of tartar and  teaspoonful of salaratus (baking soda)
combined. Use either baking powder or salaratus and cream of tartar
combined, when using sweet milk. Use 1 teaspoonful of baking soda to 1
pint of sour milk. Allow a larger quantity of baking powder when no
eggs are used. Have all materials cold when using baking powder. When
milk is only slightly sour, use a lesser quantity of soda and a small
quantity of baking powder.</p>

boiled potatoes), 1 tablespoonful of mashed potatoes added improves
the cakes; add salt. They need considerable. Stir in enough buckwheat
flour to make quite a stiff batter, beat hard and set to rise,
covered, in a warm place over night. The next morning add 1
teaspoonful salaratus, dissolved in a little hot water; 1
tablespoonful of baking molasses and a little warm milk, to thin the

pour. Let stand a short time, then bake on a hot griddle. Half this

you should have good cakes, but much of their excellence depends on
the flour. Buy a small quantity of flour and try it before investing

<p>When cooking any article to be immersed in fat use about this
proportion: 2 pounds of sweet lard to 1 of suet, which had been
previously tried out. It is cheaper, also more wholesome, to use part
suet than to use all lard. Save all pieces of left-over fat, either
raw or cooked, from steaks, roasts, bacon or ham. Cut all up into
small pieces and place in a pan in the oven until tried out, or put in
a double boiler and stand over boiling water until fat is tried out.
Strain and stand aside to be used as drippings. To clarify this fat,
pour boiling water over, let cook a short time, strain and stand away
in a cool place, when a cake of solid fat will form on top, which may
be readily removed and used as drippings, or it may be added to the
kettle of fat used for deep frying. Always strain fat carefully after
frying croquettes, fritters, etc. Should the frying fat become dark
add to the can of soap fat the economical housewife is saving. Return
the clear-strained fat to the cook pot, cover carefully, stand aside
in a cool place, and the strained fat may be used times without number
for frying. The housewife will find it very little trouble to fry
fritters, croquettes, etc., in deep fat, if the fat is always strained
immediately after using, and returned to the cook pot, kept especially
for this purpose. Stand on the hot range when required and the fat
will heat in a few minutes, and if the fat is the right temperature,
food cooked in it should not be at all greasy. When the housewife is
planning to fry fritters or croquettes she should, if possible, crumb
the articles to be fried several hours before frying, and stand aside
to become perfectly cold. When the fat for frying is so hot a blue
smoke arises, drop in the fritters or croquettes, one at a time, in
order not to chill the fat or plunge a frying basket, containing only
a couple of fritters at a time, in the hot fat, as too many placed in
the fat at one time lowers the temperature too quickly and causes the
fritters to be greasy and soggy. To test the fat before dropping in
the fritters, if a small piece of bread is dropped in the fat and
browns in about one minute the fat is the right temperature for frying
fritters, and fritters fried at the correct temperature should be a
rich brown and not at all greasy. When removing fritters from hot fat
place on coarse brown paper to absorb any remaining fat. Fritters
composed of vegetables, or oysters, should be served on a platter
garnished with parsley, and <a name='Page_220'></a>fritters composed of fruit, should have
pulverized sugar sifted over them liberally. Should a small piece of
bread brown in the fat while you count twenty, fat is the correct
temperature for frying croquettes, but is too hot for frying crullers
or any food not previously cooked.</p>

<p>One and one-half quarts of flour was sifted with 2 tablespoonfuls
of Royal baking powder, 1 teaspoonful of butter was cut through the
flour in small bits, 1 egg was beaten and enough milk or water added
to the egg to mix the flour into quite a soft dough. Sometimes instead
of molding the dough into balls large spoonfuls were placed over the
apples. Aunt Sarah had used this recipe for many years. This is a very
old recipe, and from it was made a larger quantity than ordinary
housekeepers usually require. Half the quantity, about 1 pints of
flour to 1 tablespoonfuls of baking powder, mixed according to the
directions given in the first part of recipe, would be about the
correct proportions for a family of ordinary size.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah frequently substituted sour cherries and a teaspoonful of
butter was added instead of ham and &quot;Schnitz.&quot; Dumplings prepared from
this recipe may be dropped on stewed chicken and broth and cooked or
steamed, make an excellent pot-pie. Should there be more dough mixed
than required for dumplings, place a panful in the oven and bake as
biscuits. More baking powder is required when dough is steamed or

liquid formed, then add 1 small onion, also grated; large egg or 2
small eggs, salt and pepper, 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley, 
teaspoonful baking powder (good measure), and a couple tablespoonfuls
of flour to thicken just enough to make the fritters hold together;
then drop by spoonfuls in deep, hot fat, and fry a rich brown. The
fritters form into odd shapes a trifle larger than a fried oyster,

the batter to come over top of the wafer iron. Then return it to the
hot fat, which should cover the wafer iron, and in about 25 or 30

easily removed from the iron on to a piece of brown paper to absorb
any fat which may remain. This amount of batter should make about
forty wafers. On these wafers may be served creamed oysters,
vegetables, chicken or fruit. When using the wafers as a foundation on
which to serve fruit, whipped cream is a dainty adjunct. One

gradually about 1 cups of flour to form a soft dough. Do not mix
it too stiff. Cover the bowl with a cloth; stand in a warm place until
it has doubled the original bulk. Flour the bread board and turn out
dough and mold into small biscuits or dumplings. Let these rise for
half an hour, butter a pudding pan and place dumplings in it, brushing
tops with melted butter. Pour milk in the pan around the dumplings to
about two-thirds the depth of the dumplings; set pan on inverted pie
tin in oven and bake a light brown. Serve with any desired sauce or
stewed fruit. Or, after the shaped dough has raised, drop it in a
large pot of slightly-salted boiling water, allowing plenty of room
for them to swell and puff up, and boil continuously, closely covered,
for 20 minutes. This quantity makes about 30 small dumplings. Should

<p>Aunt Sarah's raised dumplings from bread sponge were greatly relished
at the farm.</p>

<p>When bread sponge, which had been set to rise early in the morning,
and all flour necessary for loaves of bread had been added and loaves
were being shaped to place in bread tins, Aunt Sarah reserved an
amount of sponge sufficient for one loaf of bread, added a little
extra salt, shaped them into small balls, size of a lemon, placed them
on a well-floured board some distance apart to raise; when light (at
12 o'clock, if the dinner hour was 12.20), <a name='Page_228'></a>she carefully dropped the
light balls of dough into a large pot of rapidly boiling, slightly
salted water, covered closely, and boiled about 20 minutes, (Do not
have more than one layer of the dumplings in cook pot, and do not
place too close together; allow room for them to expand.)</p>

<p>Test by tearing one apart with a fork. Serve at once, and serve with a
roast, to be eaten with gravy, with butter, or they may be eaten as a
dessert, with jelly or maple syrup.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah frequently added an equal quantity of fine, dried bread
crumbs and flour and a little extra salt to a thin batter of bread
sponge (before all the flour required for bread had been added), made
about as stiff a dough as for ordinary loaves of bread; molded them
into balls. When sufficiently raised, boiled them either in water or
meat broth in the same manner as she prepared dumplings; made <i>only</i>
of <i>flour</i>.</p>

<p>This is a small economy, using <i>bread crumbs</i> in place of <i>flour</i>, and
these are delicious if prepared according to directions. Remember to
have a large quantity of rapidly boiling water in which to cook the
dumplings, not to allow water to stop boiling an instant and to keep
cook pot closely covered for 20 minutes before removing one, and
breaking apart to see if cooked through. These are particularly nice
served with stewed apricots.</p>

dumplings and boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. When cooked, take the
dumplings carefully from the stock on to a large platter, pour the
stock over the dumplings and serve.</p>

<p>These are excellent, but a little troublesome to make. One-half this

<p>Place a cook pot on the range, containing the end piece of a small
ham; partly cover with water. This should be done about three hours
before serving, changing the water once. Soak sweet, unpared, sliced,
dried apples over night in cold water. In the morning cook the dried
apples (or schnitz) in a small quantity of the ham broth, in a
separate stew-pan, until tender. Remove ham from broth one-half hour
before serving. Sweeten the broth with a small quantity of brown
sugar, and when the broth commences to boil add raised dumplings of
dough, which had been shaped with the hands into round balls about the
size of an ordinary biscuit. Cook 25 minutes. Do not uncover the
cook-pot after the dumplings have been dropped into the broth until
they have cooked the required length of time. When the dumplings have
cooked a sufficient time carefully remove to a warm platter containing
the cooked apple schnitz. Thicken the broth remaining with a little
flour, to the consistency of cream. Pour over the dumplings and serve
at once.</p>

<p>Dumplings&mdash;At 9.30 in the evening set a sponge consisting of 1 cup of
lukewarm milk, 1 tablespoonful sugar, 1 tablespoonful of butter, 1
egg,  of an yeast cake, add flour enough to form a sponge (as stiff
as may be stirred with a mixing spoon). Set to raise in a warm place
over night. In the morning add more flour to the risen sponge until
nearly as stiff as for bread. Form into round dumplings, place on a
well-floured bake-board to rise slowly. Twenty-five minutes before
serving drop dumplings into the hot broth in a large cook-pot.</p>

<p>The Professor's wife gave Mary this recipe, given her by an
Englishwoman. The recipe was liked by her family, being both
economical and good. When serving roast beef for dinner, before
thickening the gravy, take out about half a cup of liquid from the pan
and stand in a cool place until the day following. Reheat <a name='Page_233'></a>the roast
remaining from previous day, pour the half cup of liquid in an iron
fry pan, and when hot pour the following batter in the pan with the
fat and bake in a moderately hot oven about 25 minutes. Or the batter
may be poured in pan about 25 minutes before meat has finished
roasting.</p>

<p>The batter was composed of 1 cup of flour, sifted with 1 small
teaspoonful of baking powder and  teaspoonful of salt, mixed smooth
with 1 cup of sweet milk. Add 2 well-beaten eggs. When baked cut in
small pieces, surround the meat on platter, serve instead of potatoes
with roast. The addition of baked dough extends the meat flavor and
makes possible the serving of a smaller amount of meat at a meal.</p>

very good recipe for crullers, in which the economical housewife may
use the cup of cream which has turned sour. This necessitates using
less shortening, which otherwise would be required. Cream together
sugar, butter, add yolks of eggs. Dissolve the soda in a small
quantity of sour cream. Mix cream alternately with the flour. Add

<p>Cream together 1 cup sugar and 2 teaspoonfuls butter,  a grated
nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Add 2 eggs, beaten without separating
yolks from whites, and 1 cup of sweet milk. Then add 4 cups of flour
(or 1 quart), prepared as follows: Measure 1 quart of unsifted flour
and sift twice with 2 generous teaspoonfuls of baking powder. Use this
to thicken the batter sufficiently to roll out and use about 1 extra
cup of flour to flour the bake-board. Turn out one-half the quantity
of dough on to a half cup of flour on the bake-board. Roll out dough
half an inch thick. Cut out <a name='Page_234'></a>with round cutter, with hole in centre,
and drop into deep, hot fat. Use &#8532; lard and &#8531; suet for deep
frying; it is cheaper and more wholesome than to use all lard. When
fat is hot enough to brown a small piece of bread while you count 60,
it is the correct temperature for doughnuts. The dough should be as
soft as can be handled. When cakes are a rich brown, take from fat,
drain well on coarse, brown paper, and when cool dust with pulverized
sugar and place in a covered stone jar. Never use fat as hot for
frying doughnuts as that used for frying croquettes, but should the
fat not be hot the doughnuts would be greasy. These doughnuts are
excellent if made according to recipe.</p>

<a name='SOUPS_AND_CHOWDERS'></a><p><b>SOUPS AND CHOWDERS</b></p>
<br />

<p>Stock is the basis of all soups made from meat, and is really the
juice of the meat extracted by long and gentle simmering. In making
stock for soup always use an agate or porcelain-lined stock pot. Use
one quart of cold water to each pound of meat and bone. Use cheap cuts
of meat for soup stock. Excellent stock may be made from bones and
trimmings of meat and poultry. Wash soup bones and stewing meat
quickly in cold water. Never allow a roast or piece of stewing meat to
lie for a second in water. Aunt Sarah did not think that wiping meat
with a damp cloth was all that was necessary (although many wise and
good cooks to the contrary). Place meat and soup bones in a stock pot,
pour over the requisite amount of soft, cold water to extract the
juice and nutritive quality of the meat; allow it to come to a <a name='Page_235'></a>boil,
then stand back on the range, where it will just simmer for 3 or 4
hours. Then add a sliced onion, several sprigs of parsley, small
pieces of chopped celery tops, well-scraped roots of celery, and allow
to simmer three-quarters of an hour longer. Season well with salt and
pepper, 1 level teaspoonful of salt will season 1 quart of soup.
Strain through a fine sieve, stand aside, and when cool remove from
lop the solid cake of fat which had formed and use for frying after it
has been clarified. It is surprising to know the variety of soups made
possible by the addition of a small quantity of vegetables or cereals
to stock. A couple tablespoonfuls of rice or barley added to
well-seasoned stock and you have rice or barley soup. A small quantity
of stewed, sweet corn or noodles, frequently &quot;left-overs,&quot; finely
diced or grated carrots, potatoes, celery or onions, and you have a
vegetable soup. Strain the half can of tomatoes, a &quot;left-over&quot; from
dinner, add a tablespoonful of butter, a seasoning of salt and pepper,
thicken to a creamy consistency with a little cornstarch, add to cup
of soup stock, serve with croutons of bread or crackers, and you have
an appetizing addition to dinner or lunch.</p>

<p>The possibilities for utilizing left-overs are almost endless. The
economically-inclined housewife will be surprised to find how easily
she may add to the stock pot by adding left-over undesirable pieces of
meat and small quantities of vegetables. One or two spoonfuls of cold
left-over oatmeal may also be added to soup with advantage,
occasionally. Always remove the cake of fat which forms on top of soup
as soon as cooled, as soup will turn sour more quickly if it is
allowed to remain. If soup stock be kept several days in summer time,
heat it each day to prevent souring.</p>

<p>Pieces of celery, onion, parsley, beans and peas may all be added to
soup to make it more palatable. Also fine noodles. The yolk of a
hard-boiled egg dropped into the soup kettle and heated through,
allowing one for each plate of soup served, is a quick and appetizing
addition to a soup of plain broth or consomme.</p>

dice; fry until brown and crisp. Take 25 fresh clams, after having
drained a short time in a colander, run through a food chopper and
place in ice chest until required. Pour the liquor from the clams into
an agate stew-pan; add 6 medium-sized potatoes and 4 medium-sized
onions, all thinly sliced; also add the crisp bits of bacon and fat,
which had fried out from the bacon, to the clam juice. Cook all
together slowly or simmer 3 or 4 hours. Add water to the clam liquor
occasionally as required. Ten or fifteen minutes before serving add 1
cup of hot water and the chopped clams (clam juice if too strong is
liable to curdle milk). Allow clams to cook in the clam broth 10 to 15
minutes. Boil 2 quarts of sweet milk, and when ready to serve add the
hot milk to the chowder, also 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.
One-half this quantity will serve a small family. Serve crisp crackers
and small pickels, and this chowder, served with a dessert, makes an
inexpensive, nourishing lunch.</p>

<a name='BROWN_POTATO_CHOWDER'></a><p><b>BROWN POTATO CHOWDER</b></p>

<p>Put a pint of diced, raw potatoes in a stew-pan over the fire, cover
with 1 quart of water, to which a pinch of salt has been added. Cook
until tender, but not fine, then add water so that the water in the
stew-pan will still measure one quart should some have boiled away.
Place a small iron fry-part on the range, containing 1 tablespoonful
of sweet lard; when melted, it should measure about 2 tablespoonfuls.
Then add 4 tablespoonfuls of flour, a pinch of salt and stir
constantly, or rather mash the flour constantly with a spoon, being
careful not to allow it to scorch, until a rich brown; add this to the
diced potatoes and the quart of water in which they were boiled, stir
until the consistency of thick cream, or like clam chowder. Should
there be a few, small lumps of the browned flour not dissolved in the
chowder, they will not detract from the taste of it; in fact, some are
very fond of them. Perhaps some folks would prefer this, more like a
soup; then add more hot water and thin it, but be careful to add more
seasoning, as otherwise it would taste flat and unpalatable. Very few
people know the <i>good flavor</i> of <i>browned flour</i>. It has a flavor
peculiarly <a name='Page_241'></a>its own, and does not taste of lard at all. I would never
advocate <i>any</i> seasoning except butter, but advise economical
housewives to try this, being very careful not to scorch the flour and
fat while browning.</p>

<p>A mixture of butter and lard may be used in which to brown the flour
should there be a prejudice against the use of lard alone.</p>

<a name='PHILADELPHIA_PEPPER_POT'></a><p><b>PHILADELPHIA &quot;PEPPER POT&quot;</b></p>

<p>This recipe for far-famed &quot;Philadelphia Pepper Pot&quot; was given Mary by
a friend living in the Quaker City, a good cook, who vouched for its
excellence:</p>

<p>The ingredients consist of the following:


<ul><li>1 knuckle of veal.</li>
<li>2 pounds of plain tripe.</li>
<li>2 pounds of honeycomb tripe.</li>
<li>1 large onion,</li>
<li>1 bunch of pot-herbs.</li>
<li>4 medium-sized potatoes.</li>
<li>1 bay leaf&mdash;salt and cayenne pepper to season.</li>
<li> pound of beef suet&mdash;and flour for dumplings.</li></ul>

<p>The day before you wish to use the &quot;Pepper Pot&quot; procure 2 pounds of
plain tripe and 2 pounds of honeycomb tripe. Wash thoroughly in cold
water place in a kettle. Cover with cold water and boil eight hours;
then remove tripe from water, and when cold cut into pieces about 
of an inch square. The day following get a knuckle of veal, wash and
cover with cold water&mdash;about three quarts&mdash;bring slowly to the
simmering point, skimming off the scum which arises, simmer for three
hours. Remove the meat from the bones, cut into small pieces, strain
broth and return it to the kettle. Add a bay leaf, one large onion,
chopped, simmer one hour; then add four medium-sized potatoes, cut
like dice, and add to the broth. Wash a bunch of pot-herbs, chop
parsley (and add last), rub off the thyme leaves, cut red pepper in
half and add all to broth; then add meat and tripe and season with
salt; <i>if liked hot</i>, use a pinch of cayenne pepper. For the
dumplings, take 1 cup of beef suet, chopped fine, 2 cups flour, pinch
of salt, mix well together and moisten with enough cold water to allow
of their being molded or <a name='Page_243'></a>rolled into tiny dumplings, the size of a
small marble. Flour these well to prevent sticking together. When all
are prepared drop into soup, simmer a few minutes, add parsley and

<a name='FISH_CLAMS_AND_OYSTER_BONED_SHAD'></a><p><b>FISH, CLAMS AND OYSTER (BONED SHAD)</b></p>

<p>How many young cooks know how to bone a shad? It is a very simple
process, and one becomes quite expert after one or two trials. And it
fully repays one for the extra time and trouble taken, in the
satisfaction experienced by being able to serve fish without bones.
With a sharp knife cut the fish open along the back bone on the
outside of the fish, but do not cut through the bone, then carefully
cut the fish loose along the back bone on each side, cut the centre
bone away with the smaller bones branching out on each side attached.
Cut the shad into sizable pieces after being washed in cold water and
dried on a cloth to take up all the <a name='Page_244'></a>moisture. Dip pieces of fish into
white of egg containing a teaspoonful of water, roll in fine, dried
bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper, drop in hot fat, and fry a
rich brown. Serve on a platter, surrounded by a border of parsley.</p>

<p>Some small portions of the fish will adhere to the bones, however
carefully the fish has been boned. The meat may be picked from the
bones after cooking in salt water until tender. Flake the fish, and
either make it into small patties or croquettes.</p>

<p>Shad roe should be parboiled first and then dredged with flour on both
sides and fried in drippings or a little butter.</p>

all together a few minutes until oysters are heated through. Then turn
into a bowl and stand aside in a cool place until a short time before
they are to be served. (These may be prepared early in the morning and
served at six o'clock dinner.) Then fill good-sized, well-scrubbed
oyster shells with the mixture, sprinkle the tops liberally with
fine-dried, well-seasoned bread crumbs. (Seasoned with salt and

tipping over; stand in a hot oven about ten minutes, until browned on
top, when they should be heated through. Serve at once in the shells.

<a name='PLANKED_SHAD'></a><p><b><a name='Page_246'></a>PLANKED SHAD</b></p>

<p>After eating planked shad no one will wish to have it served in any
other manner, as no other method of preparing fish equals this. For
planked shad, use an oak plank, at least two inches thick, three
inches thick is better. Planks for this purpose may be bought at a
department store or procured at a planing mill. Place plank in oven
several days before using to season it. Always heat the plank in oven
about 15 minutes before placing fish on it, then have plank <i>very
hot</i>. Split a nicely-cleaned shad down the back, place skin side down,
on hot plank, brush with butter and sprinkle lightly with pepper and
salt. Put plank containing shad on the upper grating of a hot oven of
coal range and bake about 45 minutes. Baste frequently with melted
butter. The shad should be served on the plank, although not a very
sightly object, but it is the proper way to serve it. The flavor of
shad, or, in fact, of any other fish, prepared in this manner is
superior to that of any other. Fish is less greasy and more wholesome
than when fried. Should an oak plank not be obtainable, the shad may
be placed in a large roasting pan and baked in oven. Cut gashes across
the fish about two inches apart, and place a teaspoonful of butter on
each. Bake in oven from 50 to 60 minutes. Serve on a warmed platter,
garnished with parsley, and have dinner plates warmed when serving
fish on them. Do not wash the plank with soap and water after using,
but instead rub it over with sandpaper.</p>

oyster in fine, dried bread crumbs, well seasoned with salt and
pepper, then dip them in a lightly-beaten egg, and then in bread
crumbs. Allow them to stand several hours in a cool place before
frying. Place a few oysters at one time in a wire frying basket, and
immerse in smoking hot fat. Should too great a number of oysters be
placed in the fat at one time it would lower the temperature of the
fat and cause the oysters to become greasy. Drain the oysters when
fried on heavy, brown paper, to absorb any remaining fat, and serve at
once.</p>

<p>For all deep frying use two-thirds lard and one-third suet, as suet is
considered to be more wholesome and cheaper than lard. Two items to be
considered by the frugal housewife.</p>

<p>If fat for deep frying is the right temperature a crust is at once
formed, and the oysters do not absorb as great a quantity of fat as
when fried in only enough butter and drippings to prevent scorching,
as they must then be fried more slowly. Serve pickled cabbage and
tomato catsup when serving fried oysters.</p>

<a name='MEAT'></a><p><b>MEAT</b></p>

<p>Every young housewife should be taught that simmering is more
effective than violent boiling, which converts water into useless
steam. Even a tough, undesirable piece of &quot;chuck&quot; or &quot;pot roast&quot; may
be made more tender and palatable by long-continued simmering than it
would be if put in rapidly boiling water and kept boiling at that
rate. Meat may be made more tender also by being marinated; that is,
allowing the meat to stand for some time in a mixture of olive oil and
vinegar before cooking it. In stewing most meats a good plan is to put
a large tablespoonful of finely-minced beef suet in the stew-pan; when
fried out, add a little butter, and when sizzling hot add the meat,
turn and sear on both sides to retain the juice in the meat, then add
a little hot water and let come to a boil; then stand where the meat
will just simmer but not slop cooking for several hours. The meat then
should be found quite tender. Cheaper cuts of meat, especially,
require long, slow cooking or simmering to make them tender, but are
equally as nutritious as high-priced meats if properly prepared.</p>

<p>To quote from <i>The Farmers' Bulletin</i>: &quot;The number of appetizing
dishes which a good cook can make out of the meat 'left over' is
almost endless. Undoubtedly more time and skill are required in their
preparation than in the simple cooking of the more expensive cuts. The
real superiority of a good cook lies not so much in the preparation of
expensive or fancy dishes as in the attractive preparation of
inexpensive dishes for every day. In the skillful combination of
flavors. Some housewives seem to have <a name='Page_251'></a>a prejudice against
economizing. If the comfort of the family does not suffer and the
meals are kept as varied and appetizing as when they cost more, with
little reason for complaint, surely it is not beneath the dignity of
any family to avoid useless expenditure, no matter how generous its
income. And the intelligent housekeeper should take pride in setting a
good table.&quot;</p>

<p>This is such an excellent article, and so ably written and true, that
I feel it would be to the advantage of every young housewife to read
and profit by it.</p>

<p>Buy about three pounds of beef, as for an ordinary pot roast. Place in
a large bowl. Boil vinegar (or, if vinegar is too sharp, add a little
water, a couple of whole cloves and a little allspice); this should
cover the piece of meat. Vinegar should be poured over it hot; let
stand a couple of days in a cool place uncovered; turn it over
occasionally. When wanted to cook, take from the vinegar and put in a
stew-pan containing a little hot fried-out suet or drippings in which
has been sliced 2 onions. Let cook, turn occasionally, and when a rich
brown, stir in a large tablespoonful of flour, add 1 cups of hot
water, cover and cook slowly for two or three hours, turning
frequently. Half an hour before serving add small pared potatoes, and
when they have cooked tender, serve meat, gravy and potatoes on a
large platter.</p>

<p>The writer knew an old gentleman who had moved to the city from a
&quot;Bucks County farm&quot; when a boy, who said that he'd walk five miles any
day for a dish of the above as his mother had prepared it in former
years.</p>

<p>Mary was surprised at the amount of valuable information to be
obtained from the different <i>Farmers' Bulletins</i> received at the farm,
on all subjects of interest to housewives, and particularly farmers'
wives. All books were to be had free for the asking.</p>

<p>The dishes Mary prepared from recipes in the <i>Farmers Bulletin</i> on
&quot;economical use of meat in the home,&quot; were especially liked at the
farm, particularly &quot;Stewed Shin of Beef&quot; and &quot;Hungarian Goulash&quot; (a
Hungarian dish which has come to be a favorite in the United States).</p>

simmer about two hours. Season with salt and pepper or paprika. From
the vegetables and spices a sauce is made as follows: Cook in
sufficient water to cover for 20 minutes; then rub through a sieve,
and add to some of the stock in which the meat was cooked. Thicken
with flour, using 2 tablespoonfuls (moistened with cold water) to each
cup of liquid, and season with salt and paprika. Serve the meat on a
platter with the sauce poured over it. Potatoes, carrots and green
peppers cooked until tender and cut into small pieces or narrow strips
are usually sprinkled over the dish when served, and noodles may be
arranged in a border upon the platter.</p>

<a name='BROILED_STEAK'></a><p><b>BROILED STEAK</b></p>

<p>When buying beefsteak for broiling, order the steak cut 1 inch to
1 inches thick. Place the steak on a well-greased, hot broiler and
broil over a clear, hot fire, turning frequently. It will take about
ten minutes to broil a steak 1-inch thick. When steak is broiled place
on a hot platter, season with butter, pepper and salt, and serve at
once. Serve rare or otherwise, but serve <i>at once</i>. Broil-steak
unseasoned, as salt extracts juice from meat. Steak, particularly,
loses its savoriness if not served <i>hot</i>. What to a hungry man is more
nutritious and appetizing than a perfectly broiled, rare, juicy,
steak, served hot? And not a few young and inexperienced cooks serve
thin steaks, frequently overdone or scorched, containing about the
same amount of nourishment a piece of leather would possess, through
lack of knowledge of knowing just how. Often, unconsciously. I will
admit; yet it is an undiluted fact, that very many young housewives
are indi<a name='Page_253'></a>rectly the cause of their husbands suffering from the
prevailing &quot;American complaint,&quot; dyspepsia, and its attendant evils.
And who that has suffered from it will blame the &quot;grouchy man&quot; who
cannot well be otherwise. So, my dear &quot;Mrs. New Wife,&quot; be warned in
time, and always remember how near to your husband's heart lies his
stomach, and to possess the former you should endeavor to keep the
latter in good condition by preparing, and serving, nourishing,
well-cooked food.</p>

<ul><li>5 pounds of a cheap cut of beef.</li>
<li>4 cups of potatoes cut into small pieces.</li>
<li>&#8532; cup each of turnips and carrots cut into -inch cubes.</li>
<li> an onion chopped.</li>
<li> cup of flour.</li>
<li>Season with salt and pepper.</li></ul>

<p>Cut the meat into small pieces, removing the fat. Fry out the fat and
brown the meat in it. When well browned, cover with boiling water.
Boil for five minutes and then cook in a lower temperature until meat
is done. If tender, this will require about three hours on the stove,
or five hours in the fireless cooker. Add carrots, onions, turnips and
pepper and salt during the last hour of cooking, and the potatoes
fifteen minutes before serving. Thicken with the flour diluted with
cold water. Serve with dumplings. If this dish is made in the tireless
cooker the mixture must be reheated when the vegetables are put in.
Such a stew may also be made of mutton. If veal or pork is used the
vegetables may be omitted or simply a little onion used. Sometimes for
variety the browning of the meat is dispensed with. When white meat,
such as chicken, veal or fresh pork is used, the gravy is often made
rich with cream or milk thickened with flour.</p>
<br />


<p><b>DUMPLINGS.</b></p>


<ul><li>2 cups of flour.</li>
<li>4 teaspoons (level) of baking powder.</li>
<li>&#8532; cup of milk or a little more if needed.</li>
<li> teaspoonful of salt.</li>
<li>2 teaspoonfuls of butter.</li></ul>

<p>Mix and sift the dry ingredients. Work in butter with the tips of the
fingers. Add milk gradually, roll out to thickness of <a name='Page_255'></a>half inch. Cut
with biscuit cutter. Place in a buttered steamer over a kettle of hot
water and cook from 12 to 15 minutes. If the dumplings are cooked with
the stew enough liquid should be removed to allow of their being
placed directly upon the meat and vegetables. Sometimes the dough is
baked and served as biscuits, over which the stew is poured. If the
stew is made with chicken or veal it is termed a fricassee.</p>

<p>This recipe tells of such an economical way of extending the meat
flavor that I think every young housewife should know it. Mary copied
it from <i>The Farmers' Bulletin</i>, an article on the &quot;Economical Use of
Meat in the Home.&quot; The dumplings, as she prepared them from this
recipe, were regular fluff balls, they were so light and flaky. I
would add, the cook-pot should be closely covered while cooking or
steaming these dumplings, and the cover should not be raised for the
first ten minutes.</p>

<p>A lesser quantity of baking powder might be used with equally good
results, but these dumplings are certain to be light and flaky. A
larger quantity of baking powder should be used when dough is steamed
or boiled than if dough is baked, if one expects good results.</p>

<a name='EXTENDING_THE_MEAT_FLAVOR'></a><p><b>EXTENDING THE MEAT FLAVOR</b></p>

<p>Mary learned, through reading <i>The Farmers' Bulletin</i>, different
methods of extending the meat flavor through a considerable quantity
of material, which would otherwise be lacking in distinctive taste,
one way to serve the meat with dumplings, generally in the dish with
it; to combine the meat with crusts, as in meat pies or meat rolls, or
to serve the meat on toast or biscuits. Borders of rice, hominy or
mashed potatoes are examples of the same principles, applied in
different ways.</p>

<p>By serving some preparation of flour, rice, hominy or other food, rich
in starch, with the meat, we get a dish which in itself approaches
nearer to the balanced ration than meat alone, and one in which the
meat flavor is extended through a large amount of the material.</p>

<p>The measurements given in the above recipes call for a level spoonful
or a level cup, as the case may be.</p>

<p>In many American families meat is eaten two or three times a day. In
such cases, the simplest way of reducing the meat bill <a name='Page_256'></a>would be to
cut down the amount used, either by serving it less often or by using
less at a time. Deficiency of protein need not be feared, when one
good meat dish a day is served, especially if such nitrogenous
materials as eggs, milk, cheese and beans are used instead. In
localities where fish can be obtained fresh and cheap, it might well
be more frequently substituted for meat for the sake of variety as
well as economy. Ingenious cooks have many ways of &quot;extending the
flavor&quot; of meat; that is, of combining a small quantity with other
materials to make a large dish as in meat pies, stews and similar
dishes.</p>

<p>The foregoing information may be useful to other young, prospective
housekeepers who may never have read &quot;the very instructive articles on
The Economical Use of Meat in the Home,' in the <i>Farmers' Bulletin</i>.&quot;</p>

<a name='PREPARING_A_POT_ROAST'></a><p><b>PREPARING A POT ROAST</b></p>

<p>When buying a pot roast, &quot;Aunt Sarah&quot; selected a thick, chunky piece
of meat, weighing several pounds, and a small piece of beef suet which
she cut into small bits, placed pan containing them on hot range,
added a small, sliced onion, and when fat was quite hot she added the
quickly rinsed piece of meat, and quickly seared it to retain the
juice; added 1 cup of hot water, a sprig of parsley, seasoning of salt
and pepper; cooked a short time, then allowed it to stand on the range
closely covered, where it would simmer gently several hours; turning
the meat frequently, adding a small amount of water occasionally, as
the broth was absorbed by the meat. An inexperienced cook will be
surprised to find how tender, palatable, and equally nutritious, an
inexpensive cut of meat may become by slow simmering. When the pot
roast has become tender, remove from the broth and place on a <i>hot
platter</i>; this latter is a small item, but dishes may be quickly
heated in a hot oven and meat and vegetables are more appetizing if
served hot on warmed plates. &quot;Forgive this digression; I fear the pot
roast will cool even on a warmed platter.&quot; After removing the meat
from the pan add a large tablespoonful of flour, moistened with a
small quantity of cold water, to the broth in the pan for gravy; cook
until thickened, strain sliced onion and parsley from the broth, add
<a name='Page_257'></a>seasoning of salt and pepper, serve on the platter with the meat; the
onion added, gives the gravy a fine flavor and causes it to be a dark,

then a crust is formed at once over the outside, which prevents the

perfectly cold, then fry brown, in deep hot fat.</p>

<p>Chicken, beef, veal and mutton may be prepared in the same manner.
When dipping croquettes, 1 tablespoonful of water may be added to the
white of egg and 2 tablespoonfuls of water if the <a name='Page_263'></a>whole of the egg is
used. Use the whites of eggs for dipping croquettes if possible.
Croquettes may be made the day before wanted, and placed in a

add one pint of hot water containing two sliced onions and a little
ginger. This prevents the flavor of wild game, objectionable to some.
When the meat has cooked tender, drain, dust pieces with flour, and
brown quickly in a pan containing a couple tablespoonfuls of hot lard,

Place ham in a large cook pot or boiler, partly cover with cold water,
let come to a boil, then move back on range where the water will
merely simmer, just bubble gently around the edge of the boiler. A
medium sized ham should be tender in five or six hours. When a fork
stuck into the ham comes out readily, the ham is cooked. Take from the
boiler and skin carefully, removing all the discolored portions of the
smoked end, stick 2 dozen whole cloves into the thick fat, and
sprinkle a couple tablespoonfuls of brown sugar and fine bread crumbs
over top. Place in a very hot oven a short time, until the fat turns a
golden brown. Watch carefully to see that it does not scorch. When
cold, slice thin and serve. Aunt Sarah frequently added a pint of
cider to the water in which the ham was boiled. She said this improved

wipe quite dry with a clean cloth and fry in a pan containing a little
hot drippings and a very little butter (one-<a name='Page_265'></a>half teaspoonful) just
enough to prevent its sticking to the pan. Do not fry as quickly as

as the flavor was much stronger <a name='Page_266'></a>than dried sage. Some folks add 2
tablespoonfuls of summer savory, but Aunt Sarah did not care for the
flavor. Cloves, mace and nutmeg may also be added if one likes
highly-spiced food. This is a matter of taste. A good plan is to
season the small pieces of meat before chopping, as this distributes
the seasoning through the sausage. Fill well cleaned casings, with the
finely chopped meat. Or form sausage into small pats, fry brown on
both sides and serve with home-made buckwheat cakes.</p>

<p>Small pieces of cold roast beef, veal or steak may all be utilized by
being put through the food chopper. To 1 cup of finely-chopped cold
meat add  cup of stale bread, which has soaked for a few minutes in
cold water. The water having been squeezed from the bread, it was
added to the meat, as was also a small quantity of finely-minced onion
or parsley, and either the yolk or while of 1 egg and a seasoning of
salt and pepper. Add left-over gravy, to cause the mixture to be soft
enough to form into small rolls or cakes, and fry in a pan containing
a couple tablespoonfuls of sweet drippings. Mashed potatoes may be
substituted for the bread with equally good results. The meat mixture
may be formed into small cone shapes, dipped in egg, then rolled in
fine bread crumbs and fried in deep fat.</p>

<p>Very appetizing sandwiches may he made from cold pieces of fried ham,
run through food chopper. Spread this on thinly-sliced, buttered
bread, with a dish of prepared mustard, spread over the prepared ham.
Small bits of boiled ham, which cannot be sliced, may also be used in
this manner.</p>

<p>The fat was cut from left-over pieces of roast beef (place a couple of
tablespoonfuls of fat in a pan on the range until the fat has fried
out), then add a little finely-minced onion and the beef cut in pieces
the size of a small marble, brown in the fat a few minutes, then add a

<p>Singe the fowl, after it has been picked; then with a small vegetable
brush quickly scrub it well, with luke-warm water. Do not let it lie
in the water. When perfectly clean rinse in cold <a name='Page_268'></a>water, wipe dry, cut
out the oil sack, remove craw from neck, draw the fowl, being careful
not to break the gall in the process, as that would cause the meat, as
well as giblets, to have a bitter taste. Take out the lungs, the
spongy red pieces lying in crevices near the bones of the back, and
pour cold water through the fowl until you have thoroughly rinsed and
chilled it, and no blood remains inside. I think fowls should be
rinsed thoroughly inside and outside with cold water (many good cooks
to the contrary). Wipe the inside of the fowl perfectly dry with a
clean cloth, and it is ready for the &quot;filling.&quot; Separate the liver and
heart from entrails and cut open the piece containing the gizzard;
wash the outer part, and put the giblets on to cook with a little hot
water; if wanted to use with the filling. If the fowl is wanted to
cook or steam the day following, do not cut in pieces and let stand in
water over night, as I have known some quite good cooks to do, as that
draws the flavor from the meat and makes it tasteless. If the giblets
are not to be cooked and added to dressing, place them inside the
fowl, tie feet together, and hang up in a cool place until wanted.
When serving a turkey dinner with its accompaniments one finds so many
things to be attended to in the morning, especially if the fowl is
cooked on a Sunday. It will be found a great help to the cook to have
the turkey or chicken stuffed with bread filling the day before it is
to be roasted, ready to pop in the oven in the morning.</p>

<a name='BREAD_FILLING_AS_AUNT_SARAH_PREPARED_IT'></a><p><b>BREAD FILLING AS AUNT SARAH PREPARED IT</b></p>

<p>Chop the cold, cooked liver, heart and gizzard into tiny dice; add
this to a bowl containing one quart of crumbled stale bread, seasoned
with 1 teaspoonful of salt,  teaspoonful pepper,  of a small,
finely-minced onion,  teaspoonful sweet marjoram and a teaspoonful
of chopped parsley. Stir into the crumbs 3 tablespoonfuls of melted
butter, moisten all with one egg beaten with 2 tablespoonfuls of milk.
Sir all together lightly with a fork. Fill the body of the chicken,
put a couple of spoonfuls of this dressing into the space from which
the craw was taken, tie the neck with a cord, sew up the fowl with a
darning needle and cord, after filling it. (Always keep a pair of
scissors hanging from a nail conveniently near the sink in your
kitchen, as it saves many steps.) <a name='Page_269'></a>The secret of <i>good filling</i> is not
to have it <i>too moist</i>, and to put the filling into the fowl <i>very
lightly</i>; on no account press it down when placing it in the fowl, as
that will cause the best of filling to be heavy and sodden. Rather put
less in, and fill a small cheese cloth bag with what remains, and a
short time before the fowl has finished roasting, lay the bag
containing the dressing on top of fowl until heated through, then turn
out on one side of platter and serve with the fowl. Instead of the
chopped giblets, add 2 dozen oysters to the dressing, or a few
chestnuts boiled tender, mashed and seasoned with butter, pepper and
salt and added to the crumbled bread. This makes a pleasant change. Do
not use quite as many crumbs if chestnuts or oysters are added. Place
fowl in covered roasting pan, put a couple of pieces of thinly-sliced
bacon on the breast of fowl, put two cups of hot water in the pan and
set in a very hot oven for the first half hour, then reduce the heat
and baste frequently. An ordinary eight-pound turkey takes from two to
three hours to roast; a chicken takes about twenty minutes to the
pound.</p>

<p>When the fowl has been sufficiently roasted, remove from pan to a hot
platter. Pour off some of the fat in the pan and add a small quantity
of milk to the broth remaining. Thicken with flour, for gravy, season
with salt and pepper and sprinkle one teaspoonful chopped parsley over
gravy after being poured into the gravy boat ready to serve. The yolk
of one egg added makes a richer gravy to serve with chicken.</p>

a couple tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed smooth with a little cold
water. Let come to a boil, and add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley.

be kept boiling continuously. About thirty minutes from the time they
commence boiling will be the time required for cooking potatoes of
ordinary size. It spoils potatoes to have the water stop boiling even
for a short time. Add half a teaspoonful of salt to the potatoes when
partly boiled and when cooked sufficiently drain the water from them
at <i>once</i> and sprinkle a little salt over the dry potatoes. Close the

a minute on the hot range to heat the milk, then beat all together
with a fork until creamy. Add more salt if necessary. That is quite
important, as potatoes require considerable salt. Cover the potatoes
with a cloth. Never allow to stand with the lid of the stew-pan over

<p>All young housewives may not know &quot;that there is more real food value
in potatoes baked 'in their jackets' than is found in preparing this
well-known tuber in any other way.&quot; The secret of a good baked potato
lies in having a hot oven, but not too hot. Scrub good sized potatoes,
or, for a change, they may be pared before baking, place in a hot
oven, and bake about 45 minutes, when they should be a snowy, flaky
mass inside the skins, palatable and wholesome. When fully baked they
should fed soft to the touch when pressed. Take from oven, pinch one
end of potato to break the skin to allow the gas to escape. Always
break open a baked potato. Never cut with a knife.</p>

<p>Medium-sized potatoes, pared, cut in half lengthwise, and baked in a
hot oven 25 to 40 minutes, until the outside of the potato is a light
brown, make a pleasant change from boiled potatoes. When baked the
proper length of time and served at once, the inside of potato should
be light and flaky. The housewife should occasionally serve rice or
macaroni and omit potatoes from the bill of fare, especially in the
spring of the year.</p>

<a name='VARIOUS_WAYS_OF_USING_SMALL_POTATOES'></a><p><b>VARIOUS WAYS OF USING SMALL POTATOES</b></p>

<p>Early in the season when small, early potatoes are more plentiful and
cheaper than large ones, the young housewife will <a name='Page_272'></a>be able to give her
family a change, while practicing economy, as there are various ways
of using small potatoes to advantage.</p>

<p>First, new potatoes, if about the size of marbles, may be scraped,
boiled in salted water, and served with a thin cream dressing,
sprinkled liberally with chopped parsley, or the boiled potatoes,
while still hot, may be quickly browned in a pan containing a couple
tablespoonfuls of hot drippings or butter. They are much better
prepared in this manner if the potatoes are put in the hot fat while
still warm. Or the small boiled potatoes may be cut in thin slices,
browned in a couple tablespoonfuls of butter or drippings and two eggs
beaten together stirred over the potatoes a few minutes before they
are ready to serve. The small potatoes may also be scraped and dropped
in hot, deep fat and fried like fritters.</p>

<p>When possible, the small potatoes should be well cleansed with a
vegetable brush and boiled without paring. They may then be easily
skinned after they are cooked. Some of the more important ingredients
are lost when potatoes are pared, and it is also more economical to
boil them before paring. The cold boiled potatoes may be cut up and
used for potato salad, or thinly sliced after being skinned and placed
in a baking dish alternately with a cream sauce consisting of milk,
butter and flour, and seasoned with salt and pepper, having the first
and last layer cream sauce. Sprinkle bread crumbs liberally over the
top, dot with hits of butter and bake in a moderate oven about 20
minutes until the top is nicely browned. Serve in the dish in which
they were baked.</p>

<p>Or peel one-half dozen medium-sized raw potatoes, cut into small,
narrow strips about &#8531; inch wide, dry on a napkin and fry in very
hot, deep fat about six minutes, then lift from fat, drain, sprinkle
salt over and serve hot. These are a nice accompaniment to broiled
steak.</p>

<p>Peel and slice, or cut in dice, 6 or 8 cold boiled potatoes, cut into
in a stew-pan with 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, salt and pepper to
season, heat all together, shaking pan occasionally. Add  cup of
cream, sprinkle a small teaspoonful of parsley over and serve hot.
Instead of slicing or dicing cold boiled potatoes (in the usual
manner) to be fried, if they be cut in lengthwise sections like an
orange (one potato should make about 8 pieces) and fried quickly in
enough hot fat to prevent burning, they can scarcely be dis<a name='Page_273'></a>tinguished
from raw potatoes cut in the same manner and fried in deep fat, and
are much easier to prepare. They should be served at once.</p>

<p>Another manner of preparing potatoes is to slice raw potatoes as
thinly as possible on a &quot;slaw-cutter,&quot; place in a fry-pan with a
couple of tablespoonfuls of a mixture of butter and sweet drippings.
Watch carefully, as they should be fried quickly over a hot fire,
turning frequently. When brown, serve at once.</p>

<p>Raw <i>sweet</i> potatoes cut about as thick as half a section of an
orange, fried in a couple tablespoonfuls of a mixture of sweet
drippings and butter, prove a change, occasionally.</p>

<p>In a baking dish place layers of pared, thinly sliced, raw white
potatoes. Season with a very little salt and pepper and scatter over
small bits of butter. A very little finely minced onion or parsley may
be added if liked. To 1 quart of the sliced potatoes use a scant half
pint of milk, which should almost cover the potatoes. Either sift over
the top 1 tablespoon of flour or 2 tablespoons of fine, dried bread
crumbs and bits of butter; place in hot oven and bake about  of an
hour, until top is browned nicely and potatoes are cooked through. Old
potatoes are particularly good prepared in this manner.</p>

tablespoons of butter cut in small bits, and about  a cup (good
measure) of water. Stand in a hot oven and bake about  of an hour.
Baste frequently with the syrup formed in the bottom of the dish. The
potatoes when baked should look clear and the syrup should be as thick
as molasses. Serve in the dish in which they were baked. Should the

may be placed on top the range and cooked about 25 minutes before

<a name='POTATO_CHIPS'></a><p><b>POTATO CHIPS</b></p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's way of making particularly fine potato chips: She pared
six large white potatoes, one at a time. As she wished to slice them
to fry, she rinsed the potatoes, rolled them on a clean cloth to dry
them. She sliced the potatoes thinly on a &quot;slaw&quot; cutter. She patted
the sliced potatoes between old linen napkins, until all moisture was
absorbed, then dropped them into hot fat, consisting of two-thirds
lard and one-third suet. Place only one layer of potatoes at a time in
the fat. The chips quickly turn light brown; then remove with a
perforated skimmer to a colander lined with coarse brown paper, to
absorb any remaining fat. Should the fat be the right temperature, the
chips will be entirely free from grease. Dust salt over the chips
while hot. She <i>never</i> allowed chips to stand in salt water, as many
cooks do. She usually made potato chips when frying doughnuts, and
always fried potato chips first; after frying doughnuts in the fat fry
several large slices of potato in it, as the potato clarifies it. Six
large, thinly sliced potatoes will make about five quarts of potato
chips when fried and may be kept several weeks in a dry place. The
potato chips may be re-heated by placing in a hot oven a few minutes
before serving.</p>

<p>All the members of the Landis family unanimously agreed in declaring
the dish &quot;Frau Schmidt&quot; taught Sarah Landis to prepare from the
delicious edible Fungi, known as &quot;Pasture&quot; mushrooms (gathered by
Professor Schmidt from rich, wind-swept pastures early in the fall of
the year until the coming of frost) were good enough to tickle the
palate of an epicure.</p>

<p><a name='Page_279'></a>Sarah Landis was very particular to use <i>none</i> unless pronounced
<i>edible mushrooms</i>, and not poisonous toad-stools, by Professor
Schmidt, who was a recognized authority. Said the Professor, &quot;The
edible variety may be easily recognized by one having a knowledge of
the vegetable. The cap may be readily peeled, and the flesh of the
'Pasture' mushroom, when cut or broken, changes in color to a pale
rose pink, and they possess many other distinctive features, easily
recognized, when one has made a study of them.&quot;</p>

<p>The following is the manner in which the mushrooms were prepared by
Fran Schmidt:</p>

simmer or steam for twenty minutes in butter and liquid, drawn from
the mushrooms by steaming, then uncover and allow liquid in sauce-pan
and mushrooms to cook about ten minutes longer, then sprinkle two
teaspoonfuls of flour over the mushrooms, brown a minute, stir into
this  cup of milk, or enough to make a sauce the consistency of
cream, season well with salt and pepper to taste. Have ready prepared
six crisply toasted and buttered slices of stale bread. Place four
mushrooms and a couple of tablespoonfuls of the mushroom sauce on each

in a kettle of rapidly boiling water, not salted; rather add a pinch
of sugar if corn is not as sweet as liked. Cover the kettle to prevent
steam escaping. Do not use a <i>large quantity of water</i>. Corn is
sweeter if steamed. Boil from ten to fifteen minutes. If corn is not
cooked in that time, it should be used uncooked for corn fritters, as

<a name='TO_MAKE_SAUER_KRAUT'></a><p><b>TO MAKE &quot;SAUER KRAUT&quot;</b></p>

<p>Cut heads of cabbage in half, after trimming off outside leaves. Cut
out centres or hearts, cut cabbage fine on a regular old-fashioned
cabbage cutter, which has a square box on top of cutter to hold the
pieces of cabbage when being pushed back and forth over the cutter. If
not possible to procure this, use small slaw cutter for the purpose.</p>

<p>Partly fill a large pan with the cut cabbage, and mix enough salt,
with the hands, through the cut cabbage to be palatable when tasted,
no more. This was the rule taught Aunt Sarah by her Grandmother, and
always followed by her. Then put the salted cabbage into a wooden cask
or small tub to the depth of several inches. Pound the cabbage down
well with a long-handled, heavy, wooden mallet, something like a very
large wooden potato masher. Then mix another panful of finely cut
cabbage, lightly salted, into the tub and pound down well, as before.
Continue in this manner until the tub is partly filled with cabbage,
pounding down well at the last until the liquid formed by the cabbage
and salt rises above the cabbage. Cover the kraut with a layer of
large, clean cabbage or grape leaves, then cover top with a clean
piece of muslin cloth, place a round, clean board on top and put a
well-scrubbed, heavy stone on the board to weight it down. Stand the
tub in a warm place several days, to ferment. When fermentation
begins, the liquor rises over the top of the board. Remove the scrum
which rises to top, in about six days, and stand in a cool part of the
cellar after washing stone and cloth with cold water, return to top of
kraut and in two weeks the sauer kraut will be ready to use. Should
the sauer kraut require extra liquid at any time, add one quart of
water in which has been <a name='Page_284'></a>dissolved two teaspoonfuls of salt. Squeeze
the sauer kraut quite dry when taking it from the brine to cook. Boil
about two quarts of the sauer kraut several hours with a piece of
fresh pork and a little water until the pork is thoroughly cooked
through, when the sauer kraut should be cooked tender.</p>

<p>Some prefer &quot;frankfurters&quot; cooked with the kraut instead of pork, and
others do not care for the German dish without the accompaniment of
drop dumplings. Serve mashed potatoes and simple dessert with sauer
kraut.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah taught Mary to save the hearts of the cabbage usually
thrown aside when making sauer kraut. The hearts were trimmed all one
size, like small triangles. She cooked them in salted water until
tender, drained them and served with a cream dressing, and they had
much the flavor of a dish of cauliflower.</p>

<p>Frau Schmidt always placed several tart apples among her sauer kraut
when making it, and thought it improved the flavor of the kraut; gave
it a &quot;winey&quot; flavor, obtained in no other manner. A sour apple, cored
and cooked with sauer kraut is considered by some cooks an
improvement. The apple, of course, is not eatable. Aunt Sarah <i>never</i>
placed apples with her sauer kraut.</p>

Then a pinch of salt was added and  cup of sweet milk. Enough flour
was added to make a soft dough, and one tablespoonful of baking powder
was sifted with a very little flour into the batter, then a little
more flour was added to make the dough the right consistency. Form the
dough into small balls, handling as little as possible. Drop on top of
the hot cooked &quot;sauer kraut&quot; in cook-pot on range and boil, closely
covered, about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah taught Mary to cook green vegetables, peas, spinach, etc.,
in a stew-pan <i>uncovered</i>, if she wished them to retain their natural
color. Also, that old potatoes may be freshened by being allowed to
stand a short time in cold water before being cooked, but they should
not stand too long a time in cold water, as it draws the starch from
them and causes them to be tasteless, and to lose part of their
nourishing qualities.</p>

<p>Also that one teaspoonful of salt will usually season one quart <a name='Page_285'></a>of
vegetables, to be put in when the vegetables begin to cook.
Cauliflower, cabbage, lettuce and watercress should stand in a pan
containing water and a little vinegar for a half hour. This will cause
insects to drop to the bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>Changing the water on cabbage and onions when partly cooked will
improve their flavor.</p>

<a name='COMMON_CREAM_SAUCE'></a><p><b>COMMON &quot;CREAM SAUCE&quot;</b></p>

<p>Young housekeepers will be surprised to learn of the various
attractive, appetizing dishes which may be prepared by combining them
with a &quot;cream sauce.&quot; After cooking vegetables until tender in salted
water, they should be drained and served with a cream sauce poured
over. The art of making a smooth, creamy sauce of the proper
consistency is easily acquired. A good rule for &quot;common cream sauce&quot;
is 1 cup of milk, water, or meat broth, thickened with 1 tablespoonful
to 1 tablespoonfuls of flour, or a combination of flour and
cornstarch. Mix flour, or cornstarch, with a small quantity of cold
milk or water, to a smooth paste, before adding it to liquid; add,
usually, one tablespoonful of butter. Place the mixture in a saucepan
and cook until the consistency of cream, add  teaspoonful of salt
just before removing from the fire, and dust pepper over when serving.
When mixing gravy to serve with roast beef or veal, omit butter. For a
thick sauce use either 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of flour and the same
amount of butter. This thick sauce may be used to mix with meat for
croquettes in the proportion of 1 cup of sauce to 2 cups of chopped
cold roast lamb, beef, veal or chicken. Should a richer sauce be
desired, add 1 or more yolks of eggs to the cream sauce. Some of the
numerous dishes which might be served by the young housewife to vary
the daily bill of fare by the addition of &quot;cream sauce,&quot; are: Small,
new potatoes, cauliflower, onions, cabbage asparagus tips, thinly
sliced carrots, celery, mushrooms, fish, oysters, chicken, veal and
sweetbreads. All of these, when coked, may be served on slices of
toasted bread, or served in Pattie-cases, with cream sauce, or served
simply with cream sauce.</p>

<a name='PREPARATION_OF_SAVORY_GRAVIES'></a><p><b><a name='Page_287'></a>PREPARATION OF SAVORY GRAVIES</b></p>

<p>The art of preparing savory gravies and sauces is more important in
connection with the serving of the cheaper meats than in connection
with the cooking of the more expensive cuts.</p>

<p>There are a few general principles underlying the making of all sauces
or gravies, whether the liquid used is water, milk, stock, tomato
juice or some combination of these. For ordinary gravy, 2 level
tablespoonfuls of flour or 1 tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, or
arrow root, is sufficient to thicken a cup of liquid. This is true
excepting in recipes where the flour is browned. In this case, about
 tablespoonful more should be allowed, for browned flour does not
thicken so well as unbrowned. The fat used may be butter or the
drippings from the meat, the allowance being 2 tablespoonfuls to a cup
of liquid. The easiest way to mix the ingredients is to heat the fat,
add the flour and cook until the mixture ceases to bubble, and then to
add the liquid. This is a quick method and by using it there is little
danger of getting a lumpy gravy. Many persons, however, think it is
not a wholesome method, and prefer the old-fashioned one of thickening
the gravy by means of flour mixed with a little cold water. (Aunt
Sarah was one who thought thus.) The latter method is not &quot;practicable
for brown gravies,&quot; to quote the <i>Farmers' Bulletin</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Farmers' Bulletin</i> further adds:</p>

<p>&quot;Considering the large amount of discussion about the digestibility of
fried food and of gravies made by heating flour in fat, a few words on
the subject at this point may not be out of order. It is difficult to
see how heating the fat before adding the flour can be unwholesome,
unless the cook is unskillful enough to heat the fat so high that it
begins to scorch. Overheated fat, as has already been pointed out,
contains an acrid, irritating substance called 'Acrolein,' which may
readily be considered to be unwholesome. It is without doubt the
production of this body by overheating which has given fried food its
bad name. There are several ways of varying the flavor of gravies and
sauces. One should be especially mentioned here. The <i>flavor of
browned flour</i>&mdash;The good flavor of browned flour is often overlooked.
If flour is cooked in fat, until it is a dark brown color, a
distinctive and very agreeable flavor is obtained.</p>

<p>&quot;This flavor combines very well with that of currant jelly, and <a name='Page_288'></a>a
little jelly added to a brown gravy is a great improvement. The flavor
of this should not be combined with that of onions or other
highly-flavored vegetables.&quot;</p>

<a name='BUTTER_CHEESE_AND_SUET_A_SUBSTITUTE_FOR_BUTTER'></a><p><b>BUTTER, CHEESE AND SUET&mdash;A SUBSTITUTE FOR BUTTER</b></p>

<p>This formula for preparing a good, sweet, wholesome substitute for
butter to be used for baking and frying was given Aunt Sarah by a
thrifty German hausfrau, who prepared and used it in her large family
many years. Aunt Sarah always kept a supply on hand. It was made as
follows:


<ul><li>10 pounds of fine solid kidney suet.</li>
<li>10 pounds of clean pork fat.</li>
<li>10 pounds of butter.</li></ul>

<p>The suet cut in small pieces was put in a large boiler of water,
boiled until all was melted, and the fat extracted from the suet. It
was then all poured through a fine sieve into a vessel containing hot
water (the larger the quantity of hot water the finer the fat will
be). Stand aside to become cold and solid. The boiling process
prevents the peculiar taste which <i>fried</i> lard and suet usually
possess. Treat the pork fat in a similar manner. Allow the suet and
pork fat to stand until the following morning, when remove the solid
fat from the boiler of water, wipe off all moisture and add both pork
fat and suet fat to the melted butter, which had been prepared in the
following manner: The butter was melted in a porcelain lined boiler
and allowed to cook until all salt and other foreign substance had
settled and the butter had the appearance of clear oil. At this point
the butter should be watched carefully, as when settled it might
quickly boil over, when you would be liable to lose your butter,
besides suffering serious consequences. Now the liquid butter, suet
and pork fat are all put together into a large boiler and allowed to
melt together on the back part of the range. This will probably be
done in the morning. After the noon meal is finished move the boiler
containing fat to front part of range; let come to a boil, skimming it
occasionally as it boils up. It needs close watching now, the fat
being liable to cook over the top of boiler, when the &quot;fat&quot; will
surely be &quot;in the fire.&quot; Carefully pour into stone crock, and it may
be kept for months in a cool place. <a name='Page_289'></a>The fat which has been first
poured off the top, if it has been carefully skimmed, will keep
longest. The last taken from the boiler should be put in a stone crock
to use first. This may be prepared in lesser quantities, or a smaller
quantity of butter might be used to mix with the lard and suet.
Although the preparation is to be preferred composed of equal
quantities of butter, lard and suet, adding milk to the first water in
which the suet is boiled is quite an improvement. After filling the
crocks with the fat, take the boiled-out suet and hard scraps and
settlings of butter remaining and go through the same process and you
will have a small jar of cooking fat for immediate use. A little
trouble to do this, I admit, but one is well paid by having good,
sweet, inexpensive cooking fat. I should advise a young housekeeper to
experiment with one pound each of clarified suet and pork fat after it
is rendered, and one pound of butter before attempting the preparation
of a larger quantity.</p>

<a name='BUTTER_AS_IT_WAS_MADE_AT_THE_FARM_BY_AUNT_SARAH'></a><p><b>BUTTER&mdash;AS IT WAS MADE AT THE FARM, BY &quot;AUNT SARAH&quot;</b></p>

<p>Aunt Sarah strained fresh, sweet milk into small, brown earthenware
crocks kept for this purpose, scrupulously clean. The crocks were kept
in the spring-house or cellar in summer (in cold weather the milk
should be kept in a warmer place to allow cream to form on the top of
the milk). When the cream was thick and sour she skimmed the cream
from off the top of milk every day, stirring the cream well together
every time she added fresh cream to that on hand. Aunt Sarah churned
twice a week; sour cream should not be kept a longer time than one
week. The churn was scalded with boiling water, then rinsed with cold
water; this prevented the butter adhering to the churn. The cream
should be at a temperature of 60 degrees when put in the churn, but
this would be almost too cold in Winter. In very hot weather the
temperature of the cream should be 56 degrees. Aunt Sarah tested the
cream with a small dairy tube thermometer. She churned steadily and
usually had butter &quot;come&quot; in about 25 minutes, but should the cream he
too cold or too warm it would be necessary to churn a longer time. If
the cream is too warm, stand vessel containing cream on ice; if too
cold, stand in a warm place near the range. When the sour cream <a name='Page_290'></a>had
been churned a certain length of time and granules of butter had
formed, she drained off the buttermilk and poured water over the
granules of butter. Water should be two degrees colder than the
buttermilk. After churning a few minutes the lump of butter was
removed from the churn, placed in a bowl, washed thoroughly several
times in very cold water, until no buttermilk remained. The butter was
worked thoroughly, with a wooden paddle, until all buttermilk had been
extracted. One small tablespoonful of salt was added to each pound of
butter. She worked the butter well, to incorporate the salt, and
molded it into shape. Aunt Sarah did not knead the butter, but
smoothed it down, then lifted it up from the large, flat, wooden bowl
in which it was molded. When the butter was to be molded into <i>small
shapes</i>, she scalded the small wooden molds, then dipped them into
cold water before using; this prevented the butter adhering to the
molds. Before commencing to churn butter, Aunt Sarah was particular to
have her hands scrupulously clean. All the utensils used were washed
in hot water, then rinsed in cold water, both hands and utensils. She
frequently wrapped small pats of freshly-churned butter in small
squares of clean cheese-cloth and placed in a stone crock with a
cover. Placed in the crock was usually, with the butter, a bunch of
sweet clover blossoms, which imparted to the butter a delicious
flavor.</p>

<p>Stand a pan containing three quarts of milk in a warm place until it
becomes sour and quite thick. Stand the pan containing the thick milk
on the back part of the range, where it will heat gradually but not
cook. When the &quot;whey&quot; separates from the curd in the centre and forms
around the edges it is ready to use. Should the sour milk become <i>too
hot</i> on the range, or <i>scald</i>, the curds, or smier-kase, will not
become soft and creamy. When the curd has separated from the &quot;whey,&quot;
pour the contents of the pan into a cheese-cloth bag and hang in the
open air to drip for several hours, when it should be ready to use.</p>

<p>From three quarts of sour milk you should obtain one good pound of
smier-kase. To prepare it for the table place one-half the quantity in
a bowl and add one teaspoonful of softened butter, <a name='Page_291'></a>a pinch of salt
and mix as smoothly as possible. Or the smier-kase may be molded into
small rolls, and a small quantity of finely-chopped Pimento added.
This will keep fresh several days if kept in a cool cellar or

<a name='USES_OF_SWEET_DRIPPINGS_AND_SUET'></a><p><b>USES OF &quot;SWEET DRIPPINGS&quot; AND SUET</b></p>

<p>For deep frying Mary was taught to use lard and kidney suet combined.
The latter had been tried out by cutting suet in small pieces. The
suet, in an iron pan, was placed in a moderately hot oven until fat
was tried out. To prevent suet when rendered having a taste of tallow,
place in the upper part of boiler, over one containing hot water, and
stand on a hot range until all is tried out, or melted, instead of
putting it in oven. Strain into a jar and stand aside in a cool place
until wanted. Take one-third of this tried-out suet to two-thirds lard
when frying croquettes, oysters, cruellers or fritters. Suet contains
food value equal to that of lard and food fried in this fat, combined
with lard, is more wholesome than if fried in lard alone&mdash;if any food
fried in fat <i>ever is</i> wholesome. And suet is more economical than
lard if rendered at home. Mary was taught by her Aunt to save all the
trimmings from steaks, fat left over from roasts, boiled ham, sausage,
bacon fat, etc. When different fats have been tried out, to clarify
them, add to every pound and a half of combined fat or drippings a
half cup of boiling water and a pinch of baking soda. Boil until water
evaporates and fat is clear. Strain into a bowl and keep in a cool
place. Clean, sweet drippings are preferred by most cooks to lard for
many purposes. All young housewives do not know that ham or bacon fat
may be substituted for half the shortening called for in many recipes
for molasses cakes (where spices are used) with good results. Also
that the grease rendered from clean fat of chickens, which greatly
resembles butter when tried out and cold, may be combined with an
equal quantity of other shortening in making cakes in which spices are
used. The difference in the taste of cake made from this fat, if
rendered sweet and clean, will not be noticed. Equal parts of ham or
bacon fat, pork chops or sausage fat, combined with butter, are
excellent for frying cornmeal mush, eggs, sweet potatoes, egg bread
and calves' liver. Also <a name='Page_292'></a>sliced tomatoes have a particularly fine
flavor if fried in bacon fat. Should fat removed from top of stock pot
have a flavor of vegetables, pour boiling water over, strain and stand
aside to cool; then remove the clean cake of fat on top of the water
and add to bowl of drippings. This is one of the small economies which
will, I think, appeal to the frugal young housewife. If possible,
procure an iron pot for deep frying. After using, strain the fat
remaining, adding sediment in the bottom of cook-pot to the can of
soap fat; then return the clean, strained fat to the cook pot. Keep in
a cool place, closely covered, and if careful not to scorch the fat.
It may be used over and over again, and croquettes, etc., may be
prepared in a few moments by simply heating the kettle of fat in which
to fry them.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah frequently filled small glass jars with rendered mutton
suet, scented with violet essence, to be used for chapped lips and
hands.</p>

<p>She placed on the range a small fry pan (size of a tea plate),

Lastly, she stirred in lightly the stiffly-beaten whites of eggs.
Poured all into the warmed fry-pan and placed it in a moderately hot

water the minute the eggs have been put in from the front part of the
range to a place where the water will keep hot, but not allow the eggs
to boil. Let the eggs remain in the hot water from 8 to 10 minutes. On
breaking the egg open, the yolk will be found soft, and the white of
the egg a soft, jelly-like consistency. This latter is the way Aunt

<a name='AUNT_SARAHS_METHOD_OF_PRESERVING_EGGS_WITH_LIQUID_WATER_GLASS'></a><p><b>AUNT SARAH'S METHOD OF PRESERVING EGGS WITH LIQUID WATER GLASS</b></p>

<p>Aunt Sarah for many years preserved eggs in water glass, or soluble
glass, also known as &quot;Sodium Silicate,&quot; a thick liquid about the
consistency of molasses. It is not expensive and may easily be
procured at any drug store. She used the water glass in the proportion
of 10 quarts of water to one pint of the water glass. The water glass,
although in liquid form, is usually sold <a name='Page_296'></a>by the pound, and 1
pounds equals one pint. The water should always he boiled and allowed
to cool before combining with the water glass.</p>

<p>She was particular to use none but perfectly clean, fresh eggs. She
placed the eggs, narrow end down, in an earthenware crock which had
been well scalded and cooled. When the water glass had been thoroughly
mixed through the water she poured the mixture over the eggs in the
crock.</p>

<p>A stronger solution might be used to preserve the eggs, but Aunt Sarah
declared she used eggs for baking cake which were good at the
expiration of a year, which had been preserved in a mixture of 10
quarts of water to a pint of water glass, and she considered this
proportion perfectly reliable. So I do not see the need of using a
large quantity of the water glass, although many recipes call for a
mixture of one pint of water glass to only 8 quarts of water.</p>

<p>Fresh eggs may be added daily until the crock is filled, having the
mixture at least one inch above the last layer of eggs. It is best not
to wash the eggs before packing, as this removes the natural
mucilaginous coating on the outside of the shell. Place clean, fresh
eggs carefully into the crock containing the water glass and water,
with a long-handled spoon to avoid cracking the shell. Stand the crock
containing eggs in a cool place, cover with a cloth tied over top of
crock, avoiding frequent change of temperature; they should keep one
year. The water glass solution may become cloudy, and resemble a
soft-soap mixture, but this is a natural condition and does not affect
the eggs.</p>

<p>April is considered the best month for packing eggs. Infertile eggs
are to be preferred to others. Carefully remove the eggs from the
water glass mixture with a long-handled spoon when wanted to use, as
the shells are sometimes not quite as hard as when placed in the
crock. The eggs may be used for cooking, baking, in fact, for any
purpose except soft-boiled but should you wish to boil them, a tiny
puncture should be made in the shell of these eggs before boiling.</p>

<p>Ten quarts of water to one pint of water glass will cover about 12 or
13 dozen eggs.</p>

<a name='SALADS_AUNT_SARAHS_SALAD_DRESSING'></a><p><b>SALADS&mdash;AUNT SARAH'S SALAD DRESSING</b></p>

<p>For this she used 1 pint of sour cream, 1 tablespoonfuls of flour,
1 tablespoonfuls of mustard (pulverized dry mustard), 3 eggs, 
cup butter (or  cup of olive oil may be used instead, if liked),
 cup good sour vinegar,  teaspoonful of black pepper and a pinch
of red pepper (cayenne), salt to taste,  teaspoonful of sugar.
Place in a bowl the 1 tablespoonfuls of flour with the same
quantity of mustard; mix smoothly with a little of the sour cream.
Then add the eggs, beaten in one at a time, or use, instead, the yolks
of five eggs. When using the whites for angel cake or any white cake
Aunt Sarah usually made salad dressing from the remaining yolks of
eggs. Add the sour cream and vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix all well
together and strain through a fine sieve and cook in a double boiler
over hot water until a creamy consistency. Pour in glass jars. This
dressing will keep well on ice or in a cool place for two weeks. If
too thick, thin with a little vinegar, water or milk when using it.
About  of a cup of this dressing was used for mixing with 1 cup of
the meat of cold, cooked chicken in making chicken salad. The white
meat of chicken was cut in dice and  cup of celery was also cut in
small pieces, a couple of hard boiled eggs, cut in dice, were added
and the whole was carefully mixed with the salad dressing. Cold boiled
veal or pork may be used instead of chicken for salad. Potato salad
was sometimes prepared by using a small quantity of this dressing,
adding, also, minced onion, parsley and celery. Hot slaw was prepared
by heating a couple of tablespoonfuls of the salad dressing and mixing
with shredded cabbage. Or use as a dressing for lettuce when not
served &quot;Au Natural&quot; with olive oil and vinegar at the table.</p>

<p>Should very <i>thick</i>, sour cream be used in making &quot;Aunt Sarah's salad
dressing,&quot; use a mixture of sour cream and sweet milk, instead of all
sour cream.</p>

thus: The leaves of vegetables used for salad, after being carefully
rinsed and looked over, were cut fine, and the following dressing
poured over hot and served at once.</p>

<p>A small quantity of bacon was finely minced and fried crisp. To about
2 tablespoonfuls of bacon and fat after being fried, 3 tablespoonfuls

add more lemon juice. A pint or even more oil may, with care, be
blended into two yolks. Care must be taken not to mix oil in too fast,
or the egg and oil will separate, making a mixture resembling curdled
custard. If this should happen, take another plate, another egg yolk,
and begin over again, blending a drop or two at a time in the curdled

<p>Use small green or yellow string-beans, which snap when broken, called
by some &quot;snap beans.&quot; String them carefully. (If quite small and
tender this should not be necessary.) Rub well with the hands through
several waters. This removes the strong bean taste. Have your kettle
half filled with boiling water on the range over a brisk fire. Put a
tablespoon of butter in the water, add beans by handfuls until all are
in and cook until tender. Turn the beans in a colander to drain. When
cool add a chopped onion, salt and pour enough good vinegar over to
cover, and allow to stand two days, when strain vinegar from beans.
Boil vinegar, <a name='Page_304'></a>add water if vinegar is quite sour and pour hot over
the beans. Fill quart glass jars with the beans and pour vinegar over,
within an inch of top of jar; pour pure olive oil over top of beans,
screw on jar covers tightly and stand in a cool place until wanted to
use. In the winter, when fresh salads were scarce, Aunt Sarah opened a
can of these beans. If they were very sour she poured cold water over,
allowed to stand an hour, drained and added a little fresh olive oil.
Every one called her &quot;bean salat,&quot; as the Pennsylvania Germans call
it, delicious. The instructions regarding the preparing and cooking of
string beans for salad will answer for beans used as a vegetable,
omitting vinegar, of course. There is a great difference in the manner
of cooking vegetables. Aunt Sarah always added an onion and a sprig of
parsley when cooking beans to serve as a vegetable.</p>

<a name='MEAT_SALADS'></a><p><b>MEAT SALADS</b></p>

<p>To quote from the <i>Farmers' Bulletin</i>: &quot;Whether meat salads are
economical or not depends upon the way in which the materials are
utilized. If in chicken salad, for example, only the white meat of
chicken, especially bought for the purpose, and only the expensive
inside stems of expensive celery are used, it can hardly be cheaper
than plain chicken. But, if portions of meat left over from a previous
serving are mixed with celery grown at home, they certainly make an
economical dish, and one very acceptable to most persons. Cold roast
pork or tender veal, in fact, any white meat, can be utilized in the
same way. Apples cut into cubes may be substituted for part of the
celery. Many cooks consider that with the apple the salad takes the
dressing better than with the celery alone. Many also prefer to
marinate (<i>i.e.</i>, mix with a little oil and vinegar) the meat and
celery or celery and apples before putting on the final dressing,
which may be either mayonnaise or a good boiled dressing.&quot;</p>

<p>Celery should not be allowed to stand in water. To keep fresh until
used it should be wrapped in a piece of damp cheese-cloth and placed
in an ice box or cool cellar.</p>

<p>Lettuce should be broken apart, carefully rinsed, and put loosely in a
piece of damp cheese-cloth and placed on ice to crisp before using.</p>

<p>Scald coffee pot well before using (never use metal). Place in it five
tablespoons ground coffee. (A good coffee is made from a mixture of
two-thirds Java to one-third Mocha.) Beat up with the ground coffee
one whole egg. Should the housewife deem this extravagant, use only
the white of one egg, or peel off the white skin lining inside of egg
shells and use. Add three tablespoons cold water and mix well
together. Stand on range to heat; when hot add one quart of
<i>freshly-boiled</i> hot water. Allow coffee to boil to top of coffee pot
three times (about eight minutes), pour over one tablespoon cold water
to settle. Stand a few minutes where it will keep hot, not boil. Place
a generous tablespoon of sweet thick cream in each cup and pour coffee
through a strainer over it. Always serve hot.</p>

<p>A larger or smaller amount of coffee may be used, as different brands
of coffee vary in strength and individual tastes differ, but five
tablespoons of coffee, not too coarsely ground and not pulverized, to
one quart of water, will be the correct proportions for good coffee.
Use cream and you will have a delicious, rich, brown beverage not
possible when milk is used. Better coffee may be made if whole grains
of roasted coffee be bought, reheated in oven and freshly ground
whenever used, rather finely ground but not pulverized. Coffee, when
ground for any length of time, loses strength. If coffee is ground
when purchased, always keep it in closely covered cans until used. Or
buy green coffee berries and roast them in oven; when coffee has been
roasted, stir one whole raw egg through the coffee berries; when dry,
place in covered cans, then no egg will be needed when preparing
coffee. As a substitute for cream, use yolk of fresh egg mixed with a
couple tablespoonfuls of milk.</p>

circumstances, boil tea, as tannin is then extracted from the leaves,
and the tea will have a bitter taste. Do not allow tea to stand any
length of time unless strained from tea leaves. Use one teaspoon of
tea for each cup, unless liked stronger, when add one extra teaspoon
to each three cups of tea. Some contend that tea is better, if at
first a small quantity of boiling water is poured over the leaves,
allowing it to steep three minutes&mdash;then pour over the remaining
quantity of boiling water and let stand about four minutes, when it is
ready to serve with cream and sugar, if liked. Should any tea remain

an ingredient; also to decorate the tops of raised cakes. When dried
currants and raisins are bought by the frugal housewife they are
quickly washed in cold water, carefully picked over, then turned on to
a sieve to drain. Raisins are seeded, then spread over pans, placed in
a warm oven about 15 minutes, then spread on a plate and allowed to
stand in a dry place for several days. When thor<a name='Page_308'></a>oughly dried place in
glass jars and stand aside until required. Currants or raisins should
always be well floured before adding to cake or pudding. The &quot;German
hausfrau&quot; usually serves stewed prunes or raisins with a dish of
noodles or macaroni.</p>

<a name='RICE_PUDDING'></a><p><b>RICE PUDDING</b></p>

<p>One of the simplest and cheapest of desserts depends partly on the
quality of the ingredients used, but chiefly on the manner of making
for its excellence. If prepared according to directions, you will have
a pudding both rich and creamy. Use 1 quart of good sweet milk (do not
use either skimmed milk or water), 3 tablespoonfuls of whole uncoated
rice (no more), 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, pinch of salt, vanilla
or almond flavoring.</p>

<p>Wash the rice well, mix all together in a pudding dish, bake from
2 to 3 hours in an oven with a slow, even heat. When a skin forms
on the top of the pudding, carefully stir through the rice. Do this
frequently. This gives the pudding a rich, creamy consistency. When
grains of rice are tender allow pudding to brown over top and serve
either hot or cold. Raisins may be added, if liked, or raisins may be
stewed separately and served with the rice, which many think a great
improvement to the pudding. Many think rice pudding should always be
flavored with grated nutmeg. Aunt Sarah, while using nutmeg flavoring
in various other dishes, never used it for her rice pudding.</p>

<p>When mixing a boiled pudding Aunt Sarah frequently substituted a large
tablespoon of fine dried bread crumbs instead of the same amount of
flour. She said, &quot;'Twas a small economy,&quot; and, she thought, &quot;the
pudding's improved&quot; by the use of bread crumbs.</p>

water and 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar. She allowed this to stand on the
range and cook while she mixed the following dough.</p>

<p>Into a bowl she sifted 1 pint of flour with 2 teaspoons baking powder,
one teaspoonful of sugar, a little salt. Cut 1 tablespoonful of butter
through the flour. Lightly mixed all together into a soft dough with
about  cup sweet milk. Should she have a left-over yolk of egg,
that was added to the milk. She rolled dough out lightly on the bread
board, cut vents in the crust to allow steam to escape and spread it
over the top of the dish containing the hot apples; placed in a hot
oven to bake until light brown on top. Serve with sugar and cream.</p>

sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar and chopped raisins, rolled up and

well buttered and flour sifted over, the pudding when steamed may be
easily removed to a platter. Slice and serve hot with the following
sauce:</p>

<a name='CEREALS_OATMEAL_PORRIDGE'></a><p><b>CEREALS&mdash;OATMEAL PORRIDGE</b></p>

<p>Oatmeal to be palatable and wholesome should be thoroughly cooked,
that is, steamed over a hot fire two hours or longer. Use a double
boiler of agateware. Place in the upper half of the boiler about 5
cups of water and stand directly over the hottest part of the range.
When the water boils furiously, and is full of <a name='Page_322'></a>little bubbles (not
before), stir into the boiling water about 2 cups of oatmeal (if
porridge is liked rather thick), and about 1 teaspoonful of salt.
(Tastes differ regarding the thickness of porridge.) Let stand
directly on the front of the range, stirring only enough to prevent
scorching, and cook ten minutes, then stand upper part of double
boiler over the lower compartment, partly filled with boiling water;
cover closely and let steam from two to three hours. In order to have
the oatmeal ready to serve at early breakfast the following morning,
put oatmeal on to cook about five o'clock in the evening, while
preparing supper, and allow it to stand and steam over boiling water
until the fire in the range is dampened off for the night. Allow the
oatmeal to stand on range until the following morning, when draw the
boiler to front part of range, and when breakfast is ready (after
removing top crust formed by standing), turn the oatmeal out on a dish
and serve with rich cream and sugar, and you will have a good,
wholesome breakfast dish with the flakes distinct, and a nutty flavor.
Serve fruit with it, if possible. A good rule for cooking oatmeal is
in the proportion of 2 cups of water to 1 cup of oatmeal.</p>

<p>The cereals which come ready prepared are taking the place of the
old-time standby with which mothers fed their growing boys. If you
wish your boys to have muscle and brawn, feed them oats. To quote an
old physician, &quot;If horses thrive on oats, why not boys who resemble
young colts?&quot;</p>

<p>For example, look at the hardy young Scot who thrives and grows hearty
and strong on his oatmeal &quot;porritch.&quot; Chopped almonds, dates or figs
may be added to oatmeal to make it more palatable. Use cup measuring
 pint for measuring cereals as well as every other recipe calling
for one cup in this book.</p>

<a name='COOKED_RICE'></a><p><b>COOKED RICE</b></p>

<p>Boil 1 cup of whole, thoroughly cleansed, uncoated rice in 3 quarts of
rapidly boiling water (salted) about 25 minutes, or until tender,
which can be tested by pressing a couple of grains of rice between the
fingers. Do not stir often while boiling. When the rice is tender turn
on to a sieve and drain; then put in a dish and place in the oven, to
dry off, with oven <a name='Page_323'></a>door open, when the grains should be whole, flaky,
white and tempting, not the soggy, unappetizing mass one often sees.
Serve rice with cream and sugar. Some prefer brown sugar and others
like crushed maple sugar with it. Or rice may be eaten as a vegetable
with salt and butter. Rice is inexpensive, nutritious and one of the
most easily digested cereals, and if rightly cooked, an appetizing
looking food. It is a wonder the economical housewife does not serve
it oftener on her table in some of the numerous ways it may be
prepared. As an ingredient of soup, as a vegetable, or a pudding,
croquettes, etc., the wise housekeeper will cook double the amount of
rice needed and stand half aside until the day following, when may be
quickly prepared rice croquettes, cheese balls, etc. On the day
following that on which rice has been served, any cold boiled rice
remaining may be placed in a small bake dish with an equal quantity of
milk, a little sugar and flavoring, baked a short time in oven and
served with a cup of stewed, seeded raisins which have slowly steamed,
covered with cold water, on the back of the range, until soft and
plump.</p>

<a name='CORN_MEAL_MUSH'></a><p><b>CORN MEAL MUSH</b></p>

<p>Place on the range a cook-pot containing 9 cups of boiling water (good
measure). Sift in slowly 2 cups of yellow granulated corn meal,
stirring constantly while adding the meal, until the mixture is smooth
and free from lumps. Add 1 level teaspoonfuls of salt and 
teaspoonful of sugar, and cook a short time, stirring constantly, then
stand where the mush will simmer, or cook slowly for four or five
hours.</p>

<p>Serve hot, as a porridge, adding  teaspoonful of butter to each
individual bowl of hot mush and serve with it cold milk or cream.
Should a portion of the mush remain after the meal, turn it at once,
while still hot, in an oblong pan several inches in depth, stand until
quite cold. Cut in half-inch slices, sift flour over each slice and
fry a golden brown in a couple tablespoonfuls of sweet drippings and
butter. Or dip slices of mush in egg and bread crumbs and fry brown in
the same manner. Some there are who like maple syrup or molasses
served with fried mush.</p>

<p>This proportion of corn meal and water will make porridge <a name='Page_324'></a>of the
proper consistency and it will be just right to be sliced for frying
when cold. Long, slow cooking makes corn meal much more wholesome and
palatable, and prevents the raw taste of cornmeal noticeable in mush
cooked too quickly. The small quantity of sugar added is not noticed,
but improves the flavor of the mush.</p>

<a name='MACARONI'></a><p><b>MACARONI</b></p>

<p>In early spring, when the family tire of winter foods and it is still
too early for vegetables from the home garden, and the high price of
early forced vegetables in the city markets prevent the housewife, of
limited means from purchasing, then the resourceful, economical
housewife serves macaroni and rice in various ways and makes
appetizing dishes of the fruits she canned and preserved for Winter
use, combined with tapioca and gelatine. Milk and eggs tide her over
the most difficult time of the year for young, inexperienced cooks.
When the prices of early vegetables soar beyond the reach of her
purse, then she should buy sparingly of them and of meat, and
occasionally serve, instead, a dish of macaroni and cheese, or rice
and cheese, and invest the money thus saved in fruit; dried fruits, if
fresh fruits are not obtainable.</p>

<p>Macaroni is such a nutritious food that it should be used frequently
by the young housewife as a substitute for meat on the bill of fare.
Also occasionally serve a dish of baked beans or a dish composed of
eggs, or milk combined with eggs, instead of the more expensive meat
dish, all equally useful as muscle-builders, and cheaper than meat.
The wise housewife will learn which foods furnish heat for the body
and those which produce fat and energy, and those which are
muscle-builders, and endeavor to serve well-balanced meals of the
foods belonging to the three classes and thus with fruit and
vegetables she will make wise provision for her family.</p>

<a name='BAKED_MACARONI_AND_CHEESE'></a><p><b>BAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE</b></p>

<p>Put 2 cups or  pound of macaroni (either the long sticks broken in
pieces or the &quot;elbow&quot; macaroni, as preferred) in a kettle <a name='Page_325'></a>holding
several quarts of rapidly boiling, salted water, and cook about 25
minutes, or until tender. Drain in a colander and allow cold water to
run over it for several seconds. This prevents the macaroni sticking
together. Place the macaroni in a buttered baking dish and pour over a
hot &quot;cream sauce&quot; composed of 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of water, 2
tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 even tablespoonfuls of butter and a pinch
of salt. (Too much salt is apt to curdle the milk.) Spread over the
top of macaroni about 3 tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, or, if
preferred, sprinkle over the top 3 tablespoonfuls of well-seasoned
dried bread crumbs and small bits of butter. Stand the bake-dish
containing the macaroni in a hot oven ten or fifteen minutes, until
lightly browned on top. Serve hot in the dish in which it was baked.
Stewed tomatoes are a nice accompaniment to this dish. Double the
quantity of macaroni may be cooked at one time and a part of it kept
on ice; the following day serve in tomato sauce, thus utilizing any
left-over tomatoes.</p>

<p>The macaroni may be cooked while the housewife is using the range,
early in the morning. Drain the macaroni in a colander and stand aside
in a cool place. It may be quickly prepared for six o'clock dinner by
pouring over a hot cream sauce and grated cheese and quickly browning
in the oven.</p>

<p>Or the macaroni, when cooked tender in salt water, may be quickly
served by pouring over it a hot cream sauce, before the macaroni has
become cold. Serve at once.</p>

<p>Housewives should be particular when buying macaroni to get a brand
made from good flour.</p>

<a name='CAKES_CAKE_MAKING'></a><p><b>CAKES&mdash;CAKE-MAKING</b></p>

<p>Sift flour and baking powder together several times before adding to
cake batter. Aunt Sarah usually sifted flour and baking powder
together four times for cakes. Flour should always be sifted before
using. Baking powder should be sifted through the flour dry. Salaratus
(or baking soda) should, usually, be dissolved before using in a
teaspoonful of hot water, unless stated otherwise. Cream of tartar
should be sifted with the flour. Flour should be added gradually and
batter stirred as little as possible afterwards, unless directions are
given to <a name='Page_326'></a>the contrary. Much beating after flour has been added is apt
to make cake tough. Cake will be lighter if baked slowly at first
After it has raised increase heat slowly so it will brown nicely on
top. The batter, if heated slowly, will rise evenly. This does not
mean a cool oven. To prevent cakes sticking to pans, grease pans well
with lard, and sift a little flour lightly over pan. Use baking powder
with sweet milk. Saleratus is always used with sour milk. Use 1
teaspoonful of saleratus to 1 pint of sour milk. Cream of tartar and
saleratus combined may be used with sweet milk instead of baking
powder. One heaping teaspoonful of Royal baking powder is equivalent
to 1 teaspoonful of cream of tartar and  teaspoonful of saleratus
combined. Either baking powder or a combination of saleratus and cream
of tartar may be used in a cake in which sweet milk is used. Usually
take 1 to 2 scant teaspoonfuls of baking powder to two cups of
flour. Saleratus should be used alone with sour milk. Put baking
molasses in a stew-pan over fire and allow it to just come to boil;
cool before using it. It will not sour as quickly in warm weather, and
the cake baked from it will have a better flavor. The cup used in
measuring ingredients for cakes holds exactly one-half pint. All cakes
are improved by the addition of a pinch of salt. When lard is used
instead of butter, beat to a cream and salt well. In mixing cakes,
beat butter and sugar together until light and creamy, then add the
beaten yolks of eggs, unless stated otherwise as for angel cake, etc.,
then the flavoring, then mix in the flour and liquid alternately. The
baking powder, flour and salt should have been sifted together three
or four times before being added. Lastly, fold in lightly the stiffly
beaten whites of eggs. Fruit well dredged with flour should be added
last, if used. Cool the oven if too hot for baking cakes by placing a
pan containing cold water in the top rack of oven. Sponge cake
particularly is improved by doing this, as it makes the cake moist.
Stir sponge cake as little as possible after adding flour, as too much
stirring then will make cake tough. Sift flour several times before
using for sponge cake, as tins causes the flour to become lighter.
Layer cake, and most small cakes, require a quick oven. The oven door
should not be opened for 12 minutes after cake has been placed in
oven. Rich cakes, loaf cakes and fruit cakes must bake long and
slowly. The richer the cake, the slower the heat required in baking.
<a name='Page_327'></a>To test the oven, if the hand can bear the heat of the oven 20 or 25
seconds, the oven then is the right temperature. After placing a loaf
cake in oven do not open the oven door for 20 minutes. If oven be not
hot enough, the cake will rise, then fall and be heavy. Angel cake,
sunshine cake and sponge cake require a moderate oven.</p>

<p>Raisins and dried currants should be washed and dried before using in
cake. All fruit should be dredged with flour before being added to
cake. Citron may be quickly and easily prepared by cutting on a slaw
cutter or it may be grated before being added to cake. When a recipe
calls for butter the size of an egg it means two tablespoonfuls. A
tablespoonful of butter, melted, means the butter should be measured
first, then melted. Aunt Sarah frequently used a mixture of butter and
lard in her cakes for economy's sake, and a lesser quantity may be
used, as the shortening quality of lard is greater than that of
butter. When substituting lard for butter, she always beat the lard to
a cream before using it and salt it well. If raisins and currants are
placed in oven of range a few minutes to become warmed before being
added to cake, then rolled in flour, they will not sink to bottom of
cake when baked.</p>

<a name='ANGEL_CAKE_AUNT_SARAHS_RECIPE'></a><p><b>ANGEL CAKE&mdash;AUNT SARAH'S RECIPE</b></p>

<p>Mary was taught by her Aunt, when preparing a dish calling for yolks
of eggs only, to place the white of eggs not used in a glass jar which
she stood in a cold place or on ice. When she had saved one even
cupful she baked an angel cake over the following recipe:</p>

<p>One heaping cup of pulverized sugar (all the cup will hold), was
sifted 8 times. One cup of a mixture of pastry flour and corn starch
(equal parts) was also sifted 8 times. The whole was then sifted
together 4 times. The one cupful of white of eggs was beaten very
stiff. When about half beaten, sprinkle over the partly-beaten eggs
one scant teaspoonful of cream of tartar, then finish beating the
whites of eggs. Flavor with almond or vanilla. Then carefully sift
into the stiffly beaten whites of eggs sugar, flour and corn starch.
Fold into the whites of eggs rather than stir. Aunt Sarah always baked
this cake in a small, oblong bread pan. This cake should be baked in a
<i>very</i> moderate oven, one in which the hand might be held without
inconvenience while counting one hundred; the oven should be just hot
enough <a name='Page_336'></a>for one to know there was fire in the range. Do not open the
oven door for 15 minutes, then increase the heat a little; if not too
hot, open the oven door a moment to cool and bake slowly for about 55
minutes.</p>

minutes in two square layer cake pans. Cover cakes first ten minutes
until they have risen. When baked turn cakes out of pans on to a
cloth. Take one at a time from the oven, spread as quickly as possible
with a tart jelly, either currant or grape, and roll as quickly as
possible, as when the cakes become cool they cannot be rolled without
breaking. Roll up in a cloth and when cool and ready to serve slice

<p>Mary's Aunt taught her to make this exceptionally fine cake, yellow as
gold, in texture resembling an &quot;angel cake,&quot; from the following
ingredients: The whites of 6 eggs, yolks of 3 eggs,  cup of fine,
granulated sugar,  cup of high-grade flour,  teaspoonful of
cream of tartar (good measure), a few drops of almond extract or 
teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>Mix ingredients together in the following manner: Sift sugar and flour
separately 3 times. Beat yolks of eggs until light, add sugar to yolks
of eggs and beat to a cream. The whites of eggs were placed in a
separate bowl and when partly beaten the cream of tartar was sifted
over and the whites of eggs were then beaten until dry and frothy. The
stiffly beaten whites of eggs were then added alternately with the
flour to the yolks and sugar. Carefully fold in, do not beat. Add
flavoring, pour batter in a small, narrow bread tin, previously
brushed with lard, over which flour had been dusted. The cake when
baked may be readily removed from the tin after it has cooled.</p>

<p>Bake cake in a very moderate oven about 60 minutes. After cake has
been in oven 15 or 20 minutes increase heat of oven. An extra fine,
large cake may be baked from this recipe if double the quantity of
ingredients are used.</p>

<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful sweet milk.</li>
<li>Grated rind of 2 lemons and juice of one.</li></ul>

<p>Stiffen the dough with about 3 cups flour and use about 1 extra
cup of flour to dredge the bake-board when rolling out dough and for
sifting over the greased baking sheets so the cakes will come off
readily. Roll dough very thin and cut in any desired shape. From this
recipe may be made 100 small cakes. The baking sheet (for which I gave
measurements in bread recipe) holds 20 of these small round cakes. Do
all young housewives know that if dough for small cakes be mixed the
day before baking and stood in a cool place, the cakes can be cut out
more easily and the dough may be rolled thinner, and as less flour may
then be used, the cakes will be richer?</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah always cut these cakes with a small round or heart-shaped
cutter and when all were on the baking sheet she either placed a half
of an English walnut meat in the centre of each cake or cut out the
centre of each small cake with the top of a pepper box lid before
baking them.</p>

<p>One quart of New Orleans molasses, 3 eggs, butter size of an egg.
Place all together in a stew-pan on range, allow it to come to boil,
stirring constantly, and when cool stir in one tablespoonful of
saleratus dissolved in a very little vinegar, and about 3 pounds of
flour. Do not have cake dough too stiff. Dough should stand until the
following day. Roll out at least  inch thick. Cut cakes as large
around as an ordinary coffee cup or cut with a knife into small,
oblong pieces, a little larger than half a common soda cracker. Bake
in a moderate oven. Should too much flour be used, cakes will be hard
and dry instead of soft and spongy. This very old and excellent recipe
had belonged to the grandmother of Sarah Landis. Cakes similar to the
ones baked from this recipe, also those baked from recipe for &quot;honey
cakes,&quot; were sold in large sheets marked off in oblong sections,

warm, into two-inch pieces. From this recipe was made thirty pieces of

<p>One quart of boiled honey (if possible procure the honey used by
bakers, as it is much cheaper and superior for this purpose than the
clear, strained honey sold for table use). Add to the warm honey two
generous tablespoonfuls of butter, yolks of four eggs, two ounces of
salaratus (baking soda), dissolved in a very small quantity of
vinegar, just enough to moisten the salaratus. Add just enough flour
to enable one to stir well with a spoon. Work the dough a half hour
and allow it to stand until the following day, when cut cakes from the
dough which had been rolled out on the bake-board one-half inch thick.
The dough should be only just stiff enough to roll out, as should the
dough be <i>too soft</i> the cakes will become hard and crisp, instead of
light and spongy, and if too great a quantity of flour is added the
cakes will not be good. As the thickening qualities of flour differ,
the exact amount required cannot be given. When about to cut out
cakes, the bake-board should be well-floured. Cut the cakes the size
of the top of a large coffee-cup, or roll out in one-half inch thick
on a well-floured baking sheet and mark <a name='Page_362'></a>in small, oblong sections
with a knife, they may then be easily broken apart when baked. These

<p>Beat all well together. Add flour enough that they may be rolled out,
no more. Flour bake-board well; cut dough with cake cutter into small
round cakes and bake in a rather quick oven. This recipe will make a
large number of cakes if dough be rolled thin as a wafer. Frau Schmidt
was able to keep these cakes some time&mdash;under lock and key. If cake
dough be mixed one day and allowed to stand over night, cakes may be
rolled out much more easily and cut thinner.</p>

<a name='PIES_FLAKY_PIE_CRUST'></a><p><b>PIES&mdash;FLAKY PIE CRUST</b></p>

<p>Have all the materials cold when making pastry. Handle as little as
possible. Place in a bowl 3 cups flour,  teaspoonful salt and 1
cup good, sweet lard. Cut through with a knife into quite small pieces
and mix into a dough with a little less than a half cup of cold water.
Use only enough water to make dough hold together. This should be done
with a knife or tips of the fingers. The water should be poured on the
flour and lard carefully, a small quantity at a time, and never twice
at the same place. Be careful that the dough is not too moist. Press
the dough with the hands into a lump, but do not knead. Take enough of
the dough for one pie on the bake board, roll lightly, always in one
direction, line greased pie tins and fill crust. If fruit pies,
moisten the edge of the lower crust, cover with top crust, which has
been rolled quite thin. A knife scraped across the top crust several
times before placing over pie causes the crust to have a rough, flaky,
rich-looking surface when baked. Cut small vents in top crust to allow
steam to escape. Pinch the edges of fruit pies well together to
prevent syrup oozing out. If you wish light, flaky pie crust, bake in
a hot oven. If a sheet of paper placed in oven turns a delicate brown,
then the oven is right for pies. The best of pastry will be a failure
if dried slowly in a cool oven.</p>

<p>When baking a crust for a tart to be filled after crust has been
baked, always prick the crust with a fork before putting in oven to
bake. This prevents the crust forming little blisters.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah always used for her pies four even cups of flour, 
teaspoonful baking powder and one even cup of sweet, <i>rich, home-made
lard</i>, a pinch of salt with just enough cold water to form a dough,
and said her pies were rich enough for any one. They certainly were
rich and flaky, without being greasy, and <a name='Page_373'></a>she said, less shortening
was necessary when baking powder was used. To cause her pies to have a
golden brown color she brushed tops of pies with a mixture of egg and
milk or milk and placed immediately in a hot oven.</p>

<p>Mary noticed her Aunt frequently put small dabs of lard or butter on
the dough used for top crust of pies before rolling crust the desired
size when she wished them particularly rich.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah always used pastry flour for cake and pie. A smooth flour
which showed the impression of the fingers when held tightly in the
hand (the more expensive &quot;bread flour&quot;) feels like fine sand or
granulated sugar, and is a stronger flour and considered better for
bread or raised cakes in which yeast is used, better results being
obtained by its use alone or combined with a cheaper flour when baking
bread.</p>

<a name='THE_PROFESSORS_WIFES_SUPERIOR_PASTRY'></a><p><b>THE PROFESSOR'S WIFE'S SUPERIOR PASTRY</b></p>

<p>For superior pastry use 1 cups flour, 1 cup lard,  teaspoonful
salt and about  cup of cold water, or three scant tablespoonfuls.
Put 1 cup of flour on the bake board, sprinkle salt over, chop  cup
of sweet lard through the flour with a knife, until the pieces are
about the size of a cherry. Moisten with about  cup of ice cold
water. Cut through the flour and lard with a knife, moistening a
little of the mixture at a time, until <a name='Page_374'></a>you have a soft dough, easily
handled. Roll out lightly the size of a tea plate. Take &#8531; of the
lard remaining, put small dabs at different places on the dough (do
not spread the lard over), then sprinkle over &#8531; of the remaining
half cup of flour and roll the dough into a long, narrow roll, folding
the opposite ends in the centre of the roll. Roll out lightly (one
way), then add lard and flour; roll and repeat the process until flour
and lard have all been used. The pastry may be set aside in a cold
place a short time before using. If particularly fine pastry is
required, the dough might be rolled out once more, using small dabs of
butter instead of lard, same quantity as was used of lard for one
layer, then dredged thickly with flour and rolled over and over, and
then ends folded together, when it should be ready to use. When wanted
to line pie-tins, cut pieces off one end of the roll of dough and roll
out lightly. The layers should show plainly when cut, and the pastry
should puff nicely in baking, and be very rich, crisp and flaky. When
preparing crusts for custards, lemon meringues and pies having only
one crust, cut narrow strips of pastry about half an inch wide, place
around the upper edge or rim of crust and press the lower edge of the
strip against the crust; make small cuts with a knife about &#8531; inch
apart, all around the edge of this extra crust, to cause it to look
flaky when baked. This makes a rich pie crust.</p>

<p>A very good crust may be made by taking the same proportions as used
for superior pastry, placing 1 to 2 cups flour on the bake board,
add salt, cut  cup lard through the flour, moistening with water.
Roll out crust and line pie-tins or small patty pans for tarts. This
pastry is not quite as fine and smooth as the other, but requires less
time and trouble to make.</p>

<p>The Professor's wife taught Mary to make this pastry, but Mary never
could learn from her the knack of making a dainty, crimped,
rolled-over edge to her pies, which she made easily with a deft twist
of her thumb and forefinger.</p>

you prepare the following filling: The juice and <a name='Page_375'></a>grated rind of 1
lemon, 1 pint sweet milk, 1 cup sugar, yolks of three eggs, 3
tablespoonfuls flour, butter size of a walnut. Cream together sugar,
flour, yolks of eggs, then add lemon, mix well then add to the scalded
milk on the range and cook until thick. Let cool, but do not allow to
become quite cold, spread on the two crusts, which have been baked.
When quite cold add 3 tablespoonfuls of sugar to the stiffly beaten
whites of the three eggs, spread on top of pies, sift 1 tablespoonful
pulverized sugar on top of meringue and set in a quick oven until fawn
color. Serve cold.</p>

between the apples, about 1 large tablespoonful altogether, and
sprinkle about 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar over, add about 1
tablespoonful of cold water when pies are ready to place in oven.
These pies should be baked in a very hot oven. When apples are soft
take pies from oven and serve one pie, hot; stand the other one aside

cup brown sugar and  cup of butter and lard, mixed and rubbed all
together with the hands, not smooth, but in small rivels. For the
liquid part she used 1 cup baking molasses, 1 cup hot water, 1
teaspoonful baking soda dissolved in a few drops of vinegar and
stirred this into the molasses and water. She divided the liquid among
the three pans, putting one-third in each crust, over which she
sprinkled the crumbs. Bake one-half hour in a moderate oven. These

(either cheese pie or plain custard) with a layer of fresh cherries
and poured the custard over the top of the cherries and baked same as
a plain custard pie.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah might be called extravagant by some, but she always made
egg desserts when eggs were cheap and plentiful, in the Spring. In
Winter she baked pies and puddings in which a fewer number of eggs
were used and substituted canned and dried fruits for fresh ones. In
summer she used fresh fruit when in season, ice cream and sherbets.
She never indulged in high-priced, unseasonable fruits&mdash;thought it an
extravagance for one to do so, and taught Mary &quot;a wise expenditure in
time means wealth.&quot;</p>

<p>The day preceding that on which mince meat is to be prepared, boil 5
pounds of beef. To the well-cooked, finely-chopped meat add 10 pounds
of tart apples, chopped into coarse bits; 2 pounds of finely-chopped
suet, 2 pounds of large blue raisins, seeded; 2 pounds of dried,
cleaned currants,  pound of finely-shaved citron, 2 tablespoonfuls
of cinnamon, 1 tablespoonful of cloves, 1 tablespoonful of grated
nutmeg, 1 small tablespoonful of salt, 1 pint of baking molasses, 1
pint of brandy or cider which had been boiled down. Mix all well
together, add more spices, if liked, also juice of 1 orange or lemon.
Place all ingredients in a large preserving kettle, allow the mixture
to heat through. Fill glass jars, seal and stand away until used. Add
more cider, should it he required, when baking pies.</p>

<p>Two pounds lean beef (uncooked), chopped fine,  pound beef suet,
shredded.</p>

<p>Put the beef and suet in a large stone jar, pour over it &#8532; of a
quart of whiskey. Let stand covered with a lid for a week, then add 2
pounds large, seeded raisins, 2 pounds Sultana raisins, 2 pounds
currants,  pound citron, juice and grated rind of 2 oranges and of
2 lemons, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, 2 grated
nutmegs,  teaspoon ground allspice, 1 pound sugar. Let stand two
weeks, then it is ready to use. When you wish to bake pies take out as
much of the mince meat as you wish to use and add chopped apples, two
parts of mince meat to one part chopped apples, and add more sugar if
not as sweet as liked. If too thick, add a little sherry wine and
water, mixed. Fill bottom crust with some of the mixture, cover with
top crust and bake. There must be just enough liquor in the jar to
cover the meat, as that preserves it. This seems like a large quantity
of liquor to use, but much of the strength evaporates in baking, so
that only an agreeable flavor remains; that is, to those who like
liquor in mince meat; some people do not. Others there are who think
mince meat not good unless made with something stronger than cider.
Mince pies made by this recipe are excellent. This recipe was given
Mary by a friend, a noted housekeeper and cook.</p>

Cut small green cucumbers from vine, leaving a half-inch of stem.
Scrub with vegetable brush, place in a bowl and pour over a brine
almost strong enough to float an egg;  cup of salt to seven cups of
cold water is about the right proportion. Allow them to stand over
night in this brine. Drain off salt water in the morning. Heat a small
quantity of the salt water and pour over small onions which have been
&quot;skinned.&quot; Use half the quantity of onions you have of cucumbers, or
less. Allow the onions to stand in hot salt water on back of range a
short time. Heat 1 cup of good sharp cider vinegar, if too sour, add
 cup of water, also add 1 teaspoonful of sugar, a couple <a name='Page_391'></a>of whole
cloves; add cucumbers and onions (drained from salt water, after
piercing each cucumber several times with a silver fork). Place a
layer at a time in an agate stew-pan containing hot vinegar. Allow
them to remain a few minutes until heated through, when fill heated
glass jars with cucumbers and onions; pour hot vinegar over until jars
are quite full. Place rubbers on jars and screw on tops. These pickles

<a name='MARMALADES_PRESERVES_AND_CANNED_FRUITS'></a><p><b>MARMALADES, PRESERVES AND CANNED FRUITS</b></p>

<p>Young housewives, if they would be successful in &quot;doing up fruit,&quot;
should be very particular about sterilizing fruit jars, both tops and
rubbers, before using. Heat the fruit to destroy all germs, then seal
in air-tight jars while fruit is scalding hot. Allow jars of canned
fruit or vegetables to stand until perfectly cold. Then, even should
you think the tops perfectly tight, you will probably be able to give
them another turn. Carefully run the dull edge of a knife blade around
the lower edge of jar cap to cause it to fit tightly. This flattens it
close to the rubber, making it air-tight.</p>

<p>To sterilize jars and tops, place in a pan of cold water, allow water
to come to a boil and stand in hot water one hour.</p>

<p>For making jelly, use fruit, under-ripe. It will jell more easily,
and, not being as sweet as otherwise, will possess a finer flavor. For
jelly use an equal amount of sugar to a pint of juice. The old rule
holds good&mdash;a pound of sugar to a pint of juice. Cook fifteen to
twenty minutes. Fruit juice will jell more quickly if the sugar is
heated in the oven before being added.</p>

<p>For preserving fruit, use about  of a pound of sugar to 1 pound of
fruit and seal in air-tight glass jars.</p>

<p>For canning fruit, use from &#8531; to  the quantity of sugar that you
have of fruit.</p>

<p><a name='Page_394'></a>When making jelly, too long cooking turns the mixture into a syrup
that will not jell. Cooking fruit with sugar too long a time causes
fruit to have a strong, disagreeable flavor.</p>

<p>Apples, pears and peaches were pared, cut in quarters and dried at the
farm for Winter use. Sour cherries were pitted, dried and placed in
glass jars, alternately with a sprinkling of granulated sugar. Pieces
of sassafras root were always placed with dried apples, peaches, etc.</p>

<a name='FRAU_SCHMIDTS_RECIPE_FOR_APPLE_BUTTER'></a><p><b>&quot;FRAU&quot; SCHMIDT'S RECIPE FOR APPLE BUTTER</b></p>

<p>For this excellent apple butter take 5 gallons of cider, 1 bucket of
&quot;Schnitz&quot; (sweet apples were always used for the &quot;Schnitz&quot;), 2
pounds of brown sugar and 1 ounce of allspice. The cider should be
boiled down to one-half the original quantity before adding the
apples, which had been pared and cored. Cider for apple butter was
made from sweet apples usually, but if made from sour apples 4 pounds
of sugar should be used. The apple butter should be stirred
constantly. When cooked sufficiently, the apple butter should look
clear and be thick as marmalade and the cider should not separate from
the apple butter. Frau Schmidt always used &quot;Paradise&quot; apples in
preference to any other variety of apple for apple butter.</p>

<p>A delicious cranberry sauce, or jelly, was prepared by &quot;Aunt Sarah&quot; in
the following manner: Carefully pick over and wash 1 quart of
cranberries, place in a stew-pan with 2 cups of water; cook quickly a
few moments over a hot fire until berries burst open, then crush with
a potato-masher. Press through a fine sieve or a fruit press,
rejecting skin and seeds. Add 1 pound of sugar to the strained pulp in
the stew-pan. Return to the fire and cook two or three minutes only.
Long, slow cooking destroys the fine flavor of the berry, as does
brown sugar. Pour into a bowl, or mold, and place on ice, or stand in
a cool place to become cold before serving, as an accompaniment to
roast turkey, chicken or deviled oysters.</p>

Kieffer pears, which had been pared and cored, (Measured after being
run through a food chopper.) The grated yellow rind and juice of five
medium-sized tart oranges, and 6 cups granulated sugar. Cook all
together about forty minutes, until a clear amber colored marmalade.
Watch closely and stir frequently, as the mixture scorches easily.
This quantity will fill about twenty small jelly tumblers. If the
marmalade is to be kept some time, it should be put into air-tight
glass jars.</p>

<p>The recipe for this delicious jam was original with the Professor's
wife, and Fritz Schmidt, being particularly fond of the confection,
gave it the name &quot;Wunderselda,&quot; as he said &quot;'twas not 'served often.'&quot;</p>

<p>Bartlett pears may be used, pared and cut in halves and core and seeds
removed, or small sweet Seckel pears may be pared. Left whole, allow
stems to remain, weigh, and to 7 pounds of either variety of pear take
one pint of good cider vinegar, 3 pounds <a name='Page_396'></a>granulated sugar, a small
cheese cloth bag containing several tablespoonfuls of whole cloves and
the same amount of stick cinnamon, broken in pieces; all were placed
in a preserving kettle and allowed to come to a boil. Then the pears
were added and cooked until tender. The fruit will look clear when
cooked sufficiently. Remove from the hot syrup with a perforated
spoon. Fill pint glass jars with the fruit. Stand jars in a warm oven
while boiling syrup until thick as honey. Pour over fruit, in jars,
and seal while hot.</p>

<p>When making apple sauce, cut good, tart apples in halves after paring
them, cut out the cores, then cook, quickly as possible, in half
enough boiling water to cover them. Cover the stew-pan closely. This
causes them to cook more quickly, and not change color. Watch
carefully that they do not scorch. When apples are tender, turn into
sieve. Should the apples be quite juicy and the water drained from the
apples measure a half pint, add a half pound of sugar, cook 15 or 20
minutes, until it jells, and you have a glass of clear, amber-colored
jelly. Add 1 teaspoonful of butter and sugar to taste to the apple
sauce, which has been mashed through the sieve. Apple sauce made thus
should be almost the color of the apples before cooking. If the apple
sauce is not liked thick, add some of the strained apple juice instead
of making jelly; as some apples contain more juice than others.</p>

<a name='BUCKS_COUNTY_APPLE_BUTTER'></a><p><b><a name='Page_404'></a>BUCKS COUNTY APPLE BUTTER</b></p>

<p>A genuine old-fashioned recipe for apple butter, as &quot;Aunt Sarah&quot; made
it at the farm. A large kettle holding about five gallons was filled
with sweet cider. This cider was boiled down to half the quantity. The
apple butter was cooked over a wood fire, out of doors. The cider was
usually boiled down the day before making the apple butter, as the
whole process was quite a lengthy one. Fill the kettle holding the
cider with apples, which should have been pared and cored the night
before at what country folks call an &quot;apple bee,&quot; the neighbors
assisting to expedite the work. The apples should be put on to cook as
early in the morning as possible and cooked slowly over not too hot a
fire, being stirred constantly with a long-handled &quot;stirrer&quot; with
small perforated piece of wood on one end. There is great danger of
the apple butter burning if not carefully watched and constantly
stirred. An extra pot of boiling cider was kept near, to add to the
apple butter as the cider boiled away. If cooked slowly, a whole day
or longer will be consumed in cooking. When the apple butter had
almost finished cooking, about the last hour, sweeten to taste with
sugar (brown sugar was frequently used). Spices destroy the true apple
flavor, although Aunt Sarah used sassafras root, dug from the near-by
woods, for flavoring her apple butter, and it was unexcelled. The
apple butter, when cooked sufficiently, should be a dark rich color,
and thick like marmalade, and the cider should not separate from it
when a small quantity is tested on a saucer. An old recipe at the farm
called for 32 gallons of cider to 8 buckets of cider apples, and to 40
gallons of apple butter 50 pounds of sugar were used. Pour the apple
butter in small crocks used for this purpose. Cover the top of crocks
with paper, place in dry, cool store-room, and the apple butter will
keep several years. In olden times sweet apples were used for apple
butter, boiled in sweet cider, then no sugar was necessary. Small
brown, earthen pots were used to keep this apple butter in, it being
only necessary to tie paper over the top. Dozens of these pots, filled
with apple butter, might have been seen in Aunt Sarah's store-room at
the farm at one time.</p>

<a name='CANNED_TOMATOES'></a><p><b>CANNED TOMATOES</b></p>

<p>When canning red tomatoes select those which ripen early <a name='Page_405'></a>in the
season, as those which ripen later are usually not as sweet. Wash the
tomatoes, pour scalding water over, allow them to stand a short time,
when skins may be easily removed. Cut tomatoes in several pieces,
place over fire in porcelain-lined preserving kettle and cook about 25
minutes, or until an orange-colored scum rises to the top. Fill
perfectly clean sterilised jars with the hot tomatoes fill quickly
before they cool. Place rubber and top on jar, and when jars have
become perfectly cold (although they may, apparently, have been
perfectly air-tight), the tops should be given another turn before
standing away for the Winter; failing to do this has frequently been
the cause of inexperienced housewives' ill success when canning
tomatoes. Also run the dull edge of a knife blade carefully around the
top of jar, pressing down the outer edge and causing it to fit more
closely. Aunt Sarah seldom lost a jar of canned tomatoes, and they
were as fine flavored as if freshly picked from the vines. She was
very particular about using only new tops and rubbers for her jars
when canning tomatoes. If the wise housewife takes these precautions,
her canned tomatoes should keep indefinitely. Aunt Sarah allowed her
jars of tomatoes to stand until the day following that on which the
tomatoes were canned, to be positively sure they were cold, before
giving the tops a final turn. Stand away in a dark closet.</p>

<p>Three quarts of sweet corn cut from the cob, 1 cup of sugar  cup of
salt and 1 pint of cold water. Place these ingredients together in a
large bowl; do this early in the morning and allow to stand until noon
of the same day; then place all together in a preserving kettle on the
range and cook twenty minutes. Fill <a name='Page_406'></a>glass jars which have been
sterilized. The work of filling should be done as expeditiously as
possible; be particular to have jar-tops screwed on tightly. When jars
have become cool give tops another turn, to be positive they are
air-tight before putting away for the Winter. When preparing this
canned corn for the table, drain all liquid from the corn when taken
from the can, pour cold water over and allow to stand a short time on
the range until luke-warm. Drain and if not <i>too</i> salt, add a small
quantity of fresh water, cook a few minutes, season with butter, add a
couple tablespoonfuls of sweet milk; serve when hot. This canned corn
possesses the flavor of corn freshly cut from the cob. Sarah Landis

kernels and carefully scrape remaining pulp from cob. Spread on agate
pans, place in a hot oven a short time (watch closely) and allow it to
remain in a cooled oven over night to dry. When perfectly dry place in
bags for use later in the season.</p>

<p>When the housewife wishes to prepare dried corn for the table, one cup
of the dried corn should be covered with cold water and allowed to
stand until the following day, when place in a stew-pan on the range
and simmer slowly several hours; add  teaspoonful of sugar, 1
tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper. This corn Aunt Sarah
considered sweeter and more wholesome than canned corn and she said
&quot;No preservatives were used in keeping it.&quot;</p>

use in the Winter. Aunt Sarah frequently cooked together an equal
amount of chestnuts and dried corn; the combination was excellent. The
chestnuts were soaked in cold water over night.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's preserved cherries were fine, and this was her way of
preparing them: She used 1 pound of granulated sugar to 1 quart of
pitted cherries. She placed the pitted cherries on a large platter and
sprinkled the sugar over them. She allowed them to stand several hours
until the cherries and sugar formed a syrup on platter. She then put
cherries, sugar and juice all together in a preserving kettle, set on
range, and cooked 10 minutes. She then skimmed out the cherries and
boiled the syrup 10 minutes longer, then returned the cherries to
syrup. Let come to a boil. She then removed the kettle from the fire,
spread all on a platter and let it stand in the hot sun two successive
days, then put in glass air-tight jars or in tumblers and covered with
paraffin. A combination of cherries and strawberries preserved
together is fine, and, strange to say, the flavor of strawberries
predominates.</p>

<p>A fine flavored preserve is also made from a combination of cherries
and pineapple.</p>

<p>When preparing this ice cream Mary used the following: Three cups of
cream and 1 cup of milk, 1 egg and 1 cup of pulverized sugar (were
beaten together until light and creamy). This, with 1 teaspoonful of
vanilla flavoring, was added to the milk and cream. The cream should
be scalded in warm weather. The egg and sugar should then be added to
the scalded milk and cream, stirring them well together. When the
mixture has cooled, strain it into the can of the freezer. Three
measures of cracked ice to one of salt should be used. The ice and
salt, well-mixed, were packed around the freezer. The crank was turned
very slowly the first ten minutes, until the mixture had thickened,
when it was turned more rapidly until the mixture was frozen.</p>

<a name='ICE_CREAM_MADE_BY_BEATING_WITH_PADDLE'></a><p><b>ICE CREAM MADE BY BEATING WITH PADDLE</b></p>

<p>This recipe for a delicious and easily prepared ice cream was given
Mary by a friend living in Philadelphia and is not original. She found
the ice cream excellent and after having tried the recipe used no
other. A custard was made of 1 quart of scalded milk, 6 eggs, 3 cups
of sugar. The eggs were beaten light, then sugar was added, then the
hot milk was poured over and all beaten together. She put all in a
double boiler and stirred about ten minutes, until thick and creamy. A
small pinch of soda was added to prevent curdling. When the custard
was perfectly cold she stirred in three cups of sweet, cold cream,
flavored with either vanilla or almond flavoring, and beat all
together five minutes, then turned the mixture into the freezer,
packed well with pounded ice and coarse salt. She covered the freezer
with the ice and salt and threw a heavy piece of old carpet or burlap
over the freezer to exclude the air. She let it stand one hour, then
carefully opened the can containing the cream, not allowing any salt
to get in the can. With a long, thin-handled knife she scraped down
the frozen custard from the sides of the freezer, and with a thin
wooden paddle beat it hard and fast for about five minutes. This made
the cream fine and smooth. Any fruit may now be added, and should be
mixed in before the cream is covered. The cream should be beaten as
quickly as possible and covered as soon as the fruit has been added.
Aunt Sarah usually made peach ice cream when peaches were in season.
Fine ripe peaches were pared and pitted, then finely mashed, 2 small
cups of sugar being added to a pint of mashed peaches. She allowed the
peach mixture to stand one hour before adding to the beaten cream.
When the mashed peaches had been added to the cream, she fastened the
lid and drained off part of the water in outer vessel, packed more ice
and salt about the can in the freezer, <a name='Page_410'></a>placed a weight on top to hold
it down, covered closely with a piece of old carpet to exclude the
air, left it stand three or four hours. The beating was all the labor
required. The dasher or crank was not turned at all when making the
ice cream, and when frozen it was delicious.</p>

<p>Mary was told by her Aunt of a friend in a small town, with a
reputation for serving delicious ice cream, who always made ice cream
by beating with a paddle, instead of making it by turning a crank in a
freezer.</p>

cup of sugar, small tablespoon of vanilla. Cook the milk in a double
boiler, moisten corn starch with a little milk. Stir it into the hot

creamy, add to the hot milk, cook a minute, remove from fire, add the
vanilla, and when cool freeze. Crush the ice into small pieces, for
the finer the ice the quicker the custard will freeze, then mix the
ice with a fourth of the quantity of coarse rock salt, about 10 pounds
ice and 2 pounds salt will be required to pack sides and cover top of
a four-quart freezer. Place can in tub, mix and fill in ice and salt
around the can, turn the crank very slowly until the mixture is
thoroughly chilled. Keep hole in top of tub open. When mixture is
cold, turn steadily until it turns rather hard. When custard is
frozen, take out inside paddle, close the freezer, run off the salt
water, repack and allow to stand several hours. At the end of that

<a name='CHERRY_SHERBET'></a><p><b>CHERRY SHERBET</b></p>

<p>Aunt Sarah taught Mary to prepare this cheap and easily made dessert
of the various berries and fruits as they ripened. Currants,
strawberries, raspberries and cherries were used. They were all
delicious and quickly prepared. The ice for freezing was obtained from
a near-by creamery. The cherries used for this were not the common,
sour pie cherries, so plentiful usually on many &quot;Bucks County Farms,&quot;
but a fine, large, red cherry, not very sour. When about to prepare
cherry sherbet, Mary placed over the fire a stew-pan containing 1
quart of boiling water and 1 pound of granulated sugar. Boiled this
together 12 minutes. She added 1 tablespoonful of granulated gelatine
which had been dissolved in a very little cold water. When the syrup
had cooled, she added the juice of half a lemon and 1 quart of pitted
cherries, mixed all together. Poured it in the ice cream freezer,
packed around well with coarse salt and pounded ice. She used 1 part
salt to 3 parts ice. She turned the crank slowly at first, allowed it
to stand a few minutes, then increased the speed. When the mixture was
firm she removed the dasher. She allowed the water to remain with the
ice and salt, as the ice-cold water helped to freeze it. She filled in
ice and salt around the can in the freezer and on top of the can;
<a name='Page_413'></a>covered the top of the freezer with a piece of old carpet and allowed
it to stand a couple of hours, when it was ready to serve. Almost any
fruit or fruit juice, either fresh or canned, may be made into a
delicious dessert by this rule.</p>

<p>One quart of boiling water and 1 pound of sugar boiled together to
form a syrup, then add 1 quart of juice or fruit and juice to measure
exactly one quart. Mix together according to directions and freeze.</p>

granulated sugar and 1 quart of water, about 12 minutes. While hot add
1 pint of grape juice and 1 teaspoonful of granulated gelatine, which
had been dissolved in a very little cold water, to the hot syrup. When
the mixture was partly frozen add the stiffly beaten white of 1 egg
and 1 tablespoonful of pulverized sugar, beaten together. All were
stirred together, covered and stood away until cold. Then placed in a
freezer, iced as for ice cream, and frozen in the same manner as for
cherry sherbet. The juice of all berries or fruits may be extracted in
the same manner as that of grapes.</p>

would bread for 10 or 15 minutes. If the cocoanut is a large or a dry
one, about  pound more sugar will be required. Shape the mixture
into small balls, press halves of English walnut meats into each ball,
or have them plain, if preferred. Stand aside in a cool place a half
hour. Melt a half cake of Baker's unsweetened chocolate, add a half
teaspoonful of paraffin, roll the small balls in this chocolate
mixture until thoroughly coated. Place on waxed paper to dry. From the
ingredients in this recipe was made 3 pounds of candy.</p>

<p>Four tablespoonfuls New Orleans molasses, 9 tablespoonfuls sugar, 3
tablespoonfuls water, 2 teaspoonfuls butter, 1 teaspoonful vanilla.
Boil all together until it becomes brittle when a small quantity is
dropped in water. Pour the mixture into buttered pans and when cool
enough to handle, pull with the hands until a light creamy yellow
shade. Pull into long, thin strips, cut into small pieces with
scissors. This taffy is fine if boiled a long enough time to become
crisp and brittle, and you will be surprised at the quantity this
small amount of sugar and molasses will make.</p>

<a name='RECIPE_FOR_MAKING_HARD_SOAP_WITHOUT_BOILING'></a><p><b>RECIPE FOR MAKING HARD SOAP WITHOUT BOILING</b></p>

<p>To make hard soap without boiling, empty a can of &quot;Lewis Perfumed Lye&quot;
(or any other good, reliable brand of lye) into a stone jar with 1
tablespoonful powdered borax. Add 2 pints of cold water to the
lye. Stir until dissolved. Be very careful not to allow any of the lye
to touch hands or face. Wear old gloves when emptying can and stirring
lye. Stand the dissolved lye in a cool place. The tin cans containing
the fat to be used for soap (which have accumulated, been tried out,
strained, and put in empty tin cans at different times) should be
placed in the oven of range for a few minutes. When warm they may be
turned out readily into a large stew-pan. Put over fire and when all
has dissolved and melted, strain through cheese-cloth bag into an
agate dish pan. When weighed you should 5 pounds of clear fat. A
recipe telling exact quantity of fat and lye usually comes with can of
lye. When temperature of fat is 120 degrees by your thermometer
(luke-warm), the lye should have been allowed to stand about 1 hour
from the time it was dissolved. It should then be the right
temperature to mix with strained, luke-warm fat or grease not over 80
degrees by ther<a name='Page_420'></a>mometer. Now slowly pour the dissolved lye over the
fat (a half cup of ammonia added improves soap), stir together until
lye and grease are thoroughly incorporated, and the mixture drops from
the stirrer like honey. The soap may be scented by adding a few drops
of oil of cloves, if liked. Stir the mixture with a small wooden
paddle or stick. Stir slowly from 5 to 10 minutes, not longer, or the
lye and fat may separate. Pour all into a large agate dish pan lined
with a piece of clean muslin. Throw an old piece of carpet over the
top and stand near the range until evening, when, if made early in the
morning, a solid cake of soap, weighing 8 pounds, may be turned
out on a bake-board (previously covered with brown paper) and cut into
20 pieces of good hard soap. Lay the pieces of soap in a basket, cover
to protect from dust, and stand in a warm room to dry thoroughly
before using. Soap made according to these directions should be solid
and almost as white as ivory if the fat used has not been scorched.</p>

<p>This soap is excellent for scrubbing and laundry purposes. The greater
length of time the soap is kept, the better it will become. The grease
used may be clarified by adding water and cooking a short time. Stand
away and when cool remove fat from top, wiping off any moisture that
may appear. Soap-making is a <i>small economy</i>. Of course, the young
housewife will not use for soap <i>any fat</i> which could be utilized for
frying, etc., but she will be surprised to find, when she once gets
the saving habit, how quickly she will have the quantity of fat needed
for a dollar's worth of soap by the small outlay of the price of a can
of lye, not counting her work. The young, inexperienced housewife
should be careful not to use too small a stew-pan in which to heat the
fat, and should not, under any circumstance, leave the kitchen while
the fat is on the range, as grave results might follow carelessness in
this respect.</p>

<a name='TO_IMITATE_CHESTNUT_WOOD'></a><p><b>TO IMITATE CHESTNUT WOOD</b></p>

<p>Before painting the floor it was scrubbed thoroughly with the
following: One-half cup of &quot;household ammonia&quot; added to four quarts of
water. The floor, after being well scrubbed with this, was wiped up
with pure, clean water and allowed to <a name='Page_421'></a>get perfectly dry before
painting. For the ground color, or first coat of paint on the floor,
after the cracks in floor had been filled with putty or filler, mix
together five pounds of white lead, one pint of turpentine and about a
fourth of a pound of yellow ochre, add 1 tablespoon of Japan dryer.
This should make one quart of paint a light tan or straw color, with
which paint the floor and allow it to dry twenty-four hours, when
another coat of the same paint was given the floor and allowed to dry
another twenty-four hours, then a graining color, light oak, was used.
This was composed of one pint of turpentine, one teaspoon of graining
color and two tablespoons of linseed oil, and 1 tablespoon of Japan
dryer, all mixed together. This was about the color of coffee or
chocolate. When the wood had been painted with this graining color,
before drying, a fine graining comb was passed lightly over to imitate
the grain of wood. This was allowed to dry twenty-four hours, when a
coat of floor varnish was given. The room was allowed to dry
thoroughly before using. The imitation of natural chestnut was
excellent.</p>

<p>When a teacher of &quot;Domestic Science,&quot; the Professor's wife was
accustomed to using a pyrometer, or oven thermometer, to determine the
proper temperature for baking. She explained its advantages over the
old-fashioned way of testing the oven to Mary and gave her a copy of
the &quot;Cooking Schedule,&quot; to put in her recipe book, which Mary found of
great assistance, and said <a name='Page_424'></a>she would certainly have a range with an
oven thermometer should she have a home of her own, and persuaded Aunt
Sarah to have one placed in the oven door of her range.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
