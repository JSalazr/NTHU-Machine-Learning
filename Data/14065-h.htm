<h2>TO THE CITIZENS<br>
OF<br>

<p>GENTLEMEN,</p>

<p><i>Experience has confirm'd you in that everlasting</i> Maxim, <i>that there is
no other way to protect the</i> Innocent, <i>but by Punishing the</i> Guilty.</p>

<p><i>Crimes ever were, and ever must be unavoidably frequent in such
populous Cities as yours are, being the necessary Consequences, either
of the</i> Wants, <i>or the Depravity, of the lowest part of the</i> humane
<i>Species</i>.</p>

<p><i>At this time the most flagrant Offences, as</i> Burning of Dwellings;
Burglaries, <i>and</i> Highway Robberies <i>abound; and</i> Frauds <i>common
</i> Felonies, <i>and</i> Forgeries <i>are practic'd without Number; thus not only
your Properties, but even your very Lives are every way struck at</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Legislative Power <i>has not been wanting in providing necessary
and wholesome Laws against these</i> Evils, <i>the executive part whereof
(according to your great Privileges) is lodged in your own Hands: And
the Administration hath at all times applyed proper Remedies and
Regulations to the</i> Defects <i>which have happen'd in the</i> Magistracy
<i>more immediately under their Jurisdiction</i>.</p>

<p><i>Through the just and salutary Severities of the Magistrates, publick
excessive</i> Gaming <i>has been in a manner Surpress'd; and some late
Examples of divine Vengeance have overtaken certain of the most
notorious lewd</i> Prostitutes <i>of the Town, which together with the laudable
endeavours of the great and worthy</i> Societies, <i>has given no small
check to that enormous and spreading</i> Vice.</p>

<p><i>But here's a</i> Criminal <i>bids Defiance to your</i> Laws, <i>and </i>Justice <i>who

<p><i>His History will astonish! and is not compos'd of Fiction, Fable, or

<h2>THE LIFE OF<br>
<i>JOHN SHEPPARD, &amp;c.</i></h2>

<p>This <i>John Sheppard</i>, a Youth both in Age and Person, tho' an
old Man in Sin; was Born in the Parish of <i>Stepney</i> near <i>London</i>,
in the Year 1702, a Son, Grandson, and great Grandson of a <i>Carpenter</i>:
His Father died when he was so very Young that he could
not recollect that ever he saw him. Thus the burthen of his
Maintenance, together with his Brother's and Sister's, lay upon
the Shoulders of the Widow Mother, who soon procured an
Admittance of her Son <i>John</i> into the <i>Work-House</i> in <i>Bishopsgate-street,</i>
where he continued for the space of a Year and half, and
in that time received an Education sufficient to qualifie him for
the Trade his Mother design'd him, <i>viz</i>. a <i>Carpenter</i>: Accordingly
she was recommended to Mr. <i>Wood</i> in <i>Witch-Street</i> near <i>Drury-Lane</i>,
as a Master capable of entertaining and instructing her Son:
They agreed and Bound he was for the space of seven Years; the
Lad proved an early proficient, had a ready and ingenious Hand,
and soon became Master of his Business, and gave entire Satisfaction
to his Master Customers, and had the Character of a very
sober and orderly Boy. But alas unhappy Youth! before he had
compleated six Years of his Apprenticeship, he commenced a
fatal Acquaintance with one <i>Elizabeth Lyon</i>, otherwise call'd
<i>Edgworth Bess</i>, from a Town of that Name in <i>Middlesex</i> where she
was Born, the reputed Wife of a Foot Soldier, and who lived a
wicked and debauch'd Life; and our young <i>Carpenter</i> became
Enamour'd of her, and they must Cohabit together as Man and
Wife.</p>

<p>Now was laid the Foundation of his Ruin; <i>Sheppard</i> grows
weary of the Yoke of Servitude, and began to dispute with his
Master; telling him that his way of Jobbing from House to House
was not sufficient to furnish him with a due Experience in his
Trade; and that if he would not set out to undertake some
Buildings, he would step into the World for better Information.
Mr. <i>Wood</i> a mild, sober, honest Man, indulg'd him; and Mrs.
<i>Wood</i> with Tears, exhorted him against the Company of this
lewd Prostitute: But her Man prompted and harden'd by his
HARLOT, D&mdash;- n'd <i>her Blood</i>, and threw a Stick at his Mistress,
and beat her to the Ground. And being with his Master at
Work at Mr. <i>Britt's</i> the <i>Sun</i> Ale-house near <i>Islington</i>, upon a very
trivial Occasion fell upon his Master, and beat and bruised him
in a most barbarous and shameful Manner. Such a sudden and
deplorable Change was there in the Behaviour of this promising
young Man. Next ensued a neglect of Duty, both to God and his
Master, lying out of Nights, perpetual Jarrings, and Animosities;
these and such like, were the Consequences of his intimacy with
this she <i>Lyon</i>; who by the sequel will appear to have been a main
loadstone in attracting of him up to this Eminence of Guilt.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wood</i> having Reason to suspect, that <i>Sheppard</i> had robb'd
a Neighbour, began to be in great Fear and Terror for himself.
And when his Man came not Home in due season at Nights bar'd
him out; but he made a mere jest of the Locks and Bolts, and
enter'd in, and out at Pleasure; and when Mr. <i>Wood</i> and his Wife
have had all the Reason in the World to believe him Lock't out,
they have found him very quiet in his Bed the next Morning,
such was the power of his early Magick.</p>

<p><i>Edgworth Bess</i> having stol'n a Gold Ring from a Gentleman,
whom she had pick'd up in the Streets, was sent to St. <i>Giles's</i>
Round-house; <i>Sheppard</i> went immediately to his Consort, and
after a short Discourse with Mr. <i>Brown</i> the Beadle, and his Wife,
who had the Care of the Place, he fell upon the poor old Couple,
took the Keys from them, and let his Lady out at the Door in
spight of all the Out-cryes, and Opposition they were capable
of making.</p>

<p>About <i>July</i> 1723, He was by his Master sent to perform a
Repair, at the House of Mr. <i>Bains</i>, a Piece-Broker in <i>White-Horse
Yard</i>; he from thence stole a Roll of Fustain, containing 24 Yards,
which was afterwards found in his Trunk. This is supposed to be
the first Robbery he ever committed and it was not long e're he
Repeated another upon this same Mr. <i>Bains</i>, by breaking into his
House in the Night-time, and taking out of the <i>Till</i> seven Pounds
in Money, and Goods to the value of fourteen Pounds more.
How he enter'd this House, was a Secret till his being last committed
to <i>Newgate</i>, when he confessed that he took up the Iron
Bars at the Cellar Window, and after he had done his Business,
he nailed them down again, so that Mr. <i>Bains</i> never believed his
House had been broke; and an innocent Woman a Lodger in the
House lay all the while under the weight of a suspicion of committing
the Robbery.</p>

<p><i>Sheppard</i> and his Master had now parted, ten Months before
the expiration of his Apprenticeship, a woeful parting to the
former; he was gone from a good and careful Patronage, and lay
expos'd to, and comply'd with the Temptations of the most
wicked Wretches this Town could afford as <i>Joseph Blake</i>, alias
<i>Blewskins, William Field, Doleing, James Sykes</i>, alias <i>Hell</i> and <i>Fury</i>,
which last was the first that betray'd, and put him into the Hands
of Justice, as will presently appear.</p>

<p>Having deserted his Master's Service, he took Shelter in the
House of Mr. <i>Charles</i> in <i>May-Fair</i>, near <i>Piccadilly</i>, and his Landlord
having a Necessity for some Repairs in his House, engag'd
one Mr. <i>Panton</i> a <i>Carpenter</i> to Undertake them, and <i>Sheppard</i> to
assist him as a Journeyman; but on the 23rd of <i>October</i>, 1723, e're
the Work was compleat, <i>Sheppard</i> took Occasion to rob the
People of the Effects following, <i>viz.</i> seven Pound ten Shillings in
Specie, five large silver Spoons, six plain Forks ditto, four Tea-Spoons,
six plain Gold Rings, and a Cypher Ring; four Suits of
Wearing Apparel, besides Linnen, to a considerable value. This
Fact he confess'd to the Reverend Mr. <i>Wagstaff</i> before his Escape
from the Condemn'd Hold of <i>Newgate</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sheppard</i> had a Brother, nam'd <i>Thomas</i>, a <i>Carpenter</i> by Profession,
tho' a notorious Thief and House-breaker by Practice.
This <i>Thomas</i> being committed to <i>Newgate</i> for breaking the House
of Mrs. <i>Mary Cook</i> a <i>Linnen-Draper</i>, in <i>Clare-street, Clare-Market</i>,
on the 5th of <i>February</i> last, and stealing Goods to the value of
between 50, and 60 l. he impeach'd his Brother <i>John Sheppard</i>,
and <i>Edgworth Bess</i> as being concerned with him in the Fact; and
these three were also Charg'd with being concern'd together, in
breaking the House of Mr. <i>William Phillips</i> in <i>Drury-Lane</i>, and
stealing divers Goods, the Property of Mrs. <i>Kendrick</i> a Lodger in
the House, on the 14th of the said <i>February</i>: All possible endeavours
were us'd by Mrs. <i>Cook</i> and Mr. <i>Phillips</i>, to get <i>John
Sheppard</i> and <i>Edgworth Bess</i> Apprehended, but to no purpose, till
the following Accident.</p>

<p><i>Sheppard</i> was now upon his wicked Range in <i>London</i>, committing
Robberies every where at Discretion; but one Day meeting
with his Acquaintance, <i>James Sykes</i>, alias <i>Hell</i> and <i>Fury</i>, sometimes
a Chair-man, and at others a Running Foot-man. This <i>Sykes</i>
invited him to go to one <i>Redgate's</i>, a Victualling-house near the
<i>Seven Dials</i>, to play at <i>Skettles</i>, <i>Sheppard</i> comply'd, and <i>Sykes</i>
secretly sent for Mr. <i>Price</i> a Constable in St. <i>Giles's Parish</i>, and
Charg'd him with his Friend <i>Sheppard</i> for the Robbing of Mrs.
<i>Cook</i>, &amp;c. <i>Sheppard</i> was carried before Justice <i>Parry</i>, who order'd
him to St. <i>Giles's</i> Round-house till the next Morning for farther
Examination: He was Confin'd in the Upper part of the Place,
being two Stories from the Ground, but 'ere two Hours came
about, by only the help of a Razor, and the Stretcher of a Chair,
he broke open the Top of the Round house, and tying together a
Sheet and Blanket, by them descended into the Church-yard and
Escap'd, leaving the Parish to Repair the Damage, and Repent of
the Affront put upon his Skill and Capacity.</p>

<p>On the 19th of <i>May</i> last in the Evening, <i>Sheppard</i> with another
Robber named <i>Benson</i>, were passing thro' <i>Leicester-fields</i>, where a
Gentleman stood accusing a Woman with an attempt to steal his
Watch, a Mobb was gathered about the Disputants, and <i>Sheppard's</i>
Companion being a <i>Master</i>, got in amongst them and pick'd
the Gentleman's Pocket in good earnest of the Watch; the Scene
was surprizingly chang'd, from an imaginary Robbery to a real
one; and in a moment ensued an Out-cry of <i>stop Thief</i>, <i>Sheppard</i>
and <i>Benson</i> took to their Heels, and <i>Sheppard</i> was seiz'd by a
Serjeant of the Guard at <i>Leicester</i> House, crying out <i>stop Thief</i>
with much earnestness. He was convey'd to St. <i>Ann's Round
House</i> in <i>Soho</i>, and kept secure till the next Morning, when
<i>Edgworth Bess</i> came to visit him, who was seiz'd also; they were
carried before Justice <i>Walters</i>, when the People in <i>Drury-Lane</i>
and <i>Clare-Market</i> appeared, and charged them with the Robberies
aforemention'd: But <i>Sheppard</i> pretending to Impeach
certain of his Accomplices, the Justice committed them to <i>New-Prison</i>,
with intent to have them soon removed to <i>Newgate</i>,
unless there came from them some useful Discoveries. <i>Sheppard</i>
was now a second time in the hands of Justice, but how long
he intended to keep in them, the Reader will soon be able to Judge.</p>

<p>He and his MATE were now in a strong and well guarded
Prison, himself loaded with a pair of double <i>Links</i> and <i>Basils</i>[17] of
about fourteen pounds weight, and confined together in the
safest Appartment call'd <i>Newgate Ward</i>; <i>Sheppard</i> conscious of his
Crimes, and knowing the <i>Information</i> he had made to be but a
blind Amusement that would avail him nothing; he began to
Meditate an Escape. They had been thus detained for about four
Days, and their Friends having the Liberty of seeing them, furnish'd
him with Implements proper for his Design, accordingly
Mr. <i>Sheppard</i> goes to work, and on the 25th of May being <i>Whit-son
Monday</i> at about two of the Clock in the Morning, he had
compleated a practicable breach, and sawed of his Fetters; having
with unheard of Diligence and Dexterity, cut off an Iron Bar
from the Window, and taken out a Muntin, or Bar of the most
solid Oak of about nine Inches in thickness, by boring it thro' in
many Places, a work of great Skill and Labour; they had still five
and twenty Foot to descend from the Ground; <i>Sheppard</i> fasten'd a
Sheet and Blanket to the Bars, and causes Madam to take off her
Gown and Petticoat, and sent her out first, and she being more
Corpulent than himself, it was with great Pain and Difficulty that
he got her through the Interval, and observing his Directions, was
instantly down, and more frighted than hurt; the <i>Phylosopher</i>
follow'd, and lighted with Ease and Pleasure; But where are they
Escap'd to? Why out of one Prison into another. The Reader is
to understand, that the <i>New Prison</i> and <i>Clerkenwell Bridewell</i> lye
Contiguous to one another, and they are got into the Yard of the
latter, and have a Wall of twenty-two Foot high to Scale, before
their Liberty is perfected; <i>Sheppard</i> far from being unprepared to
surmount this Difficulty, has his Gimblets and Peircers ready, and
makes a Scaleing-Ladder. The Keepers and Prisoners of both
Places are a sleep in their Beds; he Mounts his <i>Bagage</i>, and in less
than ten Minutes carries both her and himself over this wall, and
compleats an entire Escape. Altho' his Escape from the Condemn'd
Hold of <i>Newgate</i>, has made a far greater Noise in the
World, than that from this Prison hath. It has been allow'd by all
the Jayl-Keepers in <i>London</i>, that one so Miraculous was never perform'd
before in <i>England</i>; the broken Chains and Bars are kept at
<i>New Prison</i> to Testifie, and preserve the Memory of this extraordinary
Villain.</p>

<p><i>Sheppard</i> not warn'd by this Admonition, returns like a <i>Dog to
his Vomit</i>, and comes Secretly into his Master <i>Wood's</i> Neighbourhood
in <i>Witch-street</i>, and conceits Measures with one <i>Anthony
Lamb</i>, an Apprentice to Mr. <i>Carter</i> a Mathematical Instrument-maker,
for Robbing of Mr. <i>Barton</i> a Master Taylor; a Man of
Worth and Reputation, who Lodg'd in Mr. <i>Carter's</i> House.
<i>Charles Grace</i>, a graceless Cooper was let into the Secret, and consented,
and resolved to Act his Part. The 16th of <i>June</i> last was
appointed, <i>Lamb</i> accordingly lets <i>Grace</i> and <i>Sheppard</i> into the
House at Mid-Night; and they all go up to Mr. <i>Bartons</i> Appartment
well arm'd with Pistols, and enter'd his Rooms, without
being disturb'd. <i>Grace</i> was Posted at Mr. <i>Barton's</i> Bedside with a
loaded Pistol, and positive Orders to shoot him through the Head,
if in case he awak'd. <i>Sheppard</i> being engag'd in opening the Trunks
and Boxes, the mean while. It luckily happen'd for Mr. <i>Barton</i>,
that he slept Sounder than usual that Night, as having come from
a Merry-making with some Friends; tho' poor Man little Dreaming
in what dreadful Circumstances. They carried off in Notes,
and Bonds, Guineas, Cloaths, Made and Unmade, to the value of
between two and three Hundred Pounds; besides a Padesuoy Suit
of Cloaths, worth about eighteen or twenty Pounds more; which
having been made for a Corpulent Gentleman, <i>Sheppard</i> had
them reduc'd, and fitted for his own Size and War, as designing to
Appear and make a Figure among the <i>Beau Monde</i>. <i>Grace</i> and
<i>Sheppard</i>, having disposed of the Goods at an Ale-house in <i>Lewkenors
Lane</i> (a Rendezvous of Robbers and Ruffians) took their
Flight, and <i>Grace</i> had not been since heard of. <i>Lamb</i> was apprehended,
and carried before Justice <i>Newton</i>, and made an ample
Confession; and there being nothing but that against him at his
Tryal, and withal, a favourable Prosecution, he came off with a
Sentence of Transportation only. He as well as <i>Sheppard</i> has since
confirm'd all the above particulars, and with this Addition, <i>viz</i>.
That it was Debated among them to have Murder'd all the People
in the House, save one Person.</p>

<p>About the latter End of the same Month, <i>June</i>, Mr. <i>Kneebone</i>, a
Woollen-Draper near the New Church in the <i>Strand</i>, receiv'd a
Caution from the Father of <i>Anthony Lamb</i>, who intimated to
Mr. <i>Kneebone</i> that his House was intended to be broke open
and robb'd that very Night. Mr. <i>Kneebone</i> prepar'd for the Event,
ordering his Servants to sit up, and gave Directions to the
Watchman in the Street to observe his House: At about two in
the Morning <i>Sheppard</i> and his Gang were about the Door, a
Maid-Servant went to listen, and heard one of the Wretches,
say, <i>Da&mdash;n him, if they could not enter that Night, they would
another, and would have 300l. of his</i>, (meaning) Mr. <i>Kneebone's</i>
Money. They went off, and nothing more was heard of them till
<i>Sunday</i> the 12th Day of <i>July</i> following, when <i>Joseph Blake</i>, alias
<i>Blewskins, John Sheppard</i>, and <i>William Field</i> (as himself Swears)
came about 12 o'clock at Night, and cut two large Oaken-Bars
over the Cellar-Window, at the back part of the House in
<i>Little-Drury-Lane</i>, and so entered; Mr. <i>Kneebone</i>, and his Family
being at Rest, they proceeded to open a Door at the Foot of the
Cellar-Stairs, with three Bolts, and a large Padlock upon it, and
then came up into the Shop and wrench'd off the Hasp, and
Padlock that went over the Press, and arriv'd at their desir'd
Booty; they continu'd in the House for three Hours, and carry'd
off with them One Hundred and eight Yards of Broad Woollen
Cloth, five Yards of blue Bays, a light Tye-Wig, and Beaver-Hat,
two Silver Spoons, an Handkerchief, and a Penknife. In all
to the value of near fifty Pounds.</p>

<p>The <i>Sunday</i> following, being the 19th of <i>July, Sheppard</i> and
<i>Blewskins</i> were out upon the <i>Hampstead</i> Road, and there stopt a
Coach with a Ladies Woman in it, from whom they took but
Half-a-Crown; all the Money then about her; the Foot-man
behind the Coach came down, and exerted himself; but <i>Sheppard</i>
sent him in hast up to his Post again, by threat of his Pistol.</p>

<p>The next Night being the 20th of <i>july</i>, about Nine, they Robb'd
Mr. <i>Pargiter</i>, a Chandler of <i>Hamstead</i>, near the Halfway-House;
<i>Sheppard</i> after his being taken at <i>Finchley</i> was particularly examin'd
about this Robbery. The Reverend Mr. <i>Wagstaff</i> having receiv'd a
Letter from an unknown Hand, with two Questions, to be
propos'd to <i>Sheppard</i>, <i>viz.</i> Whether he did Rob <i>John Pargiter</i>, on
<i>Monday</i> the 20th of <i>July</i>, about Nine at Night, between the <i>Turnpike</i>
and <i>Hamstead</i>; How much Money he took from him?
Whither <i>Pargiter</i> was Drunk, or not, and if he had Rings or Watch
about him, when robb'd? which, Request was comply'd with, and
<i>Sheppard</i> affirm'd, that Mr. <i>Pargiter</i> was very much in Liquor,
having a great Coat on; neither Rings on his Fingers or Watch,
and only three Shillings in his Pocket, which they took from
him, and that <i>Blewskins</i> knock him down twice with the Butt-end
of his Pistol to make sure Work, (tho' Excess of drink had done
that before) but <i>Sheppard</i> did in kindness raise him up as often.</p>

<p>The next Night, <i>July</i> 21, they stopt a Stage-Coach, and took
from a Passenger in it, Twenty-two Shillings, and were so expeditious
in the Matter, that <i>not two Words were made about the
Bargain</i>.</p>

<p>Now Mr. <i>Sheppard's</i> long and wicked Course seemingly draws
towards a Period. Mr. <i>Kneebone</i> having apply'd to <i>Jonathan Wild</i>,
and set forth Advertisements in the Papers, complaining of his
Robbery. On <i>Tuesday</i> the 22d of <i>July</i> at Night <i>Edgworth Bess</i> was
taken in a Brandy-shop, near <i>Temple-Bar</i> by <i>Jonathan Wild</i>; she
being much terrify'd, discover'd where <i>Sheppard</i> was: A Warrant
was accordingly issued by Justice <i>Blackerby</i>, and the next Day he
was Apprehended, at the House of <i>Blewskin's</i> Mother, in <i>Rose-Mary-Lane</i>,
by one <i>Quilt</i>, a Domestick of Mr. <i>Wild's</i> though not
without great opposition, for, he clapt a loaded, Pistol to <i>Quilt's</i>
Breast, and attempted to shoot him, but the Pistol miss'd fire; he
was brought back to <i>New Prison</i>, confin'd in the Dungeon; and
the next Day carried before Justice <i>Blackerby</i>. Upon his Examination
he Confess'd the three Robberies on the Highway aforemention'd,
as also the Robbing of Mr. <i>Bains</i>, Mr. <i>Barton</i>, and Mr.
<i>Kneebone</i>, he was committed to Newgate, and at the Sessions of
<i>Oyer</i> and <i>Terminer</i>, and Goal delivery, holden at the <i>Old-Baily</i>,
on the 12th, 13th and 14th of <i>August</i>, he was try'd upon three
several indictments, <i>viz.</i> First for breaking the House of <i>William
Philips</i>.</p>

<p><i>John Sheppard</i>, of the Parish of St. <i>Martin</i> in <i>the Fields</i>, was
indicted for breaking the House of <i>William Philips</i>, and stealing
divers Goods, the 14th of <i>February</i> last. But there not being sufficient
Evidence against the Prisoner, he was acquitted.</p>

<p>He was also indicted a Second Time, of St. <i>Clement Danes</i>, for
breaking the House of <i>Mary Cook</i>, the 5th of <i>February</i> last, and
stealing divers Goods: But the Evidence against the Prisoner
being defficient as to this Indictment also, he was acquitted.</p>

<p>He was also indicted the Third Time, of St. <i>Mary Savoy</i>, for
breaking the House of <i>William Kneebone</i>, in the Night-Time, and
stealing, 108 Yards of Woollen Cloth, the 12th of <i>July</i> last. The
Prosecutor depos'd, That the Prisoner had some Time since been
his Servant, and when he went to Bed, the Time mentioned in the
Indictment, about 11 a-Clock at Night, he saw all the Doors
and Windows fast; but was call'd up about four in the Morning,
and found his House broke open, the Bars of a Cellar-Window
having been cut, and the Bolts of the Door that comes up Stairs
drawn, and the Padlock wrench'd off, and the Shutter in the
Shop broken, and his Goods gone; whereupon suspecting the
Prisoner, he having committed ill Actions thereabouts before, he
acquainted <i>Jonathan Wild</i> with it, and he procur'd him to be
apprehended. That he went to the Prisoners in New <i>Prison</i>, and
asking how he could be so ungrateful to rob him, after he had
shown him so much Kindness? The Prisoner own'd he had been
ungrateful in doing so, informing him of several Circumstances
as to the Manner of committing the Fact, but said he had been
drawn into it by ill Company. <i>Jonathan Wild</i>, depos'd, The Prosecutor
came to him, and desir'd him to enquire after his Goods
that had been stolen, telling him he suspected the Prisoner to have
been concern'd in the Robbery, he having before committed
some Robberies in the Neighbourhood. That inquiring after him,
and having heard of him before, he was inform'd that he was an
Acquaintance of <i>Joseph Blake</i>, alias <i>Blewskins</i>, and <i>William Field</i>:
Whereupon he sent for <i>William Field</i>, who came to him; upon
which he told him, if he would make an ingenuous Confession,
he believ'd he could prevail with the Court to make him an
Evidence. That he did make a Discovery of the Prisoner, upon
which he was apprehended, and also of others since convicted,
and gave an Account of some Parcels of the Cloth, which were
found accordingly. <i>William Field</i> depos'd, That the Prisoner told
him, and <i>Joseph Blake</i>, that he knew a <i>Ken</i> where they might get
something of Worth. That they went to take a View of the Prosecutor's
House, but disprov'd of the Attempt, as not thinking
it easy to be perform'd; But the Prisoner perswaded them that
it might easily be done, he knowing the House, he having liv'd
with the Prosecutor. That thereupon he cut the Cellar Bar, went
into the Cellar, got into the Shop, and brought out three Parcels
of Cloth, which they carried away. The Prisoner had also confest
the Fact when he was apprehended, and before the Justice. The
Fact being plainly prov'd, the Jury found him guilty of the
Indictment.</p>

<p>Sentence of Death was pronounc'd upon him accordingly.
Several other Prosecutions might have been brought against
him, but this was thought sufficient to rid the World of so Capital
an Offender: He beg'd earnestly for Transportation, to the most
extream Foot of his Majesty's Dominions; and pleaded Youth,
and Ignorance as the Motive which had precipitated him into
the Guilt; but the Court deaf to his Importunities, as knowing
him, and his repeated Crimes to be equally flagrant, gave him no
satisfactory Answer: He return'd to his dismal Abode the Condemn'd
Hold, where were Nine more unhappy Wretches in as
dreadful Circumstances as himself. The Court being at <i>Windsor</i>,
the Malefactors had a longer Respite than is usual; during that
Recess, <i>James Harman</i>, <i>Lumley</i>, <i>Davis</i> and <i>Sheppard</i> agreed upon
an Escape, concerted Measures, and provided Instruments to
make it effectual; but put off the Execution of their Design, on
Account the two Gentlemen having their hopes of Life daily
renewed by the favourable Answers they receiv'd from some
considerable Persons; but those vanishing the day before their
Execution, and finding their Sentence irreversible, they two dropt
their hopes, together with the Design, they form'd for an Escape,
and so in earnest prepar'd to meet Death on the Morrow, (which
they accordingly did.). 'Twas on this Day Mr <i>Davis</i> gave <i>Sheppard</i>
the Watch Springs, Files, Saws, <i>&amp;c.</i> to Effect his own Release;
and knowing that a Warrant was Hourly expected for his
Execution with Two others, on the <i>Friday</i> following; he thought
it high time to look about him, for he had waited his Tryal, saw
his Conviction, and heard his Sentence with some patience; but
finding himself irrespitably decreed for Death, he could sit passive
no longer, and on the very Day of the Execution of the former;
whilst they were having their Fetters taken off, in order for going
to the Tree, that Day he began to saw, <i>Saturday</i> made a progress;
but <i>Sunday</i> omitted, by Reason of the Concourse in the <i>Lodge</i>:
<i>Edgworth Bess</i> having been set at Liberty, had frequent Access to
him, with others of his Acquaintance. On <i>Monday</i> the Death
<i>Warrant</i> came from <i>Windsor</i>, appointing that he, together with
<i>Joseph Ward</i> and <i>Anthony Upton</i> should be Executed on the <i>Friday</i>
following, being the 4th of <i>September</i>. The Keepers acquainted
him therewith, and desired him to make good use of that short
Time. He thank'd them, said <i>he would follow their Advice</i>, and
<i>prepare</i>. <i>Edgworth Bess</i>, and another Woman had been with him
at the Door of the Condemn'd Hold best part of the Afternoon,
between five and six he desir'd the other Prisoners, except
<i>Stephen Fowles</i> to remain above, while he offer'd something in
private to his Friends at the Door; they comply'd, and in this
interval he got the Spike asunder, which made way for the Skeleton
to pass with his Heels foremost, by the Assistance of <i>Fowles</i>, whom he most ungenerously betray'd to the Keepers after his
being retaken, and the Fellow was as severely punish'd for it.</p>

<p>Having now got clear of his Prison, he took Coach disguis'd
in a Night Gown at the corner of the <i>Old Baily</i>, along with a
Man who waited for him in the Street (and is suppos'd to be
<i>Page</i> the Butcher) ordering the Coachman to drive to
<i>Black-Fryers Stairs</i>, where his prostitute gave him the Meeting, and
they three took Boat, and went a Shoar at the <i>Horse-Ferry</i> at
<i>Westminster</i>, and at the <i>White-Hart</i> they went in, Drank, and
stay'd sometime; thence they adjourn'd to a Place in <i>Holbourn</i>, where by the help of a Saw he quitted the Chains he had brought
with him from <i>Newgate</i>; and then like a Freeman took his Ramble
through the City and came to <i>Spittle-Fields</i>, and there lay with
<i>Edgeworth Bess</i>.</p>

<p>It may be easy to imagine what an alarm his Escape gave to the
Keepers of <i>Newgate</i>, three of their People being at the farther
End of the <i>Lodge</i>, engag'd in a Discourse concerning his wonderful
Escape from <i>New-Prison,</i> and what Caution ought to be us'd,
lest he should give them the slip, at that very Instant as he perfected
it.</p>

<p>On <i>Tuesday</i> he sent for <i>William Page</i> an Apprentice to a
Butcher in <i>Clare-Market</i>, who came to him, and being Pennyless,
he desir'd <i>Page</i> to give him what Assistance he could to make his
way, and being a Neighbour and Acquaintance, he comply'd
with it; but e're he would do any thing, he consulted a near
Relation, who as he said, encourag'd him in it; nay, put him
upon it, so meeting with this Success in his Application to his
Friend, and probable an Assistance in the Pocket, he came to
<i>Sheppard</i> having bought him a new blue <i>Butcher's</i> Frock, and
another for himself, and so both took their Rout to <i>Warnden</i> in
<i>Northamptonshire</i>, where they came to a Relation of <i>Page's</i>, who
receiv'd and Entertain'd them kindly, the People lying from their
own Bed to Accommodate them. <i>Sheppard</i> pretending to be a
<i>Butcher's</i> Son in <i>Clare-Market</i>, who was going farther in the
Country to his Friends, and that <i>Page</i> was so kind as to Accompany
him; but they as well as their Friend became tir'd of one
another; the <i>Butchers</i> having but one Shilling left, and the People
poor, and Consequently unable to Subsist two such Fellows,
after a stay of three or four Days, they return'd, and came for
<i>London</i>, and reach'd the City on <i>Tuesday</i> the 8th of <i>September</i>,
calling by the way at <i>Black-Mary's-Hole</i>, and Drinking with
several of their Acquaintance, and then came into <i>Bishopsgate
street</i>, to one <i>Cooley's</i> a <i>Brandy-shop</i>; where a <i>Cobler</i> being at Work
in his Stall, stept out and Swore <i>ther was</i> Sheppard, <i>Sheppard</i> hearing
him, departed immediately. In the Evening they came into
<i>Fleet-street</i>, at about Eight of the Clock, and observing Mr.
<i>Martins</i> a Watchmaker's Shop to be open, and a little Boy only to
look after it: <i>Page</i> goes in and asks the Lad whether Mr. <i>Taylor</i> a
<i>Watchmaker</i> lodg'd in the House? being answer'd in the Negative,
he came away, and Reports the Disposition of the Place: <i>Sheppard</i>
now makes Tryal of his old Master-peice; fixeth a Nail
Peircer into the Door post, fastens the Knocker thereto with
Packthread, breaks the Glass, and takes out three <i>Silver Watches</i>
of 15 l. value, the Boy seeing him take them, but could not get
out to pursue him, by reason of his Contrivance. One of the
Watches he Pledg'd for a Guinea and Half. The same Night they
came into <i>Watch-street</i>, <i>Sheppard</i> going into his <i>Master's</i> Yard, and
calling for his Fellow 'Prentice, his Mistress heard, knew his
Voice, and was dreadfully frightened; he next went to the <i>Cock</i> and <i>Pye Ale-House</i> in <i>Drury-Lane</i>, sent for a Barber his Acquaintance,
drank Brandy and eat Oysters in the view of several people.
<i>Page</i> waiting all the while at the Door, the whole Neighbourhood
being alarm'd, yet none durst attempt him, for fear of Pistols, <i>&amp;c.</i>
He had vow'd Revenge upon a poor Man as kept a Dairy-Cellar,
at the End of <i>White-Horse-Yard</i>, who having seen him at <i>Islington</i>
after his Escape, and engag'd not to speak of it, broke his Promise;
wherefore <i>Sheppard</i> went to his Residence took the Door off the
Hinges and threw it down amongst all the Man's Pans, Pipkins,
and caus'd a Deluge of Cream and Milk all over the Cellar.</p>

<p>This Night he had a narrow Escape, one Mr. <i>Ireton</i> a Sheriffs
Officer seeing him and <i>Page</i> pass thro' <i>Drury-Lane</i>, at about Ten
o'clock pursu'd 'em, and laid hold of <i>Page</i> instead of <i>Sheppard</i>,
who got off, thus <i>Ireton</i>, missing the main Man, and thinking
<i>Page</i> of no Consequence, let him go after him.</p>

<p><i>Edgworth Bess</i> had been apprehended by <i>Jonathan Wild</i>, and by
Sir <i>Francis Forbes</i> one of the Aldermen of <i>London</i>, committed to
the <i>Poultry-Compter</i>, for being aiding and assisting to <i>Sheppard</i>
in his Escape; the Keepers and others terrify'd and purg'd her as
much as was possible to discover where he was, but had it been in
her Inclination, it was not in her Power so to do, as it manifestly
appear'd soon after.</p>

<p>The People about the <i>Strand</i>, <i>Witch-street</i> and <i>Drury-Lane</i>,
whom he had Robb'd, and who had prosecuted him were under
great Apprensions and Terror, and in particular Mr. <i>Kneebone</i>,
on whom he vow'd a bloody Revenge; because he refus'd to
sign a Petition in his behalf to the <i>Recorder</i> of <i>London</i>. This Gentleman
was forc'd to keep arm'd People up in his House every Night
till he was Re-taken, and had the same fortify'd in the strongest
manner. Several other Shop-keepers in this Neighbourhood were
also put to great Expence and Trouble to Guard themselves
against this dreadful Villian.</p>

<p>The Keepers of <i>Newgate</i>, whom the rash World loaded with
Infamy, stigmatiz'd and branded with the Title of Persons guilty
of Bribery; for Connivance at his Escape, they and what Posse
in their Power, either for Love or Money did Contribute their
utmost to undeceive a wrong notion'd People. Their Vigilance
was remarkably indefatigable, sparing neither Money nor Time,
Night nor Day to bring him back to his deserv'd Justice. After
many Intelligences, which they endeavour'd for, and receiv'd,
they had one which prov'd very Successful. Having learnt for a
certainty that their Haunts was about <i>Finchly Common</i>, and being
very well assur'd of the very House where they lay; on <i>Thursday</i>
the 10th of <i>September</i>, a posse of Men, both of Spirit and Conduct,
furnish'd with Arms proper for their Design, went for <i>Finchley</i>,
some in a Coach and Four, and others on Horseback. They dispers'd
themselves upon the <i>Common</i> aforesaid, in order to make
their View, where they had not been long e're they came in Sight
of <i>SHEPPARD</i> in Company of <i>WILLIAM PAGE</i>, habited
like two <i>Butchers</i> in new blue Frocks, with white Aprons tuck'd
round their Wastes.</p>

<p>Upon <i>Sheppard's</i> seeing <i>Langley</i> a Turnkey at <i>Newgate</i>, he says
to his Companion <i>Page</i>, <i>I see a Stag</i>; upon which their Courage
dropt; knowing that now their dealing way of Business was
almost at an End; however to make their Flight as secure as they
could, they thought it adviseable to take to a Foot-path, to cut off
the pursuit of the <i>Newgate Cavalry</i>; but this did not prove most
successful, <i>Langley</i> came up with <i>Page</i> (who was hindermost) and
Dismounting with Pistol in Hand, commands <i>Page</i> to throw up
his Hands, which he trembling did, begging for Life, desiring
him to <i>Fisk</i> him, <i>viz.</i> (search him,) which he accordingly did, and
found a broad Knife and File; having thus disarm'd him, he takes
the <i>Chubb</i> along with him in quest of the slippery <i>Ele</i>, <i>Sheppard</i>;
who had taken Shelter in an old Stable, belonging to a Farm-House;
the pursuit was close, the House invested, and a Girl
seeing his Feet as he stood up hid, discover'd him. <i>Austin</i> a Turnkey
first attach'd his Person. <i>Langley</i> seconded him, <i>Ireton</i> an
Officer help'd to Enclose, and happy was the hindermost who
aided in this great Enterprise. He being shock'd with the utmost
Fear, told them he submitted, and desir'd they would let him live
as long as he could, which they did, and us'd him mildly; upon
searching him they found a broad Knife with two of the Watches
as he had taken out of Mr. <i>Martin's</i> Shop, one under each Armpit;
and now having gain'd their Point, and made themselves Masters
of what they had often endeavoured for, they came with their
<i>Lost Sheep</i> to a little House on the <i>Common</i> that sold Liquors, with
this Inscription on the Sign, <i>I have brought my</i> Hogs <i>to a fair
Market</i>; which our two unfortunate <i>Butchers</i> under their then unhappy
Circumstances, had too sad Reason to apply to themselves.
<i>Sheppard</i> had by this time recover'd his Surprize, grew calm and
easy, and desir'd them to give him Brandy, they did, and were all
good Friends, and Company together.</p>

<p>They adjourn'd with their Booty to another Place, where was
waiting a Coach and Four to Convey it to Town, with more
Speed and Safety; and Mr. <i>Sheppard</i> arriv'd at his old Mansion, at
about two in the Afternoon. At his a-lighting, he made a sudden
Spring; He declar'd his Intention was to have slipt under the
Coach, and had a Race for it; he was put into the Condemn'd-Hold,
and Chain'd down to the Floor with double <i>Basils</i> about
his Feet, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Page</i> was carried before Sir <i>Francis Forbes</i> and committed
to the same Prison for Accompanying and aiding <i>Sheppard</i>
in his Escape. The prudence of Mr. <i>Pitt</i> caus'd a Separation
between him and his Brother the first Night, as a Means to prevent
any ensuing Danger, by having two Heads, which (according
to our Proverbial Saying) <i>are better than one</i>.</p>

<p>The Joy the People of <i>Newgate</i> conceiv'd on this Occasion is
inexpressible, <i>Te Deum</i> was Sung in the <i>Lodge</i>, and nothing but
Smiles, and Bumpers, were seen there for many Days together.
But <i>Jonathan Wild</i> unfortunately happen'd to be gone upon a
wrong Scent after him to <i>Sturbridge</i>, and Lost a Share of the Glory.</p>

<p>His Escape and his being so suddenly Re-taken made such a
Noise in the Town, that it was thought all the common People
would have gone Mad about him; there being not a <i>Porter</i> to be
had for Love nor Money, nor getting into an Ale-house, for
<i>Butchers</i>; <i>Shoemakers</i> and <i>Barbers</i>, all engag'd in Controversies,
and Wagers, about <i>Sheppard</i>. <i>Newgate</i> Night and Day surrounded
with the Curious from St. <i>Giles's</i> and <i>Rag-Fair</i>, and <i>Tyburn Road</i>
daily lin'd with Women and Children; and the <i>Gallows</i> as carefully
watch'd by Night, lest he should be hang'd <i>Incog.</i> For a
Report of that nature, obtain'd much upon the Rabble; In short,
it was a Week of the greatest Noise and Idleness among Mechanicks
that has been known in <i>London</i>, and <i>Parker</i> and <i>Pettis</i>, two
<i>Lyricks</i>, subsisted many Days very comfortably upon <i>Ballads</i> and
<i>Letters</i> about <i>Sheppard</i>. The vulgar continu'd under great Doubts
and Difficulties, in what would be his Case, and whether the <i>Old
Warrant</i>, or a <i>New One</i> must be made for his Execution, or a New
Tryal, <i>&amp;c.</i> were the great Questions as arose, and occasion'd
various Reasonings and Speculation, till a News Paper, call'd the
<i>Daily Journal</i> set them all to Rights by the Publication of the
Account following, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class='blkquot'><p>'<i>J. Sheppard</i> having been Convicted of Burglary, and Felony, and
received Sentence of Death, and afterwards 'Escap'd from <i>Newgate</i>;
and being since Re-taken'; we are assur'd that it must be prov'd in a
<i>Regular</i>, and <i>Judicial</i> way, that he is the same Person, who was so Convicted
and made his Escape, before a Warrant can be obtain'd for his
Execution; and that this Affair well be brought before the Court at the
<i>Old Baily</i> the next Sessions.'</p></div>

<p>This was enough; People began to grow calm and easy and got
<i>Shav'd</i>, and their Shoes <i>finish'd</i>, and Business returned into its
former Channel, the Town resolving to wait the <i>Sessions</i> with
Patience.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. <i>Wagstaff</i>, who officiated in the absence of
the <i>Ordinary</i>, renew'd his former Acquaintance with Mr. <i>Sheppard</i>,
and examin'd him in a particular manner concerning his
Escape from the Condemn'd Hold: He sincerely disown'd, that
all, or any, belonging to the Prison were privy thereto; but
related it as it has been describ'd. He declar'd that <i>Edgworth Bess</i>,
who had hitherto pass'd for his <i>Wife</i>, was not really so: This was
by some thought to be in him Base, and Ungenerous in that, as
she had Contributed towards his Escape, and was in Custody on
that Account, it might render her more liable to Punishment,
than if she had been thought his Wife; but he endeavour'd to
acquit himself, by saying, that she was the sole Author of all his
Misfortunes; That she betray'd him to <i>Jonathan Wild</i>, at the time
he was taken in <i>Rosemary-Lane</i>; and that when he was contriving
his Escape, she disobey'd his orders, as when being requir'd to
attend at the Door of the Condemn'd-Hold by Nine, or Ten in
the Morning to facilitate his Endeavours, she came not till the
Evening, which he said, was an ungrateful Return for the care he
had taken in setting her at Liberty from <i>New-Prison</i>; and thus
Justify'd himself in what he had done, and said he car'd not what
became of her.</p>

<p>He was also Examined about Mr. <i>Martin's</i> Watches; and
whether <i>Page</i> was privy to that Robbery; he carefully guarded
himself against uttering any thing that might affect him, peremptorily
declar'd him Innocent of that, as well as of being privy to
his Escape, and said, that he only out of Kindness, as being an old
Companion, was resolv'd to share in his Fortunes after he had
Escap'd.</p>

<p>He was again continually meditating a second Escape, as
appear'd by his own Hardiness, and the Instruments found upon
him, on <i>Saturday</i> the 12th, and <i>Wednesday</i> the 16th of <i>September</i>,
the first Time a small File was found conceal'd in his Bible, and
the second Time two Files, a Chisel and an Hammer being hid in
the Rushes of a Chair; and whenever a Question was mov'd to
him, when, or by what Means those Implements came to his
Hands; he would passionately fly out, and say, <i>How can you? you
always ask me these, and such like Questions</i>; and in a particular
manner, when he was ask'd, Whether his Companion <i>Page</i> was
an Accomplice with him, either in the affair of the Watches, or
any other? (he reply'd) <i>That if he knew, he would give no direct
Answer</i>, thinking it to be a Crime in him to detect the Guilty.</p>

<p>It was thought necessary by the Keepers to remove him from
the Condemn'd-Hold to a Place, call'd the <i>Castle</i>, in the Body of
the Goal, and to Chain him down to two large Iron Staples in
the Floor; the Concourse of People of tolerable Fashion to see
him was exceeding Great, he was always Chearful and Pleasant
to a Degree, as turning almost every thing as was said into a Jest
and Banter.</p>

<p>Being one <i>Sunday</i> at the Chapel, a Gentleman belonging to the
<i>Lord Mayor</i>, ask'd a Turnkey, Which was <i>Sheppard</i>, the Man
pointed to him? Says <i>Sheppard, yes Sir, I am the</i> Sheppard<i>,
and all
the Goalers in the Town are my Flock, and I cannot stir into the
Country, but they are all at my Heels</i> Baughing, <i>after me, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>He told Mr. <i>Robins</i>, the <i>City Smith</i>, <i>That he had procur'd him a</i>
<i>small Job, and that whoever it was that put the Spikes on the Condemn'd-Hold
was an honest Man, for a better peice of Metal,</i> says he,
<i>I never wrought upon in my Life.</i></p>

<p>He was loth to believe his frequent Robberies were an Injury
to the Public, for he us'd to say, That <i>if they were ill in one Respect,
they were as good in another, and that though he car'd not for Working
much himself, yet he was desirous that others should not stand Idle,
more especially those of his own Trade, who were always Repairing of
his Breaches.</i></p>

<p>When serious, and that but seldom, he would Reflect on his
past wicked Life. He declar'd to us, that for several Years of his
Apprenticeship he had an utter abhorrence to Women of the
Town, and us'd to pelt them with Dirt when they have fell in his
way; till a <i>Button-Mould-Maker</i> his next Neighbour left off that
Business, and set up a Victualling-house in <i>Lewkenhors-Lane</i>,
where himself and other young Apprentices resorted on <i>Sundays</i>,
and at all other Opportunities. At this House began his Acquaintance
with <i>Edgworth Bess</i>. His sentiments were strangely alter'd,
and from an Aversion to those Prostitutes, he had a more favourable
Opinion, and even Conversation with them, till he Contracted
an ill Distemper, which as he said, he cur'd himself of by a
Medicine of his own preparing.</p>

<p>He inveigh'd bitterly against his Brother <i>Thomas</i> for putting
him into the Information, for Mrs. <i>Cook's</i> Robberry, and pretended
that all the Mischiefs that attended him was owing to that
Matter. He acknowledg'd that he was concern'd in that Fact, and
that his said Brother broke into his Lodgings, and stole from him
all his Share and more of the acquir'd Booty.</p>

<p>He often-times averr'd, that <i>William Field</i> was no ways concern'd
in Mr. <i>Kneebone's</i> Robbery; but that being a Brother of
the Quill; <i>Blewskin</i> and himself told him the particulars, and
manner of the Facts, and that all he Swore against him at his
Tryal was False, and that he had other Authority for it, than
what came out of their (<i>Sheppard</i> and <i>Blewskin</i>) Mouths, who
actually committed the Fact.</p>

<p>And moreover, that <i>Field</i> being acquainted with their Warehouse
(a Stable) near the <i>Horse-Ferry</i> at <i>Westminster</i>, which
<i>Sheppard</i> had hir'd, and usually resposited therein the Goods he
stole. He came one Night, and broke open the same, and carried
off the best part of the Effects taken out of Mr. <i>Kneebone's</i>
Shop.</p>

<p><i>Sheppard</i> said he thought this to be one of the greatest Villanies
that could be acted, for another to come and Plunder them of
Things for which they had so honourably ventur'd their Lives,
and wish'd that <i>Field</i>, as well as his Brother <i>Tom</i> might meet with
forgiveness for it.</p>

<p>He declar'd himself frequently against the Practice of <i>Whidling</i>,
or <i>Impeaching</i>, which he said, had made dreadful Havock among
the <i>Thieves</i>, and much lamented the depravity of the <i>Brethren</i>
in that Respect; and said that if all were but such <i>Tight-Cocks</i> as
himself, the <i>Reputation</i> of the <i>British Thievery</i> might be carried
to a far greater height than it had been done for many Ages, and
that there would then be but little Necessity for Jaylors and
Hangmen.</p>

<p>These and such like were his constant Discourses, when Company
went up with the Turnkeys to the <i>Castle</i> to see him, and
few or none went away without leaving him Money for his
Support; in which he abounded, and did therewith some small
Charities to the other Prisoners; however, he was abstemious
and sparing enough in his Diet.</p>

<p>Among the many Schemes laid by his Friends, for the preserving
himself after his Escape, we were told of a most Remarkable
one, propos'd by an ingenious Person, who advis'd, that he
might be Expeditiously, and Secretly convey'd to the Palace at
<i>Windsor</i>, and there to prostrate his Person, and his Case at the
Feet of a most Gracious Prince, and his Case being so very singular
and new, it might in great probability move the Royal Fountain
of unbounded Clemency; but he declin'd this Advice, and
follow'd the Judgment and Dictates of <i>Butchers</i>, which very
speedily brought him very near the Door of the <i>Slaughterhouse</i>.</p>

<p>On the 4th of <i>September</i>, the Day as <i>Joseph Ward</i>, and <i>Anthony
Upton</i> were Executed, there was publish'd a whimsical Letter,
as from <i>Sheppard</i>, to <i>Jack Ketch</i>, which afforded Diversion to the
Town, and Bread to the Author, which is as followeth, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class='blkquot'><p><i>SIR</i>,

<p>I Thank you for the Favour you intended me this day: I am a
Gentleman, and allow you to be the same, and I hope can forgive
Injuries; fond Nature prompted, I obey'd, Oh, propitious
Minute! and to show that I am in Charity, I am now drinking
your Health, and a <i>Bon Repo</i> to poor <i>Joseph</i> and <i>Anthony</i>. I am
gone a few Days for the Air, but design speedily to embark;
and this Night I am going upon a Mansion for a Supply; it's a
stout Fortification, but what Difficulties can't I encounter,
when, dear <i>Jack</i>, you find that Bars and Chains are but trifling
Obstacles in the way of your Friend and Servant.</p>

<p>JOHN SHEPPARD.</p>

<p><i>From my Residence in
Terra Australi incognito</i>.</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i> Pray my Service to Mr. <i>Or&mdash;&mdash; di&mdash;&mdash; y</i> and to Mr.
<i>App&mdash;&mdash; ee</i>.</p></div>

<p>On <i>Saturday</i> the 10th of <i>October</i>, <i>Anthony Lamb</i>, and <i>Thomas
Sheppard</i>, with 95 other Felons were carried from <i>Newgate</i> on
Shipboard, for Transportation to the Plantations; the last begg'd
to have an opportunity given him of taking his final Leave of his
Brother <i>John</i>; but this was not to be Granted, and the greatest
Favour that could be obtain'd, was that on the <i>Sunday</i> before
they had an Interview at the <i>Chapel</i>, but at such a distance, that
they neither saluted, or shook Hands, and the Reason given for it,
was that no Implements might be convey'd to <i>Sheppard</i> to assist
him in making an Escape.</p>

<p>This, Caution seem'd to be absolutely necessary, for it appear'd
soon after that <i>Sheppard</i> found Means to release himself from the
Staples to which he was Chain'd in the Castle, by unlocking a
great Padlock with a Nail, which he had pickt up on the Floor,
and endeavour'd to pass up the Chimney, but was prevented by
the stout Iron Bars fix'd in his way, and wanted nothing but the
smallest File to have perfected his Liberty. When the Assistants
of the Prison, came as usual with his Victuals, they began to
examine his Irons; to their great Surprize they found them loose,
and ready to be taken off at Pleasure. Mr. <i>Pitt</i> the Head Keeper,
and his Deputies were sent for, and <i>Sheppard</i> finding this Attempt
entirely frustrated, discover'd to them by what means he had got
them off; and after they had search'd him, found nothing, and
Lock'd and Chain'd him down again; He took up the Nail and
unlocked the Padlock before their Faces; they were struck with
the greatest Amazement as having never heard, or beheld the
like before. He was then Handcuff'd, and more effectually
Chain'd.</p>

<p>The next Day, the Reverend Mr. <i>Purney Ordinary</i> of the Place
came from the Country to visit him, and complain'd of the sad
Disposition he found him in, as Meditateing on nothing, but
Means to Escape, and declining the great Duty incumbent upon
him to prepare for his approaching Change. He began to Relent,
and said, that since his last Effort had prov'd not Successful, he
would entertain no more Thoughts of that Nature, but entirely
Dispose, and Resign himself to the Mercy of Almighty God, of
whom he hop'd to find forgiveness of his manifold Offences.</p>

<p>He said, that <i>Edgworth Bess</i> and himself kept a little
Brandy-shop together in <i>Lewkenhors-Lane</i>, and once sav'd about Thirty
Pounds; but having such an universal Acquaintance amongst
Theives, he had frequent calls to go <i>Abroad</i>, and soon quitted that
Business, and his Shop.</p>

<p>On <i>Friday</i> the 2d, of <i>October</i> his old Confederate <i>Joseph Blake</i>
alias <i>Blewskin</i>, was apprehended and taken at a House in St. <i>Giles's</i>
Parish by <i>Jonathan Wild</i>, and by Justice <i>Blackerby</i> committed to
<i>Newgate</i>. <i>William Field</i> who was at his liberty, appearing and
making Oath, that <i>Blewskin</i> together with <i>John Sheppard</i> and
himself, committed the Burglary and Felony in Mr. <i>Kneebone's</i>
House, for which <i>Sheppard</i> was Condemn'd.</p>

<p>The Sessions commencing at the <i>Old-Bailey</i> on <i>Wednesday</i> the
14th of <i>October</i> following, an Indictment was found against
<i>Blewskin</i> for the same, and he was brought down from <i>Newgate</i>
to the <i>Old-Bailey</i> to be Arraign'd in order to his Tryal; and being
in the Yard within the Gate before the Court: Mr. <i>Wild</i> being
there Drinking a glass of Wine with him, he said to Mr. <i>Wild</i>,
<i>You may put in a word for me, as well as for another Person?</i> To
which Mr. <i>Wild</i> reply'd, I cannot do it. <i>You are certainly a dead
Man, and will be tuck'd up very speedily,</i> or words to that effect:
Whereupon <i>Blewskin</i> on a sudden seiz'd Mr. <i>Wild</i> by the Neck,
and with a little Clasp Knife he was provided with he cut his
Throat in a very dangerous Manner; and had it not been for a
<i>Muslin</i> Stock twisted in several Plaits round his Neck, he had in all
likelyhood succeeded in his barbarous Design before <i>Ballard</i> the
Turnkey, who was at Hand, could have time to lay hold of him;
the Villain trumph'd afterwards in what he had done, Swearing
many bloody Oaths, that if he had murder'd him, he should have
died with Satisfaction, and that his Intention was to have cut off
his Head, and thrown it into the Sessions House-Yard among the
Rabble, and Curs'd both his Hand and the Knife for not Executing
it Effectually.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wild</i> instantly had the Assistance of three able Surgeons,
<i>viz.</i> Mr. <i>Dobbins</i>, Mr. <i>Marten</i> and Mr. <i>Coletheart</i>, who sew'd up
the Wound, and order'd him to his Bed, and he has continu'd
ever since, but in a doubtful State of Recovery.</p>

<p>The Felons on the Common Side of <i>Newgate</i>, also animated by
<i>Sheppard's</i> Example, the Night before they were to be Shipt for
Transporation, had cut several Iron Bars assunder, and some of
them had saw'd off their Fetters, the rest Huzzaing, and making
Noises, under pretence of being Joyful that they were to be
remov'd on the Morrow, to prevent the Workmen being heard;
and in two Hours time more, if their Design had not been discover'd,
near One Hundred Villians had been let loose into the
World, to have committed new Depredations; nothing was
wanted here but <i>Sheppard's</i> great Judgment, who was by himself
in the strong Room, call'd the <i>Castle</i>, meditating his own Deliverance,
which he perfected in the manner following.</p>

<p>On <i>Thursday</i> the 15th of this Instant <i>October</i>, at between One
and Two in the Afternoon, <i>William Austin</i>, an Assistant to the
Keepers, a Man reputed to be a very diligent, and faithful Servant,
went to <i>Sheppard</i> in the strong Room, call'd the <i>Castle</i>, with his
Necessaries, as was his Custom every Day. There went along with
him Captain <i>Geary</i>, the Keeper of <i>New Prison</i>, Mr. <i>Gough</i>, belonging
to the <i>Gate-house</i> in <i>Westminster</i>, and two other Gentlemen,
who had the Curiosity to see the Prisoner, <i>Austin</i> very
strictly examined his Fetters, and his Hand-Cuffs, and found
them very Safe; he eat his Dinner and talk'd with his usual
Gayety to the Company: They took leave of him and wish'd
him a good Evening. The Court being sitting at the <i>Old-Bailey</i>,
the Keepers and most of their Servants were attending there
with their Prisoners: And <i>Sheppard</i> was told that if he wanted any
thing more, then was his Time, because they could not come to
him till the next Morning: He thank'd them for their Kindness,
and desir'd them to be as <i>early as possible</i>.</p>

<p>The same Night, soon after 12 of the Clock Mr. <i>Bird</i>, who keeps
a Turners-shop adjoyning to <i>Newgate</i>, was disturb'd by the Watchman,
who found his Street Door open, and call'd up the Family,
and they concluding the Accident was owing to the Carelessness
of some in the House, shut their Doors, and went to Bed again.</p>

<p>The next Morning <i>Friday</i>, at about eight Mr. <i>Austin</i> went up as
usual to wait on <i>Sheppard</i>, and having unlock'd and unbolted the
double Doors of the Castle, he beheld almost a Cart-load of
Bricks and Rubbish about the Room, and his Prisoner gone:
The Man ready to sink, came trembling down again, and was
scarce able to Acquaint the People in the <i>Lodge</i> with what had
happen'd.</p>

<p>The whole Posse of the Prison ran up, and stood like Men
depriv'd of their Senses: Their surprize being over, they were in
hopes that he might not have yet entirely made his Escape, and
got their Keys to open all the strong Rooms adjacent to the
<i>Castle</i>, in order to Trace him, when to their farther Amazement,
they found the Door ready open'd to their Hands; and the strong
Locks, Screws and Bolts broken in pieces, and scatter'd about the
Jayl. Six great Doors (one whereof having not been open'd for
seven Years past) were forc'd, and it appear'd that he had Descended
from the Leads of <i>Newgate</i> by a Blanket (which he fasten'd
to the Wall by an Iron Spike he had taken from the Hatch
of the <i>Chapel</i>) on the House of Mr. <i>Bird</i>, and the Door on the
Leads having been left open, it is very reasonable to conclude he
past directly to the Street Door down the Stairs; Mr <i>Bird</i> and his
Wife hearing an odd sort of a Noise on the Stairs as they lay in
their Bed, a short time before the Watchman alarm'd the Family.</p>

<p>Infinite Numbers of Citizens came to <i>Newgate</i> to behold
<i>Sheppard's</i> Workmanship, and Mr. <i>Pitt</i> and his Officers very
readily Conducted them up Stairs, that the World might be
convinc'd there was not the least room to suspect, either a Negligence,
or Connivance in the Servants. Every one express'd the
greatest Surprize that has been known, and declar'd themselves
satisfy'd with the Measures they had taken for the Security of
their Prisoner.</p>

<p>One of the Sheriffs came in Person, and went up to the <i>Castle</i>
to be satisfy'd of the Situation of the Place, <i>&amp;c.</i> Attended by several
of the City Officers.</p>

<p>The Court being sat at the <i>Sessions-House</i>, the Keepers were
sent for and Examin'd, and the Magistrates were in great Consternation,
that so horrid a Wretch had escap'd their Justice. It
being intended that he should have been brought down to the
Court the last Day of the <i>Sessions</i>, and order'd for Execution in
two or three Days after; if it appear'd that he was the Person Condemn'd
for the breaking Mr. <i>Kneebone's</i> House, and included in
the Warrant for Execution, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Many of the Methods by which this miraculous Escape was
effected, remain as yet a Secret, there are some indeed too Evident,
the most reasonable Conjecture that has hierto been made, is,
that the first Act was his twisting and breaking assunder by the
strength of his Hands a small Iron Chain, which together with a
great Horse Padlock, (as went from the heavy Fetters about his
Legs to the staples) confin'd him to the Floor, and with a Nail
open'd the Padlock and set himself at Liberty about the Room:
A large flat Iron Bar appears to have been taken out of the Chimney,
with the Assistance thereof 'tis plain he broke thro' a Wall
of many Foot in Thickness, and made his way from the <i>Castle</i>
into another strong Room Contiguous, the Door of it not having
been open'd since several of the <i>Preston</i> Prisoners were Confin'd
there about seven Years ago: Three Screws are visibly taken off
of the Lock, and the Doors as strong as Art could make them,
forc'd open. The Locks and Bolts, either wrench'd or Broke, and
the Cases and other Irons made for their Security cut assunder:
An Iron Spike broke off from the Hatch in the <i>Chapel</i>, which he
fix'd in the Wall and fasten'd his Blanket to it, to drop on the
Leads of Mr. <i>Bird</i>'s House, his Stockings were found on the
Leads of <i>Newgate</i>; 'tis question'd whether sixty Pounds will repair
the Damage done to the Jayl.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be inquir'd how all this could be perform'd
without his being heard by the Prisoners or the Keepers; 'tis well
known that the Place of his Confinement is in the upper part of
the Prison, none of the other Felons being Kept any where near
him; and 'tis suppos'd that if any had heard him at Work, they
would rather have facilitated, than frustrated his Endeavours.
In the Course of his Breaches he pass'd by a Door on his Left
belonging to the <i>Common-Side</i> Felons, who have since Curs'd
him heartily for his not giving them an opportunity to kiss his
Hand, and lending them a favourable lift when his Hand was in;
but that was not a Work proper for Mr. <i>Sheppard</i> to do in his
then Circumstances.</p>

<p>His Fetters are not to be found any where about the Jayl, from
whence 'tis concluded he has either thrown them down some
Chimney, or carried them off on his Legs, the latter seems to be
Impracticable, and would still render his Escaping in such Manner
the more astonishing; and the only Answer that is given to the
whole, at <i>Newgate</i> is, <i>That the</i> Devil <i>came in Person and assisted him</i>.</p>

<p>He undoubtedly perform'd most of these Wonders in the
darkest part of the Night, and without the least Glimpse of a
Candle; a word, he has actually done with his own Hands in a
few Hours, what several of the most skilful Artists allow, could not
have been acted by a number of Persons furnish'd with proper
Implements, and all other Advantages in a full Day.</p>

<p>Never was there anything better Tim'd, the Keepers and all
their Assistants being obliged to a strict Attendance on the Sessions
at the <i>Old Bailey</i>, which held for about a Week; and <i>Blewskin</i>
having confin'd <i>Jonathan Wild</i> to his Chamber, a more favourable
opportunity could not have presented for Mr. <i>Sheppard's</i> Purposes.</p>

<p>The Jaylors suffer'd much by the Opinion the ignorant Part
of the People entertain'd of the Matter, and nothing would satisfie
some, but that they not only Conniv'd at, but even assisted him
in breaking their own Walls and Fences, and that for this Reason
too, <i>viz.</i> That he should be at Liberty to instruct and train up
others in his Method of House-Breaking; and replenish the Town
with a new set of Rogues, to supply the Places of those Transported
beyond Sea.</p>

<p>This is indeed a fine way of Judging, the well-known Characters
of Mr. <i>Pitt</i>, and his Deputies, are sufficient to wipe of such
ridiculous Imputations; and 'tis a most lamentable Truth, that
they have often-times had in their Charge Villains of the deepest
Die; Persons of Quality and great Worth, for whom no Entreaties,
no Sums how large soever have been able to interfere
between the doleful Prison, and the fatal Tree.</p>

<p>The Officers have done their Duty, they are but Men, and have
had to deal with a Creature something more than Man, a <i>Protoeus</i>,
Supernatural, Words cannot describe him, his Actions and
Workmanship which are too visible, best testifie him.</p>

<p>On <i>Saturday</i> the 17th, <i>Joseph Blake</i>, alias <i>Blewskin</i>, came upon
his Tryal at the <i>Old Bailey</i>: <i>Field</i> gave the same Evidence against
him, as he had formerly done against <i>Sheppard</i>; and the Prisoner
making but a triffling Defence, the Jury found him Guilty of
Buglary and Felony. The Criminal when the Verdict was brought
in, made his Obeysances to the Court, <i>and thank'd them for their
Kindness</i>.</p>

<p>It will be necessary that we now return to the Behaviour of
Mr. <i>Sheppard</i>, some few Days before his last Flight.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Figg</i> the famous Prize Fighter comeing to see him, in
<i>NEWGATE</i>, there past some pleasant Raillery between them;
and after Mr. <i>Figg</i> was gone, <i>Sheppard</i> declared he had a Mind to
send him a formal Challenge to Fight him at all the Weapons in
the strong Room; and that let the Consequence be what it would,
he should call at Mr. <i>Figg's</i> House in his way to Execution, and
drink a merry Glass with him by way of Reconciliation.</p>

<p>A young Woman an Acquaintance of his Mother, who
wash'd his Linnen and brought him Necessaries, having in an
Affray, got her Eyes beaten Black and Blue; says <i>Sheppard</i> to her,
<i>How long hast thou been Married</i>? Replyes the Wench. <i>I wonder
you can ask me such a Question, when you so well know the Contrary</i>:
Nay, says <i>Sheppard</i> again, Sarah <i>don't deny it, for you have gotten
your Certificate in your Face</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ireton</i> a Bailiff in <i>Drury-Lane</i> having pursued <i>Sheppard</i>
after his Escape from the Condemn'd-Hold with uncommon
Diligence; (for the safety of that Neighbourhood which was the
chief Scene of his Villainies) <i>Sheppard</i> when Re-taken, declared,
he would be even with him for it, and if ever he procur'd his
Liberty again, <i>he would give all his Prisoners an</i> ACT OF GRACE.
A Gentleman in a jocose way ask'd him to come and take a
Dinner with him, <i>Sheppard</i> reply'd, <i>he accepted of the Invitation,
and perhaps might take an opportunity to wait on him</i>; and there is
great Reason to believe he has been as good as his Word.</p>

<p>He would complain of his Nights, as saying, <i>It was dark with
him from Five in the Evening, till Seven in the Morning</i>; and being
not permitted to have either a Bed or Candle, his Circumstances
were dismal; and that he never slept but had some confus'd
Doses, he said he consider'd all this with the Temper of a Philosopher.</p>

<p>Neither his sad Circumstances, nor the solemn Exhortations of
the several Divines who visited him, were able to divert him
from this ludicrous way of Expression; he said, <i>They were all
Ginger-bread Fellows</i>, and came rather out of Curiosity, than
Charity; and to form <i>Papers</i> and <i>Ballads</i> out of his Behaviour.</p>

<p>A <i>Welch</i> Clergyman who came pretty often, requested him in a
particularly Manner to refrain Drinking; (tho' indeed there was
no necessity for that Caution) <i>Sheppard</i> says, Doctor, <i>You set an
Example and I'll follow</i>; this was a smart Satyr and Repartee upon
the <i>Parson</i>, some Circumstances consider'd.</p>

<p>When he was visited in the <i>Castle</i> by the Reverend Mr. <i>Wagstaff</i>,
he put on the Face only of a Preparation for his End, as
appear'd by his frequent Attempts made upon his Escape, and
when he has been press'd to Discover those who put him upon
Means of Escaping, and furnish'd him with Implements, he would
passionately, and with a Motion of striking, say, <i>ask me no such
Questions, one File's worth all the Bibles in the World</i>.</p>

<p>When ask'd if he had not put off all Thoughts of an Escape
and Entertain'd none but those of Death, would Answer by way
of Question, not directly, whether they thought it possible, or
probable for him to Effect his Release, when Manackled in the
manner he was. When mov'd to improve the few Minutes that
seem'd to remain of his Life; he did indeed listen to, but not regard
the Design and Purport of his Admonition, breaking in with
something New of his own, either with respect to his former
Accomplices, or Actions, and all too with Pleasure and Gayety of
Expression.</p>

<p>When in <i>Chapel</i>, he would seemingly make his Responses with
Devotion; but would either Laugh, or force Expressions (when
as an Auditor of the Sermon) be of Contempt, either of the
Preacher, or of his Discourse.</p>

<p>In fine, he behav'd so, in Word, and Action, (since retaken)
that demonstrated to the World, that his Escape was the utmost
Employ of his Thoughts, whatever Face of Penitence he put on
when visited by the Curious.</p>

<p>An Account of SHEPPARD'S Adventures of five Hours immediately
after his Escape from <i>Newgate</i>, in a Letter to his Friend.</p>

<div class='blkquot'><p>DEAR FRIEND!</p>

<p>Over a Bottle of <i>Claret</i> you'll give me leave to <i>declare it</i>, that
I've fairly put the <i>Vowels</i> upon the good Folks at <i>Newgate, i.o.u.</i>
When I'm able, I may, or may not discharge my <i>Fees</i>, 'tis a <i>Fee-simple</i>,
for a Man in my Condition to acknowledge; and tho' I'm
safe out of <i>Newgate</i>, I must yet have, or at least, affect, a <i>New
Gate</i> by Limping, or Turning my Toes in by making a right
<i>Hand</i> of my <i>Feet</i>. Not <i>to be long</i>, for I hate <i>Prolixity</i> in all Business:
<i>In short</i>, after <i>Filing, Defileing, Sawing</i>, when no Body <i>Saw</i>.
<i>Climbing</i> (this <i>Clime in</i>) it prov'd a good <i>Turner</i> of my Affairs,
thro' the House of a <i>Turner</i>. Being quite past, and safe from
<i>Estreat</i> on Person or Chattels, and safe in the <i>Street</i>, I thought
Thanks due to him who cou'd <i>Deliver hence</i>; and immediately
(for you must know I'm a <i>Catholick</i>) to give Thanks for my
Deliverance, I stept amongst the <i>Grey-Fryers</i> to come an joyn
with me, in saying a <i>Pater-Noster</i>, or so, at <i>Amen-Corner</i>. The
<i>Fryers</i> being <i>Fat</i> began to <i>Broil</i>, and soon after <i>Boild up</i> into a
Passion to be disturb'd at that time of Night. But being got
<i>Loose</i> and having no Time to <i>Lose</i>, I gave them good Words,
and so the Business was done. From thence I soon slip'd through
<i>Ludgate</i>, but was damnably fearful of an <i>Old Bailey</i> always lurking
thereabout, who might have brought me to the <i>Fleet</i> for
being too <i>Nimble</i>, besides, I was wonderfully apprehensive of
receiving some unwelcome <i>Huggings</i> from the <i>W....n</i> there;
therefore with a step and a stride I soon got over <i>Fleet-ditch</i>, and
(as in Justice I ought) I prais'd the <i>Bridge</i> I got over. Being a
<i>Batchelor</i>, and not being capable to to manage a Bridewell you
know. I had no Business near <i>St. Brides</i>, so kept the right
handside, designing to <i>Pop</i> into the <i>Alley</i> as usual; but fearing to go
thro' there, and <i>harp</i> too much on the same <i>String</i>, it gave an
<i>Allay</i> to my Intention, and on I went to <i>Shoe-lane</i> end but there
meeting with a <i>Bully Hack</i> of the Town, he wou'd have shov'd
me down, which my Spirit resenting, tho' a <i>brawny Dog</i>, I soon
<i>Coller'd</i> him, fell Souse at him, then with his own Cane I <i>strapped</i>
till he was force to <i>Buckle</i> too, and hold his <i>Tongue</i>, in so much
he durst not say his <i>Soul</i> was his own, and was glad to pack of at
<i>Last</i>, and turn his <i>Heels</i> upon me: I was glad he was gone you may
be sure, and <i>dextrously</i> made a <i>Hand</i> of my <i>Feet</i> under the <i>Leg-Tavern</i>;
but the very Thoughts of <i>Fetter-Lane</i> call'd to mind some
Passages, which made me avoid the <i>Passage</i> at the end of it, (next
to the Coffee House you know) so I soon whip'd over the way,
yet going along two wooden <i>Logger-heads</i> at <i>St. Dunstan's</i> made
just them a damn'd Noise about their <i>Quarters</i>, but the sight of
me made perfectly <i>Hush</i> in a <i>Minute</i>; now fearing to goe by
<i>Chance-a wry-Lane</i>, as being upon the <i>Watch</i> my self and not to
be <i>debarr'd</i> at <i>Temple-Bar</i>; I stole up <i>Bell-Yard</i>, but narrowly
escap'd being <i>Clapper-claw'd</i> by two Fellows I did not like in the
Alley, so was forc'd to goe round with a design to <i>Sheer-off</i> into
<i>Sheer-Lane</i>, but the <i>Trumpet</i> sounding at that very time, alarm'd
me so, I was forc'd to Grope my way back through <i>Hemlock-Court</i>,
and take my <i>Passage</i> by <i>Ship-Yard</i> without the Bar again;
but there meeting with one of our trusty Friends, (all Ceremonies
a-part) he told me under the <i>Rose</i> I must expect no <i>Mercy</i> in
<i>St. Clement's</i> Parish, for the <i>Butchers</i> there on the <i>Back</i> on't would
<i>Face</i> me, and with their <i>Cleavers</i> soon bring me down on my
<i>marrow</i> Bones; you may believe I soon hastened thence, but by
this time being Fainty and night Spent, I put forward, and seeing
a <i>Light</i> near the <i>Savoy-Gate</i>, I was resolv'd not to make <i>Light</i> of
the Opportunity, but call'd for an hearty Dram of <i>Luther</i> and
<i>Calvin</i>, that is, <i>Mum</i> and <i>Geneva</i> mix'd; but having Fasted so
long before, it soon got into my Noddle, and e'er I had gone
twenty steps, it had so intirely <i>Stranded</i> my Reason, that by the
time I came to <i>Half-Moon-Street</i> end, it gave a <i>New-Exchange</i> to
my Senses, and made me quite <i>Lunatick</i>.</p>

<p>However, after a little Rest, I stole down <i>George-Passage</i> into
<i>Oaf-Alley</i> in <i>York-Buildings</i>, and thence (tho' a vile Man) into
<i>Villiers-Street</i>, and so into the <i>Strand</i> again, where having gone
a little way, <i>Hefford's-Harp</i> at the Sign of the
<i>Irish-Harp, </i> put me
a <i>Jumping and Dancing</i> to that degree that I could not forbear
making a <i>Somerset</i> or two before <i>Northumberland-House</i>. I thought
once of taking the <i>Windsor</i> Coach for my self <i>John Sheppard</i>, by
the Name of <i>Crook</i>&mdash;&mdash; but fearing to be <i>Hook'd</i> in before my
Journey's End, I stept into <i>Hedge-Lane</i>, where two Harlots were
up in the <i>Boughs</i> (it seems) <i>Branching</i> out their Respects to one

<p>I did call at <i>Hammersmith</i>, having no occasion directly. I shall
stay two or three Days in that Neighbourhood, so, if you Direct

<p>We shall conclude with what had been often observ'd by many
Persons to <i>Sheppard</i>; <i>viz.</i> That it was very Imprudent in him to
take Shelter in the City, or the adjacent Parts of it, after his
Escape from the Condemn'd Hold; and withal to commit a
<i>Capital Offence</i>, almost within Sight of <i>Newgate</i>, when his Life
and all was in such Danger. His Reply was general, <i>viz.</i> That it
was his Fate: But being ask'd a particular Reason for his not taking
a longer Rout than the City, and the Neighbouring parts:
pleaded Poverty as his Excuse for Confinement within those
Limits; at the same time urging, that had he been Master at that
time of five Pounds, <i>England</i> should not have been the Place of his
Residence, having a good Trade in his Hands to live in any populated
Part of the World.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
