<h2>Dedication</h2>
<center>TO CAPTAIN OWEN KETTLE</center>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i>My dear Kettle,--<br>
<br>
With some considerable trepidation, I venture to offer you here the
dedication of your unauthorized biography. You will read these
memoirs, I know, and it is my pious hope that you do not fit the
cap on yourself as their hero. Of course I have sent you along your
cruises under the decent disguise of a purser's name, and I trust
that if you do recognize yourself, you will appreciate this nice
feeling on my part. Believe me, it was not entirely caused by
personal fear of that practical form which I am sure your
displeasure would take if you caught any one putting you into
print. Even a working novelist has his humane moments; and besides
if I made you more recognizable, there might be a more dangerous
broth stirred up, with an ugly international flavor. Would it be
indiscreet to bring one sweltering day in Bahia to your memory,
where you made play with a German (or was he a Scandinavian?) and a
hundredweight drum of good white lead? or might one hint at that
little affair which made Odessa bad for your health, and indeed
compelled you to keep away from Black Sea ports entirely for
several years? I trust, then, that if you do detect my sin in
making myself without leave or license your personal historian, you
will be induced for the sake of your present respectability to give
no sign of a ruffled temper, but recognize me as part of the cross
you are appointed to bear, and incidentally remember my forbearance
in keeping so much really splendid material (from my point of view)
in snug retirement up my sleeve.<br>
<br>
Finally, let me remind you that I made no promises not to publish,
and that you did. Not only were you going to endow the world with a
book of poems, but I was to have a free copy. This has not yet
come; and if, for an excuse, you have published no secular verse, I
am quite willing to commute for a copy of the Book of Hymns,
provided it is suitably inscribed</i>.</blockquote>

<h3>IN QUARANTINE</h3>
<br>
<p>"The pay is small enough," said Captain Kettle, staring at the
blue paper. "It's a bit hard for a man of my age and experience to
come down to a job like piloting, on eight pound a month and my
grub."</p>
<p>"All right, Capt'n," replied the agent. "You needn't tell me
what I know already. The pay's miserable, the climate's vile, and
the bosses are beasts. And yet we have more applicants for these
berths on the Congo than there are vacancies for. And f'why is it,
Capt'n? Because there's no questions asked. The Congo people want
men who can handle steamers. Their own bloomin' Belgians aren't
worth a cent for that, and so they have to get Danes, Swedes,
Norwegians, English, Eytalians, or any one else that's capable.
They prefer to give small pay, and are willing to take the men that
for various reasons can't get better jobs elsewhere. Guess you'll
know the crowd I mean?"</p>
<p>"Thoroughly, sir," said Kettle, with a sigh. "There are a very
large number of us. But we're not all unfortunate through our own
fault."</p>
<p>"No, I know," said the agent. "Rascally owners, unsympathetic
Board of Trade, master's certificate suspended quite unjustly, and
all that--" The agent looked at his watch. "Well, Capt'n, now,
about this berth? Are you going to take it?"</p>
<p>"I've no other choice."</p>
<p>"Right," said the agent, and pulled a printed form on to the
desk before him, and made a couple of entries. "Let's see--er--is
there a Mrs. Kettle?"</p>
<p>"Married," said the little sailor; "three children."</p>
<p>The agent filled these details on to the form. "Just as well to
put it down," he commented as he wrote. "I'm told the Congo Free
State has some fancy new pension scheme on foot for widdys and
kids, though I expect it'll come to nothing, as usual. They're a
pretty unsatisfactory lot all round out there. Still you may as
well have your chance of what plums are going. Yer age,
Capt'n?"</p>
<p>"Thirty-eight."</p>
<p>"And--er--previous employment? Well, I suppose we had better
leave that blank as usual. They never really expect it to be filled
in, or they wouldn't offer such wretchedly small pay and
commission. You've got your master's ticket to show, and that's
about all they want."</p>
<p>"There's my wife's address, sir. I'd like my half-pay sent to
her."</p>
<p>"She shall have it direct from Brussels, skipper, so long as you
are alive--I mean, so long as you remain in the Congo Service."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle sighed again. "Shall I have to wait long before
this appointment is confirmed?"</p>
<p>"Why, no," said the agent. "There's a boat sailing for the Coast
to-morrow, and I can give you an order for a passage by her. Of
course my recommendation has to go to Brussels to be ratified, but
that's only a matter of form. They never refuse anybody that
offers. They call the Government 'Leopold and Co.' down there on
the Congo. You'll understand more about it when you're on the
spot.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for ye, Capt'n, but after what you told me, I'm
afraid it's the only berth I can shove you into. However, don't let
me frighten ye. Take care of yourself, don't do too much work, and
you may pull through all right. Here's the order for the passage
down Coast by the Liverpool boat. And now I must ask you to excuse
me. I've another client waiting."</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>In this manner, then, Captain Owen Kettle found himself, after
many years of weary knocking about the seas, enlisted into a
regular Government service; and although this Government, for
various reasons, happened to be one of the most unsatisfactory in
all the wide, wide world, he thrust this item resolutely behind
him, and swore to himself that if diligence and crew-driving could
bring it about, he would rise in that service till he became one of
the most notable men in Africa.</p>
<p>"What I want is a competence for the missus and kids," he kept
on repeating to himself, "and the way to finger that competence is
to get power." He never owned to himself that this thirst for power
was one of the greatest curses of his life; and it did not occur to
him that his lust for authority, and his ruthless use of it when it
came in his way, were the main things which accounted for his want
of success in life.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle's voyage down to the Congo on the British and
African S.S. <i>M'poso</i> gave time for the groundwork of Coast
language and Coast thought (which are like unto nothing else on
this planet) to soak into his system. The steamer progressed
slowly. She went up rivers protected by dangerous bars; she
anchored in roadsteads, off forts, and straggling towns; she lay-to
off solitary whitewashed factories, which only see a steamer twice
a year, and brought off little doles of cargo in her surf-boats and
put on the beaches rubbishy Manchester and Brummagem trade goods
for native consumption; and the talk in her was that queer jargon
with the polyglot vocabulary in which commerce is transacted all
the way along the sickly West African seaboard, from the Goree to
St. Paul de Loanda.</p>
<p>Every white man of the <i>M'poso's</i> crew traded on his own
private account, and Kettle was initiated into the mysteries of the
unofficial retail store in the forecastle, of whose existence
Captain Image, the commander, and Mr. Balgarnie, the purser,
professed a blank and child-like ignorance.</p>
<p>Kettle had come across many types of sea-trader in his time, but
Captain Image and Mr. Balgarnie were new to him. But then most of
his surroundings were new. Especially was the Congo Free State an
organization which was quite strange to him. When he landed at
Banana, Captain Nilssen, pilot of the Lower Congo and Captain of
the Port of Banana, gave him advice on the subject in language
which was plain and unfettered.</p>
<p>"They are a lot of swine, these Belgians," said Captain Nilssen,
from his seat in the Madeira chair under the veranda of the
pilotage, "and there's mighty little to be got out of them. Here am
I, with a wife in Kjobnhavn and another in Baltimore, and I haven't
been able to get away to see either of them for five blessed years.
And mark you, I'm a man with luck, as luck goes in this hole. I've
been in the lower river pilot service all the time, and got the
best pay, and the lightest jobs. There's not another captain in the
Congo can say as much. Some day or other they put a steamboat on
the ground, and then they're kicked out from the pilot service, and
away they're off one-time to the upper river above the falls, to
run a launch, and help at the rubber palaver, and get shot at, and
collect niggers' ears, and forget what champagne and white man's
chop taste like."</p>
<p>"You've been luckier?"</p>
<p>"Some. I've libbed for Lower Congo all my time; had a home in
the pilotage here; and got a dash of a case of champagne, or an
escribello, or at least a joint of fresh meat out of the
refrigerator from every steamboat I took either up or down."</p>
<p>"But then you speak languages?" said Kettle.</p>
<p>"Seven," said Captain Nilssen; "and use just one, and that's
English. Shows what a fat lot of influence this &Eacute;tat du
Congo has got. Why, you have to give orders even to your boat-boys
in Coast English if you want to be understood. French has no sort
of show with the niggers."</p>
<p>Now white men are expensive to import to the Congo Free State,
and are apt to die with suddenness soon after their arrival, and so
the State (which is in a chronic condition of hard-up) does not
fritter their services unnecessarily. It sets them to work at once
so as to get the utmost possible value out of them whilst they
remain alive and in the country.</p>
<p>A steamer came in within a dozen hours of Kettle's first
stepping ashore, and signalled for a pilot to Boma. Nilssen was
next in rotation for duty, and went off in his boat to board her,
and he took with him Captain Owen Kettle to impart to him the
mysteries of the great river's navigation.</p>
<p>The boat-boys sang a song explanatory of their notion of the new
pilot's personality as they caught at the paddles, but as the song
was in Fiote, even Nilssen could only catch up a phrase here and
there, just enough to gather the drift. He did not translate,
however. He had taken his new comrade's measure pretty accurately,
and judged that he was not a man who would accept criticism from a
negro. So having an appetite for peace himself, he allowed the
custom of the country to go on undisturbed.</p>
<p>The steamer was outside, leaking steam at an anchorage, and
sending out dazzling heliograms every time she rolled her bleached
awnings to the sun. The pilot's boat, with her crew of savages,
paddled towards her, down channels between the mangrove-planted
islands. The water spurned up by the paddle blades was the color of
beer, and the smell of it was puzzlingly familiar.</p>
<p>"Good old smell," said Nilssen, "isn't it? I see you snuffling.
Trying to guess where you met it before, eh? We all do that when we
first come. What about crushed marigolds, eh?"</p>
<p>"Crushed marigolds it is."</p>
<p>"Guess you'll get to know it better before you're through with
your service here. Well, here we are alongside."</p>
<p>The steamer was a Portuguese, officered by Portuguese, and
manned by Krooboys, and the smell of her drowned even the marigold
scent of the river. Her dusky skipper exuded perspiration and
affability, but he was in a great hurry to get on with his voyage.
The forecastle windlass clacked as the pilot boat drew into sight,
heaving the anchor out of the river floor; the engines were
restarted so soon as ever the boat hooked on at the foot of the
Jacob's ladder; and the vessel was under a full head of steam again
by the time the two white men had stepped on to her oily deck.</p>
<p>"When you catch a Portuguese in a hurry like this," said Nilssen
to Kettle as they made their way to the awninged bridge, "it means
there's something wrong. I don't suppose we shall be told, but keep
your eyes open."</p>
<p>However, there was no reason for prying. Captain Rabeira was
quite open about his desire for haste. "I got <i>baccalhao</i> and
passenger boys for a cargo, an' dose don' keep," said he.</p>
<p>"We smelt the fish all the way from Banana," said Nilssen.
"Guess you ought to call it stinking fish, not dried fish, Captain.
And we can see your nigger passengers. They seem worried. Are you
losing 'em much?"</p>
<p>"I done funeral palaver for eight between Loanda an' here, an'
dem was a dead loss-a. I don' only get paid for dem dat lib for
beach at Boma. Dere was a fire-bar made fast to the leg of each for
sinker, an' dem was my dead loss-a too. I don' get paid for
fire-bars given to <i>gastados</i>--" His English failed him. He
shrugged his shoulders, and said "Sabbey?"</p>
<p>"Sabbey plenty," said Nilssen. "Just get me a leadsman to work,
Captain. If you're in a hurry, I'll skim the banks as close as I
dare."</p>
<p>Rabeira called away a hand to heave the lead, and sent a steward
for a bottle of wine and glasses. He even offered camp stools,
which, naturally, the pilots did not use. In fact, he brimmed with
affableness and hospitality.</p>
<p>From the first moment of his stepping on to the bridge, Kettle
began to learn the details of his new craft. As each sandbar showed
up beneath the yellow ripples, as each new point of the forest-clad
banks opened out, Nilssen gave him courses and cross bearings,
dazing enough to the unprofessional ear, but easily stored in a
trained seaman's brain. He discoursed in easy slang of the
cut-offs, the currents, the sludge-shallows, the floods, and the
other vagaries of the great river's course, and punctuated his
discourse with draughts of Rabeira's wine, and comments on the
tangled mass of black humanity under the forecastle-head
awning.</p>
<p>"There's something wrong with those passenger boys," he kept on
repeating. And another time: "Guess those niggers yonder are half
mad with funk about something."</p>
<p>But Rabeira was always quick to reassure him. "Now dey lib for
Congo, dey not like the idea of soldier-palaver. Dere was nothing
more the matter with them but leetle sickness."</p>
<p>"Oh! it's recruits for the State Army you're bringing, is it?"
asked Kettle.</p>
<p>"If you please," said Rabeira cheerfully. "Slaves is what you
English would call dem. Laborers is what dey call demselves."</p>
<p>Nilssen looked anxiously at his new assistant. Would he have any
foolish English sentiment against slavery, and make a fuss?
Nilssen, being a man of peace, sincerely hoped not. But as it was,
Captain Kettle preserved a grim silence. He had met the low-caste
African negro before, and knew that it required a certain amount of
coercion to extract work from him. But he did notice that all the
Portuguese on board were armed like pirates, and were constantly on
the <i>qui vive</i>, and judged that there was a species of
coercion on this vessel which would stick at very little.</p>
<p>The reaches of the great beer-colored river opened out before
them one after another in endless vistas, and at rare places the
white roofs of a factory showed amongst the unwholesome tropical
greenery of the banks. Nilssen gave names to these, spoke of their
inhabitants as friends, and told of the amount of trade in palm-oil
and kernels which each could be depended on to yield up as cargo to
the ever-greedy steamers. But the attention of neither of the
pilots was concentrated on piloting. The unrest on the
forecastle-head was too obvious to be overlooked.</p>
<p>Once, when the cackle of negro voices seemed to point to an
immediate outbreak, Rabeira gave an order, and presently a couple
of cubical green boxes were taken forward by the ship's Krooboys,
broken up, and the square bottles which they contained, distributed
to greedy fingers.</p>
<p>"Dashing 'em gin," said Nilssen, looking serious. "Guess a
Portugee's in a bad funk before he dashes gin at four francs a
dozen to common passenger boys. I've a blame' good mind to put this
vessel on the ground--by accident--and go off in the gig for
assistance, and bring back a State launch."</p>
<p>"Better not risk your ticket," said Kettle. "If there's a row,
I'm a bit useful in handling that sort of cattle myself."</p>
<p>Nilssen eyed wistfully a swirl of the yellow water which hid a
sandbar, and, with a sigh, gave the quartermaster a course which
cleared it. "Guess I don't like ructions myself," he said. "Hullo,
what's up now? There are two of the passenger boys getting pushed
off the forecastle-head by their own friends on to the main
deck."</p>
<p>"They look a mighty sick couple," said Kettle, "and their
friends seem very frightened. If this ship doesn't carry a doctor,
it would be a good thing if the old man were to start in and deal
out some drugs."</p>
<p>It seemed that Rabeira was of the same opinion. He went down to
the main deck, and there, under the scorching tropical sunshine,
interviewed the two sick negroes in person, and afterwards
administered to each of them a draught from a blue glass bottle.
Then he came up, smiling and hospitable and perspiring, on to the
bridge, and invited the pilots to go below and dine. "Chop lib for
cabin," said he; "palm-oil chop, plenty-too-much-good. You lib for
below and chop. I take dem ship myself up dis next reach."</p>
<p>"Well, it is plain, deep water," said Nilssen, "and I guess you
sabbey how to keep in the middle as well as I do. Come along,
Kettle."</p>
<p>The pair of them went below to the baking cabin and dined off a
savory orange-colored stew, and washed it down with fiery red wine,
and dodged the swarming, crawling cockroaches. The noise of angry
negro voices came to them between whiles through the hot air, like
the distant chatter of apes.</p>
<p>The Dane was obviously ill at ease and frightened; the
Englishman, though feeling a contempt for his companion, was very
much on the alert himself, and prepared for emergencies. There was
that mysterious something in the atmosphere which would have bidden
the dullest of mortals prepare for danger.</p>
<p>Up they came on deck again, and on to the bridge. Rabeira
himself was there in charge, dark, smiling, affable as ever.</p>
<p>Nilssen looked sharply down at the main deck below. "Hullo,"
said he, "those two niggers gone already? You haven't shifted them
down below, I suppose?"</p>
<p>The Portuguese Captain shrugged his shoulders. "No," he said,
"it was bad sickness, an' dey died an' gone over the side. I lose
by their passage. I lose also the two fire-bar which I give for
funeral palaver. Ver' disappointing."</p>
<p>"Sudden kind of sickness," said Nilssen.</p>
<p>"Dis sickness is. It make a man lib for die in one minute, clock
time. But it don' matter to you pilot, does it? You lib for
below--off duty--dis las' half hour. You see nothing, you sabby
nothing. I don'-want no trouble at Boma with doctor palaver. I make
it all right for you after. Sabby?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I tumble to what you're driving at, but I was just thinking
out how it works. However, you're captain of this ship, and if you
choose not to log down a couple of deaths, I suppose it's your
palaver. Anyway, I don't want to cause no ill-will, and if you
think it's worth a dash, I don't see why I shouldn't earn it. It's
little enough we pick up else in this service, and I've got a wife
at home in Liverpool who has to be thought about."</p>
<p>Kettle drew a deep breath. "It seems to me," he said, looking
very hard at the Portuguese, "that those men died a bit too sudden.
Are you sure they were <i>pukka</i> dead when you put them over the
side?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said Rabeira smilingly, "an' dey made no objection.
It was best dey should go over quick. Bodies do not keep in this
heat. An' pilot, I do you square-a, same as with Nilssen. You shall
have your dash when doctor-palaver set."</p>
<p>"No," said Kettle, "you may keep it in your own trousers,
Captain. Money that you've fingered, is a bit too dirty for me to
touch."</p>
<p>"All right," said Rabeira with a genial shrug, "so much cheaper
for me. But do not talk on the beach, dere's good boy, or you make
trouble-palaver for me."</p>
<p>"I'll shut my head if you stop at this," said Kettle, "but if
you murder any more of those poor devils, I'll see you sent to join
them, if there's enough law in this State to rig a gallows."</p>
<p>The Portuguese did not get angry. On the contrary, he seemed
rather pleased at getting what he wanted without having to bribe
for it, and ordered up fresh glasses and another bottle of wine for
the pilots' delectation. But this remained untouched. Kettle would
not drink himself, and Nilssen (who wished to be at peace with both
sides) did not wish to under the circumstances.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the Dane was beginning to get rather scared
of his grim-visaged little companion; and so, to prevent further
recurrence to unpleasant topics, he plunged once more into the
detail of professional matters. Here was a grassy swamp that was a
deep water channel the year before last; there was a fair-way in
the process of silting up; there was a mud-bar with twenty-four
feet, but steamers drawing twenty-seven feet could scrape over, as
the mud was soft. The current round that bend raced at a good
eleven knots. That bank below the palm clump was where an Italian
pilot stuck the <i>M'poso</i> for a month, and got sent to upper
Congo (where he was eaten by some rebellious troops) as a
recompense for his blunder.</p>
<p>Almost every curve of the river was remembered by its tragedy,
and had they only known it, the steamer which carried them for
their observation had hatching within her the germs of a very
worthy addition to the series.</p>
<p>More trouble cackled out from the forecastle-head, and more of
the green gin cases were handed up to quell it. The angry cries
gradually changed to empty boisterous laughter, as the raw potato
spirit soaked home; and the sullen, snarling faces melted into
grotesque, laughing masks; but withal the carnival was somewhat
grisly.</p>
<p>It was clear that more than one was writhing with the pangs of
sickness. It was clear also that none of these (having in mind the
physicking and fate of their predecessors) dared give way, but with
a miserable gaiety danced, and drank, and guffawed with the best.
Two, squatting on the deck, played <i>tom-tom</i> on upturned tin
pans; another jingled two pieces of rusty iron as accompaniment;
and all who in that crowded space could find foot room, danced
<i>shuff-shuff-shuffle</i> with absurd and aimless gestures.</p>
<p>The fort at Chingka drew in sight, with a B. and A. boat landing
concrete bags at the end of its wharf; and on beyond, the sparse
roofs of the capital of the Free State blistered and buckled under
the sun. The steamer, with hooting siren, ran up her gaudy ensign,
and came to an anchor in the stream twenty fathoms off the State
wharf. A yellow-faced Belgian, with white sun helmet and white
umbrella, presently came off in the doctor's boat, and announced
himself as the health officer of the port, and put the usual
questions.</p>
<p>Rabeira lied pleasantly and glibly. Sickness he owned to, but
when on the word the doctor hurriedly made his boat-boys pull
clear, he laughed and assured him that the sickness was nothing
more than a little fever, such as any one might suffer from in the
morning, and be out, cured, and making merry again before
nightfall.</p>
<p>That kind of fever is known in the Congo, and the doctor was
reassured, and bade his boat-boys pull up again. Yet because of the
evil liver within him, his temper was short, and his questioning
acid. But Captain Rabeira was stiff and unruffled and wily as ever,
and handed in his papers and answered questions, and swore to
anything that was asked, as though care and he were divorced
forever.</p>
<p>Kettle watched the scene with a drawn, moist face. He did not
know what to do for the best. It seemed to him quite certain that
this oily, smiling scoundrel, whom he had more than half suspected
of a particularly callous and brutal double murder, would be given
<i>pratique</i> for his ship, and be able to make his profits
unrestrained. The shipmaster's <i>esprit de corps</i> prevented him
from interfering personally, but he very much desired that the
heavens would fall--somehow or other--so that justice might be
done.</p>
<p>A <i>dens ex machina</i> came to fill his wishes. The barter of
words and the conning of documents had gone on; the doctor's doubts
were on the point of being lulled for good; and in a matter of
another ten seconds <i>pratique</i> would have been given. But from
the forecastle-head there came a yell, a chatter of barbaric
voices, a scuffle and a scream; a gray-black figure mounted the
rail, and poised there a moment, an offence to the sunlight, and
then, falling convulsively downwards, hit the yellow water with a
smack and a spatter of spray, and sank from sight.</p>
<p>A couple of seconds later the creature reappeared, swimming
frenziedly, as a dog swims, and by a swirl of the current (before
anybody quite knew what was happening) was swept down against the
doctor's boat, and gripped ten bony fingers upon the gunwhale and
lifted towards her people a face and shoulders eloquent of a
horrible disorder.</p>
<p>Instantly there was an alarm, and a sudden panic. "<i>Sacre nom
d'un pipe</i>," rapped out the Belgian doctor;
"<i>variole!</i>"</p>
<p>"Small-pox lib," whimpered his boat-boys, and before their
master could interfere, beat at the delirious wretch with their
oars. He hung on tenaciously, enduring a perfect avalanche of
blows. But mere flesh and bone had to wither under that onslaught,
and at last, by sheer weight of battering, he was driven from his
hold, and the beer-colored river covered him then and for
always.</p>
<p>After that, there was no further doubt of the next move. The
yellow-faced doctor sank back exhausted in the stern sheets of the
gig, and gave out sentence in gasps. The ship was declared unclean
until further notice; she was ordered to take up a berth a mile
away against the opposite bank of the river till she was cleared of
infection; she was commanded to proceed there at once, to anchor,
and then to blow off all her steam.</p>
<p>The doctor's tortured liver prompted him, and he spoke with
spite. He called Rabeira every vile name which came to his mind,
and wound up his harangue by rowing off to Chingka to make sure
that the guns of the fort should back up his commands.</p>
<p>The Portuguese captain was daunted then; there is no doubt about
that. He had known of this outbreak of small-pox for two days, had
stifled his qualms, and had taken his own peculiar methods of
keeping the disease hidden, and securing money profit for his ship.
He had even gone so far as to carry a smile on his dark, oily face,
and a jest on his tongue. But this prospect of being shut up with
the disorder till it had run its course inside the walls of the
ship, and no more victims were to be claimed, was too much for his
nerve. He fled like some frightened animal to his room, and
deliberately set about guzzling a surfeit of neat spirit.</p>
<p>Nilssen, from the bridge, fearful for his credit with the State,
his employer, roared out orders, but nobody attended to them.
Mates, quartermasters, Krooboys, had all gone aft so as to be as
far as possible from the smitten area; and in the end it was Kettle
who went to the forecastle-head, and with his own hands let steam
into the windlass and got the anchor. He stayed at his place. An
engineer and fireman were still below, and when Nilssen telegraphed
down, they put her under weigh again, and the older pilot with his
own hands steered her across to the quarantine berth. Then Kettle
let go the anchor again, paid out and stoppered the cable, and once
more came aft; and from that moment the new <i>regime</i> of the
steamer may be said to have commenced.</p>
<p>In primitive communities, from time immemorial, the strongest
man has become chieftain through sheer natural selection. Societies
which have been upheaved to their roots by anarchy, panic, or any
of these more perfervid emotions, revert to the primitive state. On
this Portuguese ship, authority was smashed into the smallest
atoms, and every man became a savage and was in danger at the hands
of his fellow savage.</p>
<p>Rabeira had drunk himself into a stupor before the boilers had
roared themselves empty through the escapes. The two mates and the
engineers cowered in their rooms as though the doors were a barrier
against the small-pox germs. The Krooboys broached cargo and
strewed the decks with their half-naked bodies, drunk on gin, amid
a litter of smashed green cases.</p>
<p>Meals ceased. The Portuguese cook and steward dropped their
collective duties from the first alarm; the Kroo cook left the rice
steamer because "steam no more lib"; and any one who felt hunger or
thirst on board, foraged for himself, or went without satisfying
his wants. Nobody helped the sick, or chided the drunken. Each man
lived for himself alone--or died, as the mood seized him.</p>
<p>Nilssen took up his quarters at one end of the bridge,
frightened, but apathetic. With awnings he made himself a little
canvas house, airy, but sufficient to keep off the dews of night.
When he spoke, it was usually to picture the desolation of one or
other of the Mrs. Nilssens on finding herself a widow. As he said
himself, he was a man of very domesticated notions. He had no
sympathy with Kettle's constantly repeated theory that discipline
ought to be restored.</p>
<p>"Guess it's the captain's palaver," he would say. "If the old
man likes his ship turned into a bear garden, 'tisn't our grub
they're wasting, or our cargo they've started in to broach. Anyway,
what can we do? You and I are only on board here as pilots. I wish
the ship was in somewhere hotter than Africa, before I'd ever seen
her."</p>
<p>"So do I," said Kettle. "But being here, it makes me ill to see
the way she's allowed to rot, and those poor beasts of niggers are
left to die just as they please. Four more of them have either
jumped overboard, or been put there by their friends. The dirt of
the place is awful. They're spreading small-pox poison all over the
ship. Nothing is ever cleaned."</p>
<p>"There's dysentery started, too."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Kettle, "then that settles it. We shall have
cholera next, if we let dirt breed any more. I'm going to start in
and make things ship-shape again."</p>
<p>"For why?"</p>
<p>"We'll say I'm frightened of them as they are at present, if you
like. Will you chip in and bear a hand? You're frightened,
too."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm that, and no error about it. But you don't catch me
interfering. I'm content to sit here and take my risks as they
come, because I can't help myself. But I go no further. If you
start knocking about this ship's company they'll complain ashore,
and then where'll you be? The Congo Free State don't like pilots
who do more than they're paid for."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Kettle, "I'll start in and take my risks, and
you can look on and umpire." He walked deliberately down off the
bridge, went to where the mate was dozing against a skylight on the
quarter deck, and stirred him into wakefulness with his foot.</p>
<p>"Well?" said the man.</p>
<p>"Turn the hands to, and clean ship."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"You hear me."</p>
<p>The mate inquired, with abundant verbal garnishings, by what
right Kettle gave the order.</p>
<p>"Because I'm a better man than you. Because I'm best man on
board. Do you want proof?"</p>
<p>Apparently the mate did. He whipped out a knife, but found it
suddenly knocked out of his hand, and sent skimming like a silver
flying fish far over the gleaming river. He followed up the attack
with an assault from both hands and feet, but soon discovered that
he had to deal with an artist. He gathered himself up at the end of
half a minute's interview, glared from two half-shut eyes, wiped
the blood from his mouth, and inquired what Kettle wanted.</p>
<p>"You heard my order. Carry it out."</p>
<p>The man nodded, and went away sullenly muttering that his time
would come.</p>
<p>"If you borrow another knife," said Kettle cheerfully, "and try
any more of your games, I'll shoot you like a crow, and thank you
for the chance. You'll go forrard and clean the forecastle-head and
the fore main deck. Be gentle with those sick! Second Mate?"</p>
<p>"Si, Se&ntilde;or."</p>
<p>"Get a crew together and clean her up aft here. Do you want any
rousing along?"</p>
<p>Apparently the second mate did not. He had seen enough of
Captain Kettle's method already to quite appreciate its efficacy.
The Krooboys, with the custom of servitude strong on them, soon
fell-to when once they were started. The thump of holy-stones went
up into the baking air, and grimy water began to dribble from the
scuppers.</p>
<p>With the chief engineer Kettle had another scuffle. But he, too,
was eased of the knife at the back of his belt, thumped into
submissiveness, and sent with firemen and trimmers to wash paint in
the stewy engine-room below, and clean up the rusted iron work. And
then those of the passenger boys who were not sick, were turned-to
also.</p>
<p>With Captain Rabeira, Kettle did not interfere. The man stayed
in his own room for the present, undisturbed and undisturbing. But
the rest of the ship's complement were kept steadily to their
employment.</p>
<p>They did not like it, but they thought it best to submit. Away
back from time unnumbered, the African peoples have known only fear
as the governing power, and, from long acclimatization, the
Portuguese might almost count as African. This man of a superior
race came and set himself up in authority over them, in defiance of
all precedent, law, everything; and they submitted with dull
indifference. The sweets of freedom are not always appreciated by
those who have known the easy luxury of being slaves.</p>
<p>The plague was visibly stayed from almost the very first day
that Kettle took over charge. The sick recovered or died; the sound
sickened no more; it seemed as though the disease microbes on board
the ship were glutted.</p>
<p>A mile away, at the other side of the beer-colored river, the
rare houses of Boma sprawled amongst the low burnt-up hills, and
every day the doctor with his bad liver came across in his boat
under the blinding sunshine to within shouting distance, and put a
few weary questions. The formalities were slack enough. Nilssen
usually made the necessary replies (as he liked to keep himself in
the doctor's good books), and then the boat would row away.</p>
<p>Nilssen still remained gently non-interferent. He was paid to be
a pilot by the &Eacute;tat Ind&eacute;pendant du Congo--so he
said--and he was not going to risk a chance of trouble, and no
possibility of profit, by meddling with matters beyond his own
sphere. Especially did he decline to be co-sharer in Kettle's
scheme for dealing out justice to Captain Rabeira.</p>
<p>"It is not your palaver," he said, "or mine. If you want to stir
up trouble, tell the State authorities when you get ashore. That
won't do much good either. They don't value niggers at much out
here."</p>
<p>"Nor do I," said Kettle. "There's nothing foolish with me about
niggers. But there's a limit to everything, and this snuff-colored
Dago goes too far. He's got to be squared with, and I'm going to do
it."</p>
<p>"Guess it's your palaver. I've told you what the risks are."</p>
<p>"And I'm going to take them," said Kettle grimly. "You may watch
me handle the risks now with your own eyes, if you wish."</p>
<p>He went down off the bridge, walked along the clean decks, and
came to where a poor wretch lay in the last stage of small-pox
collapse. He examined the man carefully. "My friend," he said at
last, "you've not got long for this world, anyway, and I want to
borrow your last moments. I suppose you won't like to shift, but
it's in a good cause, and anyway you can't object."</p>
<p>He stooped and lifted the loathsome bundle in his arms, and
then, in spite of a cry of expostulation from Nilssen, walked off
with his burden to Rabeira's room.</p>
<p>The Portuguese captain was in his bunk, trying to sleep. He was
sober for the first time for many days, and, in consequence,
feeling not a little ill.</p>
<p>Kettle deposited his charge with carefulness on the littered
settee, and Rabeira started up with a wild scream of fright and a
babble of oaths. Kettle shut and locked the door.</p>
<p>"Now look here," he said, "you've earned more than you'll ever
get paid in this life, and there's a tolerably heavy bill against
you for the next. It looks to me as if it would be a good thing if
you went off there to settle up the account right now. But I'm not
going to take upon myself to be your hangman. I'm just going to
give you a chance of pegging out, and I sincerely hope you'll take
it. I've brought our friend here to be your room mate for the
evening. It's just about nightfall now, and you've got to stay with
him till daybreak."</p>
<p>"You coward!" hissed the man. "You coward! You coward!" he
screamed.</p>
<p>"Think so?" said Kettle gravely. "Then if that's your idea, I'll
stay here in the room, too, and take my risks. God's seen the game,
and I'll guess He'll hand over the beans fairly."</p>
<p>Perspiration stood in beads on all their faces. The room, the
one unclean room of the ship, was full of breathless heat, and
stale with the lees of drink. Kettle, in his spruce-white drill
clothes, stood out against the squalor and the disorder, as a
mirror might upon a coal-heap.</p>
<p>The Portuguese captain, with nerves smashed by his spell of
debauch, played a score of parts. First he was aggressive,
asserting his rights as a man and the ship's master, and demanding
the key of the door. Then he was warlike, till his frenzied attack
earned him such a hiding that he was glad enough to crawl back on
to the mattress of his bunk. Then he was beseeching. And then he
began to be troubled with zoological hauntings, which occupied him
till the baking air cooled with the approach of the dawn.</p>
<p>The smitten negro on the settee gave now and then a moan, but
for the most part did his dying with quietness. Had Kettle
deliberately worked for that purpose, he could not have done
anything more calculated to make the poor wretch's last moments
happy.</p>
<p>"Oh, Massa!" he kept on whispering, "too-much-fine room. You
plenty-much good for let me lib for die heah." And then he would
relapse into barbaric chatterings more native to his taste, and
fitting to his condition.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle played his parts as nurse and warder with grave
attention. He sat perspiring in his shirt sleeves, writing at the
table whenever for a moment or two he had a spell of rest; and his
screed grew rapidly. He was making verse, and it was under the
stress of severe circumstances like these that his Muse served him
best.</p>
<p>The fetid air of the room throbbed with heat; the glow from the
candle lamp was a mere yellow flicker; and the Portuguese, who
cowered with twitching fingers in the bunk, was quite ready to
murder him at the slightest opening: it was not a combination of
circumstances which would have inspired many men.</p>
<p>Morning came, with a shiver and a chill, and with the first
flicker of dawn, the last spark of the negro's life went out.
Kettle nodded to the ghastly face as though it had been an old
friend. "You seemed to like being made use of," he said. "Well,
daddy, I hope you have served your turn. If your skipper hasn't got
the plague in his system now, I shall think God's forgotten this
bit of Africa entirely."</p>
<p>He stood up, gathered his papers, slung the spruce white drill
coat over his arm, and unlocked the door. "Captain Rabeira," he
said, "you have my full permission to resume your occupation of
going to the deuce your own way." With which parting salutation, he
went below to the steamer's bathroom and took his morning tub.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed before he came to the deck again, and
Nilssen met him at the head of the companion-way with a queer look
on his face. "Well," he said, "you've done it."</p>
<p>"Done what?"</p>
<p>"Scared Rabeira over the side."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"He came scampering on deck just now, yelling blue murder, and
trying to catch crawly things that weren't there. Guess he'd got
jim-jams bad. Then he took it into his head that a swim would be
useful, and before any one could stop him, he was over the
side."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"He's over the side still," said the Dane drily. "He didn't come
to the surface. Guess a crocodile chopped him."</p>
<p>"There are plenty round."</p>
<p>"Naturally. We've been ground baiting pretty liberally these
last few weeks. Well, I guess we are about through with the
business now. Not nervous about yourself, eh?"</p>
<p>"No," said Kettle, and touched his cap. "God's been looking on
at this gamble, as I told Rabeira last night, and He dealt over the
beans the way they were earned."</p>
<p>"That's all right," said Nilssen cheerfully. "When a man keeps
his courage he don't get small-pox, you bet."</p>
<p>"Well," said Kettle, "I suppose we'll be fumigated and get a
clean bill in about ten days from now, and I'm sure I don't mind
the bit of extra rest. I've got a lot of stuff I want to write up.
It's come in my head lately, and I've had no time to get it down on
paper. I shouldn't wonder but what it makes a real stir some day
when it's printed; it's real good stuff. I wonder if that
yellow-faced Belgian doctor will live to give us
<i>pratique</i>?"</p>
<p>"I never saw a man with such a liver on him."</p>
<p>"D'you know," said Kettle, "I'd like that doctor to hang on just
for another ten days and sign our bill. He's a surly brute, but
I've got to have quite a liking for him. He seems to have grown to
be part of the show, just like the crows, and the sun, and the
marigold smell, and the crocodiles."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Nilssen, "you're a blooming poet. Come, have a
cocktail before we chop."</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE LITTLE WOODEN GOD WITH THE EYES.</h3>
<br>
<p>The colored Mrs. Nilssen, of Banana, gave the pink gin cocktails
a final brisk up with the swizzle-stick, poured them out with
accurate division, and handed the tray to Captain Kettle and her
husband. The men drank off the appetizer and put down the glasses.
Kettle nodded a word of praise for the mixture and thanks to its
concoctor, and Mrs. Nilssen gave a flash of white teeth, and then
shuffled away off the veranda, and vanished within the bamboo walls
of the pilotage.</p>
<p>Nilssen sank back into his long-sleeved Madeira chair, a perfect
wreck of a man, and Kettle sat up and looked at him with a serious
face. "Look here," he said, "you should go home, or at any rate run
North for a spell in Grand Canary. If you fool with this
health-palaver any longer, you'll peg out."</p>
<p>The Dane stared wistfully out across the blue South Atlantic
waters, which twinkled beyond the littered garden and the sand
beach. "Yes," he said, "I'd like well enough to go back to my old
woman in Boston again, and eat pork and beans, and hear her talk of
culture, and the use of missionaries, and all that good old homey
rot; but I guess I can't do that yet. I've got to shake this
sickness off me right here, first."</p>
<p>"And I tell you you'll never be a sound man again so long as you
lib for Congo. Take a trip home, Captain, and let the salt air blow
the diseases out of you."</p>
<p>"If I go to sea," said the pilot wearily, "I shall be stitched
up within the week, and dropped over to make a hole in the water. I
don't know whether I'm going to get well anywhere, but if I do,
it's right here. Now just hear me. You're the only living soul in
this blasted Congo Free State that I can trust worth a cent, and I
believe you've got grit enough to get me cured if only you'll take
the trouble to do it. I'm too weak to take on the job myself; and,
even if I was sound, I reckon it would be beyond my weight. I tell
you it's a mighty big contract. But then, as I've seen for myself,
you're a man that likes a scuffle."</p>
<p>"You're speaking above my head. Pull yourself together, Captain,
and then, perhaps, I'll understand what you want."</p>
<p>Nilssen drew the quinine bottle toward him, tapped out a little
hill of feathery white powder into a cigarette paper, rolled it up,
and swallowed the dose. "I'm not raving," he said, "or anywhere
near it; but if you want the cold-drawn truth, listen here: I'm
poisoned. I've got fever on me, too, I'll grant, but that's nothing
more than a fellow has every week or so in the ordinary way of
business. I guess with quinine, whiskey, and pills, I can smile at
any fever in Africa, and have done this last eight years. But it's
this poison that gets me."</p>
<p>"Bosh," said Kettle. "If it was me that talked about getting
poisoned, there'd be some sense in it. I know I'm not popular here.
But you're a man that's liked. You hit it off with these Belgian
brutes, and you make the niggers laugh. Who wants to poison
you?"</p>
<p>"All right," said Nilssen; "you've been piloting on the Congo
some six months now, and so of course you know all about it. But
let me know a bit better. I've watched the tricks of the niggers
here-away for a good many years now, and I've got a big respect for
their powers when they mean mischief."</p>
<p>"Have you been getting their backs up, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You've seen that big ju-ju in my room?"</p>
<p>"That foul-looking wooden god with the looking-glass eyes?"</p>
<p>"Just that. I don't know where the preciousness comes in, but
it's a thing of great value."</p>
<p>"How did you get hold of it?"</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose if you want to be told flatly, I scoffed it.
You see, it was in charge of a passenger boy, who brought it aboard
the <i>M'poso</i> at Matadi. He landed across by canoe from Vivi,
and wanted steamer passage down to Boma by the <i>M'poso</i>. I was
piloting her, and I got my eye on that ju-ju<a name=
"FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a> from the very first.
Captain Image and that thief of a purser Balgarnie were after it,
too, but as it was a bit of a race between us as to who should get
it first, one couldn't wait to be too particular."</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a> A
ju-ju in West African parlance may be a large carved idol, or
merely a piece of rag, or skin, or anything else that the native is
pleased to set up as a charm. Ju-ju also means witchcraft. If you
poison a man, you put ju-ju on him. If you see anything you do not
understand, you promptly set it down as ju-ju. Similarly chop is
food, and also the act of feeding. "One-time" is
immediately.</blockquote>
<p>"What did you want it for? Did you know it was valuable
then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no! I thought it was merely a whitewashed carved wood god,
and I wanted it just to dash to some steamer skipper who had dashed
me a case of fizz or something. You know?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I see. Go on. How did you get hold of it?"</p>
<p>"Why, just went and tackled the passenger-boy and dashed him a
case of gin; and when he sobered up again, where was the ju-ju? I
got it ashore right enough to the pilotage here in Banana, and for
the next two weeks thought it was my ju-ju without further
palaver.</p>
<p>"Then up comes a nigger to explain. The passenger-boy who had
guzzled the gin was no end of a big duke--witch-doctor, and all
that, with a record of about three hundred murders to his
tally--and he had the cheek to send a blooming ambassador to say
things, and threaten, to try and get the ju-ju back. Of course, if
the original sportsman had come himself to make his ugly remarks,
I'd soon have stopped his fun. That's the best of the Congo Free
State. If a nigger down here is awkward, you can always get him
shipped off as a slave--soldier, that is--to the upper river, and
take darned good care he never comes back again. And, as a point of
fact, I did tip a word to the commandant here and get that
particular ambassador packed off out of harm's way. But that did no
special good. Before a week was through up came another chap to
tackle me. He spoke flatly about pains and penalties if I didn't
give the thing up; and he offered money--or rather ivory, two fine
tusks of it, worth a matter of twenty pounds, as a ransom--and then
I began to open my eyes."</p>
<p>"Twenty pounds for that ju-ju! Why, I've picked up many a one
better carved for a shilling."</p>
<p>"Well, this bally thing has value; there's no doubt about that.
But where the value comes in, I can't make out. I've overhauled it
times and again, but can't see it's anything beyond the ordinary.
However, if a nigger of his own free will offered two big tusks to
get the thing back, it stands to reason it's worth a precious sight
more than that. So when the second ambassador came, I put the price
down at a quarter of a ton of ivory, and waited to get it."</p>
<p>Kettle whistled. "You know how to put on the value," he said.
"That's getting on for &pound;400 with ivory at its present
rates."</p>
<p>"I was badly in want of money when I set the figure. My poor
little wife in Bradford had sent me a letter by the last Antwerp
mail saying how hard-up she was, and the way she wrote regularly
touched me."</p>
<p>"I don't like it," Kettle snapped.</p>
<p>"What, my being keen about the money?"</p>
<p>"No; your having such a deuce of a lot of wives."</p>
<p>"But I am so very domesticated," said Nilssen. "You don't
appreciate how domesticated I am. I can't live as a bachelor
anywhere. I always like to have a dear little wife and a nice
little home to go to in whatever town I may be quartered. But it's
a great expense to keep them all provided for. And besides, the law
of most countries is so narrow-minded. One has to be so
careful."</p>
<p>Kettle wished to state his views on bigamy with clearness and
point, but when he cast his eyes over the frail wreck of a man in
the Madeira chair, he forebore. It would not take very much of a
jar to send Captain Nilssen away from this world to the Place of
Reckoning which lay beyond. And so with a gulp he said instead:
"You're sure it's deliberate poisoning?"</p>
<p>"Quite. The nigger who came here last about the business
promised to set ju-ju on me, and I told him to do it and be hanged
to him. He was as good as his word. I began to be bad the very next
day."</p>
<p>"How's it managed?"</p>
<p>"Don't know. They have ways of doing these things in Africa
which we white men can't follow."</p>
<p>"Suspect any one?"</p>
<p>"No. And if you're hinting at Mrs. Nilssen in the pilotage
there, she's as staunch as you are, bless her dusky skin. Besides,
what little chop I've managed to swallow since I've been bad, I've
always got out of fresh unopened tins myself."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Kettle; "I fancied some one had been mixing up finely
powdered glass in your chop. It's an old trick, and you don't twig
it till the doctors cut you up after you're dead."</p>
<p>"As if I wasn't up to a kid's game like that!" said the sick man
with feeble contempt. "No, this is regular ju-ju work, and it's
beyond the Belgian doctor here, and it's beyond all other white
men. There's only one cure, and that's to be got at the place where
the poisoning palaver was worked from."</p>
<p>"And where's that?"</p>
<p>Captain Nilssen nodded down the narrow slip of sand, and
mangroves, and nut palms, on which the settlement of Banana is
built, and gazed with his sunken eyes at the smooth, green slopes
of Africa beyond. "Dem village he lib for bush," he said.</p>
<p>"Up country village, eh? They're a nice lot in at the back
there, according to accounts. But can't you arrange it by your
friend the ambassador?"</p>
<p>"He's not the kind of fool to come back. He's man enough to know
he'd get pretty well dropped on if I could get him in my reach
again."</p>
<p>"Then tell the authorities here, and get some troops sent
up."</p>
<p>"What'd be the good of that? They might go, or they mightn't. If
they did, they'd do a lot of shooting, collect a lot of niggers'
ears, steal what there was to pick up, and then come back. But
would they get what I want out of the witch-doctor? Not much.
They'd never so much as see the beggar. He'd take far too big care
of his mangy hide. He wouldn't stop for fighting-palaver. He'd be
off for bush, one-time. No, Kettle, if I'm to get well, some white
man will have to go up by his lonesome for me, and square that
witch-doctor by some trick of the tongue."</p>
<p>"Which is another way of saying you want me to risk my skin to
get you your prescription?"</p>
<p>"But, my lad, I won't ask you to go for nothing. I don't suppose
you are out here on the Congo just for your health. You've said
you've got a wife at home, and I make no doubt you're as fond of
her and as eager to provide for her as I am for any of mine. Well
and good. Here's an offer. Get me cured, and I'll dash you the
ju-ju to make what you can out of it."</p>
<p>Kettle stretched out his fingers. "Right," he said. "We'll trade
on that." And the pair of them shook hands over the bargain.</p>
<p>It was obvious, if the thing was to be done at all, it must be
set about quickly. Nilssen was an utter wreck. Prolonged residence
in this pestilential Congo had sapped his constitution; the poison
was constantly eating at him; and he must either get relief in a
very short time, or give up the fight and die. So that same
afternoon saw Kettle journeying in a dug-out canoe over the
beer-colored waters of the river, up stream, toward the
witch-doctor's village.</p>
<p>Two savages (one of them suffering from a bad attack of yaws)
propelled the craft from her forward part in erratic zig-zags;
amidships sat Captain Kettle in a Madeira chair under a green-lined
white umbrella; and behind him squatted his personal attendant, a
Krooboy, bearing the fine old Coast name of Brass Pan. The crushed
marigold smell from the river closed them in, and the banks crept
by in slow procession.</p>
<p>The main channels of the Congo Kettle knew with a pilot's
knowledge; but the canoe-men soon left these, and crept off into
winding backwaters, with wire-rooted mangroves sprawling over the
mud on their banks, and strange whispering beast-noises coming from
behind the thickets of tropical greenery. The sun had slanted slow;
ceibas and silk-cotton woods threw a shade dark almost as twilight;
but the air was full of breathless heat, and Kettle's white drill
clothes hung upon him clammy and damp. Behind him, in the stern of
the canoe, Brass Pan scratched himself plaintively.</p>
<p>Dark fell and the dug-out was made fast to a mangrove root. The
Africans covered their heads to ward off ghosts, and snored on the
damp floor of the canoe. Kettle took quinine and dozed in the
Madeira chair. Mists closed round them, white with damp,
earthy-smelling with malaria. Then gleams of morning stole over the
trees and made the mists visible, and Kettle woke with a seaman's
promptitude. He roused Brass Pan, and Brass Pan roused the
canoe-men, and the voyage proceeded.</p>
<p>Through more silent waterways the clumsy dug-out made her
passage, where alligators basked on the mudbanks and sometimes swam
up from below and nuzzled the sides of the boat, and where velvety
black butterflies fluttered in dancing swarms across the shafts of
sunlight; and at last her nose was driven on to a bed of slime, and
Kettle was invited to "lib for beach."</p>
<p>Brass Pan stepped dutifully over the mud, and Captain Kettle
mounted his back and rode to dry ground without as much as
splashing the pipeclay on his dainty canvas shoes. A bush path
opened out ahead of them, winding, narrow, uneven, and the man with
the yaws went ahead and gave a lead.</p>
<p>As a result of exposure to the night mists of the river, Captain
Kettle had an attack of fever on him which made him shake with cold
and burn with heat alternately. His head was splitting, and his
skin felt as though it had been made originally to suit a small
boy, and had been stretched to near bursting-point to serve its
present wearer.</p>
<p>In the forest, the path was a mere tunnel amongst solid blocks
of wood and greenery; in the open beyond, it was a slim alley
between grass-blades eight feet high; and the only air which
nourished them as they marched was hot enough to scorch the lungs
as it was inhaled. And if in addition to all this, it be remembered
that the savages he was going to visit were practising cannibals,
were notoriously treacherous, were violently hostile to all whites
(on account of many cruelties bestowed by Belgians), and were
especially exasperated against the stealer of their idol, it will
be seen that from an ordinary point of view Captain Kettle's
mission was far from appetizing.</p>
<p>The little sailor, however, carried himself as jauntily as
though he were stepping out along a mere pleasure parade, and
hummed an air as he marched. In ordinary moments I think his nature
might be described as almost melancholy; it took times of stress
like these to thoroughly brighten him.</p>
<p>The path wound, as all native paths do wind, like some erratic
snake amongst the grasses, reaching its point with a vast disregard
for distance expended on the way. It led, with a scramble, down the
sides of ravines; it drew its followers up steep rock-faces that
were baked almost to cooking heat by the sun; and finally, it broke
up into fan-shape amongst decrepit banana groves, and presently
ended amongst a squalid collection of grass and wattle huts which
formed the village.</p>
<p>Dogs announced the arrival to the natives, and from out of the
houses bolted men, women, and children, who dived out of sight in
the surrounding patches of bush.</p>
<p>The man with the yaws explained: "Dem Belgians make war-palaver
often. People plenty much frightened. People think we lib for here
on war-palaver."</p>
<p>"Silly idiots!" said Captain Kettle. "Hullo, by James! here's a
white man coming out of that chimbeque!"</p>
<p>"He God-man. Lib for here on gin-palaver."</p>
<p>"Trading missionary, is he? Bad breed that. And the worst of it
is, if there's trouble, he'll hold up his cloth, and I can't hit
him." He advanced toward the white man, and touched his helmet.
"<i>Bon jour, Monsieur</i>."</p>
<p>"Howdy?" said the missionary. "I'm as English as yourself--or
rather Amurrican. Know you quite well by sight, Captain. Seen you
on the steamers when I was stationed at our headquarters in Boma.
What might you be up here for?"</p>
<p>"I've a bit of a job on hand for Captain Nilssen of Banana."</p>
<p>"Old Cappie Nilssen? Know him quite well. Married him to that
Bengala wife of his, the silly old fool. Well, captain, come right
into my chimbeque, and chop."</p>
<p>"I'll have some quinine with you, and a cocktail. Chop doesn't
tempt me just now. I've a dose of fever on hand."</p>
<p>"Got to expect that here, anyway," said the missionary. "I
haven't had fever for three days now, but I'm due for another dose
to-morrow afternoon. Fever's quite regular with me. It's a good
thing that, because I can fit in my business accordingly."</p>
<p>"I suppose the people at home think you carry the Glad Tidings
only?"</p>
<p>"The people at home are impracticable fools, and I guess when I
was 'way back in Boston I was no small piece of a fool too. I was
sent out here 'long with a lot more tenderfeet to plant beans for
our own support, and to spread the gospel for the glory of America.
Well, the other tenderfeet are planted, and I'm the only one that's
got any kick left. The beans wouldn't grow, and there was no sort
of living to be got out of spreading a gospel which nobody seemed
to want. So I had to start in and hoe a new row for myself."</p>
<p>"Set up as a trader, that is?"</p>
<p>"You bet. It's mostly grist that comes to me: palm-oil, rubber,
kernels, and ivory. Timber I haven't got the capital to tackle, and
I must say the ivory's more to figure about than finger. But I've
got the best connection of any trader in gin and guns and cloth in
this section, and in another year I'll have made enough of a pile
to go home, and I guess there are congregations in Boston that'll
just jump at having a returned Congo missionary as their
minister."</p>
<p>"I should draw the line at that, myself," said Kettle
stiffly.</p>
<p>"Dare say. You're a Britisher, and therefore you're a bit
narrow-minded. We're a vury adaptable nation, we Amurricans. Say,
though, you haven't told me what you're up here for yet? I guess
you haven't come just in search of health?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle reflected. His gorge rose at this man, but the
fellow seemed to have some sort of authority in the village, and
probably he could settle the question of Nilssen's ailment with a
dozen words. So he swallowed his personal resentment, and, as
civilly as he could, told the complete tale as Nilssen had given it
to him.</p>
<p>The trader missionary's face grew crafty as he listened. "Look
here, you want that old sinner Nilssen cured?"</p>
<p>"That's what I came here for."</p>
<p>"Well, then, give me the ju-ju, and I'll fix it up for you."</p>
<p>"The ju-ju's to be my fee," said Kettle. "I suppose you know
something about it? You're not the kind of man to go in for
collecting valueless curiosities."</p>
<p>"Nop. I'm here on the make, and I guess you're about the same.
But I wouldn't be in your shoes if the people in the village get to
know that you've a finger in looting their idol."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll die rather painfully, that's all. Better give the
thing up, Captain, and let me take over the contract for you. It's
a bit above your weight."</p>
<p>Kettle's face grew grim. "Is it?" he said. "Think I'm going to
back down for a tribe of nasty, stinking, man-eating niggers? Not
much."</p>
<p>"Well," said the missionary, "don't get ruffled. I've got no use
for quarrelling. Go your way, and if things turn out ugly don't say
I didn't give you the straight cinch, as one white man to another
in a savage country. And now, it's about my usual time for
siesta."</p>
<p>"Right," said Kettle. "I'll siesta too. My fever's gone now, and
I'm feeling pretty rocky and mean. Sleep's a grand pick-me-up."</p>
<p>They took off their coats, and lay down then under filmy
mosquito bars, and presently sleep came to them. Indeed, to Kettle
came so dead an unconsciousness that he afterward had a suspicion
(though it was beyond proof) that some drug had been mixed with his
drink. He was a man who at all times was extraordinarily watchful
and alert. Often and often during his professional life his bare
existence had depended on the faculty for scenting danger from
behind the curtain of sleep; and his senses in this direction were
so abnormally developed as to verge at times on the uncanny.
Cat-like is a poor-word to describe his powers of vigilance.</p>
<p>But there is no doubt that in this case his alertness was
dulled. The fatigue of the march, his dose of fever, his previous
night of wakefulness in the canoe, all combined to undermine his
guard; and, moreover, the attack of the savages was stealthy in the
extreme. Like ghosts, they must have crept back from the bush to
reconnoitre their village; like daylight ghosts, they must have
surrounded the trader missionary's hut and peered at the sleeping
man between the bamboos of the wall, and then made their entrance;
and it must have been with the quickness of wild beasts that they
made their spring.</p>
<p>Kettle woke on the instant that he was touched, and started to
struggle for his life, as indeed he had struggled many a time
before. But the numbers of the blacks put effective resistance out
of the question. Four of them pressed down each arm on to the bed,
four each leg, three pressed on his head. Their animal faces
champed and gibbered at him; the animal smell of them made him
splutter and cough.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle was not a man who often sought help from others;
he was used to playing a lone-handed fight against a mob; but the
suddenness of the attack, the loneliness of his surroundings, and
the dejection due to his recent dose of fever, for the first
instant almost unnerved him, and on the first alarm he sang out
lustily for the missionary's help. There was no answer. With a jerk
he turned his head, and saw that the other bed was empty. The man
had left the hut.</p>
<p>For a time the captive did not actively resist further. In a
climate like that of the Congo one's store of physical strength is
limited, and he did not wish to earn unnecessarily severe bonds by
wasting it. As it was, he was tied up cruelly enough with grass
rope, and then taken from the hut and flung down under the blazing
sunshine outside.</p>
<p>Presently a fantastic form danced up from behind one of the
huts, daubed with colored clays, figged out with a thousand tawdry
charms, and cinctured round the middle by a girdle of half-picked
bones. He wafted an evil odor before him as he advanced, and he
came up and stood with one foot on Kettle's breast in the attitude
of a conqueror.</p>
<p>This was the witch-doctor, a creature who held power of life and
death over all the village, whom the villagers suffered to test
them with poison, to put them to unnamable tortures, to rob them as
he pleased,--to be, in fact, a kind of insane autocrat working any
whim that seized him freely in their midst. The witch-doctor's
power of late had suffered. The white man Nilssen had "put bigger
ju-ju" on him, and under its influence had despoiled him of
valuable property. Now was his moment of counter triumph. The
witch-doctor stated that he brought this other white man to the
village by the power of his spells; and the villagers believed him.
There was the white man lying on the ground before them to prove
it.</p>
<p>Remained next to see what the witch-doctor would do with his
captive.</p>
<p>The man himself was evidently at a loss, and talked, and danced,
and screamed, and foamed, merely to gain time. He spoke nothing but
Fiote, and of that tongue Kettle knew barely a single word. But
presently the canoe-man with the yaws was dragged up, and, in his
own phrase, was bidden to act as "linguister."</p>
<p>"He say," translated the man with the yaws, "if dem big ju-ju
lib back for here, he let you go."</p>
<p>"And if not?"</p>
<br>
<a name="page040.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/page040.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>He came and stood with one foot on Kettle's breast in the
attitude of a conqueror.</b></p>
<br>
<p>The interpreter put a question, and the witch-doctor screamed
out a long reply, and then stooped and felt the captive over with
his fingers, as men feel cattle at a fair.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Kettle impatiently; "if he doesn't get back the
wooden god, let's hear what the game is next?"</p>
<p>"Me no sabbey. He say you too small and thin for chop."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle's pale cheeks flushed. Curiously enough it never
occurred to him to be grateful for this escape from a cannibal
dinner-table. But his smallness was a constant sore to him, and he
bitterly resented any allusion to it.</p>
<p>"Tell that stinking scarecrow I'll wring his neck for him before
I'm quit of this village."</p>
<p>"Me no fit," said the linguister candidly. "He kill me now if I
say that, same's he kill you soon."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's going to kill me, is he?"</p>
<p>The interpreter nodded emphatically. "Or get dem big ju-ju," he
added.</p>
<p>"Ask him how Cappie Nilssen can be cured."</p>
<p>The man with the yaws put the question timidly enough, and the
witch-doctor burst into a great guffaw of laughter. Then after a
preliminary dance, he took off a little packet of leopard skin,
which hung amongst his other charms, and stuffed it deep inside
Kettle's shirt.</p>
<p>The interpreter explained: "Him say he put ju-ju on Cappie
Nilssen, and can take it off all-e-same easy. Him say you give
Cappie Nilssen dis new ju-ju for chop, an' he live for well
one-time."</p>
<p>"He doesn't make much trouble about giving it me, anyway,"
Kettle commented. "Looks as if he felt pretty sure he'd get that
idol, or else take the change out of my skin." But, all the same,
when the question was put to him again as to whether he would
surrender the image, he flatly refused. There was a certain pride
about Kettle which forbade him to make concessionary treaties with
an inferior race.</p>
<p>So forthwith, having got this final refusal, the blacks took him
up again, and under the witch-doctor's lead carried him well beyond
the outskirts of the village. There was a cleared space here, and
on the bare, baked earth they laid him down under the full glare of
the tropical sunshine. For a minute or so they busied themselves
with driving four stout stakes into the ground, and then again they
took him up, and made him fast by wrists and ankles, spread-eagle
fashion, to the stakes.</p>
<p>At first he was free to turn his head, and with a chill of
horror he saw he was not the first to be stretched out in that
clearing. There were three other sets of stakes, and framed in each
was a human skeleton, picked clean. With a shiver he remembered
travellers' tales on the steamers of how these things were done.
But then the blacks put down other stakes so as to confine his head
in one position, and were proceeding to prop open his mouth with a
piece of wood, when suddenly there seemed to be a hitch in the
proceedings.</p>
<p>The witch-doctor asked for honey--Kettle recognized the native
word--and none was forthcoming. Without honey they could not go on,
and the captive knew why. One man was going off to fetch it, but
then news was brought that the Krooboy Brass Pan had been caught,
and the whole gang of them went off helter-skelter toward the
village--and again Kettle knew the reason for their haste.</p>
<p>So there he was left alone for the time being with his thoughts,
lashed up beyond all chance of escape, scorched by an intolerable
sun, bitten and gnawed by countless swarms of insects, without
chance of sweeping them away. But this was ease compared with what
was to follow. He knew the fate for which he was apportioned, a
common fate amongst the Congo cannibals. His jaws would be propped
open, a train of honey would be led from his mouth to a hill of
driver ants close by, and the savage insects would come up and eat
him piecemeal while he still lived.</p>
<p>He had seen driver ants attack a house before, swamp fires lit
in their path by sheer weight of numbers, put the inhabitants to
flight, and eat everything that remained. And here, in this
clearing, if he wanted further proof of their power, were the three
picked skeletons lying stretched out to their stakes.</p>
<p>There are not many men who could have preserved their reason
under monstrous circumstances such as these, and I take it that
there is no man living who dare up and say that he would not be
abominably frightened were he to find himself in such a plight. In
these papers I have endeavored to show Captain Owen Kettle as a
brave man, indeed the bravest I ever knew; but I do not think even
he would blame me if I said he was badly scared then.</p>
<p>He heard noises from the village which he could not see beyond
the grass. He heard poor Brass Pan's death-shriek; he heard all the
noises that followed, and knew their meaning, and knew that he was
earning a respite thereby; he even heard from over the low hills
the hoot of a steamer's siren as she did her business on the yellow
waters of the Congo, in crow flight perhaps not a good rifle-shot
from where he lay stretched.</p>
<p>It seemed like a fantastic dream to be assured in this way that
there were white men, civilized white men, men who could read books
and enjoy poetry, sitting about swearing and drinking cocktails
under a decent steamer's awnings close by this barbaric scene of
savagery. And yet it was no dream. The flies that crept into his
nose and his mouth and his eye-sockets, and bit him through his
clothing, and the hateful sounds from the village assured him of
all its reality.</p>
<p>The blazing day burnt itself to a close, and night came hard
upon its heels, still baking and breathless. The insects bit worse
than ever, and once or twice Kettle fancied he felt the jaws of a
driver ant in his flesh, and wondered if news would be carried to
the horde in the ant-hill, which would bring them out to devour
their prey without the train of honey being laid to lure them.
Moreover, fever had come on him again, and with one thing and
another it was only by a constant effort of will that he prevented
himself from giving way and raving aloud in delirium.</p>
<p>It was under these circumstances, then, that the missionary came
to him again, and once more put in a bid for the ju-ju which lay at
the pilotage. Kettle roundly accused the man of having betrayed
him, and the fellow did not deny it with any hope of being
believed. He had got to get his pile somehow, so he said: the ju-ju
had value, and if he could not get hold of it one way, he had to
work it another. And finally, would Kettle surrender it then, or
did he want any more discomfort.</p>
<p>Now I think it is not to the little sailor's discredit to
confess that he surrendered without terms forthwith. "The thing's
yours for when you like to fetch it," he snapped out ungraciously
enough, and the missionary at once stooped and cut the grass ropes,
and set to chafing his wrists and ankles. "And now," he said,
"clear out for your canoe at the river-side for all you're worth,
Captain. There's a big full moon, and you can't miss the way."</p>
<p>"Wait a bit," said Kettle. "I'm remembering that I had an errand
here. Can you give me the right physic to pull Captain Nilssen
round?"</p>
<p>"You have it in that leopard-skin parcel inside your shirt. I
saw the witch-doctor give it you."</p>
<p>"Oh! you were looking on, were you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"By James! I've a big mind to leave my marks on you, you
swine!"</p>
<p>The trader missionary whipped out a revolver. "Guess I'm heeled,
sonny. You'd better go slow. You'd--"</p>
<p>There was a rush, a dodge, a scuffle, a bullet whistling
harmlessly up into the purple night, and that revolver was Captain
Kettle's.</p>
<p>"The cartridges you have in your pocket."</p>
<p>"I've only three. Here they are, confound you! Now, what are you
going to do next? You've waked the village. You'll have them down
on you in another moment. Run, you fool, or they'll have you
yet."</p>
<p>"Will they?" said Kettle. "Well, if you want to know, I've got
poor old Brass Pan to square up for yet. I liked that boy." And
with that, he set off running down a path between the walls of
grasses.</p>
<p>A negro met him in the narrow cut, yelled with surprise, and
turned. He dropped a spear as he turned, and Kettle picked it up
and drove the blade between his shoulder-blades as he ran. Then on
through the village he raged like a man demented. With what weapons
he fought he never afterward remembered. He slew with whatever came
to his hand. The villagers, wakened up from their torpid sleep,
rushed from the grass and wattle houses on every hand. Kettle in
his Berserk rage charged them whenever they made a stand, till at
last all fled from him as though he were more than human.</p>
<p>Bodies lay upon the ground staring up at the moon; but there
were no living creatures left, though the little sailor, with bared
teeth and panting breath, stood there waiting for them. No; he had
cleared the place, and only one other piece of retribution lay in
his power. The embers of a great fire smouldered in the middle of
the clearing, and with a shudder (as he remembered its purpose) he
shovelled up great handfuls of the glowing charcoal and sowed it
broadcast on the dry grass roofs of the chimbeques. The little
crackling flames leaped up at once; they spread with the quickness
of a gunpowder train; and in less than a minute a great cataract of
fire was roaring high into the night.</p>
<p>Then, and not till then, did Captain Kettle think of his own
retreat. He put the three remaining cartridges into the empty
chambers of his revolver, and set off at a jog-trot down the
winding path by which he had come up from the river.</p>
<p>His head was throbbing then, and the stars and the grasses swam
before his eyes. The excitement of the fight had died away--the
ills of the place gripped every fibre of his body. Had the natives
ambushed him along the path, I do not think he could possibly have
avoided them. But those natives had had their lesson, and they did
not care to tamper with Kettle's <i>ju-ju</i> again. And so he was
allowed to go on undisturbed, and somehow or other he got down to
the river-bank and the canoe.</p>
<p>He did not do the land journey at any astonishing pace. Indeed,
it is a wonder he ever got over it at all. More than once he sank
down half unconscious in the path, and up all the steeper slopes he
had to crawl animal fashion on all-fours. But by daybreak he got to
the canoe, and pushed her off, and by a marvellous streak of luck
lost his way in the inner channels, and wandered out on to the
broad Congo beyond.</p>
<p>I say this was a streak of luck, because by this time
consciousness had entirely left him, and on the inner channels he
would merely have died, and been eaten by alligators, whereas, as
it was, he got picked up by a State launch, and taken down to the
pilotage at Banana.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Nilssen who tediously nursed him back to health.
Kettle had always been courteous to Mrs. Nilssen, even though she
was as black and polished as a patent leather boot; and Mrs.
Nilssen appreciated Captain Owen Kettle accordingly.</p>
<p>With Captain Nilssen, pilot of the lower Congo, Kettle had one
especially interesting talk during his convalescence. "You may as
well take that troublesome wooden god for yourself now," said
Nilssen. "But, if I were you, I'd ship it home out of harm's way by
the next steamer."</p>
<p>"Hasn't that missionary brute sent for it yet?"</p>
<p>Captain Nilssen evaded the question. "I'll never forget what
you've done for me, my lad. When you were brought in here after
they picked you up, you looked fit to peg out one-time, but the
only sane thing you could do was to waggle out a little
leopard-skin parcel, and bid me swallow the stuff that was inside.
You'd started out to get me that physic, and, by gum, you weren't
happy till I got it down my neck."</p>
<p>"Well, you look fit enough now."</p>
<p>"Never better."</p>
<p>"But about the missionary brute?"</p>
<p>"Well, my lad, I suppose you're well enough to be told now. He's
got his trading cut short for good. That nigger with the yaws who
paddled you up brought down the news. The beggars up there chopped
him, and I'm sure I hope he didn't give them indigestion."</p>
<p>"My holy James!"</p>
<p>"Solid. His missionary friends here have written home a letter
to Boston which would have done you good to see. According to them,
the man's a blessed martyr, nothing more or less. The gin and the
guns are left clean out of the tale; and will Boston please send
out some more subscriptions, one-time? You'll see they'll stick up
a stained-glass window to that joker in Boston, and he'll stand up
there with a halo round his head as big as a frying-pan. And, oh!
won't his friends out here be resigned to his loss when the
subscriptions begin to hop in from over the water."</p>
<p>"Well, there's been a lot of trouble over a trumpery wooden
idol. I fancy we'd better burn it out of harm's way."</p>
<p>"Not much," said Nilssen with a sigh. "I've found out where the
value comes in, and as you've earned them fairly and squarely, the
dividends are yours to stick to. One of those looking-glass eyes
was loose, and I picked it out. There was a bit of green glass
behind. I picked out the other eye, and there was a bit of green
glass at the back of that too."</p>
<p>"Oh, the niggers'll use anything for ju-ju."</p>
<p>"Wait a bit. I'd got my notions as to what that green glass was,
and so I toted them in my pocket up and down the river and asked
every man who was likely to know a jewel what he thought. They
aren't green glass at all. They're emeralds. They're come from the
Lord knows where, but that doesn't matter. They're worth fifty
pounds apiece at the very lowest, and they're yours, my lad, to do
what you like with."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle lay back on his pillow and smiled complacently.
"That money'll just set up my Missis nicely in a lodging-house. Now
I can go on with my work here, and know that whatever happens she
and the kids are provided for."</p>
<p>"Eh, well," said Nilssen with a sigh, "she'll be nicely fixed up
now. I wish I could make provision like that for my old women."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A QUICK WAY WITH REBELS.</h3>
<br>
<p>Another bullet came silently up out of the distance, and the
nigger second engineer of the launch gave a queer little whimper
and fell down <i>flop</i>, and lay with his flat nose nuzzling the
still warm boiler. A hole, which showed up red and angry against
the black wool just underneath his grass cap, made the diagnosis of
his injury an easy matter.</p>
<p>The noise of the shot came to them quite a long time afterward,
when the little puff of smoke which had spirted up from the distant
sandbank had already begun to thin under the sunshine; but it was
that gun-crack, and not the sight of the dead engineer, which gave
the working negroes their final scare. With loud children's cries,
and queer dodgings of fear, they pitched down their working tools,
and fled to where the other black soldiers and passengers were
lying on the iron floor-plates of the launch, in security below her
water-line.</p>
<p>The Belgian Commandant, from his shelter at the other side of
the boiler, swore volubly, and Clay, the English doctor, laughed
and twanged out a music-hall tune on his banjo. Kettle, intent on
getting his vessel once more under command, was for driving the
negro crew back to their work by the simple methods peculiar to the
British merchant officer. But this Commandant Balliot forbade, and,
as he was Kettle's superior in the Congo Free State service, that
small mariner had (very much against his grain) to obey.</p>
<p>"We shall have these fellows rebelling next," said the
Commandant, "if you push them too hard; and if they join the rest,
where shall we be?"</p>
<p>"There are a thousand of your troops in the mutiny already,
according to your tally," said Kettle stiffly, "and I don't see
that if this hundred joined them it would make much difference to
us, one way or the other. Besides," he added, almost persuasively,
"if I had the handling of them they would not join the others. They
would stay here and do as they were told."</p>
<p>"Captain Kettle," snapped the Commandant, "you have heard my
orders. If I have any more of this hectoring spirit from you, I
shall report your conduct when we get back to Stanley Pool."</p>
<p>"You may report till you're black in the face," said Kettle
truculently; "but if you don't put a bit more backbone into things,
you'll do it as a ghost and not as a live man. Look at your record
up to date. You come up here at the head of a fine expedition; you
set your soldiers to squeeze the tribes for rubber and ivory; they
don't bring in enough niggers' ears to show that they've used their
cartridges successfully, and so you shoot them down in batches; and
then you aren't man enough to keep your grip on them, but when
they've had enough of your treatment, they just start in and
rebel."</p>
<p>"One man can't fight a thousand."</p>
<p>"You can't, anyway. If the Doc and I had turned up with this
launch half an hour later, your excellent troops would have knocked
you on the head and chopped you afterward. But I'd like to remind
you that we ran in-shore and took you away in spite of their
teeth."</p>
<p>"You are very brave," sneered the Commandant, "you and Monsieur
le Docteur."</p>
<p>"Well, you see," said Kettle with cheerful insult, "our
grandfathers didn't run away at Waterloo, and that gives us
something to go upon."</p>
<p>"I put you under arrest," screamed the Belgian. "I will have
satisfaction for this later. I--"</p>
<p>"Steady on," said Clay, with a yawn. He put down his banjo,
stretched, and stood up. Behind him the bullets pattered merrily
against the iron plating. "Why on earth do you two keep on nagging?
Look at me--I'm half drunk as usual, and I'm as happy as a lord.
Take a peg, each of you, and sweeten your tempers."</p>
<p>They glared at him from each side.</p>
<p>"Now it's not the least use either of you two trying to quarrel
with me. We might as well all be friends together for the little
time we've got. We've a good deal in common: we're all bad eggs,
and we're none of us fit for our billets. Monsieur le Commandant,
you were a sous-officier in Belgium who made Brussels too hot to
hold you; you come out here, and you're sent to govern a district
the size of Russia, which is a lot beyond your weight.</p>
<p>"Friend Kettle, you put a steamer on the ground in the lower
Congo; you probably had a bad record elsewhere, or you'd never have
drifted to the Congo service at all; and now you're up here on the
Haut Congo skippering a rubbishy fourpenny stern-wheel launch,
which of course is a lot beneath your precious dignity.</p>
<p>"And I--well, I once had a practice at home; and got into a row
over a woman; and when the row was through, well, where was the
practice? I came out here because no one will look at me in any
other quarter of the globe. I get wretched pay, and I do as little
as I possibly can for it. I'm half-seas over every day of the week,
and I'm liked because I can play the banjo."</p>
<p>"I don't see what good you're getting by abuse like this," said
Kettle.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to make you both forget your silly naggling. We may
just as well be cheerful for the bit of time we've got."</p>
<p>"Bit of time!"</p>
<p>"Well, it won't be much anyway. Here's the launch with a hole
shot in her boiler, and no steam, drifted hard and fast on to a
sandbank. On another bank, eight hundred yards away, are half a
regiment of rebel troops with plenty of good rifles and plenty of
cartridges, browning us for all they're worth. Their friends are
off up stream to collect canoes from those villages which have been
raided, and canoes they'll get--likewise help from the recently
raided. When dark comes, away they'll attack us, and personally, I
mean to see it out fighting, and they'll probably chop me
afterward, and the odds are I give some of them bad dyspepsia.
About that I don't care two pins. But I don't intend to be caught
alive. That means torture, and no error about it." He shivered.
"I've seen their subjects after they've played their torture games
on them. My aunt, but they were a beastly sight."</p>
<p>The Commandant shivered also. He, too, knew what torture from
the hands of those savage Central African blacks meant.</p>
<p>"I should blow up the launch with every soul on board of her,"
he said, "if I thought there was any chance of their boarding with
canoes."</p>
<p>"Well, you can bet your life they'll try it," said Kettle, "if
we stay here."</p>
<p>"But how can we move? We can't make steam. And if we do push off
this bank, we shall drift on to the next bank down stream."</p>
<p>"That's your idea," said Kettle. "Haven't you got a better?"</p>
<p>"You must not speak to me like that," said Balliot, with another
little snap of dignity and passion. "I'm your senior officer."</p>
<p>"At the present rate you'll continue to be that till about
nightfall," said Kettle unpleasantly, "after which time we shall be
killed, one way or another, and our ranks sorted out afresh."</p>
<p>"Now, you two," said Clay, "don't start wrangling again." He
took a bottle out of a square green case, and passed it. "Here,
have some gin."</p>
<p>"For God's sake, Doc, dry up," said Kettle, "and pull yourself
together, and remember you're a blooming Englishman."</p>
<p>Clay's thin yellow cheeks flushed. "What's the use?" he said
with a forced laugh. "'Tisn't as if anybody wanted to see any of us
home again."</p>
<p>"I'm wanted," said Kettle, sharply, "by my wife and kids. I've
got them to provide for, and I'm not going to shirk doing it. Let
me have my own way, and I can get out of this mess; yes, and out of
a dozen worse messes on beyond it. The thing's nothing if only it's
tackled the right way."</p>
<p>"How shall you set about it," asked the Commandant.</p>
<p>"By giving orders, and taking mighty big care that everybody on
this ship carries them out."</p>
<p>Commandant Balliot rubbed at his close, scrubby beard, and bared
his teeth viciously. Behind him, from the distant sandbank, the
rebel bullets rapped unceasingly at the launch's iron plating. "But
I am the senior in rank," he repeated again. "Officially I could
not resign the command in your favor."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. But here's the situation packed small: if you
climb up, and do the large, and perch on your blessed rank, we
shall probably see this day out, but we certainly sha'n't see
another in. You're at the end of your string, and you can't deny
it."</p>
<p>"But if you've a suggestion to make which will save us, make it,
and I will act."</p>
<p>"No," snapped Kettle. "I'll either be boss and carry out my
schemes my own way; or else, if we stay on as we are, I hold my
tongue, and you can go on and arrange the funeral."</p>
<p>"If you can get us out of this mess--"</p>
<p>"I've said I can."</p>
<p>"Then I will let you take the command."</p>
<p>"Well and good. In the first place--"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. I resign to you temporarily; but, understand,
even if I wished to, I could not do this officially. When we get
down to Leopoldville--when we get down to the next post even--"</p>
<p>"Oh, you can collar the blooming credit," said Kettle
contemptuously, "when we do get clear away to any of your own
headquarters. I'm not looking for gratitude either from a Belgian
or from the Congo Free State. They don't like Englishmen."</p>
<p>"You are not a lovable nation," said Commandant Balliot
spitefully.</p>
<p>"Now," said Kettle, thrusting his fierce little face close up to
the other, "understand once and for all that I will not have
England abused, neither do I take any more of your lip for myself.
I'm Captain of the whole of this show now, by your making, and I
intend to be respected as such, and hold a full captain's ticket.
You'll call me 'sir' when you speak, and you'll take orders civilly
and carry them out quick, or, by James! you'll find your teeth
rammed down your throat in two twinkles of a handspike. Savvy
that?"</p>
<p>The man of the weaker nation subsided. There was no law and
order here to fall back upon. There was nothing but unnerving
savagery and vastness. The sandbar where their wrecked launch lay
was out in the middle of the Congo, perhaps eight miles from the
park-like lands which stretched indefinitely beyond either bank.
The great river astern of her glared like a mirror under the
intolerable sunshine; came up and swirled around her flanks in
yellow, marigold-smelling waves; and then joined up into mirror
shape again till the eye ached in regarding it. The baking sky
above was desolate even of clouds; there was no help anywhere; and
on another distant sandbank, where here and there little bushes of
powder smoke sprouted up like a gauzy foliage, a horde of barbarous
blacks lusted to tear out his life.</p>
<p>In Commandant Balliot's own heart hope was dead. But it seemed
that this detestable Englishman had schemes in his head by which
their lives might yet be saved.</p>
<p>He had been given a sample of the Englishmen's brazen daring
already. After his troops mutinied, and pandemonium reigned in the
village where he was quartered, the Englishman had steamed up with
his paltry stem-wheel launch, and by sheer dash and recklessness
had carried him and his last parcel of faithful men away in spite
of the mutineers' teeth.</p>
<p>It was an insane thing to do, and when he had (as senior
officer) complimented Kettle on the achievement, the little sailor
had coldly replied that he was only carrying out his duty and
earning his pay. And he had further mentioned that it was lucky for
Commandant Balliot that he was a common, low-down Britisher, and
not a fancy Belgian, or he would have thought of his own skin
first, and steamed on comfortably down river and just contented
himself with making a report. The white engineer of the launch--a
drunken Scot--had, it seemed, been killed in the sortie, which, of
course, was regretable; but Balliot (who disliked the Scot
personally) had omitted to make the proper condolences; and it was
at this that Kettle had taken umbrage and turned the nasty edge of
his tongue outward.</p>
<p>"Now," said Captain Kettle, "enough time's been wasted. We will
start business at once, please. That boiler's got to be mended,
first."</p>
<p>"But," said Balliot, "it's under fire all the time."</p>
<p>"I can see that for myself," said the little sailor, "without
being reminded by a subordinate who wasn't asked to speak. We take
things as we find them, and so it's got to be mended under fire.
Moreover, as the chief engineer of this vessel was killed ashore,
and the second engineer was shot overboard, there's others that
will have to take rating as engine-room officers. Commandant
Balliot, have you any mechanics amongst your lot?"</p>
<p>"I have one man who acted as armorer-sergeant. He is very
inefficient."</p>
<p>"He must do his best. Can you handle a drill or a monkey wrench,
yourself?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then I shall find you a laborer's job. Doc, are you handy with
tools?"</p>
<p>"Only with those of my own trade," said Clay. "I'm pretty
inefficient all round," he added, with a shrug, "or else I
shouldn't be here."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Kettle, "then I'll rate myself chief
engineer." He got up, and walked round to where the black second
engineer, the last man shot, still nuzzled the boiler plates
exactly in the same position where he had first fallen. He lifted
one of the man's arms, and let it go. It jerked back again like a
spring.</p>
<p>"Well, Daddy," he said, "you didn't take long to get stiff. They
shot you nice and clean, anyway. I guess we'll let the river and
the crocodiles bury you." With a sharp heave, he jerked the rigid
body on to the rail, and even for the short second it poised there
the poor dead clay managed to stop another of those bullets which
flew up in such deadly silence from that distant sandbank.</p>
<p>"Good-by," said Kettle, as he toppled the corpse over, and it
fell with a splash, stiff-limbed into the yellow water. He watched
the body as it bobbed up again to the surface, and floated with the
stream out into the silvery sunshine. "Good-by, cocky," said he.
"You've been a good nigger, and, as you were shot doing your duty,
they'll set you on at the place where you've gone to, one of the
lightest jobs they've got suitable for a black pagan. That's a
theological fact. You'll probable turn to and stoke; I'll be
sending you down presently another batch of heathen to shovel on
the fire. I've got a biggish bill against those beggars on that
sandbank yonder for the mischief they've done."</p>
<p>But it was no place there to waste much time on sentiment. The
woodwork of the shabby little steamer was riddled with splintered
holes; the rusted iron plating was starred with gray lead-splashes;
and every minute more bullets ploughed furrows in the yellow waters
of the river, or whisped through the air overhead, or hit the
vessel herself with peremptory knocks. It is all very well to
affect a contempt for a straggling ill-aimed fire such as this;
but, given a long enough exposure to it, one is bound to be hit;
and so, if the work was to be attempted, the quicker it was set
about the more chance there was of getting it finished.</p>
<p>They use wood fuel on these small, ungainly steamers which do
their business up in the savage heart of Africa on the waters of
the Haut Congo, and because every man with a gun for many reasons
feels himself to be an enemy of the Free State, the steamers carry
their firing logs stacked in ramparts round their boilers and other
vital parts. But wood, as compared with coal, is bulky stuff to
carry, and as the stowage capacity of these stern-wheelers is
small, they have to make frequent calls to rebunker.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was for this purpose that Kettle had originally put
in at the village where Commandant Balliot had his headquarters;
and, as other events happened there which he had not calculated
upon, he had steamed out into the broad river again without a
chance of taking any logs on board, and, in fact, with his stock of
fuel down very near to the vanishing-point.</p>
<p>On this account, therefore, after the fatal shot into the
boiler, and the subsequent disablement and drifting on to the
sandbank, all repairing work had to be done under full exposure to
the fire of the mutineers. The Central African negro is a fairly
stolid person, and as the sight of a little slaughter does not in
the least upset his nerves, he can stand bullet hail for a good
long time without emotion, especially if there is no noise and
bustle attached to it. But once let a scare get rubbed home into
his stupid brain, and let him get started off on the run, and he is
an awkward person to stop.</p>
<p>But Kettle did not start to hustle his black laborers back to
work at once. He knew that there would be heavy mortality amongst
them once they were exposed to fire, and he wanted to lose as few
of them as possible. He had got use for them afterward. So for long
enough he worked alone, and the bullets spattered around him gayly.
He hammered out a lead templet to cover the wound in the boiler,
which, of course, as bad luck would have it, was situated at a
place where three plates met; and then whilst Balliot's armorer
with fire and hammer beat out a plate of iron the exact counterpart
of this, he rigged a ratchet drill and bored holes through the
boiler's skin to carry the necessary bolts.</p>
<p>Clay volunteered assistance once, but as he was told he would be
asked for help when it was needed, he squatted down under the
sheltered side of the boiler again, and smoked, and played more
music-hall ditties on the banjo. Commandant Balliot held to a
sullen silence. He was growing to have a poisonous hatred for this
contemptuous little Englishman who by sheer superiority had made
him give up his treasured dictatorship, and he formed schemes for
the Englishman's discomfiture in the near future.</p>
<p>But for the present he hoped very much that the man would not be
killed; he recognized, with fresh spasms of anger every time he
thought about it, that without Captain Kettle there would be no
future--at any rate on this earth--for any of them.</p>
<p>And meanwhile Captain Owen Kettle, stripped to shoes and
trousers, sweated over his work in the baking heat. Twice had a
bullet grazed him, once on the neck, and once on the round of a
shoulder, and red stains grew over the white satin of his skin. The
work was strange to him certainly, but he set about it with more
than an amateur's skill. All sailors have been handy with their
fingers from time immemorial, but the modern steamer-sailor, during
his apprenticeship as mate, has to turn his hand to a vast variety
of trades. He is painter, carpenter, stevedore, crew-driver, all in
one day; and on the next he is doctor, navigator, clerk, tailor,
and engineer. And especially he is engineer. He must be able to
drive winch, windlass, or crane, like an artist; he must have a
good aptitude for using hand tools; and if he can work machine
tools also, it is so much the better for him.</p>
<p>Yes, Captain Kettle put the patch on that boiler like a workman.
He fitted his bolts, and made his joints; then luted the manhole
and bolted that back in place; and then stepped down while a couple
of negroes sluiced him with water from gourds, and rubbed him clean
and dry with handfuls of wild cotton waste. So far, although the
incessant hail of bullets had pitted the boiler's skin in a hundred
places, no second shot had found a spot sufficiently soft to make a
puncture. The range of the bombardment was long, perhaps, and
though a bullet at seven hundred yards may, with convenience, kill
a man, it will not pierce seven-eighths boiler plate. And so,
theoretically, the boiler was safe for the time being.</p>
<p>But practically it was otherwise. The boiler was by no means
new. It was corroded with years, and incapacity, and neglect, as is
the custom with all parts of boats and machinery on the Haut Congo.
But it had been brought up to that waterway by carriers at vast
expense from Matadi, the highest steamer port on the Lower Congo,
probably costing three months and a dozen lives in transit, so that
it was debited in the books of the Free State as being worth its
weight in silver, and destined to be used on without replacement
till it saw fit to burst.</p>
<p>So Kettle knew that in places it would be not much thicker than
stout brown paper, and was quite aware that if any of the pattering
bullets investigated one of these patches, he would have to do his
work over again. He had a strong--and, I think,
natural--disinclination for this. He had come through terrific
risks during the last four hours, and could not expect to do so a
second time with equal immunity; his two wounds smarted; and
(although it sounds ludicrous that such a thing should have weight)
the dirt inseparable from such employment jarred against his neat
and cleanly habits, and filled him with unutterable disgust.</p>
<p>The moment, he conceived, was one for hurry. He told off four of
the negroes as trimmers and stokers, and set Commandant Balliot
over them to see that they pressed on with their work; he sent Clay
with a huge gang of helpers overboard on the lee side to risk the
crocodiles, and dig away the sand; and he himself, with a dozen
paddlers, got into the dug-out canoe, which was his only boat, and
set to carrying out a kedge and line astern. All of these
occupations took time, and when at last steam had mounted to a
working pressure in the battered gauge, and they got on board
again, two of his canoe-men had been shot, and one of Clay's party
had been dragged away into deep water by a prowling crocodile.</p>
<p>As no one else was competent, Kettle himself took charge of the
engines, and roared his commands with one hand on the throttle, and
the other on the reversing gear; Clay, for the moment, was
quartermaster, and stood to the wheel on the upper deck; and
Balliot, under the tuition of curses and revilings, drove the
winch, which heaved and slacked on the line made fast to the
kedge.</p>
<p>The little steamer rolled and squeaked and coughed, and the
paddle-wheel at her stern kicked up a compost of sand and mud and
yellow water that almost choked them with its crushed marigold
scent. The helm swung over alternately from hard-a-starboard to
hard-a-port; the stern-wheel ground savagely into the sand, first
one way and then the other; and the gutter, which she had delved
for herself in the bank, grew gradually wider and more deep. Then
slowly she began to make real progress astern.</p>
<p>"Now, heave on that kedge," Kettle yelled, and the winch bucked
and clattered under a greater head of steam, and the warp sung to
the strain; and presently the little vessel slid off the bank,
picked up her anchor, and was free to go where she pleased.</p>
<p>"Hurrah," cried Balliot, "we are saved. You are a brave man,
Captain."</p>
<p>"I didn't ask you to speak," retorted Kettle. "We aren't out of
the wood by a long chalk yet."</p>
<p>"But we are out of their fire now. We shall be disturbed no
further."</p>
<p>"No, my lad, but we've got a precious heap of disturbing to do
on our own account before we've squared up for this tea party. I'm
going to drop down stream to somewhere quiet where we can fill up
with wood, and then I'm coming back again to give your late Tommies
bad fits."</p>
<p>"But I don't authorize this. I didn't foresee--"</p>
<p>"Very likely not. But a fat lot I care for that. Fact remains
that I'm skipper here, and I'm going to do as I think best. I've
got it in mind that my two engineers and a lot of good niggers have
been shot by those disgusting savages over yonder, and I don't
permit that sort of thing without making somebody pay a pretty
steep bill for the amusement. So I'm going down stream to wood up,
and then we'll come back and make them pay for the tea party."</p>
<p>"You are exceeding your powers. I warn you."</p>
<p>"If any of my inferiors on board ship don't keep their heads
shut when they aren't spoken to," said Kettle unpleasantly, "I
always disarrange their front teeth. If I have any more palaver
from you, you'll get to know what it feels like." He shouted up the
companion way--"On top there, quartermaster?"</p>
<p>"Hullo?" said Clay.</p>
<p>"Keep her down river to M'barri-m'barri. That's a twelve-mile
run from here. There are two big cotton woods in a line which will
bring you to the landing. You know the channel?"</p>
<p>"I ought to. I've been up and down it times enough. But I guess
I don't--at least, not now."</p>
<p>"Fuddled again, are you? Then I'll con you from here. You see
three trees growing on that island bang ahead? Keep her on those."
He turned to a couple of stalwart niggers at his side--"Say, you
boys, you lib for top, one-time. You take dem Doctor's gin-bottle,
and you throw him overboard, one-time. If dem Doctor he make
palaver, you throw him overboard too. Away with you now. By James!
we got to get discipline in this ship somehow, and I'm a man that
can teach it. Here, you black swine at that furnace, go slow with
those logs, or we won't be able to steam her half-way."</p>
<p>He bustled about the little vessel, turning every soul on board
to some employment or other; and those of the newcomers who did not
know his wishes, and were not quick enough for his taste, received
instruction in a manner which is understood by men all the world
over, be their skins black, or white, or yellow.</p>
<p>The process might not be very pleasant for those who came in
contact with it, but it was very effective for the purpose aimed
at. In sea parlance Kettle had to "break up" some half-dozen of
them before all hands acquiesced to his dictatorship; but they were
quick to see there was a Man over them this time, and involuntarily
they admired his virility even while they rubbed ruefully at their
bumps; and during the times of stress that came afterward, none of
these Africans were so smart to obey as those on whom their
taskmaster's hand had originally come heaviest.</p>
<p>The period of instruction was short. It began when the little
stern-wheeler slipped off the bank and got under weigh. It was
completed satisfactorily during the twelve miles run down the
river. The boat was steered into M'barri-m'barri creek, made
hastily fast to trees on the bank, and exuded her people in an
armed rush. They had possession of the place almost before the
villagers knew of their arrival, and proceeded to the object of
their call. There was no especial show of violence.</p>
<p>The women and the children were imprisoned in the huts; the men
were given axes, and sent off into the forest to cut and gather
fuel; and, meanwhile, the landing party set themselves to eat what
they fancied and to carry off any store of ivory and rubber that
they might chance upon. There was nothing remarkable in the
manoeuvre. It is the authorized course of proceedings when a Free
State launch goes into the bank for wood and supplies.</p>
<p>The villagers brought down the logs smartly enough, and waxed
quite friendly on finding that none of the hostage women and
children had been killed or maltreated during their absence. They
duly gave up the German axes which had been loaned to them, and
carried the wood aboard. Kettle arranged its disposition. He had
solid defences built up all round the vulnerable boiler and
engines. He had a stout breastwork built all round inside the rail
of the lower deck, quite stout enough to absorb a bullet even if
fired at point-blank range. And he had another breastwork built on
the third deck, above the cabins, so that he turned the flimsy
little steamer into a very staunch, if somewhat ungainly, floating
fort.</p>
<p>He got on board the rubber and ivory he had collected, and had
it struck down below--the dividends of the State have to be
remembered first, even at moments of trouble like these--and then
he gave orders, and the vessel set off again up stream. On the
lower deck he stayed himself during the journey back, and gave
instructions to Commander Balliot in the art of engine-driving.</p>
<p>Balliot was sullen at first, and showed little inclination to
acquire so warm and grimy a craft, and fenced himself behind his
dignity. But Kettle put forth his persuasive powers; he did not hit
the man, he merely talked; and under the merciless lash of that
vinegary little tongue, Balliot repented him of his stubbornness,
and set himself to acquire the elementary knack of engine nursing
and feeding and driving.</p>
<p>"And now," said Kettle, cheerfully, when the pupil had mastered
the vague outlines of his business, "you see what can be done by
kindness. I haven't hit you once, and you know enough already not
to blow her up if only you're careful. Don't you even sham stupid
again; and, see here, don't you grit your teeth at me when you
think I'm not looking, or I'll beat you into butcher's meat when
I've hammered these rebels, and have a bit of spare time. You want
to learn a lot of manners yet, Mr. Commandant Balliot, and where I
come from we teach these to foreigners free of charge. Just you
remember that I'm your better, my man, and give me proper respect,
or I'll lead you a life a nigger's yellow dog wouldn't fancy."</p>
<p>Now the revolted troops, when they saw the launch wriggle off
the bank where she was stuck, and steam away down stream, were
filled with exasperation, because they had confidently anticipated
making a barbecue out of Commandant Balliot in return for many
cruelties received, and doing the same by any other Europeans whom
they might catch on the steamer, because, being white, they would
be presumably relatives of Balliot. It never occurred to their
simple minds that the launch would return, much less that she would
offer them battle; so when indeed she did appear again, they were
in the midst of a big consultation about their future
movements.</p>
<p>However, the African who owns a gun, be he revolted soldier or
mere peaceful farmer, never lets that weapon go far away from his
hand, for fear that his neighbor should send him away into the land
of shadows in order to possess it. And so a fusillade was soon
commenced. But the launch, armed with her fine rampart of logs,
bore it unflinchingly, and steamed up within a hundred yards of the
thick of them, and just held there in her place, with her wheel
gently flapping against the stream, and opened a vicious fire from
fifty muzzles.</p>
<p>Of modern rifles Kettle had only twenty on board, but he had an
abundance of those beautiful instruments known as "trade guns," and
at shot-range a man can be killed just as definitely by a dose of
pot-leg out of a gas-pipe barrel as he can by a dum-dum bullet sent
through scientific rifling. Indeed, for close-quarter righting
pot-leg is far more comprehensive, and far less likely to miss than
the lonely modern bullet. Moroever, his crew had quite as much
dread for him as they had for the enemy, and as a consequence they
fought with a briskness which made even their grim little chief
approve.</p>
<p>The crowd of mutineers did not, however, offer themselves to be
browned like a pack of helpless sheep for long. They were Africans
who had been born in an atmosphere of scuffle and skirmish, and
death had no especial terrors for them. Moreover, they had learnt
certain elements of the modern art of war from white officers; and
now, in the moment of trial, their dull brains worked, and the
crafty knowledge came back to them. They were a thousand strong;
they had friends all round--cannibal friends--who would come to
help in the fight and share in the loot; and, moreover, they had
canoes. Other well-manned canoes also were fast coming to their
help down stream.</p>
<p>In the canoes then they put off, and Kettle smiled grimly as he
saw the move. He had thought of this before, but it was greater
luck than he had dared hope for. But now the enemy had given
himself over into his hand. The one strong position of the
stern-wheel launch was her forward part. The Congo is full of snags
and floating logs which cannot always be avoided, and so all
steamers are strengthened to stand contact with them; and he could
give them the stem now without risk to himself.</p>
<p>He pretended flight when the canoes first came out, standing
across toward the further bank of the river, which was some dozen
miles away. The rebels fell into the lure, and paddled frantically
after him. Canoe after canoe put out, as fast as they could be
manned. The white men on the steamer were running away; they were
frightened; there was spoil and revenge to be got for the taking.
And from unseen villages on the islands and on the bank other
canoes shot out to get their share.</p>
<p>In the mean while Kettle consolidated his defences. Frantically
he worked, and like Trojans Clay and the negroes labored under him.
All that drunken doctor's limp <i>laissez faire</i> was gone now.
The blood of some fighting ancestor had warmed up inside him. He
might be physically weak and unhandy, but the lust of battle filled
him up like new drink, and he forgot his disgraceful past, and
lived only for the thrill of the present moment.</p>
<p>The log barricades had to be lashed and strutted so that no
collision could unship them, and all hands sweated and strained in
that tropical heat, till the job could not be bettered. And at the
after part of the lower deck, Commandant Balliot, driven on also by
the strong-willed man whom nobody on board could resist, tended the
engines with all his brain and nerve, and did his best to make the
fighting machine perfect.</p>
<p>"Now," said Kettle at last, "as we have got those fool Tommies
nicely tailed out about the river, we'll quit this running-away
game, and get to business. Mr. Chief Engineer, open that throttle
all it'll go, and let her rip, and mind you're standing by for my
next order. Doc, you keep your musketry class well in hand. Don't
waste shots. But when you see me going to run down a canoe, stand
by to give them eternal ginger when they're ten yards from the
stern. I'll whistle when you're to fire."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle went on to the upper deck and took over the
wheel, and screwed it over hard-a-port. The little top-heavy
steamer swung round in a quick circle, lurching over dangerously to
the outside edge. She ran for half a mile up stream, and then
turned again and came back at the top of her gait. She was aiming
at one particular canoe, which for a while came on pluckily enough
to meet her.</p>
<p>But African nerve has its limits, and the sight of this strange
uncouth steamer, which followed so unflinchingly their every
movement, was too much for the sweating paddlers. They turned their
ponderous dug-out's head, and tried to escape.</p>
<p>Kettle watched them like a cat. He had the whistle string in his
teeth, so as to leave him both hands free for the steering wheel,
and when the moment came he threw back his head, and drew the
string. The scream of the steam whistle was swamped instantly in
the roar of a blasting volley. Not many of the shots hit--for the
African is not a marksman--but the right effect was gained. The
blacks in the canoe ducked and flinched; they were for the moment
quite demoralized; and before they could man their paddles again,
the stern-wheeler's stem had crushed into their vessel, had cut a
great gash from one side, had rolled it over, and then mounted the
wreck, and drove down stream across the top of it.</p>
<p>A few more angry shots snapped out at the black bodies swimming
in the yellow water. "Hold up, there," Kettle ordered, "and let
them swim if they can, and chance the crocodiles. They've got their
gruel. Load up now, and get ready for the next."</p>
<p>He turned the launch again, and stood across the stream down the
strung-out line of canoes, occasionally making feints at them, but
ramming no more for the present. They all fired at him as he passed
them; indeed, a wild, scattered fire was general from all the
fleet; but his log armor protected him from this, and he steamed
grimly on, without returning a shot.</p>
<p>At the furthermost end of the line he turned sharply again, and
ran down the last canoe, just as he had run down the other; and
then he deliberately started to drive the whole fleet together into
one solid flock. He had the speed of them, and with rifle fire they
could not damage him, but for all that it was not easy work. They
expected the worst, and made desperate efforts to scatter and
escape; finally, he drove them altogether in one hopeless
huddle--cowed, scared, and tired out; and then he brought the
stern-wheeler to a sudden stop just above them, and made Clay shout
out terms in the native tongue.</p>
<p>They were to throw all their weapons overboard into the river.
They did it without question.</p>
<p>They were to throw their paddles overboard. They did that
also.</p>
<p>They were to tie all their canoes together into one big raft.
They obeyed him there, too, with frenzied quickness.</p>
<p>He took the raft in tow and steamed off down river to the
headquarters Free State post of the Upper River. He was feeling
almost complacent at the time. He had shown Commandant Balliot what
he was pleased to term a quick way with rebels.</p>
<p>But Commandant Balliot, whose life had been saved, and army
disarmed and brought back from rebellion in spite of himself, was
not the man to let any vague feeling of gratitude overweigh his own
deep sense of injury. He was incompetent, and he knew it, but
Kettle had been tactless enough to tell him so; and, moreover,
Kettle had thrown out the national gibe about Waterloo, which no
Belgian can ever forgive. Commandant Balliot gritted his teeth, and
rubbed at his scrubby beard, and melodramatically vowed
revenge.</p>
<p>He said nothing about it then; he even sat at meat with the two
Englishmen, and shared the ship duties with them without so much as
a murmur. He could not but notice, too, that Kettle said nothing
more now about being supreme chief, and had, in fact, tacitly
dropped back to his old position as skipper of the launch. But
Balliot brooded over the injuries he had received at the hands of
this truculent little sailor, and they grew none the smaller from
being held in memory.</p>
<p>Kettle's own method of reporting his doings, too, was not
calculated to endear him to the authorities. He steamed down to
headquarters at Leopoldville, went ashore, and swung into the
Commandant's house with easy contempt and assurance. He gave an
arid account of the launch's voyage up the great river to the
centre of Africa and back, and then in ten words described
Balliot's disaster, his rescue, and its cost. "And so," he wound
up, "as the contract was outside Mr. Balliot's size, I took it in
my own hands and carried it through. I've brought back your
blooming army down here. It's quite tame now."</p>
<p>The Commandant at Leopoldville nodded stiffly, and said he would
confer with Captain Kettle's senior officer, Commandant Balliot,
after which Kettle would probably hear something further.</p>
<p>"All right," said the little man. "I should tell you, too, that
Mr. Balliot's not without his uses. With a bit of teaching I got
him to handle my engines quite decent for an amateur." He turned to
go, but stopped again in the glare of the doorway. "Oh, there's one
other thing. I want to recommend to you Doctor Clay. He's a good
man, Clay. He stood by me well in the trouble we had, after he got
roused up. I'd like to recommend him for promotion."</p>
<p>"I will see if Commandant Balliot--as senior officer--adds his
recommendation to yours," said the other drily. "Good-morning to
you for the present."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle went down to the beach, and stepped along the
gangway on to the stern-wheel launch. The working negroes on the
lower deck stopped their chatter for the moment as he passed, and
looked up at him with a queer mixture of awe and admiration. From
above came the tinkle of a banjo and the roar of an English song.
The doctor was free, and was amusing himself according to his
fashion.</p>
<p>Kettle got his accordion and went up on the hurricane deck and
joined him, and till near on sundown the pair of them sat there
giving forth music alternately. There was a fine contrast between
them. The disreputable doctor deliberately forgot everything of the
past, and lived only for the reckless present; the shipmaster had
got his wife and children always filling half his memory, and was
in a constant agony lest he should fail to properly provide for
them. And as a consequence Clay's music was always of the lighter
sort, and was often more than impolite; while Kettle's was, for the
most part, devotional, and all of it sober, staid, and thoughtful.
They were a strong contrast, these two, but they pulled together
with one another wonderfully. Kettle used sometimes to wonder why
it was, and came to the conclusion that it was the tie of music
which did it. But Clay never worried about the matter at all. He
was not the man to fill his head with useless problems.</p>
<p>But on this afternoon their concert was cut short before its
finish. Commandant Balliot came back to the launch with
satisfaction on his streaming face, and two armed black soldiers
plodding at his heels.</p>
<p>"Well," said Kettle, "have they made you a colonel yet, or are
they only going to give you the Congo medal?"</p>
<p>"You sacred pig," said Balliot, "you talked to M. le Commandant
here of rebels. What are you but a rebel? I have told him all, and
he has sent me to arrest you."</p>
<p>"Good old Waterloo," said Kettle cheerfully. "I bet you lied,
and because you are both Belgians, I suppose he believed you."</p>
<p>The fat man gritted his teeth. "You talked of having a short way
with rebels yourself. You will find that we have a short way here,
too. You are under arrest."</p>
<p>"So you've said."</p>
<p>Balliot said a couple of words in the native to one of his
followers, and the man produced a pair of rusty handcuffs and held
them out alluringly.</p>
<p>Kettle's pale cheeks flushed darkly. "No," he said, "by James!
No, that's not the way for a thing like you to set about it." He
jumped to his feet, and thrust his savage little face close to the
black soldier's eyes. "Give me dem handcuffs." The man surrendered
them limply, and Kettle flung them overboard. Balliot was trying to
get a revolver from the leather holster at his waist, but Kettle,
who had his weapon in a hip pocket, was ready first, and covered
him.</p>
<p>"Throw up your hands!"</p>
<p>Commandant Balliot did so. He knew enough about Captain Kettle
to understand that he meant business.</p>
<p>"Tell your soldiers to drop their guns, or I'll spread their
brains on the deck."</p>
<p>Balliot obeyed that order also.</p>
<p>"Now, Doc," said Kettle in a different tone, "pack your traps
and go ashore."</p>
<p>"What for?" asked Clay.</p>
<p>"Because I'm going to take this steamer for a cruise up river. I
don't mind getting the sack; I'd reckoned on that. But, by James!
I'm not going to be arrested by these Belgian brutes, and that's
final."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose they would string you up, or shoot you, to
soothe their precious dignity, from what His Whiskers here
says."</p>
<p>"They're not going to get the chance," snapped Kettle.
"Handcuffs, by James! Here, clear out, Doc, and let me get the ship
under way."</p>
<p>"No," said Clay. "I fancy I've had about enough of the Congo
Free State service, too. I'll come, too."</p>
<p>"Don't be an idiot."</p>
<p>Dr. Clay gave a whimsical laugh. "Have I ever been anything else
all my life?"--He went across and took the revolver out of
Balliot's holster--there, I've burnt my boats. I've disarmed His
Whiskers here, and defied authority, and that gives them a <i>casus
belli</i> against me. You'll have to take me along now out of sheer
pity."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Kettle; "help me to shove the three of them
into one of the empty rooms below, and then mount guard on them to
see they don't make a row. We mustn't have them giving the alarm of
this new game till we've got a start on us. You're a good soul,
Doc. I'll never forget this of you."</p>
<p>And so Captain Owen Kettle finally severed his connection with
the Congo Free State service, and set off at once again as his own
master. He had no trouble with the black crew of the launch. The
men half adored, half dreaded him; and, anyway, were prepared to
take his orders before any others. They got the little vessel under
weigh again, and just before the gang-plank was pulled in,
Commandant Balliot and his disarmed escort were driven on to the
beach.</p>
<p>The Belgian was half wild with mortification and anger. "You
have won now," he screamed. "But you will be fetched back, and I
myself will see that you are disgracefully hanged."</p>
<p>"If you come after me and worry me," said Kettle, coolly, "I'll
give you my men to chop. Just you remember that, Mr. Waterloo. I
think you know already that I am a fellow that never lies."</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE NEW REPUBLIC</h3>
<br>
<p>The fighting ended, and promptly both the invaders and the
invaded settled down to the new course of things without further
exultation or regret. An hour after it had happened, the capture of
the village was already regarded as ancient history, and the two
white men had got a long way on in their discussion on its ultimate
fate.</p>
<p>"No," Captain Kettle was saying, "no being king for me, Doctor,
thank you. I've been offered a king's ticket once, and that
sickened me of the job for good and always. The world's evidently
been going on too long to start a new kingdom nowadays, and I'm too
much of a conservative to try and break the rule. No, a republic's
the thing, and, as you say, I'm the stronger man of the two of us.
Doc, you may sign me on as President."</p>
<p>Dr. Clay turned away his face, and relieved his feelings with a
grin. But he very carefully concealed his merriment. He liked
Kettle, liked him vastly; but at the same time he was more than a
little scared of him, and he had a very accurate notion that the
man who failed to take him seriously about this new scheme, would
come in contact with trouble. The scheme was a big one; it purposed
setting up a new state in the heart of the &Eacute;tat du Congo, on
territory filched from that power; but the little sailor was in
deadly earnest over the project, and already he had met with
extraordinary luck in the initial stages. Central Africa is a
country where determined <i>coups de main</i> can sometimes yield
surprising results.</p>
<p>The recent history of these two vagabond white men cannot be
given in this place with any web of detail. They had gone through
their apprenticeship amongst these African inlands as officers of
the Congo Free State; they had been divorced from that service with
something of suddenness; and a purist might have held that the
severance of their ties was complicated with something very near
akin to piracy. I know that they had been abominably oppressed; I
know that Kettle chose running away with his steamer to the
alternative of handcuffs and disgrace, and a possible hanging to
follow; but there was no getting over the fact that the
stern-wheeler was Free State property, and that these two had
alienated it to their own uses.</p>
<p>The black crew of the launch and the black soldiers on board,
some seventy head all told, they had little trouble in dragooning
into obedience. The Central African native never troubles himself
much about niceties of loyalty, and as the sway of the Congo Free
State (or "Buli Matdi," as it is named by the woolly aboriginal),
had been brutally tyrannous, the change of allegiance had worried
them little. Besides, they had been in contact with Captain Kettle
before, and knew him to be that admirable thing, a Man, and worthy
of being served; while Clay, whom they also knew, amused them with
his banjo, and held powerful <i>ju-ju</i> in the shape of drugs;
and so they went blithely enough where they were led or driven, and
described themselves as soldiers or slaves, whichever word happened
to come handiest. The African of the interior never worries his
head about the terms of his service. So long as he has plenty of
food, and a master to do all the thinking for him, he is quite
content to work, or steal, or fight, or be killed, as that master
sees fit to direct.</p>
<p>The progress of the little stern-wheel steamer on her return
journey up the Haut Congo might also give rise to misapprehension
here at home, if it were described exactly as it happened. There
are no ship's chandlers in Central Africa, and it is the custom
there, when you lack stores, to go to a village on the bank and
requisition anything that is available. The Arab slave-traders who
once held the country did this; the prehistoric people before them
founded the custom; and the Free State authorities, their lineal
descendants, have not seen fit to change the policy. At least, they
may have done so in theory at Brussels, but out there, in practice,
they have left this matter <i>in statu quo</i>.</p>
<p>There is a massive conservatism about the heart of Africa with
which it is dangerous to tamper. If you rob a man in that region,
he merely respects your superior power. If you offer him payments,
he promptly suspects you of weakness, and sets his clumsy mind at
work to find the method by which you may be robbed of whatever you
have not voluntarily surrendered.</p>
<p>"Of course," said Kettle, taking up the thread of his tale
again, "it's understood that we run this country for our own
advantage first."</p>
<p>"What other object should white men have up-country in Africa?"
said Clay. "We don't come here merely for our health."</p>
<p>"But I've got a great notion of treating the people well
besides. When we have made a sufficient pile--and, mark you, it
must be all in ivory, as there's nothing else of value that can be
easy enough handled--we shall clear out for the Coast, one-time.
And then we must realize on the ivory, and then we can go home and
live as Christians again." He stared through the doorway of the hut
at the aching sunshine beyond. "Oh, Lord! Think of it, Doc--Home!
England! Decent clothes! Regular attendance in chapel on Sundays,
and your soul well cared for and put into safe going order
again!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my soul doesn't bother me. But England! that's fine to
think about, old man, isn't it? England!" he repeated dreamily.
"Yes, I suppose I should have to change my name if I did go back. I
don't know, though. It'd have blown over by now, perhaps; things do
blow over, and if I went to a new part of the country I expect I
could still stick to the old name, and not be known from Adam. Yes,
things do blow over with time, and if you don't make too much stir
when you go back. I should have to keep pretty quiet; but I bet I'd
have a good time for all that. Fancy the luxury of having good
Glenlivet in a cask again, with a tap half-way up, after the
beastly stuff one got on the coast, or, worse still, what one gets
up here--and that's no whiskey at all!"</p>
<p>"Well, you needn't worry about choosing your home drinks just
now," said Kettle. "'Palaver no set' here by a very long chalk yet,
and till it is you'll have to go sober, my lad, and keep a very
clear head."</p>
<p>Clay came to earth again. "Sorry, Skipper," he said, "but you
set me off. 'Tisn't often I look across at either to-morrow or
yesterday. As you say, it's a very dry shop this, and so the sooner
we get what we want and quit, the sooner we shall hit on a good
time again. And the sooner we clear out, too, the less chance we
have of those beastly Belgians coming in here to meddle. You know
we've had luck so far, and they haven't interfered with us. But we
can't expect that for always. The Congo Free State's a trading
corporation, with dividends to make for the firm of Leopold and
Co., in Brussels, and they don't like trade rivals. What stealing
can be done in the country, they prefer to do themselves."</p>
<p>"When the time comes," said the little sailor grimly, "we shall
be ready for them, and if they interfere with me, I shall make the
Congo Free State people sit up. But in the mean while they are not
here, and I don't see that they need be expected. They can trace us
up the Congo from Leopoldville, if you like, by the villages we
stopped at--one, we'll say, every two hundred miles--but then we
find this new river, and where are we? The river's not charted;
it's not known to any of the Free State people, or I, being in
their steamboat service, would have been told of it; and the
entrance is so well masked at its Congo end by islands, that no one
would guess it was there. The Congo's twenty miles wide where our
river comes in, and very shallow, and the steamer-channel's right
at the further bank. If they'd another Englishman in their service
up here, I'd not say; but don't you tell me that the half-baked
Dutchmen and Dagos who skipper their launches would risk hunting
out a new channel, and blunder on it that way."</p>
<p>"No," said Clay, "I'm with you there. But word travels amongst
the natives. You can't get over that."</p>
<p>"That's where the risk comes in. But I've done my best to make
it travel slow. I've got hold of that beast of a witch-doctor, who
deserves hanging anyway for all the poor wretches he's killed, and
I've told him that as soon as word slips out downriver of our being
here, he'll get shot, one-time. He's a man of influence, that
witch-doctor, and I shouldn't wonder but what he makes the natives
keep their heads shut for quite a long time."</p>
<p>"It may be professional prejudice, but I rather hope that local
practitioner gets his gruel somehow before we clear out." Clay
shivered. "He's a cruel devil. Remember the remains of those two
poor sacrificed wretches we found when we got here?"</p>
<p>Kettle shrugged his shoulders. "I know. But what could one do?
Niggers always are like that when they're left to play about
alone--as these here have been, I suppose, since Creation Day. We
couldn't pin the sacrifices on to the witch-doctor, or else, of
course, we'd have strung him up. We could only just give him an
order for these customs to stop one-time, and stand by to see it
carried out. But we start the thing from now, on fresh, sensible
lines. We're going to have no foolery about the nigger being as
good as a white man. He isn't, and no man that ever saw him where
he grows ever thought so."</p>
<p>"Speaking scientifically," said Clay, "it has always struck me
that a nigger is an animal placed by the scheme of creation
somewhere between a monkey and a white man. You might bracket him,
say, with a Portugee."</p>
<p>"About that," said Kettle; "and if you treat him as more, you
make him into a bad failure, whereas if he's left alone, he's a bit
nasty and cruel. Now I think, Doc, there's a middle course, and
that's what I'm going to try here whilst we're making our pile.
We've grabbed four tidy villages already, and that makes a good
beginning for this new republic; and when we've got things
organized a bit more, and have a trifle of time, we can grab some
others. And, by James! Doc, there's a name for you--the New
Republic!"</p>
<p>"I seem to think it's been used in a book somewhere."</p>
<p>"The New Republic!" Kettle repeated relishingly. "It goes well.
It's certain to have been used before, but it's good enough to be
used again. Some day, perhaps, it'll have railways, and
public-houses, and a postal service, and some day it may even issue
stamps of its own."</p>
<p>"With your mug in the middle!"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle reddened. "I don't see why not," he said stiffly.
"I started the show, and by James! whilst I'm running it, the New
Republic's got to hum; and when I'm gone, I shall be remembered as
some one out of the common. I'm a man, Doctor Clay, that's got a
high sense of duty. I should think it wrong to stay here sweating
ivory out of these people, if I didn't put something into them in
return."</p>
<p>"Well, you do seem to have got a hold over them, and that's a
fact, and I guess you will be able to make them--" he broke off,
and burst into a cackle of laughter. "Oh, my Christian aunt, look
there!"</p>
<p>A mob of natives were reverently approaching the hut, two of
them carrying skinny chickens. The witch-doctor led the advance.
Kettle guessed what was intended, and got up from his seat to
interfere.</p>
<p>"Oh, look here, Skipper," Clay pleaded, "don't spoil the show.
Let's do the traveller for once, and observe the 'interesting
native customs.' You needn't be afraid; they're going to sacrifice
the bigger hen to you, right enough."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle allowed himself to be persuaded, and sat back
again. The mob of negroes came up to the doorway of the hut, and
the witch-doctor, with many prostrations to the little sailor, made
a long speech. Then the larger of the two fowls entered into the
ceremony, and was slain with a sword, and the witch-doctor,
squatting on the ground, read the omens.</p>
<p>Kettle accepted the homage with glum silence, evidently
restraining himself, but when Clay's turn came, and the smaller and
scraggier of the chickens yielded up life in his honor, he hitched
up his feet, and squatted cross-legged on the chair, and held up
his hand palm outward, after the manner of some grotesque Chinese
idol. A sense of the absurd was one of the many things which had
hampered this disreputable doctor all through his unlucky
career.</p>
<p>The negroes, however, took it all in good part, and in time they
departed, well satisfied. But Kettle wore a gloomy face.</p>
<p>"Funny, wasn't it?" said Clay.</p>
<p>"I call it beastly," Kettle snapped. "This sort of thing's got
to stop. I'm not going to have my new Republic dirtied by shows
like that."</p>
<p>"Well," said Clay flippantly, "if you will set up as a little
tin god on wheels, you must expect them to say their prayers to
you."</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything of the kind. I merely stepped in and
conquered them."</p>
<p>"Put it as you please, old man. But there's no getting over it
that that's what they take you for."</p>
<p>"Then, by James! it comes to this: they shall be taught the real
thing!"</p>
<p>"What, you'll import a missionary?"</p>
<p>"I shall wade in and teach them myself."</p>
<p>"Phew!" whistled Clay. "If you're going to start the New
Jerusalem game on the top of the New Republic, I should say you'll
have your hands full."</p>
<p>"Probably," said Kettle grimly; "but I am equal to that."</p>
<p>"And you'll not have much time left to see after ivory
palaver."</p>
<p>"I shall go on collecting the ivory just the same. I shall
combine business with duty. And"--here he flushed somewhat--"I'm
going to take the bits of souls these niggers have got, and turn
them into the straight path."</p>
<p>Clay rubbed his bald head. "If you're set on it," said he,
"you'll do it; I quite agree with you there. But I should have
thought you'd seen enough of the nigger to know what a disastrous
animal he is after some of these missionaries have handled
him."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Kettle; "but those were the wrong sort of
missionary--wrong sort of man to begin with; wrong sort of religion
also."</p>
<p>And then, to Dr. Clay's amazement, his companion broke out into
a violent exposition of his own particular belief. It was the first
time he had ever heard Kettle open his lips on the subject of
religion, and the man's vehemence almost scared him. Throughout the
time they had been acquainted, he had taken him to be like all
other lay white men on the Congo, quite careless on the subject,
and an abhorrer of missions and all their output; and, lo! here was
an enthusiast, with a violent creed of his very own, and with
ranting thunders to heave at all who differed from him by so much
as a hairs-breadth. Here was a devotee who suddenly, across a great
ocean of absence, remembered the small chapel in South Shields,
where during shore days he worshipped beside his wife and children.
Here was a prophet, jerked by circumstances into being, trumpeting
the tenets of an obscure sect with something very near to
inspiration.</p>
<p>He preached and preached on till the tropical day burned itself
out, and the velvety night came down, and with it the mists from
the river. The negroes of the village, with their heads wrapped up
to keep off the ghosts, shivered as they listened to "dem small
whiteman make ju-ju" across the clearing. Clay listened because he
could not get away. He knew the man well, yes, intimately; he was
constantly dealing him out unpalatable flippancies; but in this
new, this exalted mood, he did not care to do less than give
attention.</p>
<p>The man seemed to have changed; his eyes were bright and
feverish; his face was drawn; his voice had lost its shipmaster's
brusqueness, and had acquired the drone of the seaman's shore
conventicle. There was no doubt about his earnestness; in Clay's
mind, there was no doubt about the complications which would ensue
from it.</p>
<p>When Dr. Clay lay down on his bed that night, his mind was big
with foreboding. Ever since that entanglement with the woman
occurred, which ruined forever his chance of practicing in England,
he had gone his way with a fine recklessness as to consequences. He
had lived for the day, and the day only; he had got to the lowest
peg on the medical scale; and any change would be an improvement.
He carried with him an incomplete case of instruments, a
wire-strung banjo, and a fine taste in liquor and merriment as
stock-in-trade, and if any of the many shapes which Death assumes
in the Congo region came his way, why there he was ready to journey
on.</p>
<p>But during these last weeks a chance had appeared of returning
to England with a decent competency, and he jumped at it with an
eagerness which only those who have at one time or other "gone
under" themselves can appreciate. In effect he had entered into a
partnership with Captain Owen Kettle over a filibustering
expedition--although they gave the thing different names--and from
the first their ivory raiding had been extraordinarily successful.
If only they could collect on undisturbed for another six months at
the same rate, and then get their spoils down to the coast and
shipped, the pair of them stepped into a snug competence at once.
But this latest vagary of his partner's seemed to promise
disruption of the whole enterprise. He did not see how Kettle could
possibly carry out this evangelizing scheme, on which he had so
suddenly gone crazed, without quite neglecting his other commercial
duties.</p>
<p>However, in the course of the next day or so, as he witnessed
Captain Kettle's method of spreading his faith, Clay's forebodings
began to pass away. There was nothing of the hypocrite about this
preaching sailor; but, at the same time, there was nothing of the
dreamer. He exhorted vast audiences daily to enter into the narrow
path (as defined by the Tyneside chapel), but, at the same time, he
impressed on them that the privilege of treading this thorny way in
no manner exempted them from the business of gathering ivory, by
one means or another, for himself and partner.</p>
<p>Kettle had his own notions as to how this proselytizing should
be carried on, and he set about it with a callous disregard for
modern precedent. He expounded his creed--the creed of the obscure
Tyneside chapel--partly in Coast-English, partly in the native,
partly through the medium of an interpreter, and he commanded his
audience to accept it, much as he would have ordered men under him
to have carried out the business of shipboard. If any one had
doubts, he explained further--once. But he did not allow too many
doubts. One or two who inquired too much felt the weight of his
hand, and forthwith the percentage of sceptics decreased
marvellously.</p>
<p>Clay watched on, non-interferent, hugging himself with
amusement, but not daring to let a trace of it be seen. "And I
thought," he kept telling himself with fresh spasms of suppressed
laughter, "that that man's sole ambition was to set up here as a
sort of robber baron, and here he's wanting to be Mahomet as well.
The crescent or the sword; Kettleism or kicks; it's a pity he
hasn't got some sense of humor, because as it is I've got all the
fun to myself. He'd eat me if I told him how it looked to an
outsider."</p>
<p>Once, with the malicious hope of drawing him, he did venture to
suggest that Kettle's method of manufacturing converts was somewhat
sudden and arbitrary, and the little sailor took him seriously at
once.</p>
<p>"Of course it is," said he. "And if you please, why shouldn't it
be? My intelligence is far superior to theirs at the lowest
estimate; and therefore I must know what's best for them. I order
them to become members of my chapel, and they do it."</p>
<p>"They do it like birds," Clay admitted. "You've got a fine grip
over them."</p>
<p>"I think they respect me."</p>
<p>"Oh, they think you no end of a fine man. In fact they consider
you, as I've said before, quite a little tin--"</p>
<p>"Now stop it, Doc. I know you're one of those fellows that don't
mean half they say, but I won't have that thrown against me, even
in jest."</p>
<p>"Well," said Clay, slily, "there's no getting over the fact that
some person or persons unknown sacrificed a hen up against the door
of this hut under cover of last night, and I guess they're not
likely to waste the fowl on me."</p>
<p>"One can't cure them of their old ways all at once," said
Kettle, with a frown.</p>
<p>"And some genius," Clay went on, "has carved a little wooden
image in trousers and coat, nicely whitewashed, and stuck up on
that old <i>ju-ju</i> tree down there by the swamp. I saw it when I
was down there this morning. Of course, it mayn't be intended to be
a likeness of you, skipper, but it's got a pith helmet on, which
the up-country nigger doesn't generally add to portraits of
himself; and moreover, it's wearing a neat torpedo beard on the end
of its chin, delicately colored vermilion."</p>
<p>"Well?" said Kettle sourly.</p>
<p>"Oh, that had got a hen sacrificed in front of it, too, that's
all. I recognize the bird; he was a game old rooster that used to
crow at me every time I passed him."</p>
<p>"Beastly pagans," Kettle growled. "There's no holding some of
them yet. They suck up the glad tidings like mother's milk at
first, and they're back at their old ways again before you've
taught them the tune of a hymn. I just want to catch one or two of
these backsliders. By James! I'll give them fits in a way they
won't forget."</p>
<p>But if Captain Kettle was keen on the conversion of the heathen
to the tenets of the Tyneside chapel, he was by no means forgetful
of his commercial duties. He had always got Mrs. Kettle, the
family, and the beauties of a home life in an agricultural district
at the back of his mind, and to provide the funds necessary for a
permanent enjoyment of all these items close at hand, he worked
both Clay and himself remorselessly.</p>
<p>Ivory does not grow on hedgerows even in Africa, and the
necessary store could by no means be picked up even in a day, or
even in a matter of weeks. Ivory has been looked upon by the
African savage, from time immemorial, not as an article of use, but
as currency, and as such it is vaguely revered. He does not often
of his own free will put it into circulation; in fact, his life may
well pass without his once seeing it used as a purchasing medium;
but custom sits strong on him, and he likes to have it by him. An
African chief of any position always has his store of ivory,
usually hidden, sometimes in the bush, sometimes buried--for
choice, under the bed of a stream. It is foolish of him, this
custom, because it is usually the one thing that attracts the white
man to his neighborhood, and the white man's visits are frequently
fraught with disaster; but it is a custom, and therefore he sticks
to it. He is not a highly reasoning animal, this Central African
savage.</p>
<p>The African, moreover, is used to oppression--that is, he either
oppresses or is oppressed--and he is dully callous to death. So the
villages were not much surprised at Kettle's descents upon them,
and usually surrendered to him passively on the mere prestige of
his name. They were pleasantly disappointed that he omitted the
usual massacre, and in gratitude were eager to accept what they
were pleased to term his <i>ju-ju</i>, but which he described as
the creed of the Tyneside chapel.</p>
<p>They reduced him to frenzy about every second day by
surreptitiously sacrificing poultry in his honor; but he did not
dare to make any very violent stand against this overstepping of
the rubric, lest (as was hinted to him) they should misinterpret
his motive, and substitute a plump nigger baby for the more
harmless spring chicken. It is by no means easy to follow the
workings of the black man's brain in these matters.</p>
<p>But all the time he went on gathering ivory--precious ivory,
worth as much as a thousand pounds a ton if he could but get it
home. Some of it had been buried for centuries, and was black-brown
with age and the earth; some was new, and still bloody-ended and
odorous; but he figured it all out into silk dresses for Mrs.
Kettle, and other luxuries for those he loved, and gloated even
over the little <i>escribellos</i> which lay about on the village
refuse heaps as not being worthy to hide with the larger tusks.</p>
<p>And, between-whiles, he preached to the newly conquered, ordered
them to adopt the faith of the South Shields chapel, and finally
sang them hymns, which he composed himself especially to suit their
needs, to the tunes of "Hold the Fort," and "From Greenland's Icy
Mountains," which he played very sweetly on the accordion. Captain
Kettle might be very keen after business, but at the same time it
could never be laid to his charge that he was ever forgetful of the
duty he owed to the souls of these heathen who came under his
masterful thumb.</p>
<p>Dr. Clay, however, watched all the proceedings now with a
jubilant mind. As a political division, the much-talked-of New
Republic might be said to lack cohesion, but as a conquered tract
of country it was very pleasantly in awe of Captain Kettle. A very
comfortable store of ivory was stored in the principal hut of each
village they came to, which Clay, who commanded the rear guard,
always took care to "put <i>ju-ju</i> on" after his senior officer
at the head of the force had marched out of the village <i>en
route</i> for the next, that being the most satisfactory fashion of
warding off pilferers. And last but not least, they had agreed upon
their route of exit to a sea-coast, and (in theory at any rate)
considered it eminently practicable.</p>
<p>The Congo, of course, <i>via</i> Leopoldville, Matadi, and
Banana was barred to them, on account of their trouble with the
Free State authorities. Their original idea had been to cross the
great continent eastward by way of the Great Lakes, and take
shipping somewhere by Mozambique or Zanzibar. But the barbarous
difficulties of that route daunted even Kettle, when they began to
consider it in detail, and the advantages of the French Congo
territory showed up brightly in comparison.</p>
<p>They still had the little stern-wheel steamer that was
filched--I beg their pardon, captured from the Free State, and in
her, with the loot on board, they must creep down the Congo again,
almost to Stanley Pool, steaming by night only, hiding at the back
of islands during the days, always avoiding observation. And then
they must strike across country due west, till they made the
head-waters of the Ogowe, and so down to the sea, fighting a way
through whatever tribes tried to impede them. The French Customs
would take their toll of the ivory, of course, but that could not
be helped; but after that, a decent steamer again, and the sea, and
home. It was an appetizing prospect.</p>
<p>But castles in the clouds have been built before, and often it
is the unexpected that sets them trundling; and in this case such
an ordinary occurrence as a tornado stepped into the reckoning and
split this sighed-for edifice of success and prosperity with all
completeness.</p>
<p>There had been no tornado to clear the atmosphere for nine whole
days, and the country was unendurable accordingly. The air was
stagnant with heat, and reeked with the lees of stale vegetation.
The sky overhead was full of lurid haze, which darkened the
afternoon almost to a twilight, and in the texture of this haze,
indicated rather than definitely seen, was a constant nicker of
lightning. It was the ordinary heat-lightning of the tropics, which
is noiseless, but it somehow seemed to send out little throbs into
the baking air, till, at times, to be alive was for a white man
almost intolerable.</p>
<br>
<a name="page095.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/page095.jpg" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>The little army could only march in single file.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Under this discomfort, a predatory column was marching on from
one captured village to another, whose possible store of ivory had
so far not been gleaned. The road was the ordinary African
bush-path, intensely winding and only foot-sole wide; the little
army, with Kettle at its head, could only march in single file, and
Clay, who brought up the straggling rear, sweated and panted quite
half a mile behind his leader.</p>
<p>Every one knew the tornado was approaching, and both the worn
and haggard white men and the sweating, malodorous blacks hoped for
it with equal intensity. For be it known that the tropical tornado
passes through the stale baked air at intervals, like some gigantic
sieve, dredging out its surplus heat and impurities. The which is a
necessity of Nature; else even the black man could not endure in
those regions.</p>
<p>And in due time, though it lingered most cruelly in its
approach, the tornado burst upon them, coming with an insane volley
of rain and wind and sound, that filled the forests with crashings,
and sent the parched earth flying in vicious mud-spirts. In a
Northern country such a furious outburst would have filled people
with alarm; but here, in the tropic wilderness, custom had robbed
the tornado of its dignity; and no one was awed. Indeed the blacks
fairly basked in its violence, turning their glistening bodies
luxuriously under the great ropes of rain.</p>
<p>The march stopped at the first outbreak of the squall. Kettle
bolted to a rock ahead of him, and squatted down in a dry lee,
sucking up great draughts of the new cool air. There are times when
a drop of five degrees of temperature can bring earthly bliss of a
quality almost unimaginable. And there he stayed, philosophically
waiting till the tornado should choose to blow itself out.</p>
<p>The wind had started with a roar and a sudden squall, reaching
the full climax of its strength in a matter of thirty seconds, and
then with equal hurry it ended, leaving the country it had scoured
full of a fresh, cool, glistening calm. Kettle rose to his feet,
shook his clothes into shape, and gave the order to start.</p>
<p>The black soldiers stepped out in his wake, and for half a mile
he strode at their head through the new-made mud of the path. But
then he was suddenly brought up all standing. Word had been
tediously handed down the long straggling line of men that there
had been an accident in the rear; that a great tree had fallen to
the blast; and finally that "dem dokitar, he lib for die."</p>
<p>Swiftly Kettle turned, and worked his way back down the narrow
lane of the path. The negroes he hustled against watched him with
stupid stares, but he gave them little notice. Leaving out the
facts that Clay was his only white companion and assistant, he had
grown strangely to like the man, and the vague report of the
accident filled him with more than dismay.</p>
<p>He had over a mile to go before he came upon the scene, and when
he did get there he found that the first report had exaggerated.
Clay was not dead, but he lay unconscious on the ground, pinned
there by a great cotton-wood which had crashed down before the fury
of the wind, and which had fallen across his right leg. To move the
tree was an impossibility; but with a sailor's resourcefulness
Kettle set his men to dig beneath it, so that the imprisoned leg
might be released that way; and himself gave them a lead.</p>
<p>Clay, fortunately for himself, remained the whole time in a
state of blank unconsciousness, and at last he was released, but
with his leg horribly mangled. A hammock had meanwhile been rigged,
and in this he was carried back to the village from which they had
set out. Kettle led the retreat in front of the hammock bearers. He
left his force of soldiers and carriers to follow, or straggle, or
desert, as they pleased. The occupation of ivory raiding had
completely passed from his mind; he had forgotten his schemes of
wholesale conversion; he had nothing but Clay's welfare left at his
heart.</p>
<p>He got the wounded man under cover of one of the village huts,
and there, with the help of stimulants, poor Clay's senses came
back to him, He was lividly pale with pain and the shock, but he
was game to the backbone, and made no especial complaint. Indeed,
he was rather disposed to treat the whole thing humorously.</p>
<p>"All the result of having a musical ear," he explained. "I made
the boy who carried it put my banjo in a hollow of that tree out of
the wet, and when I saw the old stick was going to crash down, I
made a grab for the 'jo, and got it right enough. Well, I wasn't
sufficiently nippy in jumping out of the way, it seems, and as the
old banjo's busted for good, I shall have to trouble you for a
funeral march on the accordion, Skipper."</p>
<p>"Funeral be hanged!" said Kettle. "You're worth a whole cemetery
full of dead men yet."</p>
<p>"Speaking as a doctor," said Clay cheerfully, "I may tell you
that your unprofessional opinion is rot. Now, if I'd a brother
sawbones here to perform amputation, I might have a chance--say,
one in a thousand."</p>
<p>"Your leg ought to be cut off?"</p>
<p>"Just there, above the knee. That'll mortify in twenty hours
from now. Thank the Lord I never wasted much morphia on the
niggers. There's plenty in stock. So it won't worry me much."</p>
<p>"Look here," said Kettle, "I will cut that leg off for you."</p>
<p>"You! My good Skipper, you're a handy man, I know, but what the
blazes do you know about amputation?"</p>
<p>"You've got to teach me. You can show me the tools to use, and
draw diagrams of where the arteries come."</p>
<p>"By the powers, I've a great mind to. There's something pretty
rich in giving an amputation lecture with one's own femorals as a
subject."</p>
<p>"You'd better," said Kettle grimly, "or I shall cut it off
without being taught. I like you a lot too well, my man, to let you
die for want of a bit of help."</p>
<p>And so, principally because the grotesqueness of the situation
appealed to his whimsical sense of humor, Clay forthwith proceeded
to pose as an anatomy demonstrator addressing a class, and
expounded the whole art of amputation, handling the utensils of the
surgeon's craft with the gusto of an expert, and never by shudder
or sigh showing a trace of the white feather. He carried the whole
thing through with a genial gayety, pointing his sentences now with
a quip, now with some roguish sparkle of profanity, and finally he
announced that the lecture was complete and over, and then he
nodded familiarly at his wounded limb.</p>
<p>"By-bye, old hoof!" he said. "You've helped carry the rest of me
into some queer scrapes, one time and another. But we've had good
times together, as well as bad, you and I, and anyway, I'm sorry to
lose you. And now, skipper," said he, "get off your coat and wade
in. I've put on the Esmarch's bandage for you. Don't be niggardly
with the chloroform--I've got a good heart. And remember to do what
I told you about that femoral artery, and don't make a mistake
there, or else there'll be a mess on the floor. Shake hands, old
man, and good luck to your surgery; and anyway, thank you for your
trouble."</p>
<p>I fancy that I have made it clear before that Captain Kettle was
a man possessed not only of an iron nerve, but also of all a
sailor's handiness with his fingers; but here was a piece of work
that required all his coolness and dexterity. At home, on an
operating table, with everything at hand that antiseptic surgery
could provide, with highly trained surgeons and highly trained
nurses in goodly numbers, it would have been a formidable
undertaking; but there, among those savage surroundings, in that
awful loneliness which a white man feels so far away from all his
kin, it was a very different matter.</p>
<p>It makes me shiver when I think how that little sailor must have
realized his risks and his responsibility. It was a situation that
would have fairly paralyzed most men. But from what can be gathered
from the last letter that the patient ever wrote, it is clear that
Kettle carried out the operation with indomitable firmness and
decision; and if indeed some of his movements were crude, he had
grasped all the main points of his hurried teaching, and he made no
single mistake of any but pedantic importance.</p>
<p>Clay woke up from the anaesthetic, sick, shaken, but still
courageous as ever. "Well," he gasped, "you've made a fine
dot-and-go-one of me, Skipper, and that's a fact. When you chuck
the sea, and get back to England, and set up in a snug country
practice as general practitioner, you'll be able to look back on
your first operation with pride."</p>
<p>Kettle, shaken and white, regarded him from a native stool in
the middle of the hut. "I can't think," he said, "how any men can
be doctors whilst there's still a crossing to sweep."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Clay, "you're new at it now, and a bit jolted up. But
the trade has its points. I'll argue it out with you some day. But
just at present I'm going to try and sleep. I'm a bit jolted up,
too."</p>
<p>Now, it is a melancholy fact to record that Dr. Clay did not
pull round again after his accident and the subsequent operation.
To any one who knows the climate, the reason will be easily
understood. In that heated air of Central Equatorial Africa,
tainted with all manner of harmful germs, a scratch will take a
month to heal, and any considerable flesh wound may well prove a
death warrant. Captain Kettle nursed his patient with a woman's
tenderness, and Clay himself struggled gamely against his fate; but
the ills of the place were too strong for him, and the inevitable
had to be.</p>
<p>But the struggle was no quick thing of a day, or even of a week.
The man lingered wirily on, and in the mean while Kettle saw the
marvellous political structure, which with so much labor and daring
he had built up, crumbling to pieces, as it were, before his very
eyes. A company of Arab slave-traders had entered the district, and
were recapturing his subject villages one by one.</p>
<p>At the first attack runners came to him imploring help. It was
useless to send his half-baked soldiers without going himself. They
knew no other leader; there was not a negro among them fit to take
a command; and he himself was tied. He said nothing to Clay, but
just sent a refusal, and remained at his post.</p>
<p>Again and again came clamorous appeals for help against these
new invaders, and again and again he had to give the same stubborn
refusal. His vaunted New Republic was being split up again into its
primitive elements; the creed of the South Shields chapel was being
submerged under a wave of red-hot Mohammedanism; and the ivory,
that hard-earned ivory, with all its delicious potentialities, was
once more being lifted by alien raiders, and this time forever
beyond his reach.</p>
<p>Clay got some inkling of what was going on, and repeatedly urged
him to be off at once and put things straight in person. "Don't you
worry about me, Skipper," he'd say. "I'll get along here fine by
myself. Nobody'll come to worry me. And if they did, they'd let me
alone. I'm far too unwholesome-looking to chop just now."</p>
<p>But Kettle always stolidly refused to leave him. Indeed, with
difficulty (for he was at all times a painfully truthful man) he
used to lie to his patient and say that there was no need for him
to go at all; that everything was going on quite as they could
wish; and that he was vastly enjoying the relaxation of a
holiday.</p>
<p>But in sober fact things were going very much awry. And every
day they got worse. Even his original bevy of troops, those he had
brought up with him into the country on the stern-wheel launch,
seemed to grasp the fact that his star was in the descendant. There
was no open mutiny, for they still feared him too much personally
to dare that; but in the black unwatched nights they stole away
from the village, and every day their numbers thinned, and the
villagers followed their lead; and when the end came, the two
lonely white men had the village to themselves.</p>
<p>Clay's last words were typical of him. Kettle, with devotional
intent, had been singing some hymn to him, which he had composed as
being suitable for the occasion. But the dying man's ears were
dulled, and he mistook both air and words. "You're a good fellow to
sing me that," he whispered. "I know you don't like striking up
that sort of music. By Jove! I heard that song last at the Pav.
Good old Piccadilly Circus."</p>
<p>And then a little later: "I say, Skipper. I'm close on the
peg-out. There's a girl in Winchester--but hang her, anyway. No,
you've been my best pal. You're to have all my share of the
loot--the ivory, I mean. You savvy, I leave it to you in my last
will and testament, fairly and squarely. And Skipper, I'm sorry I
ragged you about your mug on those New Republic stamps. If ever a
man deserved what he wanted in that line, you're--you're--"</p>
<p>The voice failed. "Yes?" said Kettle, and stooped nearer.</p>
<p>Clay feebly winked. "You're him," he whispered. "So long, old
cock."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle buried his friend in the first gold of the next
dawn under a magnolia tree, which was hung with sweet-scented
blossoms, in the middle of the village. During the heat of the day
he composed a copy of verses to his memory, and when the sun had
dropped somewhat, he went out with his knife to carve them on the
tree above the grave.</p>
<p>It appeared that the village was not so completely deserted as
seemed to the eye, or, at any rate, that he had been watched. On
the newly turned earth was a chicken, which had been sacrificed in
the orthodox fashion; and for once he beheld the sight without
resentment.</p>
<p>He raised his hat to the dead, and "Doc," he said, "this
hen-killing is bang against my principles, but I won't say anything
now. I guess it's some nigger's way of showing respect to you, and,
by James! you're a fellow that ought to be admired. If only it
hadn't been for that tree falling down, there'd have been two men
round here that would have left their mark on Africa, and you're
one of them. Well, old man, you're gone, and I hope you're looking
down this moment--or up, as the case may be--to read this bit of
poetry I'm going to stick above your head. It's worth attention.
It's about the best sample of rhyme I ever hoisted out."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE LOOTING OF THE "INDIAN SHERIFF."</h3>
<br>
<p>Captain Kettle dived two fingers into the bowl of odorous,
orange-colored palm-oil chop, and fished out a joint suspiciously
like a nigger baby's arm. He knew it was a monkey's; or at least he
was nearly certain it was a monkey's; but he ate no more from that
particular bowl. The tribe he was with were not above suspicion of
cannibalism, and though their hospitality was lavish, it was by no
means guaranteed as to quality.</p>
<p>The head-man noticed his action, and put a smiling question:
"You no like dem climb-climb chop? Tooth him plenty sore?"</p>
<p>"No," said Kettle, "my teeth are all in good working order,
daddy, thanks. But now you mention it, the monkey is a bit tough.
Not been stewed long enough, perhaps."</p>
<p>The head-man gave an order, and presently a woman at the cooking
fire outside brought another calabash into the hut, and set it at
the little sailor's feet. The head-man examined and explained:
"Dem's dug chop, too-plenty-much fine. You fit?"</p>
<p>"I fit," said Kettle; "that'll suit me down to the ground,
daddy. Stewed duck is just the thing I like, and palm-oil sauce
isn't half bad when you're used to it. I'll recommend your pub to
my friends, old one-eye, when I get home."</p>
<p>He dipped his digits into the stew, and drew forth a doubtful
limb. He regarded it with a twitching nose and critical eye.</p>
<p>"Thundering heavy-boned duck this, of yours, daddy."</p>
<p>"Me no savvy?" said his host questioningly.</p>
<p>"I say dem dug he got big bone. He no fit for fly. He no say
quack-quack."</p>
<p>"Oh, I savvy plenty," said the one-eyed man, smiling. "Dem not
quack-quack dug, dem bow-wow dug. You see him bow-wow dis morning.
You hit him with foot, so."</p>
<p>"Ugh," said Kettle, "dog stew, is it? Yes, I know the animal, if
you say he's the one I kicked. I had watched the brute eating
garbage about the village for half an hour, and then when he wanted
to chew my leg, I hit him. Ugh, daddy, don't you bring on these
delicacies quite so sudden, or I shall forget my table manners.
African scavenger dog! And I saw him make his morning meal. Here,
Missis, for Heaven's sake take this dish away."</p>
<p>The glistening black woman stepped forward, but the head-man
stopped her. There was some mistake here. He had killed the best
dog in the village for Captain Kettle's meal, and his guest for
some fastidious reason refused to eat. He pointed angrily to the
figured bowl. "Dug chop," said he. "Too-much-good. You chop him."
This rejection of excellent food was a distinct slur on his
m&eacute;nage, and he was working himself up into passion. "You
chop dem dug chop one-time," he repeated.</p>
<p>The situation was growing strained, and might well culminate in
fisticuffs. But Captain Kettle, during his recent many months'
sojourn as a lone white man in savage Africa, had acquired one
thing which had never burdened him much before, and that was tact.
He did not openly resent the imperative tone of his host, which any
one who had known him previously would have guessed to be his first
impulse. But neither at the same time did he permit himself to be
forced into eating the noxious meal. He temporized. With that queer
polyglot called Coast English, and with shreds from a score of
native dialects, he made up a tattered fabric of speech which
beguiled the head-man back again into good humor; and presently
that one-eyed savage squatted amicably down on his heels, and gave
an order to one of his wives in attendance.</p>
<p>The lady brought Kettle's accordion, and the little sailor
propped his back against the wattle wall of the hut, and made
music, and lifted up his voice in song. The tune carried among the
lanes and dwellings of the village, and naked feet
<i>pad-padded</i> quickly up over dust and the grass; the audience
distributed itself within and without the head-man's hut, and
listened enrapt; and the head-man felt the glow of satisfaction
that a London hostess feels when she has hired for money the most
popular drawing-room entertainer of the day, and her guests
condescend to enjoy, and not merely to exhibit themselves as
<i>blases</i>.</p>
<p>But Captain Kettle, it must be confessed, felt none of the
artist's pride in finding his art appreciated. He had always the
South Shields chapel at the back of his mind, with its austere code
and creed, and he felt keenly the degradation of lowering himself
to the level of the play-actor; even though he was earning his bare
existence--and had been doing all through the heart of barbarous
Africa--by mumming and carolling to tribes whose trade was murder
and cannibalism.</p>
<p>He felt an infinite pity for himself when he reflected that many
a time nothing but a breakdown, or a loudly bawled hymn, or a
series of twisted faces, had been the only thing which stood
between him and the cooking fires. But there was no help for it. He
was a fighting man, but he could not do battle with a continent;
and so he had either to take the only course which remained, and
lower himself (as he considered it) to the level of the music-hall
pariah, and mouth and mow to amuse the mob, or else accept the
alternative which even the bravest of men might well shrink from in
dismay.</p>
<p>His travel through the black heart of this black continent may
have been paralleled by that of other obscure heroes who voyaged
from grim necessity and not for advertisement, but the history of
it, as it was told me in his simple log-book style, far surpasses
the wonder of any of those travels which find a place in published
volumes. He had started, a completely destitute man, from a spot
far up on the Haut Congo, amidst treacherous hostile population. He
had not a friend in Africa, black or white. He had no resources
save his tongue, his thews, an empty revolver, and his mother wit,
and yet he had won a slow way down to the western seaboard through
a hundred hostile tribes, where an army would have been eaten up,
and a Marco Polo might well have failed.</p>
<p>It would suit my pleasure finely to write of this terrific
journey, with its dangers, its finesses, and its infinite escapes;
it would gratify me to the quick if I might belaud to the full of
my appreciation the endurance, and the grand resourcefulness, of
this little sailor cast so desperately out of his more native
element; but the account of the travel is reserved for the pen of
Captain Kettle himself, and so the more professional scribe may not
poach upon his territory.</p>
<p>I had it from his own lips that the perils of the way made him
see the poetry of it all, and he said to himself that here was the
theme for that great epic, which would be the <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>
of his literary life. It is to be written in blank verse, with the
hymns and secular songs he sang at each stop given in an appendix,
and he confidently hopes that it will stand out as something
conspicuous and distinct against the sombre background of prosaic
travel books.</p>
<p>His arrival at the coast was an achievement that made him almost
faint with joy. Xenophon and his ten thousand Greeks hailed the
sea, we are told, with a mighty shout. But to them Thalassa was
merely a way-mark, a sign that they were nearing home. To Kettle it
was more, far more, although he could not define the relationship.
He had dwelt upon the sea the greater part of his days; he had got
his meagre living from her; and although at all times she had been
infinitely hard and cruel to him, and he had cursed her day in and
day out with all a seaman's point and fluency, she had wrapped
herself into his being in a way he little guessed, till separation
showed him the truth.</p>
<p>He had seen the glint of her through the trees as he entered
this last village of his march, but the air was too dull with heat
for him to catch so much as a whiff of her refreshing saltness, and
for the present he could not go down to greet her. He was still the
lonely troubadour, dressed in a native cloth around the loins, with
a turban of rags upon his head, and a battered accordion slung from
his back, come in from afar to sing and pull faces for a
dinner.</p>
<p>The meal, for reasons which have been stated, was not a success,
but payment had to be rendered all the same. He sang with noise,
and made antics such as experience had taught him would be
acceptable; and the audience, to whom a concert of this kind was a
rarity, howled to him to go on. There was no escape. He had to sing
till he could sing no more. It was far on into the night when a
couple of native <i>tom-tom</i> players rescued him. The musical
appetites of the village had been whetted rather than appeased, and
as no more could be got out of this wandering minstrel, why then
they were quite ready to listen to local instruments and
melody.</p>
<p>Dancing commenced, and the heat and the noise grew, and
presently Kettle managed to slip away and walk out through the yam
and manioc gardens, and the banana groves, to the uproarious beach
beyond. He threw himself wearily down on the warm white sand, and
when the great rollers swept in and crashed into noisy bellowing
surf, the spindrift from it drove on him, and refreshed him
luxuriously. It was almost worth going through all he had suffered
to enjoy the pleasures of that greeting.</p>
<p>For long-enough he filled his eye on the creaming fringes of the
surf, and then he glanced over it at the purple plain of ocean
which lay level and unruffled beyond. A great African moon glowed
above it in the night, and the lonely vastness of it all gratified
him like the presence of a friend. "You are a decent old puddle,"
he murmured to himself, "though I say it that's got precious little
from you beyond mud and slashing. It's good to be back in reach of
the stink of you again."</p>
<p>He lay on where he was deep into the night, revelling in the
companionship of the sea, till the many-colored land-crabs began to
regard him as mere jetsam. He was not consciously thinking. He was
letting his mind rest in an easy torpor; but from time to time he
let his eyes range through the purple dark with a seaman's
mechanical watchfulness. The noise of the <i>tom-toms</i> and the
dancing from the village behind him had died away, and nothing but
the sounds from the bush, and the din of the surf, remained to show
that the world was alive. The moon, too, had been smothered by a
cloud bank, and night lay huddled close round him, with a texture
like black velvet.</p>
<p>Then, with a jump he was on his feet, and trembling violently.
Another old friend was in his neighborhood--a steamer. Her masthead
light had just twinkled into view. He got up and began walking
nervously toward her along the hard, white sands. He saw her first
in the northwest, coming from some port in the Bight of Biafra
probably, and the odds were she was heading south along the
Coast.</p>
<p>Presently he picked up her red port light. Yes, he admitted to
himself with a sigh, she was making for one of the ports to
southward, for Sette Camma perhaps, or Loango, or Landana, or
Kabenda, and he calmed himself down with the discovery. Had she
been heading north, he had it in him to have swum out to her
through the surf and the sharks, and chanced being picked up. He
was sick of this savage Africa which lay behind him. The sight of
those two lights, the bright white, and the duller red, let him
know how ravenous was his hunger to see once more a white man and a
white man's ship, and to feel the sway of a deck, and to smell the
smells of oil, and paint, and Christian cookery, from which he had
been for such a weary tale of days divorced.</p>
<p>The steamer drew on till she came a-beam, and the red port light
was eclipsed, and "carrying no stern light," was Captain Kettle's
comment. There was a small glow from her deck and two or three of
her ports were lit, but for the most part she crept along as a
mysterious black ship voyaging into a region of blackness. It was
too dark to make out more than her bare existence, but Kettle took
a squint at the Southern Cross, which hung low in the sky like an
ill-made kite, to get her bearings, and so made note of her course,
and from that tried to deduce her nationality.</p>
<p>From the way she was steering he reckoned she came from Batanga
or Cameroons, which are in German territory, and so set her down as
sailing originally from Marseilles or Hamburg, and anyway decided
that she was not one of the Liverpool boats which carry all the
West Coast trade to England. But as he watched, she seemed to slew
out of her course. She lengthened out before him across the night,
as her bows sheered in toward the land, till he saw her broadside
on, and then she hung motionless as a black blot against the
greater blackness beyond.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle summed the situation: "Rounded up and come to an
anchor. There'll be a factory somewhere on the beach there. But I
don't know, though. That one-eyed head-man said nothing about a
factory, and if there was one, why doesn't she whistle to raise 'em
up so's they'd be ready to bring off their bit o' trade in the
surf-boats when day breaks?"</p>
<p>A cloud slid away in the sky, and the moon shone out like the
suddenly opened bulb of a dark lantern. The oily surface of the sea
flashed up into sight, and on it sat the steamer--a picture in
black and silver. She lay there motionless as the trees on the
beach, and the reason for her state was clear. Her forefoot soared
stiffly aloft till it was almost clear of the water; her stern was
depressed; her decks listed to port till it was an acrobatic feat
to make passageway along them.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle whistled to himself long and dismally. "Piled her
up," he muttered, "that's what her old man has done. Hit a half-ebb
reef, and fairly taken root there. He's not shoved on his engines
astern either, and that means she's ripped away half her bottom,
and he thinks she'll founder in deep water if he backs her off the
ground." A tiny spit of flame, pale against the moonlight, jerked
out from under the awnings of the steamer's upper bridge. The noise
of the shot came some time afterward, no louder than the cracking
of a knuckle. "By James! somebody's getting his gun into use pretty
quick. Well, it's some one else's trouble, and not mine, and I
guess I'm going to stay on the beach, and watch, and not meddle."
He frowned angrily as though some one had made a suggestion to him.
"No, by James! I'm not one of those that seeks trouble
unnecessarily."</p>
<p>But all the same he walked off briskly along the sand, keeping
his eyes fixed on the stranded steamer. That some sort of a scuffle
was going on aboard of her was clear from the shouts and the
occasional pistol shots, which became louder as he drew more near;
and Captain Kettle, connoisseur as he was of differences of this
sort on the high seas, became instinctively more and more
interested. And at last when he came to a small canoe drawn up on
the beach above high-water mark, he paused beside it with a mind
loaded with temptation as deep as it would carry.</p>
<p>The canoe was a dug-out, a thing of light cotton-wood, with
washboards forward to carry it through a surf. A couple of paddles
and a calabash formed its furniture, and its owner probably lived
in the village where he had sung for his dinner over-night. Of
course, to borrow her--merely to borrow her, of course--without
permission was--</p>
<p>Another splatter of pistol shots came from the steamer, and a
yelping of negro voices. Captain Kettle hesitated no longer. He
laid hands on the canoe's gunwale, and ran her down into the edge
of the surf. He had barely patience to wait for a smooth, but,
after three rollers had roared themselves into yeast and quietude,
he ran his little craft out till the water was arm-pit deep, and
then scrambled on board and paddled furiously.</p>
<p>But it is not given to the European to equal the skill of the
black on African surf beaches, and, as might be expected, the next
roller that swooped in overended the canoe, and sent it spinning
like a toy through the broken water. But Captain Kettle had gained
some way; and if he could not paddle the little craft to sea, he
could at least swim her out; and this he proceeded to do. He was as
handy as an otter in the water, and besides, there was something
here which was dragging him to seaward very strongly. His soul
lusted for touch with a steamer again with a fierceness which he
did not own even to himself. Even a wrecked steamer was a thing of
kinship to him then.</p>
<p>He swam the dug-out through the last drench and backtow of the
surf, rocked her clear from part of her watery load, and then, with
a feeling of relief, clambered gingerly on board and baled the rest
over the gunwale with his hands. It is not good to stay over-long
in these seas which fringe the West African beaches, by reason of
the ground shark which makes them his hunting-ground. And then he
manned the paddle, knelt in the stern, and went the shortest way to
the steamer which perched on the rock.</p>
<p>The moon was still riding in the sky, but burnt with a pale
light now, as dawn had jumped up from behind the shore forests. All
things were shown clearly. Among other matters, Kettle noted from
trifles in her garnishing, which read clear as print to a seaman's
eye, that the steamer was not French or German as he had guessed
before, but hailed from his own native islands. Moreover, her
funnel told him that she was not one of the two regular lines from
Liverpool, which do all the commerce of the coast. But he had no
time for fresh speculations just then as to her business. The
scuffling on board had been growing more and more serious, and it
was clear that the blacks of her complement were giving the whites
more than they cared about.</p>
<p>Kettle knew enough of the custom of the Coast to be able to sum
the situation. "Her Krooboys have broken out of hand," he
commented. "That's what's the trouble. You come down here from
England with just enough white men to handle your vessel to Sierra
Leone, and then you ship Krooboys to work cargo and surf-boats, and
do everything except steer, and as long as nothing happens, your
Krooboy is a first-class hand. Two cupfuls of rice and a bit offish
is all the grub he wants; he'll work sixteen hours a day without a
grunt; and he'll handle a winch or a steam crane with any Geordie
donkey-man that has been grounded in the shops. But just put your
steamboat on the ground where he thinks she can't get off, and
there's a different tune to play. He's got a notion that the ship's
his, and the cargo's his, to loot as he likes, and if he doesn't
get 'em both, he's equal to making trouble. Seems to me he's making
bad trouble now."</p>
<p>By this time it was plain that the black men had got entire
possession of the lower parts of the ship. The small handful of
whites were on the top of the fiddley, and while most were fighting
to keep the Africans back, a couple were frenziedly working to get
a pair of davits swung outboard, and a lifeboat which hung from
them lowered into the water. It was clear they had given up all
hope of standing by the ship; and presently they got the boat
afloat, and slid down to her in hurried clusters by the davit
falls, and then unhooked and rowed away from the steamer's side in
a skelter of haste. Coals and any other missile that came handy
were showered upon them by the Krooboys who manned the rail, to
which they replied with a few vicious revolver shots; and then the
boat drew out of range.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle, in his clumsy canoe, paddled up close to her and
nodded, and gave the boat's people a "good-morning." The greeting
was quaintly enough out of place, but nobody seemed to notice that.
Each party was too occupied in staring at the other. Those in the
lifeboat saw a little lean European, naked to the waist, clad only
in a turban and native cloth, and evidently (from the color of his
skin) long inured to that state. Kettle saw a huddle of fugitives,
all of them scared, and many of them bloody with wounds.</p>
<p>The man who was steering the white boat, the steamer's mate he
was, according to the gold lace on his cuff, spoke first.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "you're a funny enough looking beachcomber.
What do you want, anyway?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle felt himself to redden all over under the tan of
his skin. Neatness in clothes was always a strong point with him,
and he resented the barbarism of his present get-up acutely. "If I
wanted a job at teaching manners, I could find one in your boat,
that's certain," was his prompt retort. "And when I'd finished with
that, I could give some of you a lesson in pluck without much harm
being done. I wonder if you call yourselves white men to let a
crowd of niggers clear you out of your ship like that?"</p>
<p>"Now, look here, Robinson Crusoe," said the man at the steering
oar, "our tempers are all filed up on the raw edge just now, and if
you give much lip, this boat will be rowed over the top of your
Noah's ark before you know what's hit it. You paddle back to your
squaw and piccaninnies on the beach, Robinson, and don't you come
out here to mock your betters when they're down on their luck.
We've nothing to give you except ugly words, and you'll get them
cheap."</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Mate," said Kettle, "I haven't heard white man's
English for a year, but if you can teach me anything new, I'm here
to learn. I've come across most kinds of failure in my time, but a
white man who lets himself be kicked off his ship by a parcel of
Krooboys, and who disgraces Great Britain by being a blooming
Englishman, is a specimen that's new to me. But perhaps I'm making
a mistake? Perhaps you're a Dutchman or a Dago that's learnt the
language? Or perhaps, to judge from that cauliflower nose of yours,
you're something that's escaped out of a freak museum? You haven't
a photo about you by any chance? I'd like to send one home to South
Shields. My Missis is a great hand at collecting curiosities which
you only see in foreign parts."</p>
<p>The mate bent on the steering gear with sudden violence, turned
the lifeboat's head with a swirl, and began sculling her toward the
canoe. But a tall, thin man sitting beside him in the stern-sheets
said something to him in an undertone, and the Mate reluctantly let
the oar drag limp in the water, and sat himself down, and
ostentatiously made ready to roll a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Now, look here," said the tall man, "I don't suppose you want
to quarrel."</p>
<p>"I've been in quarrels before for the sheer fun of the thing,"
said Kettle, who was determined that at any rate no apology should
come from his side.</p>
<p>"So have I," said the tall man, "but I've no time for empty
amusement just now. I'm down here on business. I'm trying to start
a new steamer line to work this Coast and get away the monopoly
from the other companies. That boat stuck yonder--the <i>Indian
Sheriff</i> she's called--is my venture, and she represents about
all I've got, and she isn't underwritten for a sixpence. I've been
going nap or nothing on this scheme, and at present it looks
uncommon like nothing. What I'm anxious about now, is to see if I
can't make some arrangement for salvage."</p>
<p>"I can understand it would be useful to you."</p>
<p>"It might be useful to others besides me. Now, there's you, for
instance. I dare say you've got a nice little establishment ashore,
and some simple comforts, and a bit of influence in your village.
But you spoke about your wife at home in South Shields just now,
and I make no doubt that if you'd got a tidy sum of money in your
pocket you'd be as pleased as not to get home to her again?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle was on the point of breaking out into
explanations and disavowals, but a thought came to him, and he
refrained.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "I'm waiting to hear your offer."</p>
<p>"Here it is, then. You go ashore now, raise your village, bring
off every nigger you can scare up, swamp the Krooboys on that
steamboat and keep her from being looted, and I solemnly promise
you 25 per cent. of her value and the value of what she has in
her."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Kettle thoughtfully. "That's a square enough offer,
and it's made before witnesses, and I believe the courts would make
you stick to it."</p>
<p>"Ho!" grunted the Mate, "Robinson's a sea lawyer, is he? Courts,
he talks about."</p>
<p>Kettle ignored the suggestion. "Should I know your name, sir?"
he asked of the tall man.</p>
<p>"I'm Nicholson Sheriff. If you know Liverpool, you'll have heard
of me."</p>
<p>"You were with Kevendales?"</p>
<p>"That's me. I left there two years ago, to start on my own."</p>
<p>"H'm," said the little sailor in the canoe. "I was master of one
of Kevendale's ships once. It was me that had misfortune with the
<i>Armenia</i>."</p>
<p>"By gum! are you Captain Kettle that piled up the old
<i>Atrocity</i> on that iceberg? I'm sorry to see you come down to
this, Captain."</p>
<p>"Captain Kettle," said the sulky Mate, "that was in the Congo
Pilot Service?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Kettle.</p>
<p>"Then, Captain," said the Mate, "I take back what I said about
you being Robinson Crusoe. You may have met with misfortune, but,
by the Lord, you're a man all the way through. You've made the
ports down there on the Congo just ring with the way you kept your
end up with those beastly Belgians. And now when any Englishman
goes ashore at Boma or Matadi or any place on the river, they're
fit to eat him."</p>
<p>The compliment had its doubtful side, but Kettle bowed with
pleasure. "Mr. Mate," he said, "I should have been more polite to
you. I forgot you were a man who had just come through an anxious
time."</p>
<p>"Anxious time! My holy grandmother! You should have just seen.
It was my watch below when she took the ground, and I give you my
word for it, there's deep water marked in the chart where she
struck. Third mate had the bridge, and he rang for engines hard
astern. Nothing happened. From the first moment she hit, the
Krooboys got the notion she was their ship by all the rules of the
Coast, and they played up to that tune like men. They bashed in the
heads of the two engineers who tried to handle the reversing gear,
and fairly took the ship below; and when the old man came out in
his pyjamas and started his fancy shooting on deck, they just ran
in on him and pulled him into kybobs.</p>
<p>"The second mate pegged out a week ago with black-water fever.
So there was only me and Mr. Sheriff here, and the third left that
were worth counting." He wagged a stubby finger contemptuously at
the rest of his boat's crew. "Half this crowd don't know enough
English to take a wheel, and the rest of them come from happy
Dutchland, where they don't make soldiers, bless their silly eyes.
I can tell you I'm not feeling sweet about it myself. I left a bran
new suit of clothes and an Accra finger-ring on that blame'
ship."</p>
<p>"Well, never mind the rest of the tale now," said Sheriff. "Here
we are kicked overboard, and glad enough to save our bare skins,
I'll own. We won't go into the question of manning British ships
with foreigners just now. What's interesting me is the fact that
those Krooboys have got hatches off already, and are standing by
the cranes and winches. I've seen them work cargo before all up and
down the coast, and know the pace they can put into it, and if we
don't move quick they'll scoff that ship clear down to the ceilings
of her holds." A winch chain rattled, and a sling load of cloth
bales swung up to one of her derrick sheaves. "My faith, look at
that! They've begun to broach cargo by now, and there are some of
the beggars setting to lower the surf-boats to ferry it on to the
beach."</p>
<p>The Mate rapped out sulphurous wishes for the Krooboys' future
state.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said Sheriff, "but we're wasting time. Come now,
Captain, you heard my offer, and you seemed to like it. I'm waiting
for you to fill your part of the bargain. Away with you ashore, and
bring off your army and take possession."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid, sir," said Kettle honestly, "you've been taking a
little too much for granted. I've got no establishment ashore. I'm
just what you see--a common tramp, or worse, seeing that I've been
play-acting for my dinners of late. And as for any help those
niggers ashore could give, why, I shouldn't recommend it. The
one-eyed old son of a dog who's head-man, has served on ships
according to his own telling, and he'll have the same notions about
loot as your own Krooboys. The Coast nigger hereabouts has got a
fancy that any ship on the beach is cumshaw for himself, and you'll
not knock it out of him without some hard teaching. No, Mr.
Sheriff, to call in that one-eyed head-man and his friends--who it
makes me hot to think I had to sing and dance to not six hours
back--would only pile up the work ahead of us. Much best tackle the
ship as she is."</p>
<p>"What!" said Sheriff. "Do you mean to say we can retake her? You
don't know what those boys are like. I tell you they were fair
demons when we left, and they'll be worse now, because they are
certain to have got liquor inside them by this. It's not a bit of
use your counting on these deckhands and stokers in the boat.
They're not a penn'oth of use, the whole lot of them."</p>
<p>"Well," said Kettle diffidently, "I'd got my eye on that packet
of cartridge beside you on the thwart. If they were
four-fiftys--"</p>
<p>"They are--let's look--four--five--nought. Yes, well?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle pulled a well-cleaned revolver out of his
waist-cloth. "I've carried this empty for a whole year now, sir,
but I don't think I've forgot my shooting."</p>
<p>"I can speak here," said the Mate. "I've heard of his usefulness
that way on the Congo. When Captain Kettle lets off his gun, Mr.
Sheriff, it's a funeral. By gum, if he's a way of getting the ship
again, I'm on for helping. Look! There's that steward's boy, Tins,
going into my room this minute. I've a suit of clothes there that
have never been put on, and he'll have them for a cert if we don't
look quick."</p>
<p>"Now then, Captain," said Sheriff, "if there's anything going to
be done, get a move on you."</p>
<p>Kettle paddled the dug-out alongside, and stepped into the
lifeboat. His eye glittered as he tore open the wrapping of the
cartridges and reloaded his revolver. It was long since he had
known the complacent feel of the armed man.</p>
<p>"Now," he said, "there's one more thing. I'm not in uniform, but
I hold a master's ticket, and I've got to be skipper."</p>
<p>"You can take the berth for me," said the Mate. "I'll say
outright it's a lot above my weight."</p>
<p>"And I've offered it to you already," said Sheriff. "Go on, man,
and give your orders."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle's first desire was to get back to the steamer
whence the boat had come, and this the mixed crew of foreigners at
the oars had scruples about carrying out. But Kettle and the Mate
got furiously at work on them with their hands, and in less than a
minute the men were doing as they were bidden, except, that is, a
trio who were too badly wounded to sit up, and who were allowed to
wallow on the floor gratings.</p>
<p>The Mate straddled in the stern and steered her with an oar, and
the white painted boat pulled heavily toward the stranded vessel.
The Krooboys in possession were quick to see her coming. A mob of
them gathered on the bridge deck, gibbering and shouting, and
threatening with their hands; and even before the boat drew within
range, they commenced a vigorous fusilade of coal lumps. Kettle had
all a cleanly man's dislike for these dirty missiles, and he halted
the boat just beyond the limit of their fire, and stood up himself,
and sighted the revolver over the crook of his left elbow.</p>
<p>He dropped one man, and the others raged at him. He dropped a
second, and still with an impotent courage they stood their ground.
He brought a third shrieking to the deck, and then, and not before,
did the others turn to run, and he shot a fourth to hurry their
going. Then he turned to the rowers in the lifeboat. "Give way, you
thieves," he shouted at them; "set me aboard whilst the coast is
clear.--Mr. Mate, round her up under those davit tackles."</p>
<p>Again the Krooboys tried to prevent the boarding, but again the
fire of that terrible revolver drove them yelping to shelter, and
the boat drew up with a bump and a swirl under the dangling ropes.
Kettle clambered forward along the thwarts, and swarmed up one fall
with a monkey's quickness, and the Mate, a man of wooden courage,
raced him up the other. Sheriff could not climb; they had to haul
him up the ship's side by brute force in a bowline; and
providentially they were allowed to do this uninterrupted. The
foreign crew of the lifeboat, limp with scare, would have been mere
slaughter-pigs on board even if they could have been lured there,
which was improbable, and so they were bidden to haul off out of
shot, and wait till they were needed.</p>
<p>Now there was no question here of risking a hand-to-hand
encounter. The Krooboys on board mustered quite fifty head, and
most of them were men of enormous physical strength. So the three
invaders went into the chart-house, from the ports of which they
could command the bridge deck and the main fore deck, and shot the
door-bolts by way of making themselves secure. The walls were of
iron, and the roof was of iron; the place was a perfect stronghold
in its way; and as there was no chance of its being stormed without
due notice, they tacitly called a halt to recover breath.</p>
<p>"Here," said Sheriff, "is the poor old skipper's whisky. I guess
a second mate's nip all round will do us no harm."</p>
<p>"Here," said Kettle, "are the old man's Canary cigars, nice and
black and flavory, and I guess one of them's more in my line, sir,
thanking you all the same. I haven't come across a Christian smoke
for more dreary months than I care to think about."</p>
<p>The Mate was peering through one of the forward ports. "There's
the door of my room wide open," he grunted. "I bet those new
clothes of mine are gone. They're just the thing to take a nigger's
eye--good thick blue broadcloth."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle wiped the perspiration from his forehead with a
bare, sinewy arm. "Now," he said, "enough time's been wasted. We
must keep those toughs on the move, or they'll find leisure to
think, and be starting some fresh wickedness."</p>
<p>"If we go out of this chart-house," said Sheriff doubtfully,
"they'll swamp us by sheer weight. You must remember we've only got
two pistols, yours and mine. The poor old skipper's is lost."</p>
<p>"I'm going to try what a little quiet talking-to will do first,
sir. I used to be a bit useful with my tongue, if I haven't lost
the trick. But before that, I'm going to borrow this white drill
coat and pants of your late old man's, if you don't mind. You'd
hardly think it, sir, if you knew the trials I've gone through in
that beastly Africa, but I believe it's the want of a decent pair
of trousers that's hurt me more than anything."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle dressed himself with care, and put on a
white-covered uniform cap; and then, happening to see a pair of
scissors, he took them up and trimmed his beard before the glass.
Sheriff looked on at these preparations with fidgeting impatience,
and from without there was a clamor of negro voices taking counsel.
But the little sailor was not to be hurried. He went through his
toilet with solemn deliberation, and then he opened the chart-house
door and went out beneath the baking sunshine of the bridge-deck
beyond.</p>
<p>A cluster of Krooboys stood at the further end of it, cackling
with talk, and at sight of him they called their friends on the
main deck below, who began to come up as fast as they could get
foot on the ladders. They showed inclinations for a rush, but
Kettle held up his left hand for them to keep back, and they obeyed
the order. They saw that vicious revolver gripped in his right
fingers, and they respected its powers.</p>
<p>He addressed them with a fine fluency of language. He had a good
command of sailor's English, and also of Coast English, both of
which are specially designed for forcible comment; and he knew,
moreover, scraps from a score of native dialects, which, having
Arabic for a groundwork, are especially rich in those parts of
speech-which have the highest vituperative value. The black man is
proverbially tough, and a whip, moral or physical, which will cut
the most hardened of whites to ribbons, will leave him unmoved. An
artist in words may rail at him for an hour without making him
flicker an eyelash, or a Yankee mate might hammer him with a
packing-case lid (always supposing there was no nail in it) for a
like period without jolting from him so much as a cry or a groan.
And so I think it speaks highly for Captain Kettle's powers when,
at the end of three minutes' talk, he caused many of those Krooboys
to visibly wince.</p>
<p>You cannot touch a Krooboy's feelings by referring insultingly
to his mother, because he has probably very dim recollections of
the lady; you can not rile him by gibing comments on his personal
appearance; but still there are ways of getting home to him, and
Kettle knew the secret. "You make fight-palaver," he said, "you
steal, you take ship, you drink cargo gin, and you think your
<i>ju-ju</i> fine <i>ju-ju.</i> But my <i>ju-ju</i> too-plenty-much
better, and I fit for show it you again if dis steal-palaver no
stop one-time."</p>
<p>They began to move threateningly toward him. "Very well," he
said, "then I tell you straight; you no fit to be called black
boys. You bushmen. Bah! you be bushmen."</p>
<p>The maddened Krooboys ran in, and the wicked revolver spoke out,
and then Kettle nipped into the deck-house and slammed the door to
on his heels. The black ape-like faces jabbered and mowed at the
window ports, and brawny arms were thrust in, grappling viciously,
but the Mate drew out camp-stools from a locker, and with these the
three white men stabbed and hit at every face or arm which showed
itself. There was no more shooting, and there was no need for it.
By sheer weight of blows the whites kept the enemy from climbing
through the windows, and so long as the windows were not stormed,
the iron house was safe to them. And presently one of the head-men
blew his boatswain's whistle, and the attack drew off.</p>
<p>Promptly Kettle reloaded his revolver and stepped out into the
open. "Now," he said, "you seen my <i>ju-ju?</i> You savvy him
too-big <i>ju-ju</i>? You want any more of it? No. Then get away
aft with you. You hear? You lib for bottom deck back there,
one-time." He rushed at them, one slight, slim, white-clad white
man against all that reeking, shining mob, and they struggled away
before him in grotesque tumblings and jostlings, like a flock of
sheep.</p>
<p>But at the break of the deck he paused and looked below him, and
the fight all dropped away from his face. No. 3 hatch lay open
before him, with the covers thrown here and there. From it was
creeping up a thin blue smoke, with now and then a scarlet trail of
flame. Here was a complication.</p>
<p>"So you gluttonous, careless brutes have set fire to her, have
you? Here, who was in the engine room?"</p>
<p>Discipline was coming back. A man in black trousers, with a
clout round his neck, stepped out.</p>
<p>"You? Well, slip below, and turn steam into the donkey."</p>
<p>"Steam no lib, sar. Cranes die when we try to work him just
now."</p>
<p>"Oh, you holy crowd of savages! Well, if we can't use the hose,
you must hand buckets--and sharp, too. That fire's gaining. Now
then, head-men, step out."</p>
<p>"I second head-man, sar."</p>
<p>"I head-man, sar."</p>
<p>"Get buckets, tubs, tins--anything that'll hold water, and look
sharp. If you boys work well now, I'll overlook a lot that's been
done. If you don't, I'll give you fits. Try and get below, some of
you, and pull away what's burning. Probably you'll find some of
your dear relations down there, drunk on gin and smoking pipes. You
may knock them on the head if you like, and want to do a bit more
murder. They deserve it."</p>
<p>But though half a dozen of the Krooboys, who were now thoroughly
tamed, tried to get down the hatch, the fire was too strong for
them. Even the water when it came did little to check the burning,
for though it sent up great billows of steam, the flames shot out
fiercer and higher every moment. In that sweltering climate it does
not take very much inducement to make a fire settle down thoroughly
to work, once it gets anything like a tolerable start.</p>
<p>To add to the trouble, news of the wreck had been carried to the
village behind the beach where Captain Kettle had sung for his
lodging over-night, and the one-eyed head-man there and his friends
were coming off to share in the spoil as fast as canoes could bring
them. They, too, would have their theories as to the ownership of
wrecked cargoes on the West African Coast, and as they were
possessed of trade guns, they were not like to forego what they
considered their just rights without further fighting.</p>
<p>But as it happened, a period was put to the scene on the steamer
with considerable suddenness. Sheriff, who had been making sure
that there were no Krooboys lurking forward who could take them
from the rear, came up and looked upon the fire with a blanched
face. "Excuse me, Skipper," he said, and turned and bawled for the
lifeboat to come alongside.</p>
<p>"No hurry for that yet," said Kettle, angrily. "Don't scare the
men, sir. And don't you give orders without my sanction. You made
me Captain here, and, by James! Captain I'll be. We're handicapped
for want of the hose, but we're going to try and get this fire
under without. Anyway, there's no question of leaving the ship
yet."</p>
<p>"Good God, man, don't niggle about that now. I know what I'm
saying. There's eight tons of powder in that hold."</p>
<p>"And we may be blown up against the sky as a thin kind of rain
any minute? Well, sir, you're owner, and as you seem to have acted
as purser on board, you ought to know. But hadn't we better ask the
Mate for his cargo-book first, so as to make sure?"</p>
<p>He turned and looked, but Sheriff had gone, and was sliding down
into the lifeboat which had come alongside. "Well, I don't like
leaving the ship, and I suppose for that matter he wouldn't either,
being owner, and being uninsured. But as Mr. Sheriff's gone in such
a blazing hurry, it's probably time for me to go too, if I'm to
land home any time in South Shields again." He hailed the lower
deck with a sharp order. "You boys, there, knock off. Knock off
work, I say, and throw down your buckets. There's powder stowed
down below, and it'll be going off directly. Gunpowder, you savvy,
shoot-powder, go <i>fizz--boosh--bang</i>!"</p>
<p>There was a sharp clatter of understanding and explanation, but
no movement. The African is not great at making deductions. Captain
Kettle had to give a definite order. "Now, overboard with you, all
hands, and lib for beach. No time for lower boats. You all fit for
swim."</p>
<p>They took the hint, and began leaping the bulwark rail like a
swarm of black frogs. "Good-by, boys," he said, in valediction.
"You'll find it cheaper to be good and virtuous next time. You
haven't stay enough in you for a real good fight." And then he went
to where the davits dangled over the water, and slid down to the
boat, while the frightened crew cursed him aloud for keeping them
waiting.</p>
<p>Not much was said as they rowed away. The all-nation rowers were
openly terrified; the Mate had all his attention used up in
steering to a hair; and Sheriff sat with his shoulders humped
beside his ears in the position of a man who expects a blow.
Captain Kettle held his peace. He knew that mere words could not
urge the sweating crew to heavier effort, and he puffed at his
treasured cigar as any smoker would who had been divorced from
tobacco for so many a month, and does not know when he will meet
with his next indulgence.</p>
<p>And in due time the powder was fired, and the steamer was turned
into a vast volcano of steam and smoke and flame, which vomited
iron and human limbs, and which sent forth an air blast which drove
the boat before it like the hurricane of a tornado. And then the
<i>debris</i> from the sky foamed down into the water, and then
there was a long, long silence. Save for some inconsiderable
flotsam, the steamer and all that was in her had vanished
eternally. The canoes from the village were paddling for the beach
again. They were alone on a lonely sea. No man seemed to have a
thought he wished to share.</p>
<p>The Mate was the first to speak. He patted a bundle whose outer
housing was a pillow-case, which lay on the thwart beside him.
"Well," he said, "it's been a close thing. I darn nearly lost those
new clothes of mine."</p>
<p>"It might have been worse," said Sheriff; "we might well all
have been killed. But as it is," he added with a sigh, "we've
merely got to start fresh from the bottom again. Anyway, Kettle,
I'm obliged to you for what you have done."</p>
<p>The little sailor frowned. "It's kind of you, sir, to say that.
But I hate being beaten. And it's no excuse to say I did my best. I
hadn't figured on that fire and the powder, and that's a fact."</p>
<p>"I wonder," said the Mate thoughtfully, "which of those beggars
scoffed that gold zodiac ring of mine. That steward's boy, Tins, I
expect. Took the ring and left the new blue suit. Well, by gum,
they're a funny lot, those boys."</p>

<h3>THE WIRE-MILKERS</h3>
<br>
<p>"Look here," said Sheriff, "you compel me to be brutal, but the
fact is, they've had enough of you here in Lagos. So far as I can
see, you've only got the choice of two things. You can have a free
passage home to England as a Distressed Seaman by the next steamer,
and you know what that means. The steamer gets paid a shilling a
day, and grubs and berths you accordingly, and you earn your 'bacca
money by bumming around the galley and helping the cook peel spuds.
Or else, if you don't like that, you can do the sensible thing, and
step into the billet I offer you."</p>
<p>"By James!" said Kettle, "who's going to turn me out of Lagos;
tell me that, sir?"</p>
<p>"Don't get wrathful with me. I'm only telling you what you'll
find out to be the square truth if you stay on long enough. The
authorities here will be equal to handling you if you try to buck
against them."</p>
<p>"But, sir, they have no right to touch me. This isn't French
territory, or German, or any of those clamped-down places. The
town's as English as Liverpool, and I'm a respectable man."</p>
<p>"The trouble of it is," said Sheriff drily, "they say you are
not. There are a limited number of white men here in Lagos--perhaps
two hundred all told--and their businesses and sources of income
are all more or less visible to the naked eye. Yours aren't. In the
language of the--er--well--the police court, you've no visible
means of subsistence, and yet you always turn out neat, and spruce,
and tidy; you've always got tobacco; and apparently you must have
meals now and again, though I can't say you've got particularly fat
on them."</p>
<p>"I've never been a rich man, sir. I've never earned high
wages--only once as much as fifteen pounds a month--and there's the
missis and the family to provide for; and, as a consequence, I've
never had much to spend on myself. It would surprise a gentleman
who's been wealthy like you, Mr. Sheriff, to see the way I can make
half-a-crown spin out."</p>
<p>"It surprises me to see how you've made nothing at all spin
out," said Sheriff; "and as for the Lagos authorities I was
speaking about, it's done more; it's made them suspicious. Hang it,
man, be reasonable; you must see they are bound to be
suspicious."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle's brown face grew darker in tint, and he spoke
with visible shame. "I've come by a living, sir, honest, but I
couldn't bear it to be told aloud here to all the world how it was
done. I may be down, Mr. Sheriff, but I have my pride still."</p>
<p>Sheriff spread his hands helplessly. "That's no kind of answer,"
he said. "They won't let you continue to stay here in Lagos on an
explanation like that. Come now, Kettle, be sensible: put yourself
in the authorities' place. They've got a town to administer--a big
town--that not thirty years ago was the most murderous, fanatical,
rowdy dwelling of slave-traders on the West Coast of Africa.
To-day, by dint of careful shepherding, they've reduced it to a
city of quiet respectability, with a smaller crime rate than
Birmingham; and in fact made it into a model town suitable for a
story-book. You don't see the Government much, but you bet it's
there, and you bet it isn't asleep. You can bet also that the
nigger people here haven't quite forgotten the old days, and would
like to be up to a bit of mischief every now and again, just for
old association's sake, which of course the Government is quite
aware of.</p>
<p>"Now there's nothing that can stir up niggers into ructions
against a white man's government better than a white man, as has
been proved tons of times already, and here are you already on the
carpet quite equal to the job. I don't say you are up to mischief,
nor does the Government, but you must see for yourself that they'd
be fools if they didn't play for safety and ship you off out of
harm's way."</p>
<p>"I must admit," said Kettle ruefully, "that there's sense in
what you say, sir."</p>
<p>"Are you going to give a free and open explanation of your means
of employment here in Lagos, and earn the right to stay on openly,
or are you going to still stick to the mysterious?"</p>
<p>The little sailor frowned. "No, sir," he said; "as I told you
before, I have my pride."</p>
<p>"Very-well, then. Now, are you going to be the Distressed
Seaman, and be jeered at all the run home as you cadge round for
your 'baccy money, or are you going to do the sensible thing, and
step into this billet I've put in your way?"</p>
<p>"You corner me."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear it, and let me tell you it hasn't been for
want of trying. Man, if I hadn't liked you, I would not have taken
all this trouble to put a soft thing ready to your hand."</p>
<p>"I believe you want service out of me in return, sir," said
Kettle stiffly.</p>
<p>Sheriff laughed. "You aren't the handiest man in the world to
get on with, and if I hadn't been an easy-tempered chap I should
have bidden you go to the deuce long enough ago. Of course, I want
something out of you. A man who has just lost a fortune, and who is
down on his luck like I am, can't afford to go in for pure
philanthropy without any possible return. But, at the same time,
I'm finding you a job at fifty pound a month with a fortnight's
wages paid in advance, and I think you might be decently grateful.
By your own telling, you never earned so much as four sovereigns a
week before."</p>
<p>"The wages were quite to my taste from the beginning, sir; don't
think me ungrateful there. But what I didn't like was going to sea
without knowing beforehand what I was expected to do. I didn't like
it at first, and I refused the job then; and if I take it now,
being, as you say, cornered, you're not to understand that it's
grown any the tastier to me."</p>
<p>"We shouldn't pay a skipper a big figure like that," said
Sheriff drily, "if we didn't want something a bit more than, the
ordinary out of him. You may take it you are getting fifteen pounds
a month as standard pay, and the extra thirty-five for
condescending to sail with sealed orders. But what I told you at
first I repeat now: I've got a partner standing in with me over
this business, and as he insists on the whole thing being kept
absolutely dark till we're away at sea, I've no choice but to
observe the conditions of partnership."</p>
<p>Some thirty minutes later than this, Mr. Sheriff got out of his
'rickshaw on the Marina and went into an office and inquired for
Mr. White. One of the colored clerks (who, to do credit to his
English education, affected to be utterly prostrated by the heat)
replied with languor that Mr. White was upstairs; upon which
Sheriff, mopping himself with a handkerchief, went up briskly.</p>
<p>White, a gorgeously handsome young Hebrew, read success from his
face at once. "I can see you've hooked your man," said he. "That's
good business; we couldn't have got another as good anywhere. Have
a cocktail?"</p>
<p>"Don't mind if I do. It's been tough work persuading him. He's
such a suspicious, conscientious little beggar. Shout for your boy
to bring the cocktail, and when we're alone, I'll tell you about
it."</p>
<p>"I'll fix up your drink myself, old man. Where's the
swizzle-stick? Oh, here, behind the Angostura bottle. And there's a
fresh lime for you--got a basket of them in this morning. Now you
yarn whilst I play barmaid."</p>
<p>Mr. Sheriff tucked his feet on the arms of a long-chair and
picked up a fan. He sketched in the account of his embassage with
humorous phrase.</p>
<p>The Hebrew had been liberal with his cocktail. He said himself
that he made them so beautifully that no one could resist a second;
and so, with a sigh of gusto, Sheriff gulped down number two and
put the glass on the floor. "No," he said; "no more. They're
heavenly, I'll grant, but no more. We shall want very clear heads
for what's in front of us, and I'm not going to fuddle mine for a
commencement. I can tell you we have been very nearly wrecked
already. It was only by the skin of my teeth I managed to collar
Master Kettle. I only got him because I happened to know something
about him."</p>
<p>"Did you threaten to get him into trouble over it? What's he
done?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing of that sort. But the man's got the pride of an
emperor, and it came to my knowledge he'd been making a living out
of fishing in the lagoon, and I worked on that. Look out of that
window; it's a bit glary with the sun full on, but do you see those
rows of stakes the nets are made fast on? Well, one of those
belongs to Captain Owen Kettle, and he works there after dark like
a native, and dressed as one. You know he's been so long living
naked up in the bush that his hide's nearly black, and he can speak
all the nigger dialects. But I guessed he'd never own up that he'd
come so low as to compete with nigger fishermen, and I fixed things
so that he thought he'd have to tell white Lagos what was his
trade, or clear out of the colony one-time. It was quite a neat bit
of diplomacy."</p>
<p>"You have got a tongue in you," said White.</p>
<p>"When a man's as broke as I am, and as desperate, he does his
best in talk to get what he wants. But look here, Mr. White, now
we've got Kettle, I want to be off and see the thing over and
finished as soon as possible. It's the first time I've been hard
enough pushed to meddle with this kind of racket, and I can't say I
find it so savory that I'm keen on lingering over it."</p>
<p>The Jew shrugged his shoulders. "We are going for money," he
said. "Money is always hard to get, my boy, but it's nice, very
nice, when you have it."</p>
<p>Keen though Sheriff was to get this venture put to the trial,
brimming with energy though he might be, it was quite out of the
question that a start could be made at once. A small steamer they
had already secured on charter, but she had to be manned, coaled,
and provisioned, and all these things are not carried out as
quickly in Lagos as they would be in Liverpool, even though there
was a Kettle in command to do the driving. And, moreover, there
were cablegrams to be sent, in tedious cypher, to London and
elsewhere, to make the arrangements on which the success of the
scheme would depend.</p>
<p>The Jew was the prime mover in all this cabling. He had
abundance of money in his pocket, and he spent it lavishly, and he
practically lived in the neighborhood of the telegraph office. He
was as affable as could be; he drank cocktails and champagne with
the telegraph staff whenever they were offered; but over the nature
of his business he was as close as an oyster.</p>
<p>A breath of suspicion against the scheme would wreck it in an
instant, and, as there was money to be made by carrying it through,
the easy, lively, boisterous Mr. White was probably just then as
cautious a man as there was in Africa.</p>
<p>But preparations were finished at last, and one morning, when
the tide served, the little steamer cast off from her wharf below
the Marina, and steered for the pass at the further side of the
lagoon.</p>
<p>The bar was easy, and let her through with scarcely so much as a
bit of spray to moisten the dry deck planks, and Sheriff pointed to
the masts of a branch-boat which had struck the sand a week before,
and had beaten her bottom out and sunk in ten minutes, and from
these he drew good omens about this venture, and at the same time
prettily complimented Kettle on his navigation.</p>
<p>But Kettle refused to be drawn into friendliness. He coldly
commented that luck and not skill was at the bottom of these
matters, and that if the bar had shifted, he himself could have put
this steamer on the ground as handily as the other man had piled up
the branch-boat. He refused to come below and have a drink, saying
that his place was on the bridge till he learned from observation
that either of the two mates was a man to be trusted. And, finally,
he inquired, with acid formality, as to whether his employers
wished the steamer brought to an anchor in the roads, or whether
they would condescend to give him a course to steer.</p>
<p>Sheriff bade him curtly enough to "keep her going to the
s'uth'ard," and then drew away his partner into the stifling little
chart-house. "Now," he said, "you see how it is. Our little admiral
up there is standing on his temper, and if he doesn't hear the plan
of campaign, he's quite equal to making himself nasty."</p>
<p>"I don't mind telling him some, but I'm hanged if I'm going to
tell him all. There are too many in the secret already, what with
you and the two in London; and as I keep on telling you, if one
whiff of a suspicion gets abroad, the whole thing's busted, and a
trap will be set that you and I will be caught in for a
certainty."</p>
<p>"Poof! We're at sea now, and no one can gossip beyond the walls
of the ship. Besides Kettle is far too staunch to talk. He's the
sort of man who can be as mum as the grave when he chooses. But if
you persist in refusing to trust him, well, I tell you that the
thought of what he may be up to makes me frightened."</p>
<p>"Now look here, my boy," said White, "you force me to remind you
that I'm senior partner here, and to repeat that what I say on this
matter's going to be done. I flatly refuse to trust this Kettle
with the whole yarn. We've hired him at an exorbitant fee--bought
him body and soul, in fact, as I've no doubt he very well
understands--and to my mind he's engaged to do exactly as he's
told, without asking questions. But as you seem set on it, I'll
meet you here; he may be told a bit. Fetch him down."</p>
<p>But as Kettle refused to come below, on the chilly plea of
business, the partner went out under the awnings of the upper
bridge, where the handsome White, with boisterous, open-hearted
friendliness, did his best to hustle the little sailor into quick
good humor.</p>
<p>"Don't blame me, Skipper, or Sheriff here either, for the matter
of that, for making all this mystery. We're just a couple of paid
agents, and the bigger men at the back insisted that we should keep
our mouths shut till the right time. There's nothing wrong with
this caution, I'm sure you'll be the first to say. You see they
couldn't tell from that distance what sort of man we should be able
to pick up at Lagos. I guess they never so much as dreamed that
we'd have the luck to persuade a chap like you to join."</p>
<p>"You are very polite, sir," said Kettle formally.</p>
<p>"Not a bit of it. I'm not the sort of boy to chuck civility away
on an incompetent man. Now look here, Captain. We're on for making
a big pile in a very short time, and you can stand in to finger
your share if you'll, only take your whack of the work."</p>
<p>"There's no man living more capable of hard work than me, sir,
and no man keener to make a competence. I've got a wife that I'd
like to see a lot better off than I've ever been able to make her
so far."</p>
<p>"I'm sure Mrs. Kettle deserves affluence, and please the pigs
she shall have it."</p>
<p>"But it isn't every sovereign that might be put in her way,"
said the sailor meaningly, "that Mrs. Kettle would care to
use."</p>
<p>"I guess I find every sovereign that comes to my fingers
contains twenty useful shillings."</p>
<p>"I will take your word for it, sir. Mrs. Kettle prefers to know
that the few she handles are cleanly come by."</p>
<p>Mr. White gritted his handsome teeth, shrugged his shoulders,
and made as if he intended to go down off the bridge. But Sheriff
stopped him. "We'd better have it out," Sheriff suggested; "as well
now as later."</p>
<p>"Put it in your own words, then. I don't seem able to get
started. You," he added significantly, "know as well as I do what
to say."</p>
<p>"Very well. Now, look here, Kettle. This mystery game has gone
on long enough, and you've got to be put on the ground floor, like
the rest of us. Did you ever dabble in stocks?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"But you know what they are?"</p>
<p>"I've heard the minister I sit under ashore give his opinion
from the pulpit on the Stock Exchange, and those who do business
there. The minister of our chapel, sir, is a man I always agree
with."</p>
<p>This was sufficiently unpromising, but Sheriff went doggedly on.
"I see your way of looking at it: the whole crowd of stock
operators are a gang of thieves that no decent man would care to
touch?"</p>
<p>"That's much my notion."</p>
<p>"And they are quite unworthy of protection?"</p>
<p>"They can rob one another to their heart's content for all I
care."</p>
<p>Sheriff smiled grimly. "That's what I wanted to hear you say,
Captain. This cruise we are on now is not exactly a pleasure
trip."</p>
<p>"I guessed that, of course, from the pay that was offered."</p>
<p>"What we are after is this: the Cape to England telegraph cable
stops at several places on the road, and we want to get hold of one
of the stations and work it for our own purposes for an hour or so.
If we can do that, our partners in London will bring off a
speculation in South African shares that will set the whole lot of
us up for life."</p>
<p>"And who pays the piper? I mean where will the money for your
profit come from?"</p>
<p>White was quicker than Sheriff to grasp the situation. "From
inside the four walls of the Stock Exchange. S'elp me, Captain, you
needn't pity them. There are lots of men there, my friends too, who
would have played the game themselves if they had been sharp enough
to think of it. We have to be pretty keen in the speculation
business if we want to make money out of it."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle buttoned his coat, and stepped to the further end
of the bridge with an elaborate show of disgust. "You are on the
Stock Exchange yourself, sir?"</p>
<p>"Er--connected with it, Captain."</p>
<br>
<a name="page143.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/page143.jpg" width="45%" alt=

<b>"You insolent little blackguard, you dare to speak to me like
that!".</b></p>
<br>
<p>"I can quite understand our minister's opinion of stock gamblers
now. Perhaps some day you may hear it for yourself. He's a great
man for visiting jails and carrying comfort to the afflicted."</p>
<p>"By gad!" said White, "you insolent little blackguard, you dare
to speak to me like that!"</p>
<p>"I use what words I choose," said Kettle, truculently. "I'd have
said the same to your late King Solomon if I hadn't liked his ways;
but if I was pocketing his pay, I should have carried out his
orders all the same." He bent down to the voice hatch, and gave a
bearing to the black quartermaster in the wheel-house below, and
the little steamer, which had by this time left behind her the
vessels transhipping cargo in the roads, canted off on a new course
to the southward.</p>
<p>"Hullo," said Sheriff, "what's that mean? Where are you off to
now?"</p>
<p>Kettle mentioned the name of a lonely island standing by itself
in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>But Sheriff and the Jew were visibly startled. Mr. Sheriff
mopped at a very damp forehead with his pocket handkerchief. "Have
you heard anything then?" he asked, "or did you just guess?"</p>
<p>"I heard nothing before, or I should not have signed on for this
trip, sir. But having come so far I'm going to earn out my pay.
What's done will not be on my conscience. The shipmaster's
blameless in these matters; it's the owner who drives him that
earns his punishment in the hereafter; and that's sound
theology."</p>
<p>"But how did you guess, man, how did you know where we were
bound?"</p>
<p>"A shipmaster knows cable stations as well as he knows owners'
agents' offices ashore. Any fool who had been told your game would
have put his finger on that island at once. That's the loneliest
place where the cable goes ashore all up and down the coast, and it
isn't British, and what more could you want?"</p>
<p>With these meagre assurances, Messieurs Sheriff and White had to
be content, as no others were forthcoming. Captain Kettle refused
to be drawn into further talk upon the subject, and the pair went
below to the stuffy little cabin more than a trifle disconsolate.
"Well, here's the man you talked so big about," said White,
bitterly. "As soon as we get out at sea, he shows himself in his
true colors. Why, he's a blooming Methodist. But if he sells us
when it comes to the point, and there's a chance of my getting
nabbed, by gad I'll murder him like I would a rat."</p>
<p>"If he offers a scrimmage," said Sheriff, "you take my tip, and
clear out. He's a regular glutton for a fight; I know he's armed;
and he could shoot the buttons off your coat at twenty yards. No,
Mr. White; make the best or the worst of Captain Kettle as you
choose, but don't come to fisticuffs with him, or as sure as you
are living now, you'll finish out on the under side then. And mind,
I'm not talking by guess-work. I know."</p>
<p>"I shall not stick at much if this show's spoiled. Why, the
money was as good as in our pockets, if he hadn't cut up
awkward."</p>
<p>"Don't throw up the sponge till some one else does it for you.
Look here, I know this man Kettle a lot better than you do. He
wants the pay very badly. And when it comes to sticking up the
cable station, you'll see him do the work of any ten like us. I
tell you, he's a regular demon when it comes to a scuffle."</p>
<p>It was in this attitude, then, that the three principal members
of the little steamer's complement voyaged down over those warm
tropical seas which lay between Lagos and the isle of their hopes
and fears. Two of them kept together, and perfected the detail of
their plans for use in every contingency; but the other kept
himself icily apart, and for an occupation, when the business of
the ship did not require his eye, wrapped himself up in the labor
of literary production. He even refused to partake of meals at the
same table with his employers.</p>
<p>The island first appeared to them as a huddle of mountains
sprouting out of the sea, which grew green as they came more near,
and which finally showed great masses of foliage growing to the
crown of the splintered heights, with a surf frilling the bays and
capes at their foot. There was a town in the hug of one of these
bays, and toward it the little steamer rolled as though she had
been an ordinary legitimate trader. She brought up to an anchor in
the jaws of the bay, half-way between the lighthouse and the
rectangular white building on the further beach, and after due
delay, a negro doctor, pulled up by a surf-boat full of other
negroes, came off and gave her pratique.</p>
<p>The rectangular white building, standing in the sea breeze by
itself away from the town beyond, was the cable station, but for
the present they faced it with their backs. Kettle had seen it
before; the other two acted as though it were the last thing to
trouble their minds. There was no going ashore for any of them yet;
indeed, the less they advertised their personal identity, the more
chance there was of getting off untraced afterward.</p>
<p>Night fell with such suddenness that one could almost have
imagined the sun was permanently extinguished. Round the rim of the
bay lights began to kindle, and presently (when the wind came off
the land) strains of music floated out to them.</p>
<p>"Some saint's day," Sheriff commented.</p>
<p>"St. Agatha's," said Kettle with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Hello, Kettle. I thought you were a straight-laced chapel goer.
What have you to do with saints and their days?"</p>
<p>"I was told that one once, sir, and I can't help remembering it.
You see the date is February 5th, and that's my eldest youngster's
birthday."</p>
<p>Sheriff swore. "I wish you'd drop that sort of sentimental bosh,
Skipper; especially now. I want to get this business over first,
and then, when I go back with plenty in my pocket, I can begin to
think of family pleasures and cares again. Come now, have you
thought out what we can do with the steamer after we've finished
our job here?"</p>
<p>"Run up with the coast and sink her, and then go ashore in the
surf-boat at some place where the cable doesn't call, and leave
that as soon as possible for somewhere else."</p>
<p>"It will be a big saving of necks," said Kettle drily. "Why sir,
you've been a steamer-owner in your time, and you must know how
we're fixed. You've given up your papers here, and you're known.
You can't go into another port in the whole wide world without
papers, and as far as forging a new set, why that's a thing that
hasn't been done this thirty years outside a story-book."</p>
<p>Mr. White came up to hear. "I don't see that," he said.</p>
<p>"You fellows don't understand everything in Jerusalem," said
Kettle, with a cheerful insult, and walked away. Captain Kettle
regarded Sheriff as a gull, and pitied him accordingly; but White
he recognized as principal knave, and disliked him accordingly.</p>
<p>But when the start was made for the raid, some hour and a half
before the dawn, Kettle was not backward in fulfilling his paid-for
task. Himself he saw a surf-boat lowered into the water and manned
by black Krooboy paddlers; himself he saw his two employers down on
the thwarts, and then followed them; and himself he sat beside the
head-man who straddled in the stern sheets at the steering oar, and
gave him minute directions.</p>
<p>The boat was avoiding the bay altogether. She was making for the
strip of sand in front of the cable station, and except when she
was shouldered up on the back of a roller, the goal was out of
sight all the time.</p>
<p>"There's a rare swell running, and it's a mighty bad beach
to-night," Kettle commented. "I hope you gentlemen can swim, for
the odds are you'll have to do it inside the next ten minutes."</p>
<p>"If we are spilt getting ashore," said White, "how do you say
we'll get off again?"</p>
<p>"The Lord knows," said Kettle.</p>
<p>"Well, you're a cheerful companion, anyway."</p>
<p>"I wasn't paid for a yacht skippering job and asked to say nice
things which weren't true. But if you don't fancy the prospect, go
back and try a trade that's less risky. You mayn't like honest
work, but it strikes me this kind of contract's out your weight
anyway."</p>
<p>The Jew looked as if he would like to let loose his tongue, and
perhaps handle a weapon, but his motto was "business first," and he
could not afford to have an open fracas with Kettle then. So he
swallowed his resentment, and said, "Get on," and clung dizzily on
to his thwart.</p>
<p>As each roller passed tinder her, the surf-boat swooped higher
and higher, and the laboring paddles seemed to give her less and
less momentum. The head-man strained at the steering oar. The
Krooboys had hard work to keep their perches on the gunwale.</p>
<p>At last the head-man shouted, and the paddles ceased. They were
waiting for a smooth. Roller after roller swept under them, and the
boat rode them dizzily, but kept her place just beyond the outer
edge of the surf. From over his shoulder, the head-man watched the
charging seas with animal intentness. Then with a sudden shriek he
gave the word, and the paddles stabbed the water into spray. The
heavy boat rushed forward again, and a great towering sea rushed
after her. It reared her up, stern uppermost, and passed, leaving
her half swamped by its foaming passage; and then came another sea,
and the boat broached to and spilt. The Krooboys jumped like black
frogs from either gunwale, and Kettle jumped also, and made his way
easily to the sand, being used to this experience. But Sheriff was
pulled on to the beach with difficulty, and the Jew was hauled
there in a state verging on the unconscious. He looked at the
fearsome surf, and shuddered openly. "How shall we get off again?"
he gasped.</p>
<p>"More swimming," said Kettle tersely. "And perhaps not manage it
at all. You'd better give up the game, and go off decently
to-morrow morning from the Custom House wharf."</p>
<p>But Mr. White, whatever might be the list of his failings, was
certainly possessed of dogged pluck, and as he had got that far
with his enterprise, did not intend to desert it. He got rid of the
sea-water that was within him, and resolutely led the way to the
cable station, which loomed square and solid through the dusk.
Sheriff followed, and Captain Kettle, with his hands in his
pockets, brought up the rear. The Krooboys, according to their
orders, stayed on the beach, brought in the boat, collected her
furniture, and got all ready for relaunching.</p>
<p>White seemed to know the way as if he had been there before. He
went up to the building, entered through an open door, and strode
quietly in his rubber-soled shoes along a dark passage. At the end
was a room in partial darkness, and a man who watched a spot of
light which darted hither and back, and between whiles wrote upon
paper. To him White went up, and clapped a cold revolver muzzle
against the nape of his neck.</p>
<p>"Now," he said, "I want the loan of your instrument for about an
hour. If you resist, you'll be shot. The noise of the shot will
bring out the other men on the station, and they'll be killed also.
There are plenty of us here, and we are well armed, and we intend
to have our own way. If you are not anything short of a fool,
you'll go and sit on that chair, and keep quiet till you're given
leave to talk."</p>
<p>"I don't think I'll argue it with you," said the operator
coolly. He got up and sat where he was told, and Kettle, according
to arrangement, stood guard over him. "I suppose you malefactors
know," he added, "that there are certain pains and penalties
attached to this sort of amusement, and that you are bound to get
caught quite soon, whether you shoot me or let me go?"</p>
<p>Nobody answered him. White had sat down at the instrument table,
and was tapping out messages like a man well accustomed to the
work.</p>
<p>"Of course with those black mask things over your faces I
couldn't recognize you again, even if I was put in the box; but, my
good chaps, your steamer's known, there's no getting over that.
Much better clear out before any mischief's done, and own up you've
made a mistake."</p>
<p>White turned on the man with a sudden fury. "If you don't keep
your silly mouth shut, I'll have you throttled," he threatened, and
after that the only noise that broke the silence was the
<i>tap--taptap--taptapping</i> of the telegraph instrument.</p>
<p>Only two men in that darkened room knew what message was being
dispatched, and these were White and the dispossessed operator. The
one worked with cool, steady industry, and the other listened with
strained intentness. Sheriff was outside the door keeping guard on
the rest of the house. But Kettle, from his station behind the
operator's chair, listened with a strange disquietude. He had been
told that the object of the raid was to arrange a stock exchange
robbery, and to this he had tacitly agreed. According to his narrow
creed (as gathered from the South Shields chapel) none but rogues
and thieves dealt in stocks and shares, and if these chose to rob
one another, an honest man might well look on non-interferent. But
what guarantee had he that this robbery was not planned to draw
plunder from the outside public as well? The pledged word of Mr.
White. And that was worth? He smiled disdainfully when he thought
of the slenderness of its value.</p>
<p><i>Tap--taptap--tap--tap--taptap</i>, said the tantalizing
instrument, going steadily on with its hidden speech.</p>
<p>The stifling heat of the room seemed to get more oppressive. The
mystery of the thing beat against Kettle's brain.</p>
<p>Of course he could not read the deposed operator's thoughts,
though he could see easily that the man was reading the messages
which White was so glibly sending off. But it was clear that the
man's agitation was growing; growing, too, out of all proportion to
the coolness he had shown when his room was first invaded. At last
an exclamation was forced from him, almost, as it seemed,
involuntarily. "Oh, you ghastly scoundrel," he murmured, and on
that Kettle spoke. He could not stand the mystery any longer.</p>
<p>"Tell me," he said, "exactly what message that man's
sending."</p>
<p>"But I forbid you to do any such thing," said White, and reached
for his revolver. But before his fingers touched it, he looked up
and saw Kettle's weapon covering him.</p>
<p>"You put that down," came the crisp order, and White obeyed it
nervously enough.</p>
<p>"And now go and stand in the middle of the room till I give you
leave to shift."</p>
<p>White did this also. He grasped the fact that Captain Kettle was
not in a mood to be trifled with.</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Telegraph Clerk, as you understand this tack-hammer
language, and as I could see you've been following all the messages
that's been sent, just tell me the whole lot of it, please, as near
as you can remember."</p>
<p>"He called up London first, and gave what sounded like a
registered address, and sent the word 'corruscate.' That's probably
code; anyway I don't know what it meant. Then he called the Cape,
and sent a message to the Governor. He hadn't got to the end, and
there was no signature, but it was evidently intended to make them
believe that it was sent from the Colonial Office at home."</p>
<p>"Well," said Kettle, "what was the message?"</p>
<p>"Good Lord, man, he's directing the Governor to declare war on
the Transvaal. You know there's been trouble with them lately, and
they'll believe that it comes from the right place. If this is some
stock-jobbing plant--"</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>"Then, by heavens, it'll be carried through unless you let me
stop it at once. The thing's plausible enough--"</p>
<p>But here White recovered from his temporary scare, and cut in
with a fine show of authority. "S'help me, Kettle, you're making a
pretty mess of things. You make me knock off in the middle of a
message, and they'll not know what's up at the other end if I don't
go on. Look at that mirror."</p>
<p>"I see the spot of light winking about."</p>
<p>"That's the operator at the next station calling me."</p>
<p>"But is it true what this gentleman's been telling me?"</p>
<p>"I suppose it is, more or less. But what of that? What did you
lose your temper for like this? You knew quite well what we came
here for."</p>
<p>"I knew you came to steal money from stockbrokers. I knew
nothing about going to try and run my country in for a war."</p>
<p>"Poof, that's nothing. The war would not hurt you and me.
Besides, it must go on now. I've cabled my partner in London to be
a bear in Kaffirs for all he's worth. We must smash all the
instruments here so they can't contradict the news, and then be
off."</p>
<p>"Your partner can be a bear or any other kind of beast, in any
sort of niggers he chooses, but I'm not going to let you run
England into war at any price."</p>
<p>"Pah, my good man, what does that matter to you? What's England
ever done for you?"</p>
<p>"I live there," said Kettle, "when I'm at home, and as I've
lived everywhere else in the world, I'm naturally a bit more fond
of the old shop than if I'd never gone away from her beach. No, Mr.
White, England's never done anything special for me that I could,
so to speak, put my finger on, but--ah would you!"</p>
<p>White, in desperation, had made a grab at the revolver lying on
the instrument table, but with a quick rush Kettle possessed
himself of it, and Mr. White found himself again looking down the
muzzle of Captain Kettle's weapon.</p>
<p>But a moment later the aim was changed. Sheriff, hearing the
whispered talk, had come in through the doorway to see what it was
about, and promptly found himself favored in his turn.</p>
<p>"Shift your pistol to muzzle end, and bring it here."</p>
<p>Sheriff obeyed the order promptly. He had seen enough of Captain
Kettle's usefulness as a marksman not to dispute his wishes.</p>
<p>"Did you know that we came here to stir up a war between our
folks at home and the Transvaal?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so."</p>
<p>"And smash up the telegraph instruments afterward, so that it
could not be contradicted till it was well under way?"</p>
<p>"That would have been necessary."</p>
<p>"And you remember what you told me on that steamboat? Oh! you
liar!" said Kettle, and Sheriff winced.</p>
<p>"I'm so beastly hard up," he said.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle might have commented on his own poverty, but he
did not do this. Instead, he said: "Now we'll go back to the ship,
and of course you'll have to scuttle her just as if you'd brought
off your game here successfully. Run England in for a bloody war,
would you, just for some filthy money? By James! no. Come, march.
And you, Mr. Telegraph Clerk, get under weigh with that deaf and
dumb alphabet of yours, and ring up the Cape, and tell them what's
been sent is all a joke, and there's to be no war at all."</p>
<p>"I'll do that, you may lay your heart on it," said the operator.
"But Mr. I-don't-know-what-your-name-is, look here. Hadn't you
better stay? I'll see things are put all right. But if you go off
with those two sharks, it might be dangerous."</p>
<p>"Thank you, kindly, sir," said Kettle; "but I'm a man that's
been accustomed to look after myself all the world over, and I'm
not likely to get hurt now. Those two may be sharks, as you say,
but I'm not altogether a simple little lamb myself."</p>
<p>"I shall be a bit uneasy for you. You're a good soul whoever you
may be, and I'd like to do something for you if I could."</p>
<p>"Then, sir," said Kettle, "just keep quiet, here, and get on
with your work contradicting that wire, and don't send for any of
those little Portuguese soldiers with guns to see us off. It's a
bad beach, and we mayn't get off first try, and if they started to
annoy us whilst we were at work, I might have to shoot some of
them, which would be a trouble."</p>
<p>"I'll see to that," said the operator. "We'll just shake hands
if you don't mind, before you go. There's more man to the cubic
inch about you than in any other fellow I've come across for a long
time. I've no club at home now, or I'd ask you to look me up. But I
dare say we shall meet again some time. So long."</p>
<p>"Good-by, sir," said Kettle, and shook the operator by the hand.
Then he turned, and drove the other two raiders before him out of
the house, and down to the beach, and, with the Krooboys, applied
himself to launching the surf-boat through the breakers.</p>
<p>"Run the old shop into a war, would you?" he soliloquized to two
very limp, unconscious figures, as the Krooboys got the surf-boat
afloat after the third upset. "It's queer what some men will do for
money." And then, a minute later, he muttered to himself: "By
James! look at that dawn coming up behind the island there; yellow
as a lemon. Now, that is fine. I can make a bit of poetry out of
that."</p>

<h3>THE DERELICT</h3>
<br>
<p>"Her cargo'll have shifted," said the third mate, "and when she
got that list her people will have felt frightened and left
her."</p>
<p>"She's a scary look to her, with her yard-arms spiking every
other sea," said Captain Image, "and her decks like the side of a
house. I shouldn't care to navigate a craft that preferred to lie
down on her beam ends myself."</p>
<p>"Take this glass, sir, and you'll see the lee quarter-boat
davit-tackles are overhauled. That means they got at least one boat
in the water. To my mind she's derelict."</p>
<p>"Yard-arm tackles rigged and overhauled, too," said Captain
Image. "She'll have carried a big boat on the top of that house
amidships, and that's gone, too. Well, I hope her crew have got to
dry land somewhere, or been picked up, poor beggars. Nasty things,
those old wind-jammers, Mr. Strake. Give me steam."</p>
<p>"But there's a pile of money in her still," said the third mate,
following up his own thoughts. "She's an iron ship, and she'll be
two thousand tons, good. Likely enough in the 'Frisco grain trade.
Seems to me a new ship, too; anyway, she's got those humbugging
patent tops'ls."</p>
<p>"And you're thinking she'd be a nice plum if we could pluck her
in anywhere?" said Image, reading what was in his mind.</p>
<p>"Well, me lad, I know that as well as you, and no one would be
pleaseder to pocket &pound;300. But the old <i>M'poso's</i> a
mailboat, and because she's got about a quarter of a hundredweight
of badly spelt letters on board, she can't do that sort of salvage
work if there's no life-saving thrown in as an extra reason.
Besides, we're behind time as it is, with smelling round for so
much cargo, and though I shall draw my two and a-half per cent, on
that, I shall have it all to pay away again, and more to boot, in
fines for being late. No, I tell you it isn't all sheer profit and
delight in being skipper on one of those West African coast boats.
And there's another thing: the Chief was telling me only this
morning that they've figured it very close on the coal. We only
have what'll take us to Liverpool ourselves, without trying to pull
a yawing, heavy, towing thing like that on behind us."</p>
<p>Strake drummed at the white rail of the bridge. He was a very
young man, and he was very keen on getting the chance of
distinguishing himself; and here, on the warm, windless swells
abeam, the chance seemed to sit beckoning him. "I've been thinking,
sir, if you can lend me half a dozen men, I could take her in
somewhere myself."</p>
<p>"I'm as likely to lend you half a dozen angels. Look at the deck
hands; look at the sickly trip this has been. We've had to put some
of them on double tricks at the wheel already, and as for getting
any painting done, or having the ship cleaned up a bit, why, I can
see we shall go into Liverpool as dirty as a Geordie collier.
Besides, Mr. Strake, I believe I've told you once or twice already
that you're not much use yourself, but anyway you're the best
that's left, and I'm having to stand watch and watch with you as it
is. If the mate gets out of his bed between here and home, it'll be
to go over the side, and the second mate's nearly as bad with that
nasty blackwater fever only just off him; and there you are. Mr.
Strake, if you have a penn'oth of brains stowed away anywhere, I
wish to whiskers you'd show 'em sometimes."</p>
<p>"Old man's mad at losing a nice lump of salvage," thought
Strake. "Natural, I guess." So he said quietly: "Ay, ay, sir," and
walked away to the other end of the bridge.</p>
<p>Captain Image followed him half-way, but stopped irresolutely
with his hand on the engine-room telegraph. On the fore main deck
below him his old friend, Captain Owen Kettle, was leaning on the
rail, staring wistfully at the derelict.</p>
<p>"Poor beggar," Image mused, "'tisn't hard to guess what he's
thinking about. I wonder if I could fix it for him to take her
home. It might set him on his legs again, and he's come low enough,
Lord knows. If I hadn't given him a room in the first-class for old
times' sake, he'd have had to go home, after his trouble on the
West Coast, as a distressed seaman, and touch his cap to me when I
passed. I've not done badly by him, but I shall have to pay for
that room in the first-class out of my own pocket, and if he was to
take that old wind-jammer in somewhere, he'd fork out, and very
like give me a dash besides.</p>
<p>"Yes, I will say that about Kettle; he's honest as a barkeeper,
and generous besides. He's a steamer sailor, of course, and has
been most of these years, and how he'll do the white wings business
again, Lord only knows. Forget he hasn't got engines till it's too
late, and then drown himself probably. However, that's his palaver.
Where we're going to scratch him up a crew from's the thing that
bothers me. Well, we'll see." He leaned down over the bridge rail,
and called.</p>
<p>Kettle looked up.</p>
<p>"Here a minute, Captain."</p>
<p>Poor Kettle's eye lit, and he came up the ladders with a boy's
quickness.</p>
<p>Image nodded toward the deserted vessel. "Fine full-rigger,
hasn't she been? What do you make her out for?"</p>
<p>"'Frisco grain ship. Stuff in bulk. And it's shifted."</p>
<p>"Looks that way. Have you forgotten all your 'mainsail haul' and
the square-rig gymnastics?"</p>
<p>"I'm hard enough pushed now to remember even the theory-sums
they taught at navigation school if I thought they would serve
me."</p>
<p>"I know. And I'm as sorry for you, Captain, as I can hold. But
you see, it's this: I'm short of sailormen; I've barely enough to
steer and keep the decks clean; anyway I've none to spare."</p>
<p>"I don't ask for fancy goods," said Kettle eagerly. "Give me
anything with hands on it--apes, niggers, stokers, what you like,
and I'll soon teach them their dancing steps."</p>
<p>Captain Image pulled at his moustache. "The trouble of it is, we
are short everywhere. It's been a sickly voyage, this. I couldn't
let you have more than two out of the stokehold, and even if we
take those, the old Chief will be fit to eat me. You could do
nothing with that big vessel with only two beside yourself."</p>
<p>"Let me go round and see. I believe I can rake up enough hands
somehow."</p>
<p>"Well, you must be quick about it," said Image. "I've wasted
more than enough time already. I can only give you five minutes,
Captain. Oh, by the way, there's a nigger stowaway from Sarry Leone
you can take if you like. He's a stonemason or some such
foolishness, and I don't mind having him drowned. If you hammer him
enough, probably he'll learn how to put some weight on a
brace."</p>
<p>"That stonemason's just the man I can use," said Kettle. "Get
him for me. I'll never forget your kindness over this, Captain, and
you may depend upon me to do the square thing by you if I get her
home."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle ran off down the bridge and was quickly out of
sight, and hard at his quest for volunteers. Captain Image waited a
minute, and he turned to his third mate. "Now, me lad," he said, "I
know you're disappointed; but with the other mates sick like they
are, it's just impossible for me to let you go. If I did, the
Company would sack me, and the dirty Board of Trade would probably
take away my ticket. So you may as well do the kind, and help poor
old Cappie Kettle. You see what he's come down to, through no fault
of his own. You're young, and you're full to the coamings with
confidence. I'm older, and I know that luck may very well get up
and hit me, and I'll be wanting a helping hand myself. It's a
rotten, undependable trade, this sailoring. You might just call the
carpenter, and get the cover off that smaller lifeboat."</p>
<p>"You think he'll get a crew, then, sir, and not our
deckhands?"</p>
<p>"Him? He'll get some things with legs and arms to them, if he
has to whittle 'em out of kindling-wood. It's not that that'll stop
Cappie Kettle now, me lad."</p>
<p>The third mate went off, sent for the carpenter, and started to
get a lifeboat cleared and ready for launching. Captain Image fell
to anxiously pacing the upper bridge, and presently Kettle came
back to him.</p>
<p>"Well, Captain," he said, "I got a fine crew to volunteer, if
you can see your way to let me have them. There's a fireman and a
trimmer, both English; there's a third-class passenger--a Dago of
some sort, I think he is, that was a ganger on the Congo
railway--and there's Mr. Dayton-Philipps; and if you send me along
your nigger stonemason, that'll make a good, strong ship's
company."</p>
<p>"Dayton-Philipps!" said Image. "Why, he's an officer in the
English Army, and he's been in command of Haussa troops on the Gold
Coast, and he's been some sort of a Resident, or political thing up
in one of those nigger towns at the back there. What's he want to
go for?"</p>
<p>"Said he'd come for the fun of the thing."</p>
<p>Captain Image gave a grim laugh. "Well, I think he'll find all
the fun he's any use for before he's ashore again. Extraordinary
thing some people can't see they're well off when they've got a job
ashore. Now, Mr. Strake, hurry with that boat and get her lowered
away. You're to take charge and bring her back; and mind, you're
not to leave the captain here and his gang aboard if the vessel's
too badly wrecked to be safe."</p>
<p>He turned to Kettle. "Excuse my giving that last order, old man,
but I know how keen you are, and I'm not going to let you go off to
try and navigate a sieve. You're far too good a man to be drowned
uselessly."</p>
<p>The word was "Hurry," now that the final decision had been
given, and the davit tackles squeaked out as the lifeboat jerked
down toward the water. She rode there at the end of her painter,
and the three rowers and the third mate fended her off, while
Kettle's crew of nondescripts scrambled unhandily down to take
their places. The negro stowaway refused stubbornly to leave the
steamer, and so was lowered ignominiously in a bowline, and then,
as he still objected loudly that he came from Sa' Leone, and was a
free British subject, some one crammed a bucket over his head,
amidst the uproarious laughter of the onlookers.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle swung himself down the swaying Jacob's ladder,
and the boat's painter was cast off; and under three oars she moved
slowly off over the hot sun-kissed swells. Advice and farewells
boomed like a thunderstorm from the steamer, and an animated frieze
of faces and figures and waving headgear decorated her rail.</p>
<p>Ahead of them, the quiet ship shouldered clumsily over the
rollers, now gushing down till she dipped her martingale, now
swooping up again, sending whole cataracts of water swirling along
her waist.</p>
<p>The men in the boat regarded her with curious eyes as they drew
nearer. Even the three rowers turned their heads, and were called
to order therefor by the mate at the tiller. A red ensign was
seized jack downward in her main rigging, the highest note of the
sailorman's agony of distress. On its wooden case, in her starboard
fore-rigging, a dioptric lens sent out the faint green glow of a
lamp's light into the sunshine.</p>
<p>The third mate drew attention to this last "Lot of oil in that
lamp," he said, "or it means they haven't deserted her very long.
To my mind, it must have been in yesterday's breeze her cargo
shifted, and scared her people into leaving her."</p>
<p>"We shall see," said Kettle, still staring intently ahead.</p>
<p>The boat was run up cannily alongside, and Kettle jumped into
the main chains and clambered on board over the bulwarks. "Now,
pass up my crew, Mr. Strake," said he.</p>
<p>"I'm coming myself next, if you don't mind," said the third
mate, and did so. "Must obey the old man's orders," he explained,
as they stood together on the sloping decks. "You heard yourself
what he said, Captain."</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Mate," said Kettle grimly, "I hope you'll decide
she's seaworthy, because, whatever view you take of it, as I've got
this far, here I'm going to stay."</p>
<p>The mate frowned. He was a young man; he was here in authority,
and he had a great notion of making his authority felt. Captain
Kettle was to him merely a down-on-his-luck free-passage nobody,
and as the mate was large and lusty he did not anticipate trouble.
So he remarked rather crabbedly that he was going to obey his
orders, and went aft along the slanting deck.</p>
<p>It was clear that the vessel had been swept--badly swept.
Ropes-ends streamed here and there and overboard in every
direction, and everything movable had been carried away eternally
by the sea. A goodly part of the starboard bulwarks had vanished,
and the swells gushed in and out as they chose. But the hatch
tarpaulins and companions were still in place; and though it was
clear from the list (which was so great that they could not walk
without holding on) that her cargo was badly shifted, there was no
evidence so far that she was otherwise than sound.</p>
<p>The third mate led the way on to the poop, opened the companion
doors and slide, and went below. Kettle followed. There was a cabin
with state rooms off it, littered, but dry. Strake went down on his
knees beneath the table, searching for something. "Lazaret hatch
ought to be down here," he explained. "I want to see in there. Ah,
it is."</p>
<p>He got his fingers in the ring and pulled it back. Then he
whistled. "Half-full of water," he said. "I thought so from the way
she floated. It's up to the beams down here. Likely enough she'll
have started a plate somewhere. 'Fraid it's no go for you, Captain.
Why, if a breeze was to come on, half the side of her might drop
out, and she'd go down like a stone."</p>
<p>Now to Kettle's honor be it said (seeing what he had in his
mind) he did not tackle the man as he knelt there peering into the
lazaret. Instead he waited till he stood up again, and then made
his statement coldly and deliberately.</p>
<p>"This ship's not too dangerous for me, and I choose to judge.
And if she'll do for me, she's good enough for the crew I've got in
your boat. Now I want them on deck, and at work without any more
palaver."</p>
<p>"Do you, by God!" said the mate, and then the pair of them
closed without any further preliminaries. They were both of them
well used to quick rough-and-tumbles, and they both of them knew
that the man who gets the first grip in these wrestles usually
wins, and instinctively each tried to act on that knowledge.</p>
<p>But if the third mate had bulk and strength, Kettle had science
and abundant wiriness; and though the pair of them lost their
footing on the sloping cabin floor at the first embrace, and
wriggled over and under like a pair of eels, Captain Kettle got a
thumb artistically fixed in the bigger man's windpipe, and held it
there doggedly. The mate, growing more and more purple, hit out
with savage force, but Kettle dodged the bull-like blows like the
boxer he was, and the mate's efforts gradually relaxed.</p>
<p>But at this point they were interrupted. "That wobbly boat was
making me sea-sick," said a voice, "so I came on board here. Hullo,
you fellows!"</p>
<p>Kettle looked up. "Mr. Philipps," he said, "I wish you'd go and
get the rest of our crew on deck out of the boat."</p>
<p>"But what are you two doing down there?"</p>
<p>"We disagreed over a question of judgment. He said this ship
isn't safe, and I shouldn't have the chance to take her home. I say
there's nothing wrong with her that can't be remedied, and home I'm
going to take her, anyway. It might be the one chance in my life,
sir, of getting a balance at the bank, and I'm not going to miss
it."</p>
<p>"Ho!" said Dayton-Philipps.</p>
<p>"If you don't like to come, you needn't," said Kettle. "But I'm
going to have the stonemason and the Dago, and those two
coal-heavers. Perhaps you'd better go back. It will be wet, hard
work here; no way the sort of job to suit a soldier."</p>
<p>Dayton-Philipps flushed slightly, and then he laughed. "I
suppose that's intended to be nasty," he said. "Well, Captain, I
shall have to prove to you that we soldiers are equal to a bit of
manual labor sometimes. By the way, I don't want to interfere in a
personal matter, but I'd take it as a favor if you wouldn't kill
Strake quite. I rather like him."</p>
<p>"Anything to oblige," said Kettle, and took his thumb out of the
third mate's windpipe. "And now, sir, as you've so to speak signed
on for duty here, away with you on deck and get those four other
beauties up out of the boat."</p>
<p>Dayton-Philipps touched his hat and grinned. "Ay, ay, sir," he
said, and went back up the companion.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward he came to report the men on board, and Kettle
addressed his late opponent. "Now, look here, young man, I don't
want to have more trouble on deck before the hands. Have you had
enough?"</p>
<p>"For the present, yes," said the third mate huskily. "But I hope
we'll meet again some other day to have a bit of further talk."</p>
<p>"I am sure I shall be quite ready. No man ever accused me of
refusing a scrap. But, me lad, just take one tip from me: don't you
go and make Captain Image anxious by saying this ship isn't
seaworthy, or he'll begin to ask questions, and he may get you to
tell more than you're proud about."</p>
<p>"You can go and get drowned your own way. As far as I am
concerned, no one will guess it's coming off till they see it in
the papers."</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Kettle. "I knew you'd be nice about it."</p>
<p>The third mate went down to his boat, and the three rowers took
her across to the <i>M'poso</i>, where she was hauled up to davits
again. The steamer's siren boomed out farewells, as she got under
way again, and Kettle with his own hands unbent the reversed ensign
from the ship's main rigging, and ran it up to the peak and dipped
it three times in salute.</p>
<p>He breathed more freely now. One chance and a host of unknown
dangers lay ahead of him. But the dangers he disregarded. Dangers
were nothing new to him. It was the chance which lured him on.
Chances so seldom came in his way, that he intended to make this
one into a certainty if the efforts of desperation could do it.</p>
<p>Alone of all the six men on the derelict, Captain Kettle had
knowledge of the seaman's craft; but, for the present, thews and
not seamanship were required. The vessel lay in pathetic
helplessness on her side, liable to capsize in the first squall
which came along, and their first effort must be to get her in
proper trim whilst the calm continued. They knocked out the wedges
with their heels, and got the tarpaulins off the main hatch; they
pulled away the hatch covers, and saw beneath them smooth slopes of
yellow grain.</p>
<p>As though they were an invitation to work, shovels were made
fast along the coamings of the hatch. The six men took these, and
with shouts dropped down upon the grain. And then began a period of
Homeric toil. The fireman and the coal-trimmer set the pace, and
with a fine contempt for the unhandiness of amateurs did not fail
to give a display of their utmost. Kettle and Dayton-Philipps
gamely kept level with them. The Italian ganger turned out to have
his pride also, and did not lag, and only the free-born British
subject from Sierra Leone endeavored to shirk his due proportion of
the toil.</p>
<p>But high-minded theories as to the rights of man were regarded
here as little as threats to lay information before a justice of
the peace; and under the sledge-hammer arguments of shovel blows
from whoever happened to be next to him, the unfortunate colored
gentleman descended to the grade of nigger again (which he had
repeatedly sworn never to do), and toiled and sweated equally with
his betters.</p>
<p>The heat under the decks was stifling, and dust rose from the
wheat in choking volumes, but the pace of the circling shovels was
never allowed to slacken. They worked there stripped to trousers,
and they understood, one and all, that they were working for their
lives. A breeze had sprung up almost as soon as the <i>M'poso</i>
had steamed away, and hourly it was freshening: the barometer in
the cabin was registering a steady fall; the sky was banking up
with heavy clouds.</p>
<p>Kettle had handled sheets and braces and hove the vessel to so
as to steady her as they worked, but she still labored heavily in
the sea, and beneath them they could hear the leaden swish of water
in the floor of the hold beneath. Their labor was having its
effect, and by infinitesimal gradations they were counteracting the
list and getting the ship upright; but the wind was worsening, and
it seemed to them also that the water was getting deeper under
their feet, and that the vessel rode more sluggishly.</p>
<p>So far the well had not been sounded. It is no use getting
alarming statistics to discourage one's self unnecessarily. But
after night had fallen, and it was impossible to see to work in the
gloomy hold any longer without lamps, Captain Kettle took the
sounding-rod and found eight feet.</p>
<p>He mentioned this when he took down the lanterns into the hold,
but he did not think it necessary to add that as the sounding had
been taken with the well on the slant it was therefore considerably
under the truth. Still he sent Dayton-Philipps and the trimmer on
deck to take a spell at the pumps, and himself resumed his
shovel-work alongside the others.</p>
<p>Straight away on through the night the six men stuck to their
savage toil, the blood from their blistered hands reddening the
shafts of the shovels. Every now and again one or another of them,
choked with the dust, went to get a draft of lukewarm water from
the scuttlebutt. But no one stayed over long on these excursions.
The breeze had blown up into a gale. The night overhead-was
starless and moonless, but every minute the black heaven was split
by spurts of lightning, which showed the laboring, dishevelled ship
set among great mountains of breaking seas.</p>
<p>The sight would have been bad from a well-manned, powerful
steamboat; from the deck of the derelict it approached the
terrific. With the seas constantly crashing on board of her, to
have left the hatches open would have been, in her semi-waterlogged
condition, to court swamping, and after midnight these were
battened down, and the men with the shovels worked among the
frightened, squeaking rats in the closed-in box of the hold. There
were four on board the ship during that terrible night who openly
owned to being cowed, and freely bewailed their insanity in ever
being lured away from the <i>M'poso</i>. Dayton-Philipps had
sufficient self-control to keep his feelings, whatever they were,
unstated; but Kettle faced all difficulties with indomitable
courage and a smiling face.</p>
<p>"I believe," said Dayton-Philipps to him once when they were
taking a spell together at the clanking pumps, "you really glory in
finding yourself in this beastly mess."</p>
<p>"I have got to earn out the salvage of this ship somehow,"
Kettle shouted back to him through the windy darkness, "and I don't
much care what work comes between now and when I handle the
check."</p>
<p>"You've got a fine confidence. I'm not grumbling, mind, but it
seems very unlikely we shall be still afloat to-morrow
morning."</p>
<p>"We shall pull through, I tell you."</p>
<p>"Well," said Dayton-Philipps, "I suppose you are a man that's
always met with success. I'm not. I've got blundering bad luck all
along, and if there's a hole available, I get into it."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle laughed aloud into the storm. "Me!" he cried. "Me
in luck! There's not been a man more bashed and kicked by luck
between here and twenty years back. I suppose God thought it good
for me, and He's kept me down to my bearings in bad luck ever since
I first got my captain's ticket. But He's not cruel, Mr. Philipps,
and He doesn't push a man beyond the end of his patience. My time's
come at last. He's given me something to make up for all the weary
waiting. He's sent me this derelict, and He only expects me to do
my human best, and then He'll let me get her safely home."</p>
<p>"Good Heavens, Skipper, what are you talking about? Have you
seen visions or something?"</p>
<p>"I'm a man, Mr. Philipps, that's always said my prayers regular
all through life. I've asked for things, big things, many of them,
and I'll not deny they've been mostly denied me. I seemed to know
they'd be denied. But in the last week or so there's been a change.
I've asked on, just as earnestly as I knew how, and I seemed to
hear Him answer. It was hardly a voice, and yet it was like a
voice; it appeared to come out of millions of miles of distance;
and I heard it say: 'Captain, I do not forget the sparrows, and I
have not forgotten you. I have tried you long enough. Presently you
shall meet with your reward.'"</p>
<p>Dayton-Philipps stared. Was the man going mad?</p>
<p>"And that's what it is, sir, that makes me sure I shall bring
this vessel into some port safely and pocket the salvage."</p>
<p>"Look here, Skipper," said Dayton-Philipps, "you are just fagged
to death, and I'm the same. We've been working till our hands are
raw as butcher's meat, and we're clean tired out, and we must go
below and get a bit of sleep. If the ship swims, so much the
better; if she sinks, we can't help it; anyway, we're both of us
too beat to work any more. I shall be 'seeing things' myself
next."</p>
<p>"Mr. Philipps," said the little sailor gravely, "I know you
don't mean anything wrong, so I take no offence. But I'm a man
convinced; I've heard the message I told you with my own
understanding; and it isn't likely anything you can say will
persuade me out of it. I can see you are tired out, as you say, so
go you below and get a spell of sleep. But as for me, I've got
another twenty hours' wakefulness in me yet, if needs be. This
chance has mercifully been sent in my way, as I've said, but
naturally it's expected of me that I do my human utmost as well to
see it through."</p>
<p>"If you stay on at this heart-breaking work, so do I," said
Dayton-Philipps, and toiled gamely on at the pump. There he was
still when day broke, sawing up and down like an automaton. But
before the sun rose, utter weariness had done its work. His
bleeding fingers loosed themselves from the break, his knees failed
beneath him, and he fell in an unconscious stupor of sleep on to
the wet planking of the deck. For half an hour more Kettle
struggled on at the pump, doing double work; but even his flesh and
blood had its breaking strain; and at last he could work no
more.</p>
<p>He leaned dizzily up against the pump for a minute or so, and
then with an effort he pulled his still unconscious companion away
and laid him on the dry floor of a deck-house. There was a pannikin
of cold stewed tea slung from a hook in there, and half a sea
biscuit on one of the bunks. He ate and drank greedily, and then
went out again along the streaming decks to work, so far as his
single pair of hands could accomplish such a thing, at getting the
huge derelict once more in sailing trim.</p>
<p>The shovels meanwhile had been doing their work, and although
the list was not entirely gone, the vessel at times (when a sea
buttressed her up) floated almost upright. The gale was still
blowing, but it had veered to the southward, and on the afternoon
of that day Kettle called all hands on deck and got her under way
again, and found to his joy that the coal-trimmer had some
elementary notion of taking a wheel.</p>
<p>"I rate you as Mate," he said in his gratitude, "and you'll draw
salvage pay according to your rank. I was going to make Mr.
Philipps my officer, but--"</p>
<p>"Don't apologize," said Dayton-Philipps. "I don't know the name
of one string from another, and I'm quite conscious of my
deficiency. But just watch me put in another spell at those
infernal pumps."</p>
<p>The list was of less account now, and the vessel was once more
under command of her canvas. It was the leak which gave them most
cause for anxiety. Likely enough it was caused by the mere
wrenching away of a couple of rivets. But the steady inpour of
water through the holes would soon have made the ship grow
unmanageable and founder if it was not constantly attended to.
Where the leak was they had not a notion. Probably it was deep down
under the cargo of grain, and quite unget-at-able; but anyway it
demanded a constant service at the pumps to keep it in check, and
this the bone-weary crew were but feebly competent to give. They
were running up into the latitude of the Bay, too, and might
reasonably expect that "Biscay weather" would not take much from
the violence of the existing gale.</p>
<p>However, the dreaded Bay, fickle as usual, saw fit to receive
them at first with a smiling face. The gale eased to a plain
smiling wind; the sullen black clouds dissolved away into fleckless
blue, and a sun came out which peeled their arms and faces as they
worked. During the afternoon they rose the brown sails of a
Portuguese fishing schooner, and Kettle headed toward her.</p>
<p>Let his crew be as willing as they would, there was no doubt
that this murderous work at the pumps could not be kept up for a
voyage to England. If he could not get further reinforcements, he
would have to take the ship into the nearest foreign port to barely
save her from sinking. And then where would be his sighed-for
salvage? Wofully thinned, he thought, or more probably whisked away
altogether. Captain Kettle had a vast distrust for the shore
foreigner over questions of law proceedings and money matters. So
he made for the schooner, hove his own vessel to, and signalled
that he wished to speak.</p>
<p>A boat was slopped into the water from the schooner's deck, and
ten swarthy, ragged Portuguese fishermen crammed into her. A couple
pushed at the oars, and they made their way perilously over the
deep hill and dale of ocean with that easy familiarity which none
but deep-sea fishermen can attain. They worked up alongside, caught
a rope which was thrown them, and nimbly climbed over on to the
decks.</p>
<p>Two or three of them had a working knowledge of English; their
captain spoke it with fluent inaccuracy; and before any of them had
gone aft to Kettle, who stood at the wheel, they heard the whole
story of the ship being found derelict, and (very naturally) were
anxious enough by some means or another to finger a share of the
salvage. Even a ragged Portuguese <i>baccalhao</i> maker can have
his ambitions for prosperity like other people.</p>
<p>Their leader made his proposal at once. "All right-a, Captain, I
see how you want. We take charge now, and take-a you into Ferrol
without you being at more trouble."</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind," said Kettle. "I'm just wanting the loan
of two or three hands to give my fellows a spell or two at that
pump. We're a bit short-handed, that's all. But otherwise we're
quite comfortable. I'll pay A.B.'s wages on Liverpool scale, and
that's a lot more than you Dagos give amongst yourselves, and if
the men work well I'll throw in a dash besides for 'bacca
money.'"</p>

<b>He picked up the man and sent him after the knife.</b></p>
<br>
<p>"Ta-ta-ta," said the Portuguese, with a wave of his yellow fist.
"It cannot be done, and I will not lend you men. It shall do as I
say; we take-a you into Ferroll. Do not fear-a, captain; you shall
have money for finding sheep; you shall have some of our
salvage."</p>
<p>Dayton-Philipps, who was standing near, and knew the little
sailor's views, looked for an outbreak. But Kettle held himself in,
and still spoke to the man civilly.</p>
<p>"That's good English you talk," he said. "Do all your crowd
understand the language?"</p>
<p>"No," said the fellow, readily enough, "that man does not, nor
does him, nor him."</p>
<p>"Right--oh!" said Kettle. "Then, as those three man can't kick
up a bobbery at the other end, they've just got to stay here and
help work this vessel home. And as for the rest of you filthy,
stinking, scale-covered cousins of apes, over the side you go
before you're put. Thought you were going to steal my lawful
salvage, did you, you crawling, yellow-faced--ah!"</p>
<p>The hot-tempered Portuguese was not a man to stand this tirade
(as Kettle anticipated) unmoved. His fingers made a vengeful snatch
toward the knife in his belt, but Kettle was ready for this, and
caught it first and flung it overboard. Then with a clever heave he
picked up the man and sent him after the knife.</p>
<p>He tripped up one of the Portuguese who couldn't speak English,
dragged him to the cabin companion, and toppled him down the
ladder. Dayton-Philipps (surprised at himself for abetting such
lawlessness) captured a second in like fashion, and the English
fireman and coal-trimmer picked up the third and dropped him down
an open hatchway on to the grain in the hold beneath.</p>
<p>But there were six of the fishermen left upon the deck, and
these did not look upon the proceedings unmoved. They had been slow
to act at first, but when the initial surprise was over, they were
blazing with rage and eager to do murder. The Italian and the
Sierra Leone nigger ran out of their way on to the forecastle head,
and they came on, vainglorious in numbers, and armed with their
deadly knives. But the two English roughs, the English gentleman,
and the little English sailor, were all of them men well accustomed
to take care of their own skins; the belaying pins out of the
pinrail seemed to come by instinct into their hands, and not one of
them got so much as a scratch.</p>
<p>It was all the affair of a minute. It does not do to let these
little impromptu scrimmages simmer over long. In fact, the whole
affair was decided in the first rush. The quartette of English went
in, despising the "Dagos," and quite intending to clear them off
the ship. The invaders were driven overboard by sheer weight of
blows and prestige, and the victors leaned on the bulwark puffing
and gasping, and watched them swim away to their boat through the
clear water below.</p>
<p>"Ruddy Dagos," said the roughs.</p>
<p>"Set of blooming pirates," said Kettle.</p>
<p>But Dayton-Philipps seemed to view the situation from a
different point. "I'm rather thinking we are the pirates. How about
those three we've got on board? This sort of press-gang work isn't
quite approved of nowadays, is it, Skipper?"</p>
<p>"They no speakee English," said Kettle drily. "You might have
heard me ask that, sir, before I started to talk to that skipper to
make him begin the show. And he did begin it, and that's the great
point. If ever you've been in a police court, you'll always find
the magistrate ask, 'Who began this trouble?' And when he finds
out, that's the man he logs. No, those fishermen won't kick up a
bobbery when they get back to happy Portugal again; and as for our
own crowd here on board, they ain't likely to talk when they get
ashore, and have money due to them."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose there's reason in that, though I should have my
doubts about the stonemason. He comes from Sierra Leone, remember,
and they're great on the rights of man there."</p>
<p>"Quite so," said Kettle. "I'll see the stonemason gets packed
off to sea again in a stokehold before he has a chance of stirring
up the mud ashore. When the black man gets too pampered, he has to
be brought low again with a rush, just to make him understand his
place."</p>
<p>"I see," said Dayton-Phillips, and then he laughed.</p>
<p>"There's something that tickles you, sir?"</p>
<p>"I was thinking, Skipper, that for a man who believes he's being
put in the way of a soft thing by direct guidance from on high,
you're using up a tremendous lot of energy to make sure the
Almighty's wishes don't miscarry. But still I don't understand much
about these matters myself. And at present it occurs to me that I
ought to be doing a spell at those infernal pumps, instead of
chattering here."</p>
<p>The three captive Portuguese were brought up on deck and were
quickly induced by the ordinary persuasive methods of the merchant
service officer to forego their sulkiness and turn-to diligently at
what work was required of them. But even with this help the heavy
ship was still considerably undermanned, and the incessant labor at
the pumps fell wearily on all hands. The Bay, true to its fickle
nature, changed on them again. The sunshine was swamped by a
driving gray mist of rain; the glass started on a steady fall; and
before dark, Kettle snugged her down to single topsails, himself
laying out on the foot-ropes with the Portuguese, as no others of
his crew could manage to scramble aloft with so heavy a sea
running.</p>
<p>The night worsened as it went on; the wind piled up steadily in
violence; and the sea rose till the sodden vessel rode it with a
very babel of shrieks, and groans, and complaining sounds. Toward
morning, a terrific squall powdered up against them and hove her
down, and a dull rumbling was heard in her bowels to let them know
that once more her cargo had shifted.</p>
<p>For the moment, even Kettle thought that this time she was gone
for good. She lost her way, and lay down like a log in the water,
and the racing seas roared over her as though she had been a
half-tide rock. By a miracle no one was washed overboard. But her
people hung here and there to eyebolts and ropes, mere nerveless
wisps of humanity, incapable under those teeming cataracts of waves
to lift so much as a finger to help themselves.</p>
<p>Then to the impact of a heavier gasp of the squall, the
topgallant masts went, and the small loss of of top-weight seemed
momentarily to ease her. Kettle seized upon the moment. He left the
trimmer and one of the Portuguese at the wheel, and handed himself
along the streaming decks and kicked and cuffed the rest of his
crew into activity. He gave his orders, and the ship wore slowly
round before the wind, and began to pay away on the other tack.</p>
<p>Great hills of sea deluged her in the process, and her people
worked like mermen, half of their time submerged. But by degrees,
as the vast rollers hit and shook her with their ponderous impact,
she came upright again, and after a little while shook the grain
level in her holds, and assumed her normal, angle of heel.</p>
<p>Dayton-Philipps struggled up and, hit Kettle on the shoulder.
"How's that, umpire?" he bawled. "My faith, you are a clever,
sailor."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle touched his hat. "God bore a hand there, sir," he
shouted through the wind. "If I'd tried to straighten her up like
that without outside help, every man here would have been fish-chop
this minute."</p>
<p>Even Dayton-Philipps, sceptical though he might be, began to
think there was "something in it" as the voyage went on. To begin
with, the leak stopped. They did not know how it had happened, and
they did not very much care. Kettle had his theories. Anyway it
stopped. To go on with, although they were buffeted with every kind
of evil weather, all their mischances were speedily rectified. In a
heavy sea, all their unstable cargo surged about as though it had
been liquid, but it always shifted back again before she quite
capsized. The mizzen-mast went bodily overboard in one black
rain-squall because they were too short-handed to get sail off it
in time, but they found that the vessel sailed almost as well as a
brig, and was much easier for a weak crew to manage.</p>
<p>All hands got covered with salt-water boils. All hands, with the
exception of Kettle--who remained, as usual, neat--grew gaunt,
bearded, dirty, and unkempt. They were grimed with sea-salt, they
were flayed with violent suns; but by dint of hard schooling they
were becoming handy sailormen, all of them, and even the negro
stonemason learned to obey an order without first thinking over its
justice till he earned a premonitory hiding.</p>
<p>In the throat of the English Channel a blundering steamship did
her best to run them down, and actually rasped sides with the
sailing-vessel as she tore past into the night; but nobody made an
attempt to jump for safety on to her decks, nobody even took the
trouble to swear at her with any thing like heartfelt
profanity.</p>
<p>"It's a blooming Flying Dutchman we're on," said the
coal-trimmer who acted as mate. "There's no killing the old beast.
Only hope she gets us ashore somehow, and doesn't stay fooling
about at sea forever just to get into risks. I want to get off her.
She's too blooming lucky to be quite wholesome somehow."</p>
<p>Kettle had intended to make a Channel port, but a gale hustled
him north round Land's End, "and you see," he said to
Dayton-Philipps, "what I get for not being sufficiently trustful.
The old girl's papers are made out to Cardiff, and here we are
pushed round into the Bristol Channel. By James! look, there's a
tug making up to us. Thing like that makes you feel homey, doesn't
it, sir?"</p>
<p>The little spattering tug wheeled up within hail, tossing like a
cork on the brown waves of the estuary, and the skipper in the
green pulpit between the paddle-boxes waved a hand cheerily.</p>
<p>"Seem to have found some dirty weather, Captain," he bawled.
"Want a pull into Cardiff or Newport?"</p>
<p>"Cardiff. What price?"</p>
<p>"Say &pound;100."</p>
<p>"I wasn't asking to buy the tug. You're putting a pretty fancy
figure on her for that new lick of paint you've got on your
rails."</p>
<p>"I'll take &pound;80."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can sail her in myself if you're going to be funny. She's
as handy as a pilot-boat, brig rigged like this, and my crew know
her fine. I'll give you &pound;20 into Cardiff, and you're to dock
me for that."</p>
<p>"Twenty wicked people. Now look here, Captain, you don't look
very prosperous with that vessel of yours, and will probably have
the sack from owners for mishandling her when you get ashore, and I
don't want to embitter your remaining years in the workus, so I'll
pull you in for fifty quid."</p>
<p>"&pound;20, old bottle nose."</p>
<p>"Come now, Captain, thirty. I'm not here for sport. I've got to
make my living."</p>
<p>"My man," said Kettle, "I'll meet you and make it &pound;25, and
I'll see you in Aden before I give a penny more. You can take that,
or sheer off."</p>
<p>"Throw us your blooming rope," said the tug skipper.</p>
<p>"There, sir," said Kettle <i>sotto voce</i> to Dayton-Philipps,
"you see the marvellousness of it? God has stood by me to the very
end. I've saved at least &pound;10 over that towage, and, by James!
I've seen times when a ship mauled about like this would have been
bled for four times the amount before a tug would pluck her
in."</p>
<p>"Then we are out of the wood now?"</p>
<p>"We'll get the canvas off her, and then you can go below and
shave. You can sleep in a shore bed this night, if you choose, sir,
and to-morrow we'll see about fingering the salvage. There'll be no
trouble there now; we shall just have to ask for a check and Lloyds
will pay it, and then you and the hands will take your share, and
I--by James! Mr. Philipps, I shall be a rich man over this
business. I shouldn't be a bit surprised but what I finger a snug
&pound;500 as my share. Oh, sir, Heaven's been very good to me over
this, and I know it, and I'm grateful. My wife will be grateful
too. I wish you could come to our chapel some day and see her."</p>
<p>"You deserve your luck, Captain, if ever a man did in this
world, and, by Jove! we'll celebrate it. We've been living on pig's
food for long enough. We'll find the best hotel in Cardiff, and
we'll get the best dinner the <i>chef</i> there can produce. I want
you to be my guest at that."</p>
<p>"I must ask you to excuse me," said Kettle. "I've received a
good deal just lately, and I'm thankful, and I want to say so. If
you don't mind, I'd rather say it alone."</p>
<p>"I understand, Skipper. You're a heap better man than I am, and
if you don't mind, I'd like to shake hands with you. Thanks. We may
not meet again, but I shall never forget you and what we've seen on
this murderous old wreck of a ship. Hullo, there's Cardiff not
twenty minutes ahead. Well, I must go below and clean up after
you've docked her."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>TO CAPTURE AN HEIRESS</h3>
<br>
<p>The <i>Parakeet</i> had discharged the last of her coal into the
lighters alongside, had cast off from the mooring buoys, and was
steaming out of the baking heat of Suez harbor on her way down
toward the worse heat of the Red Sea beyond. The clatter and dirt
of the-working ships, with the smells of hot iron and black
humanity, were dying out astern, and presently she slowed up to
drop the pilot into his boat, and then stood on again along her
course.</p>
<p>A passenger, a young man of eight or nine-and-twenty, lounged on
a camp-stool under the upper bridge awning, and watched the
<i>Parakeet's</i> captain as he walked briskly across and across,
and presently, when the little sailor faced him, he nodded as
though he had decided something that was in his thoughts.</p>
<p>"Well, sir?" said Captain Kettle.</p>
<p>"I wish you wouldn't look so anxious. We've started now, and may
as well make up our minds to go through it comfortably."</p>
<p>"Quite so," said Kettle. "I'm thinking out how we are to do this
business in comfort--and safety," and with that he resumed his
walk.</p>
<p>The man beside him had introduced himself when the black workers
were carrying the <i>Parakeet's</i> cargo of coal in baskets from
the holds to the lighters alongside; and Kettle had been rather
startled to find that he carried a letter of introduction from the
steamboat's owners. The letter gave him no choice of procedure. It
stated with clearness that Mr. Hugh Wenlock, solicitor, had laid
his wishes before them, and that they had agreed to further these
wishes (through the agency of their servant--Captain Owen Kettle)
in consideration of the payment of &pound;200 sterling.</p>
<p>The <i>Parakeet</i> was a cargo tramp, and carried no passenger
certificate, but a letter of recommendation like this was
equivalent to a direct order, and Kettle signed Mr. Wenlock on to
his crew list as "Doctor," and put to sea with an anxious mind.</p>
<p>Wenlock waited awhile, watching squalid Suez sink into the sea
behind; and then he spoke again.</p>
<p>"Look here, Captain," he said, "those South Arabian ports have
got a lot worse reputation than they really deserve. The people
down there twenty years ago were a pack of pirates, I'll grant you,
but nowadays they know that if they get at any of their old games,
a British gunboat promptly comes up next week and bombards them at
two-mile range, and that's not good enough. They may not be honest
from inclination, but they've got the fear of the gunboat always
handy, and that's a wonderful civilizing power. I tell you,
captain, you needn't be frightened; that pirate business is
exploded for now and always."</p>
<p>"I know all about the piratical hankerings of those South
Arabian niggers, sir," said Kettle stiffly, "and I know what they
can do and what they can't do as well as any man living. And I know
also what I can do myself at a push, and the knowledge leaves me
pretty comfortable. But if you choose to think me frightened, I'll
own I am. It's the navigation down there that gave me cold shivers
the first moment you mentioned it."</p>
<p>"Why, it's no worse than the Red Sea here, anyway."</p>
<p>"Red Sea's bad, but you can get good charts of it and rely on
them. South Arabian coast is no better, and the charts aren't worth
the paper they're printed on. There are bad tide-rips down there,
sir, and there are bad reefs, and there's bad fog, and the truth of
it is, there's no handier place to lose a ship in all the big, wide
world."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't like you to wreck the steamer down there. It might
be awkward for me getting back."</p>
<p>"Quite so," said Kettle, "you're thinking of yourself, and I
don't blame you. I'm thinking of myself also. I'm a man that's met
a great deal of misfortune, sir, and from one thing and another
I've been eight years without a regular command. I had the luck to
bring in a derelict the other day, and pocket a good salvage out of
her, and my present owners heard of it, and they put me as master
of this steamer, just because of that luck."</p>
<p>"Nothing like luck."</p>
<p>"If you don't lose it. But I am not anxious to pile up this
steamboat on some uncharted reef just because luck has left me, and
have to wait another eight years before I find another
command."</p>
<p>"And, as I say, I'm as keen as you are not to get the steamer
wrecked, and if there's any way she can be kept out of a dangerous
area, and you can manage to set me ashore where I want in a boat,
just you say, and I'll meet you all I can. But at the same time,
Skipper, if you don't mind doing a swap, you might give me a good
deal of help over my matter in return."</p>
<p>"I haven't heard your business yet, sir. All you've told me is
that you want to be set down in this place, Dunkhot, and be taken
off again after you've stayed there four-and-twenty hours."</p>
<p>"Well, you see I didn't want it talked over beforehand. If the
newspapers got hold of the yarn, and made a lot of fuss about it,
they might upset a certain marriage that I've very much set my
heart upon."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle looked puzzled. "I don't seem to quite follow
you, sir."</p>
<p>"You shall hear the tale from the beginning. We have plenty of
time ahead of us just now. You remember the wreck of the
<i>Rangoon</i>?"</p>
<p>"She was coming home from East Indian ports, wasn't she, and got
on fire somewhere off Cape Guardafui? But that'll have been twenty
years back, in the old overland days, before the Ditch was opened.
Only about ten of her people saved, if I remember."</p>
<p>"That's about right," said Wenlock, "though it's twenty years
ago now. She was full of Anglo-Indians, and their loss made a great
sensation at the time. Amongst others was a Colonel Anderson, and
his wife, and their child Teresa, aged nine; and what made their
deaths all the more sad was the fact that Anderson's elder brother
died just a week before, and he would have come home to find a
peerage and large estates waiting for him."</p>
<p>"I can feel for that man," said Kettle.</p>
<p>"I can feel most for the daughter," said Wenlock.</p>
<p>"How do you mean, sir?"</p>
<p>"Well, Colonel Anderson's dead, and his wife's dead, but the
daughter isn't, or at any rate she was very much alive twelve
months ago, that's all. The whole lot of them, with others, got
into one of the <i>Rangoon's</i> boats, and after frizzling about
at sea till they were nearly starved, got chucked on that South
Arabian coast (which you say is so rocky and dangerous), and were
drowned in the process. All barring Teresa, that is. She was pulled
out of the water by the local niggers, and was brought up by them,
and I've absolutely certain information that not a year ago she was
living in Dunkhot as quite a big personage in her way."</p>
<p>"And she's 'My Lady' now, if she only knew?"</p>
<p>"Well, not that. The title doesn't descend in the female line,
but Colonel Anderson made a will in her favor after she was born,
and the present earl, who's got the estates, would have to shell
out if she turned up again."</p>
<p>"My owners, in their letter, mentioned that you were a
solicitor. Then you are employed by his lordship, sir?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wenlock laughed. "Not much," he said. "I'm on my own hook.
Why, hang it all, Captain, you must see that no man of his own free
will would be idiot enough to resurrect a long-forgotten niece just
to make himself into a beggar."</p>
<p>"I don't see why not, sir, if he got to know she was alive. Some
men have consciences, and even a lord, I suppose, is a man."</p>
<p>"The present earl has far too good a time of it to worry about
running a conscience. No, I bet he fights like a thief for the
plunder, however clear a case we have to show him. And as he's the
man in possession and has plenty of ready cash for law expenses,
the odds are he'll turn out too big to worry at through all the
courts, and we shall compromise. I'd like that best myself. Cash
down has a desirable feel about it."</p>
<p>"It has, sir," said Kettle with a reminiscent sigh. "Even to
pocket a tenth of what is rightfully yours is better than getting
mixed up with that beastly law. But will the other relatives of the
young lady, those that are employing you, I mean, agree to
that?"</p>
<p>"Don't I tell you, Captain, I'm on my own hook? There are no
other relatives--or at least none that would take a ha'porth of
interest in Teresa's getting the estates. I've gone into the thing
on sheer spec, and for what I can make out of it, and that, if
all's well, will be the whole lump."</p>
<p>"But how? The young lady may give you something in her
gratitude, of course, but you can't expect it all."</p>
<p>"I do, though, and I tell you how I'm going to get it. I shall
marry the fair Teresa. Simple as tumbling off a house."</p>
<p>Kettle drew himself up stiffly and walked to the other end of
the bridge, and began ostentatiously to look with a professional
eye over his vessel.</p>
<p>Wenlock was quick to see the change. "Come, what is it now,
Captain?" he asked with some surprise.</p>
<p>"I don't like the idea of those sort of marriages," said the
little sailor, acidly.</p>
<p>Wenlock shrugged his shoulders good-humoredly.</p>
<p>"Neither do I, and if I were a rich man, I wouldn't have dreamed
of it. Just think of what the girl probably is: she's been with
those niggers since she was quite a kid; she'll be quite
uneducated; I'm in hopes she's good-looking and has a decent
figure; but at the best she'll be quite unpresentable till I've had
her in hand for at least a couple of years, if then. Of course
you'll say there's 'romance' about the thing. But then I don't care
tuppence about romance, and anyway it's beastly unconfortable to
live with."</p>
<p>"I was not looking at that point of view."</p>
<p>"Let me tell you how I was fixed," said Wenlock with a burst of
confidence. "I'd a small capital. So I qualified as a solicitor,
and put up a door-plate, and waited for a practice. It didn't come.
Not a client drifted near me from month's end to month's end. And
meanwhile the capital was dribbling away. I felt I was getting on
my back legs; it was either a case of the Colonies or the
workhouse, and I'd no taste for either; and when the news of this
girl Teresa came, I tell you I just jumped at the chance. I don't
want to marry her, of course; there are ten other girls I'd rather
have as wife; but there was no other way out of the difficulty, so
I just swallowed my squeamishness for good and always. See?"</p>
<p>"It was Miss Teresa Anderson I was pitying," said Kettle
pointedly.</p>
<p>"Good Lord, man, why? Isn't it the finest thing in the world for
her?"</p>
<p>"It might be fine to get away from where she is, and land home
to find a nice property waiting. But I don't care to see a woman
have a husband forced on her. It would be nobler of you, Mr.
Wenlock, to let the young lady get to England, and look round her
for a while, and make her own choice."</p>
<p>"I'm too hard up to be noble," said Wenlock drily. "I've not
come here on philanthropy, and marrying that girl is part of my
business. Besides, hang it all, man, think of what she is, and
think of what I am." He looked himself up and down with a half
humorous smile--"I know nice people at home who would be civil to
her, and after all, hang it, I'm not unmarriageable
personally."</p>
<p>"Still," said Kettle doggedly, "I don't like the idea of
it."</p>
<p>"Then let me give you an inducement. I said I was not down here
on philanthropy, and I don't suppose you are either. You'll have my
passage money?"</p>
<p>"Two and a-half per cent of it is my commission. The rest goes
to the owners, of course."</p>
<p>"Very well, then. In addition to that, if you'll help this
marriage on in the way I ask, I'll give you &pound;50."</p>
<p>"There's no man living who could do more usefully with &pound;50
if I saw my way of fingering it."</p>
<p>"I think I see what you mean. No, you won't have to wait for it.
I've got the money here in hard cash in my pocket ready for you to
take over the minute it's earned."</p>
<p>"I was wondering, sir, if I could earn it honorably. You must
give me time to think this out. I'll try and give you an answer
after tea. And for the present I shall have to leave you. I've got
to go through the ship's papers: I have to be my own clerk on board
here just now, though the Company did certainly promise me a much
better ship if I beat up plenty of cargo, and made a good voyage of
it with this."</p>
<p>The <i>Parakeet</i> worked her way along down the Red Sea at her
steady nine knots, and Mr. Hugh Wenlock put a couple of bunk
pillows on a canvas boat-cover under the bridge deck awnings, and
lay there and amused himself with cigarettes and a magazine.
Captain Owen Kettle sat before a table in the chart-house with his
head on one side, and a pen in his fingers, and went through
accounts. But though Wenlock, when he had finished his magazine,
quickly went off to sleep, Captain Kettle's struggles with
arithmetic were violent enough to keep him very thoroughly awake,
and when a due proportion of the figures had been checked, he put
the papers in a drawer, and was quite ready to tackle the next
subject.</p>
<p>He had not seen necessary to mention the fact to Mr. Wenlock,
but while that young man was talking of the Miss Teresa Anderson,
who at present was "quite a big personage in her way" at Dunkhot, a
memory had come to him that he had heard of the lady before in
somewhat less prosaic terms. All sailormen who have done business
on the great sea highway between West and East during recent years
have had the yarn given to them at one time or another, and most of
them have regarded it as gratuitous legend. Kettle was one of
these. But he was beginning to think there was something more in it
than a mere sailor's yarn, and he was anxious to see if there was
any new variation in the telling.</p>
<p>So he sent for Murray, his mate, a smart young sailor of the
newer school, who preferred to be called "chief officer," made him
sit, and commenced talk of a purely professional nature. Finally he
said: "And since I saw you last, the schedule's changed. We call in
at Dunkhot, for that passenger Mr. Wenlock to do some private
business ashore, before we go on to our Persian Gulf ports."</p>
<p>Murray repeated the name thoughtfully. "Dunkhot? Let's see,
that's on the South Arabian coast, about a day's steam from Aden,
and a beast of a place to get at, so I've heard. Oh, and of course,
that's the place where the She-Sultan, or Queen, or whatever she
calls herself, is boss."</p>
<p>"So there is really a woman of that kind there, is there? I'd
heard of her, like everybody else has, but I thought she was only a
yarn."</p>
<p>"No, she's there in the flesh, sir, right enough; lots of flesh,
according to what I've gathered. A serang of one of the B. and I.
boats, who'd been in Dunkhot, told me about her only last year. She
makes war, leads her troops, cuts off heads, and does the Eastern
potentate up to the mark. The serang said she was English, too,
though I don't believe much in that. One-tenth English would
probably be more near the truth. The odds are she'll be Eurasian,
and those snuff-and-butter colored ladies, when they get amongst
people blacker than themselves, always try to ignore their own lick
of the tar-brush."</p>
<p>"Fat, is she?"</p>
<p>"The serang said she-was a big buffalo bull of a woman, with a
terror of a temper. I don't know what's Mr. Wenlock's business,
sir; but whether he wants to start a dry-goods agency, or merely to
arrange for smuggling in some rifles, he'd better make up his mind
to square her first and foremost. She will have a finger in every
pie. She's as curious as a monkey, too, and there's no doing
anything without letting her know. And when she says a thing, it's
got to be done."</p>
<p>"Is she the head chief's favorite wife, then?"</p>
<p>"That's the funny part of it: she isn't married. These Orientals
always get husbands early as a general thing, and you'd have
thought that in her juvenile days, before she got power, they'd
have married her to some one about the town, whether she liked it
or not. But it seems they didn't, because she said she'd certainly
poison any man if they sent her into his zenana. And later on, when
she came to be boss, she still kept to spinsterhood. Guess there
wasn't any man about the place white enough to suit her taste."</p>
<p>"H'm. What you've told me seems to let daylight on to
things."</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, sir?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle put his hand kindly on Murray's shoulder. "Don't
ask me to explain now, my lad, but when the joke comes you shall
share the laugh. There's a young man on this ship (I don't mind
telling you in confidence) whose ways I don't quite like, and I
think he's going to get a lesson."</p>
<p>He went out then under the awnings of the bridge deck, and told
Wenlock that he would probably be able to earn his fee for helping
on the marriage, and Wenlock confidently thought that he quite
understood the situation.</p>
<p>"Skipper's a bit of a methody," thought Mr. Hugh Wenlock, "but
his principles don't go very deep when there are fifty sovereigns
to be earned. Well, he's a useful man, and if he gets me snugly
married to that little girl, he'll be cheap at the price."</p>
<p>The <i>Parakeet's</i> voyage to Dunkhot was not swift.
Eight-and-a-half knots was her most economical pace for coal
consumption, and at that gait she steamed. With a reputation to
make with his new owners, and two and a-half per cent, commission
on all profits, Kettle had developed into a regular glutton for
cargo; and the knowledge of men and places which he had so
laboriously acquired in former days served him finely. Three times
he got doles of cargo at good stiff freights at points where few
other men would have dreamed of looking. He was an ideal man for
the master of an ocean tramp. He was exactly honest; he had a world
of misfortunes behind to spur him on; he was quick of decision; and
he had developed a nose for cargo, and a knack of extorting it from
merchants, that were little short of miraculous. And, in fact, if
things went on as they had started, he stood a very good chance of
making 50 per cent, on the <i>Parakeet's</i> capital for the
voyage, and so earning promotion to one of the firm's better
ships.</p>
<p>But though in the many days of his adversity Captain Kettle had
never shunned any risks which came in his way, with this new
prosperity fresh and pleasant at his feet, he was beginning to tell
himself that risks were foolish things. He arrived off Dunkhot and
rang off his engines, and frowned angrily at the shore.</p>
<p>The town stood on an eminence, snugly walled, and filled with
cool, square houses. At one side, the high minaret of a mosque
stood up like a bayonet, and at the other, standing in a ring of
garden, was a larger building, which seemed to call itself palace.
There was a small fringe of cultivation beside the walls of the
town, and beyond was arid desert, which danced and shimmered under
the violent sun.</p>
<p>But all this lay small and far off, like a tiny picture in some
huge frame, and showing only through the glass. A maze of reefs
guarded the shore, and tore up the sleek Indian Ocean swells into
spouting breakers; and though there was anchorage inside, tenanted
indeed by a score of sailing craft, the way to it was openly
perilous. And so for the present the <i>Parakeet</i> lay to,
rolling outside the entrance, flying a pilot jack, and waiting
developments.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle might have his disquieting thoughts, still
outwardly he was cool. But Mr. Hugh Wenlock was on deck in the
sprucest of his apparel, and was visibly anxious and fidgety, as
befitted a man who shortly expected to enter into the bonds of
matrimony.</p>
<p>A double-ended boat came off presently, manned by naked Arabs,
and steered by a man in a white burnous. She swept up alongside,
caught a rope and made fast, and the man in white introduced
himself as a pilot. They are all good Mohammedans down there, or
nominally, and so of course there was no question of a clean bill
of health. Islam is not impious enough to check the spread of any
disease which Allah may see good to send for its chastening.</p>
<p>The pilot wanted to take them in at once. He spoke some English,
and carried an air of confidence. He could guide them through the
reefs in the most complete of safety, and he could guarantee fine
openings for trade, once inside.</p>
<p>"I dare say," grunted Kettle under his breath, "but you're a
heap too uncertificated for my taste. Why, you don't even offer a
book of forged logs to try and work off your humbug with some look
of truth. No, I know the kind of pilot you are. You'd pile up the
steamboat on the first convenient reef, and then be one of the
first to come and loot her."--He turned to Murray: "Now, look here,
Mr. Mate. I'll leave you in charge, and see you keep steam up and
don't leave the deck. Don't let any of these niggers come on board
on any pretence whatever, and if they try it on, steam out to sea.
I'll get through Mr. Wenlock's business ashore as quick as lean,
and perhaps pick up a ton or two of cargo for ourselves."</p>
<p>Below, in the dancing boat which ground against the steamer's
side, the pilot clamored that a ladder might be thrown to him so
that he might come on board and take the <i>Parakeet</i> forthwith
into the anchorage; and to him again Kettle turned, and temporized.
He must go ashore himself first, he said, and see what offer there
was of trade, before he took the steamer in. To which the pilot,
though visibly disappointed, saw fit to agree, as no better offer
was forthcoming.</p>
<p>"Now, sir," said Kettle to Wenlock, "into the boat with you. The
less time that's wasted, the better I shall be pleased."</p>
<p>"All right," said Wenlock, pointing to a big package on the
deck. "Just tell some of your men to shove that case down into the
boat, and I'm ready."</p>
<p>Kettle eyed the bulky box with disfavor. "What's in it?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"A present or a bribe; whichever you care to call it. If you
want to know precisely, it's rifles. I thought they would be most
acceptable."</p>
<p>"Rifles are liked hereabouts. Is it for a sort of introductory
present?"</p>
<p>"Well, if you must know, Captain, it's occurred to me that
Teresa is probably an occupant of somebody's harem, and that I
shall have to buy her off from her husband. Hence the case of
rifles."</p>
<p>A queer look came over Captain Kettle's face. "And you'd still
marry this woman if she had another husband living?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Haven't I told you that I've thought the whole thing
thoroughly over already, and I'm not inclined to stick at trifles?
But I may tell you that divorce is easy in these Mohammedan
countries, and I shall take care to get the girl set legally free
before we get away from here. You don't catch me getting mixed with
bigamy."</p>
<p>"But tell me. Is a Mohammedan marriage made here binding for an
Englishman?"</p>
<p>"It's as legally binding as if the Archbishop of Canterbury tied
the knot."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Kettle. "Now let me tell you, sir, for the
last time, that I don't like what you're going to do. To my mind,
it's not a nice thing marrying a woman that you evidently despise,
just for her money."</p>
<p>Wenlock flushed. "Look here," he said, "I refuse to be lectured,
especially by you. Aren't you under promise to get &pound;50 from
me the moment I'm safely married? And didn't you fairly jump at the
chance of fingering it."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle did not hit this man who cast such an unpleasant
imputation on him; he did not even let him feel the lash of his
tongue in return. He merely smiled grimly, and said: "Get down into
the boat, you and your case of rifles."</p>
<p>For the moment Wenlock started and hesitated. He seemed to
detect something ominous in this order. But then he took a brace on
his courage, and after a couple of deck hands had lowered the
rifles into the dancing boat, he clambered gingerly down after
them, and sat himself beside the white-robed man in the stern
sheets. Kettle followed, and the boat headed off for the opening
between the reefs.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean swells swung beneath them, and presently were
breaking on the grim stone barriers on either hand in a roar of
sound. The triangular dorsal fins of a couple of sharks convoyed
them in, in case of accidents; and overhead a crowd of sea-fowl
screamed and swooped and circled. But none of these things
interested them. The town ahead, which jerked nearer to every tug
of the oars, held the eye. In it was Teresa Anderson, heiress, a
personage of whom each of them had his own private conception. In
it also were fanatical Arabs, whom they hoped the fear of shadowy
British gunboats would deter from open piracy.</p>
<p>The boat passed between a cluster of ragged shipping which
swayed at the anchorage, and Wenlock might have stared with curious
eyes (had he been so minded) on real dhows which had even then got
real slaves ready for market in their stuffy 'tween decks. But he
was gazing with a fascinated stare at the town. Over the arch of
the water-gate, for which they were heading, was what at first
appeared to be a frieze of small rounded balls; but a nearer view
resolved these into human heads, in various stages of desiccation.
Evidently justice in Dunkhot was determined that the criminal who
once passed through its hands should no more tread the paths of
unrighteousness.</p>
<p>The boat landed against a jetty of stone, and they stepped out
dryshod. Wenlock stared at the gate with its dressing of heads as
though they fascinated him.</p>
<p>"And Teresa will have been brought up within sight of all this,"
he murmured to himself, "and will be accustomed to it. Fancy
marrying a woman who has spent twenty years of her life in the
neighborhood of all this savagery."</p>
<p>"Strong place in its way," said Kettle, squinting up at the
brass cannon on the walls. "Those guns up there are well kept, you
can see. Of course one of our cheapest fourpenny gunboats could
knock the whole shop into bricks in half an hour at three-mile
range; but it's strong enough to hold out against any niggers along
the coast here, and that's all the Queen here aims at. By the way,
Emir, not Queen, is what she calls herself, so the pilot tells me.
I suppose she thinks that as she's doing a man's job in a man's
way, she may as well take a full man's ticket."</p>
<p>They passed in through the gate, the sentries staring at them
curiously, and once inside, in the full heat and smell of the
narrow street beyond, Wenlock said: "Look here, Skipper, you're
resourceful, and you know these out-of-the-way places. How had we
better start to find the girl?"</p>
<p>Kettle glanced coolly round at the grim buildings and the savage
Arabs who jostled them, and said, with fine sarcasm: "Well, sir, as
there doesn't appear to be a policeman about, I should recommend
you to apply at the post office."</p>
<p>"I don't want to be mocked."</p>
<p>"Then, if you'll take the tip from me, you'll crowd back to my
steamboat as fast as you can go. You'll find it healthier."</p>
<p>"I'm going on with it," said Wenlock doggedly. "And I ask you to
earn your &pound;50, and give me help."</p>
<p>"Then, if you distinctly ask me to help you on into trouble like
that, of course, the best thing to do is to go straight on to the
palace."</p>
<p>"Show the way, then," said Wenlock curtly.</p>
<p>Kettle gave the word to the white-robed pilot, and together they
set off down the narrow winding streets, with an ever-increasing
train of Arabs and negroes following in their wake. Wenlock said
nothing as he walked, but it was evident from the working of his
face that his mind was very full. But Kettle looked about him with
open interest, and thoughts in verse about this Eastern town came
to him with pleasant readiness.</p>
<p>The royal residence was the large building encircled with
gardens which they had seen from the sea, and they entered it with
little formality. There was no trouble either about obtaining an
audience. The Lady Emir had, it appeared, seen the steamer's
approach with her own eyes; indeed, the whole of Dunkhot was
excited by such an unusual arrival; and the Head of the State was
as human in her curiosity as the meanest nigger among her
subjects.</p>
<p>The audience hall was imposing. It was bare enough, according to
the rule of those heated Eastern lands, but it had an air of
comfort and coolness, and in those parts where it was not severely
plain, the beauty of its architecture was delicious. Armed guards
to the number of some forty men were posted round the walls, and at
the further end, apparently belonging to the civil population, were
some dozen other men squatting on the floor. In the centre of the
room was a naked wretch in chains; but sentence was hurriedly
pronounced on him, and he was hustled away as the two Englishmen
entered, and they found themselves face to face with the only woman
in the room, the supreme ruler of this savage South Arabian coast
town.</p>
<p>She was seated on a raised divan, propped by cushions, and in
front of her was a huge water-pipe at which she occasionally took a
meditative pull. She was dressed quite in Oriental fashion, in
trousers, zouave jacket, sash, and all the rest of it; but she was
unmistakably English in features, though strongly suggestive of the
Boadicea. She was a large, heavily-boned woman, enormously covered
with flesh, and she dandled across her knees that very unfeminine
sceptre, an English cavalryman's sword. But the eye neglected these
details, and was irresistibly drawn by the strongness of her face.
Even Kettle was almost awed by it.</p>
<p>But Captain Owen Kettle-was not a man who could be kept in awe
for long. He took off his helmet, marched briskly up toward the
divan, and bowed.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, your Ladyship," he said. "I trust I see you
well. I'm Captain Kettle, master of that steamboat now lying in
your roads, and this is Mr. Wenlock, a passenger of mine, who heard
that you were English, and has come to put you in the way of some
property at home."</p>
<p>The lady sat more upright, and set back her great shoulders. "I
am English," she said. "I was called in the Giaour faith Teresa
Anderson."</p>
<p>"That's the name," said Kettle. "Mr. Wenlock's come to take you
away to step into a nice thing at home."</p>
<p>"I am Emir here. Am I asked to be Emir in your country?"</p>
<p>"Why, no," said Kettle; "that job's filled already, and we
aren't thinking of making a change. Our present Emir in England
(who, by the way, is a lady like yourself) seems to suit us very
well. No, you'll be an ordinary small-potato citizen, like
everybody else, and you will probably find it a bit of a
change."</p>
<p>"I do not onderstand," said the woman. "I have not spoke your
language since I was child. Speak what you say again."</p>
<p>"I'll leave it to Mr. Wenlock, your Majesty, if you've no
objections, as he's the party mostly interested; and if you'd ask
one of your young men to bring me a long drink and a chair, I'll be
obliged. It's been a hot walk up here. I see you don't mind smoke,"
he added, and lit a cheroot.</p>
<p>Now, it was clear from the attitude of the guards and the
civilians present, that Kettle was jostling heavily upon court
etiquette, and at first the Lady Emir was very clearly inclined to
resent it, and had sharp orders for repression ready upon her lips.
But she changed her mind, perhaps through some memory that by blood
she was related to this nonchalant race; and presently cushions
were brought, on which Captain Kettle bestowed himself
tailor-fashion (with his back cautiously up against a wall), and
then a negro slave knelt before him and offered sweet sticky
sherbet, which he drank with a wry face.</p>
<p>But in the mean while Mr. Wenlock was stating his case with
small forensic eloquence. The sight of Miss Teresa Anderson in the
flesh awed him. He had pictured to himself some slim, quiet exile,
perhaps a little gauche and timid, but at any rate amenable to
instruction and to his will. He had forgotten the developing power
of tropical suns. The woman before him, whose actual age was
twenty-nine, looked fifty, and even for a desperate man like
himself was impossible as a wife in England.</p>
<p>He felt daunted before her already. It flashed through his mind
that it was she who had ordered those grisly heads to be stuck
above the water-gate, and he heartily wished himself away back on
the steamer, tramping for cargo. He was not wanting in pluck as a
usual thing, this unsuccessful solicitor, but before a woman like
this, with such a record behind her, a man may well be scared and
yet not be accused of cowardice.</p>
<p>But the Lady Emir looked on Wenlock in a very different way to
that in which she had regarded Kettle. Mr. Wenlock possessed (as
indeed he had himself pointed out on the <i>Parakeet</i>) a fine
outward appearance, and in fact anywhere he could have been
remarked on as a personable man. And things came about as Kettle
shrewdly anticipated they would. The Lady Emir had not remained
unmarried all these years through sheer distaste for matrimony. She
had been celibate through an unconquerable pride of blood. None but
men of colored race had been around her in all her wars, her
governings, and her diplomacies; and always she had been too proud
to mate with them. But here now stood before her a male of her own
race, handsome, upstanding, and obviously impressed by her power
and majesty. He would not rule her; he would not even attempt a
mastery; she would still be Emir--and a wife. The chance had never
occurred to her before; might never occur again. She was quick to
make her decision.</p>
<p>Ruling potentates are not as other folk with their love affairs,
and the Lady Emir of Dunkhot (forgetting that she was once Teresa
Anderson, and a modest English maiden) unconsciously fell in with
the rule of her caste. The English speech, long disused, came to
her unhandily, but the purport of what she said was plain. She made
proclamation that the Englishman Wenlock should there and then
become her husband, and let slaves fetch the mullah to unite them
before the sun had dropped below another bar of the windows.</p>
<p>She did not ask her future husband's wishes or his permission.
She simply stated her sovereign will and looked that it should be
carried out forthwith.</p>
<p>A couple of slaves scurried out on their missions--evidently
their Emir was accustomed to have her orders carried out with
promptness--and for long enough Wenlock stood wordless in front of
the divan, far more like a criminal than a prospective bridegroom.
The lady, with the tube of the water-pipe between her lips, puffed
smoke and made no further speech. She had stated her will: the
result would follow in due course.</p>
<p>But at last Wenlock, as though wrenching himself into
wakefulness out of some horrid dream, turned wildly to Kettle, and
in a torrent of words implored for rescue.</p>
<p>The little sailor heard him quite unmoved. "You asked my help,"
he said, "in a certain matter, and I've given it, and things have
turned out just as I've guessed they would. You maundered about
your dear Teresa on my steamboat till I was nearly sick, and, by
James! you've got her now, and no error about it."</p>
<p>"But you said you didn't approve," cried the wretched man.</p>
<p>"I quite know what I said," retorted Kettle grimly. "I didn't
approve of your way. But this is different. You're not a very fine
specimen, but anyway you're English, and it does good to the old
shop at home to have English people for kings and queens of foreign
countries. I've got a theory about that."</p>
<br>
<a name="page205.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/page205.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>"I'm a British subject".</b></p>
<br>
<p>Now the Lady Emir was not listening to all this tirade by any
means unmoved. To begin with, it was not etiquette to speak at all
in her presence if unaddressed, and to go on with, although she did
not understand one word in ten of what was being spoken, she
gathered the gist of it, and this did not tend to compose her. She
threw away the snaky stem of water-pipe, and gripped both hands on
the trooper's sword, till the muscles stood out in high relief.</p>
<p>"Do you say," she demanded, "you onwilling marry me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Wenlock, with sullen emphasis.</p>
<p>She turned her head, and gave orders in Arabic. With marvellous
readiness, as though it was one of the regular appointments of the
place, a couple of the guards trundled a stained-wooden block into
the middle of the floor, another took his station beside it with an
ominous-looking axe poised over his shoulder, and almost before
Wenlock knew what was happening, he was pinned by a dozen men at
wrist and ankle, and thrust down to kneel "with his neck over the
block.</p>
<p>"Do you say," the Lady Emir repeated, "you onwilling marry
me?"</p>
<p>"I'm a British subject," Wenlock shouted. "I've a Foreign Office
passport in my pocket. I'll appeal to my Government over this."</p>
<p>"My lad," said Kettle, "you won't have time to appeal. The lady
isn't being funny. She means square biz. If you don't be sensible,
and see things in the same way she does, it'll be one
<i>che-opp</i>, and what happens afterward won't interest you."</p>
<p>"Those spikes," said Wenlock faintly.</p>
<p>"Above the water-gate?" said Kettle. "Queer, but the same thing
occurred to me, too. You'd feel a bit lonely stuck up there getting
sun-dried."</p>
<p>"I'll marry her."</p>
<p>"You'd better spread a bit more politeness about," Kettle
advised. "It will be all the more comfortable for you afterward if
you do." And so Wenlock, with desperation nerving him, poured out
all the pretty speeches which he had in store, and which he had
looked to use to this very woman under such very different
circumstances. But he did not even suggest taking his future spouse
back to England.</p>
<p>She, too, when she graciously pardoned his previous outburst,
mentioned her decision on this matter also.</p>
<p>"I am Emir here," she said, "and I could not be Emir in your
England without many fights. So here I shall stay, and you with me.
When there is war, you shall ride at my side; in peace I will give
you a governorship over a ward of this town, from which you can get
your taxes. And if there are children, you shall bring them
up."</p>
<p>The mullah, who knew better than to keep his ruler waiting, had
come in, and they were forthwith married, solemnly and irrevocably,
according to the rites and ceremonies of the Mohammedan Church, as
practised in the kingdom of Dunkhot. And in witness thereof,
Captain Kettle wrote his name from left to right, in
contradistinction to all the other signatories, who wrote from
right to left, except the bridegroom.</p>
<p>"And now, Mr. Wenlock, if you please," said Kettle, "as you're
comfortably tied to the lady of your choice, I'll trouble you for
that fee you promised."</p>
<p>"I'll see you in somewhere hotter than Arabia," said the
bridegroom, mopping his pale face.</p>
<p>"Now look," said Kettle, "I'm not going to scrap with you here,
and I don't want to break up this happy home with domestic
unpleasantness; but if you don't hand me over that &pound;50, I
shall ask your good lady to get it for me."</p>
<p>Wenlock sullenly handed out a note.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I know you feel injured, but I'm earning this money
exactly according to promise, and of you don't quite like what's
been done, you must remember that it's your own fault for not
wording the agreement a bit more carefully. And now, as I seem to
have got through my business here, if it's agreeable to all
parties, I'll be going. Good-by, Mrs. Wenlock, madam. Let me call
you by your name for the first time."</p>
<p>The Lady Emir set back her great shoulders. "That is not my
name," she said. "I am Emir. My name does not change."</p>
<p>"Beg pardon," said Kettle, "he takes yours, does he? Didn't know
that was the custom of this country. Well, good-afternoon."</p>
<p>"But do you want," said the lady, "no present?"</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Kettle, with a cock of the head, "but I take
presents from no one. What bit of a living I get, your ladyship, I
earn."</p>
<p>"I do not onderstand. But you are sailor. You have ship. You
wish cargo?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle snapped his fingers ecstatically. "Now, ma'am,
there you've hit it. Cargo's what I do want. I'll have to tell you
that freights are up a good deal just now, and you'll have to pay
for accommodation, but my ship's a good one, and my firm's
reliable, and will see that you are dealt by honest at the other
end."</p>
<p>"I do not onderstand."</p>
<p>"Of course you don't, your Majesty; of course you don't. Ladies
like you don't have to bother with the shipping trade. But just you
give me a line to the principal merchants in the town saying that
you'd like me to have a few tons of their stuff, and that'll do. I
guess that what your ladyship likes round here is usually
done."</p>
<p>"You wish me write. I will write. Now we will wash hands, and
there is banquet."</p>
<p>And so it came to pass that, some twenty-four hours later,
Captain Kettle returned to the <i>Parakeet</i> sun-scorched, and
flushed with success, and relieved the anxious Murray from his
watch. The mate was naturally curious to know what happened
ashore.</p>
<p>"Let me get a glass of Christian beer to wash all their sticky
nastinesses from my neck, and I'll tell you," said Kettle, and he
did with fine detail and circumstance.</p>
<p>"Well, Wenlock's got his heiress anyway," said Murray, with a
sigh, when the tale was over. "I suppose we may as well get under
way now, sir."</p>
<p>"Not much," said Kettle jubilantly. "Why, man, I've squeezed
every ton of cargo they have in the place, and stuck them for
freights in a way that would surprise you. Here's the tally: 270
bags of coffee, 700 packets of dates, 350 baskets of figs, and all
for London. And, mark you," said Kettle, hitting the table, "that
or more'll be waiting for me there every time I come, and no other
skipper need apply."</p>
<p>"H'm," said the mate thoughtfully; "but will Wenlock be as civil
and limp next time you call, sir?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle winked pleasantly, and put a fifty-pound note in
his lock-up drawer. "That's all right, my lad. No fear of Master
Wenlock getting his tail up. If you'd seen the good lady, his wife,
you'd know why. That's the man that went hunting an heiress, Mr.
Murray; and by the holy James he's got her, and no error."</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A MATTER OF JUSTICE</h3>
<br>
<p>It was quite evident that the man wanted something; but Captain
Kettle did not choose definitely to ask for his wishes.
Over-curiosity is not a thing that pays with Orientals. Stolid
indifference, on the other hand, may earn easy admiration.</p>
<p>But at last the man took his courage in a firmer grip, and came
up from the <i>Parakeet's</i> lower deck, where the hands were
working cargo, and advanced under the bridge deck awnings to
Captain Kettle's long chair and salaamed low before him.</p>
<p>Kettle seemed to see the man for the first time. He looked up
from the accounts he was laboring at. "Well?" he said, curtly.</p>
<p>It was clear the Arab had no English. It was clear also that he
feared being watched by his fellow countrymen in the lighter which
was discharging date bags alongside. He manoeuvred till the broad
of his back covered his movements, materialized somehow or other a
scrap of paper from some fold of his burnous, dropped this into
Kettle's lap without any perceptible movement of either his arms or
hands, and then gave another stately salaam and moved away to the
place from which he had come.</p>
<p>"If you are an out-of-work conjuror," said Kettle to the
retreating figure, "you've come to the wrong place to get
employment here."</p>
<p>The Arab passed out of sight without once turning his head, and
Kettle glanced down at the screw of paper which lay on his knees,
and saw on it a scrawl of writing.</p>
<p>"Hullo," he said, "postman, were you; not conjuror? I didn't
expect any mail here. However, let's see. Murray's writing, by
James!" he muttered, as he flattened out the grimy scrap of paper,
and then he whistled-with surprise and disgust as he read.</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Dear Captain</i>," the letter ran. "<i>I've got
into the deuce of a mess, and if you can bear a hand to pull me
out, it would be a favor I should never forget. I got caught up
that side street to the left past the mosque, but they covered my
head with a cloth directly after, and hustled me on for half an
hour, and where I am now, the dickens only knows. It's a cellar.
But perhaps bearer may know, who's got my watch. The trouble was
about a woman, a pretty little piece who I was photographing. You
see</i>--"</blockquote>
<p>And here the letter broke off.</p>
<p>"That's the worst of these fancy, high-toned mates," Kettle
grumbled. "What does he want to go ashore for at a one-eyed hole
like this? There are no saloons--and besides he isn't a drinking
man. Your new-fashioned mate isn't. There are no girls for him to
kiss--seeing that they are all Mohammedans, and wear a veil. And as
for going round with that photography box of his, I wonder he
hasn't more pride. I don't like to see a smart young fellow like
him, that's got his master's ticket all new and ready in his chest,
bringing himself down to the level of a common, dirty-haired
artist. Well, Murray's got a lot to learn before he finds an owner
fit to trust him with a ship of his own."</p>
<p>Kettle read the hurried letter through a second time, and then
got up out of his long chair, and put on his spruce white drill
uniform coat, and exchanged his white canvas shoes for another pair
more newly pipeclayed. His steamer might merely be a common cargo
tramp, the town he was going to visit ashore might be merely the
usual savage settlement one meets with on the Arabian shore of the
Persian Gulf, but the little sailor did not dress for the
admiration of fashionable crowds. He was smart and spruce always
out of deference to his own self-respect.</p>
<p>He went up to the second mate at the tally desk on the main deck
below, and gave him some instructions. "I'm going ashore," he said,
"and leave you in charge. Don't let too many of these niggers come
aboard at once, and tell the steward to keep all the doors to below
snugly fastened. I locked the chart-house myself when I came out.
Have you heard about the mate?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Ah, I thought the news would have been spread well about the
ship before it came to me. He's got in trouble ashore, and I
suppose I must go, and see the Kady, and get him bailed out."</p>
<p>The second mate wiped the dust and perspiration from his face
with his bare arm, and leant on the tally-desk, and grinned. Here
seemed to be an opportunity for the relaxation of stiff official
relations. "What's tripped him?" he asked. "Skirt or
photographing?"</p>
<p>"He will probably tell you himself when he comes back," said
Kettle coldly. "I shall send him to his room for three days when he
gets on board."</p>
<p>The second mate pulled his face into seriousness. "I don't
suppose he got into trouble intentionally, sir."</p>
<p>"Probably not, but that doesn't alter the fact that he has
managed it somehow. I don't engage my mates for amusements of that
kind, Mr. Grain. I've got them here to work, and help me do my duty
by the owners. If they take up low class trades like artisting,
they must be prepared to stand the consequences. You'll remember
the orders I've given you? If I'm wanted, you'll say I'll probably
be back by tea."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle went off then in a shore-boat, past a small fleet
of pearling dhows, which rolled at their anchors, and after a long
pull--for the sea was shallow, and the anchorage lay five miles
out--stepped on to the back of a burly Arab, and was carried the
last mile dry-shod. Parallel to him were lines of men carrying out
cargo to the lighters which would tranship it to the
<i>Parakeet</i>, and Kettle looked upon these with a fine
complacency.</p>
<p>His tramping for cargo had been phenomenally successful. He was
filling his holds at astonishingly heavy freights. And not only
would this bring him credit with his owners, which meant promotion
in due course to a larger ship, but in the mean time, as he drew
his 2-1/2 per cent, on the profits, it represented a very
comfortable matter of solid cash for that much-needing person
himself. He hugged himself with pleasure when he thought of this
new found prosperity. It represented so many things which he would
be able to do for his wife and family, which through so many years
narrow circumstances had made impossible.</p>
<p>The burly Arab on whose hips he rode pick-a-back stepped out of
the water at last, and Kettle jumped down from his perch, and
picked his way daintily among the litter of the foreshore toward
the white houses of the town which lay beyond.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had set foot there. So great was his
luck at the time, that he had not been forced to go ashore in the
usual way drumming up cargo. The shippers had come off begging him
to become their carrier, and he had muleted them in heavy freights
accordingly. So he stepped into the town with many of the feelings
of a conqueror, and demanded to be led to the office of a man with
whom he had done profitable business that very morning.</p>
<p>Of course, "office" in the Western meaning of the term there was
none. The worthy Rad el Moussa transacted affairs on the floor of
his general sitting-room, and stored his merchandise in the
bed-chambers, or wherever it would be out of reach of pilfering
fingers. But he received the little sailor with fine protestations
of regard, and (after some giggles and shuffling as the women
withdrew) inducted him to the dark interior of his house, and set
before him delicious coffee and some doubtful sweetmeats.</p>
<p>Kettle knew enough about Oriental etiquette not to introduce the
matter on which he had come at the outset of the conversation. He
passed and received the necessary compliments first, endured a
discussion of local trade prospects, and then by an easy gradation
led up to the powers of the local Kady. He did not speak Arabic
himself, and Rad el Moussa had no English. But they had both served
a life apprenticeship to sea trading, and the curse of the Tower of
Babel had very little power over them. In the memories of each
there were garnered scraps from a score of spoken languages, and
when these failed, they could always draw on the unlimited
vocabulary of the gestures and the eyes. And for points that were
really abstruse, or which required definite understanding, there
always remained the charcoal stick and the explanatory drawing on
the face of a whitewashed wall.</p>
<p>When the conversation had lasted some half an hour by the clock,
and a slave brought in a second relay of sweetmeats and thick
coffee, the sailor mentioned, as it were incidentally, that one of
his officers had got into trouble in the town. "It's quite a small
thing," he said lightly, "but I want him back as soon as possible,
because there's work for him to do on the steamer. See what I
mean?"</p>
<p>Rad el Moussa nodded gravely. "Savvy plenty," said he.</p>
<p>Now Kettle knew that the machinery of the law in these small
Arabian coast towns was concentrated in the person of the Kady,
who, for practical purposes, must be made to move by that lubricant
known as palm oil; and so he produced some coins from his pocket
and lifted his eyebrows inquiringly.</p>
<p>Rad el Moussa nodded again, and made careful inspection of the
coins, turning them one by one with his long brown fingers, and
biting those he fancied most as a test of their quality. Finally,
he selected a gold twenty-franc piece and two sovereigns, balanced
and chinked them carefully in his hand, and then slipped them into
some private receptacle in his wearing apparel.</p>
<p>"I say," remarked Kettle, "that's not for you personally, old
tintacks. That's for the Kady."</p>
<p>Rad pointed majestically to his own breast. "El Kady," he
said.</p>
<p>"Oh, you are his Worship, are you?" said Kettle. "Why didn't you
say so before? I don't think it was quite straight of you,
tintacks, but perhaps that's your gentle Arab way. But I say,
Whiskers, don't you try being too foxy with me, or you'll get hurt.
I'm not the most patient man in the world with inferior nations.
Come, now, where's the mate?"</p>
<p>Rad spread his hands helplessly.</p>
<p>"See, here, it's no use your trying that game. You know that I
want Murray, my mate."</p>
<p>"Savvy plenty."</p>
<p>"Then hand him out, and let me get away back on board."</p>
<p>"No got," said Rad el Moussa; "no can."</p>
<p>"Now look here, Mister," said Captain Kettle, "I've paid you
honestly for justice, and if I don't have it, I'll start in pulling
down your old town straight away. Give up the mate, Rad, and let me
get back peacefully to my steamboat, or, by James! I'll let loose a
wild earthquake here. If you want battle, murder, and sudden death,
Mr. Rad el Moussa, just you play monkey tricks with me, and you'll
get 'em cheap. Kady, are you? Then, by James! you start in without
further talk, and give me the justice that I've bought and paid
for."</p>
<p>Though this tirade was in an alien tongue, Rad el Moussa caught
the drift from Captain Kettle's accompanying gesticulations, which
supplied a running translation as he went on. Rad saw that his
visitor meant business, and signed that he would go out and fetch
the imprisoned mate forthwith.</p>
<p>"No, you don't," said Kettle promptly. "If your Worship once
left here, I might have trouble in finding you again. I know how
easy it is to hide in a-warren like this town of yours. Send one of
your hands with a message."</p>
<p>Now, to convey this sentence more clearly, Kettle had put his
fingers on the Arab's clothing, when out fell a bag of pearls,
which came unfastened. The pearls rolled like peas about the floor,
and the Arab, with gritting teeth, whipped out a knife. Promptly
Kettle drew also, and covered him with a revolver.</p>
<p>"See here," he said, "I'm not a thief, though perhaps you think
I pulled out that jewelry purse on purpose. It was an accident,
Rad, so I'll forgive your hastiness. But your Worship mustn't pull
out cutlery on me. I'll not stand that from any man living. That's
right, put it up. Back goes the pistol into its pocket, and now
we're friends again. Pick up the pearls yourself, and then you'll
be certain I haven't grabbed any, and then send one of your men to
fetch my mate and do as I want. You're wasting a great deal of my
time, Rad el Moussa, over a very simple job."</p>
<p>The Arab gathered the pearls again into the pouch and put it
back to its place among his clothes. His face had grown savage and
lowering, but it was clear that this little spitfire of a sailor,
with his handy pistol, daunted him. Kettle, who read these signs,
was not insensible to the compliment they implied, but at the same
time he grew, if anything, additionally cautious. He watched his
man with a cat-like caution, and when Rad called a slave and gave
him orders in fluent Arabic, he made him translate his commands
forthwith.</p>
<p>Rad el Moussa protested that he had ordered nothing more than
the carrying out of his visitor's wishes. But it seemed to Kettle
that he protested just a trifle too vehemently, and his suspicions
deepened.</p>
<p>He tapped his pistol in its resting-place, and nodded his head
meaningly. "You've friends in this town," he said, "and I dare say
you'll have a goodish bit of power in your small way. I've neither,
and I don't deny that if you bring up all your local army to
interfere, I may have a toughish fight of it; but whatever happens
to me in the long run, you may take it as straight from yours truly
that you'll go to your own funeral if trouble starts. So put that
in your hookah and smoke it, tintacks, and give me the other
tube."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle was used to the dilatory ways of the East, and he
was prepared to wait, though never doubting that Murray would be
surrendered to him in due time, and he would get his own way in the
end. So he picked up one of the snaky tubes of the great pipe, and
put the amber mouthpiece between his lips; and there for an hour
the pair of them squatted on the divan, with the hookah gurgling
and reeking between them. From time to time a slave-girl came and
replenished the pipe with tobacco or fire as was required. But
these were the only interruptions, and between whiles they smoked
on in massive silence.</p>
<p>At the end of that hour, the man-slave who had been sent out
with the message re-entered the room and delivered his tidings. Rad
el Moussa in his turn passed it on. Murray was even then waiting in
the justice chamber, so he said, at the further side of the house,
and could be taken away at once. Kettle rose to his feet, and the
Arab stood before him with bowed head and folded arms.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle began to feel shame for having pressed this man
too hardly. It seemed that he had intended to act honestly all
along, and the suspiciousness of his behavior doubtless arose from
some difficulty of custom or language. So the sailor took the Rad's
limp hand in his own and shook it cordially, and at the same time
made a handsome apology for his own share of the
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>"Your Worship must excuse me," he said, "but I'm always apt to
be a bit suspicious about lawyers. What dealings I've had with them
have nearly always turned out for me unfortunately. And now, if you
don't mind, we'll go into your court-house, and you can hand me
over my mate, and I'll take him back to the ship. Enough time's
been wasted already by both of us."</p>
<p>The Arab, still bowed and submissive, signed toward the doorway,
and Kettle marched briskly out along the narrow dark passage
beyond, with Rad's sandals shuffling in escort close at his rear.
The house seemed a large one, and rambling. Three times Rad's
respectful fingers on his visitor's sleeve signed to him a change
of route. The corridors, too, as is the custom in Arabia, where
coolness is the first consideration, were dimly lit; and with the
caution which had grown to be his second nature, Kettle
instinctively kept all his senses on the alert for inconvenient
surprises. He had no desire that Rad el Moussa should forget his
submissiveness and stab him suddenly from behind, neither did he
especially wish to be noosed or knifed from round any of the dusky
sudden corners.</p>
<p>In fact he was as much on the <i>qui vive</i> as he ever had
been in all his long, wild, adventurous life, and yet Rad el
Moussa, who meant treachery all along, took him captive by the most
vulgar of timeworn stratagems. Of a sudden the boarding of the
floor sank beneath Kettle's feet. He turned, and with a desperate
effort tried to throw himself backward whence he had come. But the
boarding behind reared up and hit him a violent blow on the hands
and head, and he fell into a pit below.</p>
<p>For an instant he saw through the gloom the face of Rad el
Moussa turned suddenly virulent, spitting at him in hate, and then
the swing-floor slammed up into place again, and all view of
anything but inky blackness was completely shut away.</p>
<p>Now the fall, besides being disconcerting, was tolerably deep;
and but for the fact that the final blow from the flooring had shot
him against the opposite side of the pit, and so broken his descent
at the expense of his elbows and heels, he might very well have
landed awkwardly, and broken a limb or his back in the process. But
Captain Owen Kettle was not the man to waste time over useless
lamentation or rubbing of bruises. He was on fire with fury at the
way he had been tricked, and thirsting to get loose and be
revenged. He had his pistol still in its proper pocket, and
undamaged, and if the wily Rad had shown himself anywhere within
range just then, it is a certain thing that he would have been shot
dead to square the account.</p>
<p>But Kettle was, as I have said, wedged in with darkness, and for
the present, revenge must wait until he could see the man he wanted
to shoot at. He scrambled to his feet, and fumbled in his pocket
for a match. He found one, struck it on the sole of his trim white
shoe, and reconnoitred quickly.</p>
<p>The place he was in was round and bottle shaped, measuring some
ten feet across its floor, and tapering to a small square, where
the trap gave it entrance above. It was a prison clearly, and there
was evidence that it had been recently used. It was clear also that
the only official way of releasing a prisoner was to get him up by
a ladder or rope through the small opening to which the sides
converged overhead. Moreover, to all common seeming, the place was
simply unbreakable, at least to any creature who had not either
wings or the power of crawling up the under-side of a slant like a
fly.</p>
<p>But all these things flashed through Kettle's brain in far less
time than it takes to read them here. He had only two matches in
his possession, and he wished to make all possible use of the
first, so as to keep the second for emergencies; and so he made his
survey with the best of his intelligence and speed.</p>
<p>The walls of this bottle-shaped prison were of bricks built
without visible mortar, and held together (it seemed probable) by
the weight of earth pressing outside them; but just before the
match burned his fingers and dropped to the floor, where it
promptly expired, his eye fell upon an opening in the masonry. It
was a mere slit, barely three inches wide, running vertically up
and down for some six courses of the brick, and it was about
chin-high above the ground.</p>
<p>He marked this when the light went out, and promptly went to it
and explored it with his arm. The slit widened at the other side,
and there was evidently a chamber beyond. He clapped his hands
against the lip of the slit, and set his feet against the wall, and
pulled with the utmost of his strength. If once he could widen the
opening sufficiently to clamber through, possibilities lay beyond.
But from the weight of wall pressing down above, he could not budge
a single brick by so much as a hairs-breadth, and so he had to give
up this idea, and, stewing with rage, set about further
reconnoitring.</p>
<p>The darkness put his eyes out of action, but he had still left
his hands and feet, and he went round with these, exploring
carefully.</p>
<p>Presently his search was rewarded. Opposite the opening he had
discovered before, was another slit in the overhanging wall of this
bottle-shaped prison, and this also he attacked in the hope of
wrenching free some of the bricks. He strained and panted, till it
seemed as though the tendons of his body must break, but the wall
remained whole and the slit unpassable; and then he gave way,
almost childishly, to his passion of rage, and shouted insults and
threats at Rad el Moussa in the vain hope that some one would hear
and carry them. And some one did hear, though not the persons he
expected.</p>
<p>A voice, muffled and foggy, as though it came from a long
distance, said in surprise: "Why, Captain, have they got you here,
too?"</p>
<p>Under cover of the darkness, Kettle blushed for shame at his
outcry. "That you, Murray? I didn't know you were here. How did you
guess it was me?"</p>
<p>The distant voice chuckled foggily. "I've heard you giving your
blessing to the hands on board, sir, once or twice, and I
recognized some of the words. What have they collared you for? You
don't photograph. Have you been messing round with some girl?"</p>
<p>"Curse your impudence; just you remember your position and mine.
I'll have respect from my officers, even if I am in a bit of a
fix."</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, sir. Sorry I forgot myself. It sha'n't occur
again."</p>
<p>"You'll go to your room for three days when we get back on
board."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>
<p>"I decided that before I left the ship. I can't have my officers
staying away from duty without leave on any excuse. And if they
have such low tastes as to bring themselves on the level of common
mop-headed portrait painters and photographers, they must pay for
it."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>
<p>"What were you run in for?"</p>
<p>"Oh, photographing."</p>
<p>"There you are, then! And did they bring you straight along
here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. And lowered me in a bowline to this cellar."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Kettle, "then you don't want so much change out of
them. They dropped me, and some one will have a heavy bill to
square up for, over that. Do you know whose house this is?"</p>
<p>"Haven't a notion. After I'd been here an hour or so, some
heathen sneaked round to a peep-hole in the wall and offered to
take off a message to the ship, on payment. I hadn't any money, so
I had to give up my watch, and before I'd written half the letter
he got interrupted and had to clear off with what there was. Did he
bring off the message, sir?"</p>
<p>"He did. And I came ashore at once. You remember Rad el
Moussa?"</p>
<p>"The man that consigned all that parcel of figs for London?"</p>
<p>"That man. I considered that as he'd been doing business with
the steamer, he was the best person to make inquiries of ashore. So
I came to him, and asked where I could find the Kady to bail you
out. He shuffled a bit, and after some talk he admitted he was the
Kady, and took palm-oil from me in the usual way, and then I'll not
deny that we had a trifle of a disagreement. But he seemed to
simmer down all right, said he'd send along for you, and after a
bit of time said you'd come, and wouldn't I walk through the house
and see you myself. The crafty old fox had got his booby trap
rigged in the mean time, and then I walked straight into it like
the softest specimen of blame' fool you can imagine."</p>
<p>"Rad el Moussa," came the foggy comment. "By Jove! Captain, I
believe we're in an awkward place. He's the biggest man in this
town far and away, and about the biggest blackguard also from what
I've heard. He's a merchant in every line that comes handy, from
slaves and palm fibre to horses and dates; he runs most of those
pearling dhows that we saw sweltering about at the anchorage; and
he's got a little army of his own with which he raids the other
coast towns and the caravans up-country when he hears they've got
any truck worth looting. I say, this is scaring. I've been taking
the thing pretty easily up to now, thinking it would come all right
in time. But if I'd known it was old Rad who had grabbed me, I tell
you I should have sat sweating."</p>
<p>"It takes a lot more than a mere nigger, with his head in
clouts, to scare me," said Kettle truculently, "and I don't care
tuppence what he may be by trade. He's got a down on me at present,
I'll grant, but I'm going to give Mr. Rad el Moussa fits a little
later on, and you may stand by and look on, if you aren't
frightened to be near him."</p>
<p>"I'm not a funk in the open," grumbled Murray, "and you know it.
You've seen me handle a crew. But I'm in a kind of cellar here, and
can't get out, and if anybody chooses they can drop bricks on me,
and I can't stop them. Have they been at you about those rifles,
sir?"</p>
<p>"What rifles? No, nobody's said 'rifles' to me ashore here."</p>
<p>"It seems we've got some cases of rifles on board for one of
those little ports up the coast. I didn't know it."</p>
<p>"Nor did I," said Kettle, "and you can take it from me that we
haven't. Smuggling rifles ashore is a big offence here in the
Persian Gulf, and I'm not going to put myself in the way of the
law, if I know it."</p>
<p>"Well, I think you're wrong, sir," said the Mate. "I believe
they're in some cases that are down on the manifest as 'machinery.'
I saw them stowed down No. 3 hold, and I remember one of the
stevedores in London joking about them when they were struck
below."</p>
<p>"Supposing they were rifles, what than?"</p>
<p>"Rad wants them. He says they're consigned to some of his
neighbors up coast, who'll raid him as soon as they're properly
armed; and he doesn't like the idea. What raiding's done, he likes
to do himself, and at the same time he much prefers good Brummagen
rifles to the local ironmonger's blunderbusses."</p>
<p>"Well," said Kettle, "I'm waiting to hear what he thought you
could do with the rifles supposing they were on board."</p>
<p>"Oh, he expected me to broach cargo and bring them here ashore
to him. He's a simple-minded savage."</p>
<p>"By James!" said Kettle, "the man's mad. What did he think I
should be doing whilst one of my mates was scoffing cargo under my
blessed nose?"</p>
<p>"Ah, you see," said the foggy voice, with sly malice, "he did
not know you so well then, sir. That was before he persuaded you to
come into his house to stay with him."</p>
<p>It is probable that Captain Kettle would have found occasion to
make acid comment on this repartee from his inferior officer, but
at that moment another voice addressed him from the slit at the
other side of his prison, and he turned sharply round. To his
surprise this new person spoke in very tolerable English.</p>
<p>"Capt'n, I want t'make contrack wid you."</p>
<p>"The deuce you do. And who might you be, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I cullud gen'lem'n, sar. Born <i>Zanzibar</i>. Used to be
fireman on P. and O. I want arsk you--"</p>
<p>"Is this the Arabian Nights? How the mischief did you get here,
anyway?"</p>
<p>"Went on burst in Aden, sar. Th'ole Chief fired me out. Went
Yemen. Caught for slave. Taken caravan. Brought here. But I'm very
clever gen'lem'n, sar, an' soon bought myself free. Got slave of my
own now. An' three wives. Bought 'nother wife yesterday."</p>
<p>"You nasty beast!" said Kettle.</p>
<p>"Sar, you insult me. Not bally Christian any longer. Hard-shell
Mohammedan now, sar, and can marry as many wives as I can buy."</p>
<p>"I'm sure the Prophet's welcome to you. Look here, my man. Pass
down a rope's end from aloft there, and let me get on deck, and
I'll give you a sovereign cash down, and a berth in my steamboat's
stoke-hold if you want one. I'm not asking you to help me more. I
guess I'm quite competent to find my way on board, and to wipe this
house tolerably clean before it's quit of me."</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind, sar," said the man behind the slit. "You
insult me, sar. I very big gen'lem'n here, sar, an' a sovereign's
no use to me. Besides, I partner to ole man Rad, an' he say he want
dem rifles you got on your ole tramp."</p>
<p>"Does he, indeed? Then you can tell him, Mr. Nigger
runaway-drunken-fireman, that I'll see you and him in somewhere a
big sight hotter than Arabia before he gets them. I didn't know
they were rifles; if I had known before this, I'd not have put them
ashore; but as things are now, I'll land them into the hands of
those that ordered them, and I hope they come round to this town of
yours and give you fits. And see here, you talk more respectful
about my steamboat, or you'll get your shins kicked, daddy."</p>
<p>"An ole tramp," said the man relishingly. "I served on P. an'
O., sar, an' on P. an' O. we don't care 'sociate wid tramps'
sailors."</p>
<p>"You impudent black cannibal. You'll be one of the animals those
passenger lines carry along to eat the dead babies, to save the
trouble of heaving them overboard."</p>
<p>The ex-fireman spluttered. But he did not continue the contest.
He recognized that he had to deal with a master in the cheerful art
of insult, and so he came back sulkily to business.</p>
<p>"Will you give Rad dem rifles, you low white fellow?"</p>
<p>"No, I won't."</p>
<p>"Very well. Den we shall spiflicate you till you do," said the
man, and after that Kettle heard his slippers shuffling away.</p>
<p>"I wonder what spiflicating is?" mused Kettle, but he did not
remain cudgelling his brain over this for long. It occurred to him
that if this negro could come and go so handily to the outside of
this underground prison, there must be a stairway somewhere near,
and though he could not enlarge the slit to get at it that way, it
might be possible to burrow a passage under the wall itself. For a
tool, he had spied a broken crock lying on the floor, and with the
idea once in his head, he was not long in putting it to practical
effect. He squatted just underneath the slit, and began to quarry
the earth at the foot of the wall with skill and determination.</p>
<p>But if Kettle was prompt, his captors were by no means dilatory.
Between Kettle's prison and the mate's was another of those
bottle-shaped <i>oubliettes</i>, and in that there was presently a
bustle of movement. There came the noises of some one lighting a
fire, and coughing as he fanned smouldering embers into a glow with
his breath, and then more coughing and some curses as the
fire-lighter took his departure. The door above clapped down into
place, and then there was the sound of someone dragging over that
and over the doors of the other two prisons what seemed to be
carpets, or heavy rugs.</p>
<p>There was something mysterious in this manoeuvre at first, but
the secret of it was not kept for long. An acrid smell stole out
into the air, which thickened every minute in intensity. Kettle
seemed dimly to recognize it, but could not put a name to it
definitely. Besides, he was working with all his might at scraping
away the earth from the foot of the wall, and had little leisure to
think of other things.</p>
<p>The heat was stifling, and the sweat dripped from him, but he
toiled on with a savage glee at his success. The foundations had
not been dug out; they were "floating" upon the earth surface; and
the labor of undermining would, it appeared, be small.</p>
<p>But Murray in the other prison had smelt the reek before, and
was able to put a name to it promptly. "By Jove! Captain," he
shouted mistily from the distance, "they're going to smoke us to
death; that's the game."</p>
<p>"Looks like trying it," panted the little sailor, from his
work.</p>
<p>"That's dried camel's dung they're burning. There's no wood in
Arabia here, and that's their only fuel. When the smoke gets into
your lungs, it just tears you all to bits. I say, Skipper, can't
you come to some agreement with Rad over those blessed rifles? It's
a beastly death to die, this."</p>
<p>"You aren't dead--by a long chalk--yet. More'm I. I'd hate to
be--smoke-dried like a ham--as bad as any Jew. But I don't start
in--to scoff the cargo--on my own ship--at any bally price."</p>
<p>There was a sound of distant coughing, and then the misty
question: "What are you working at?"</p>
<p>"Taking--exercise," Kettle gasped, and after that, communication
between the two was limited to incessant staccato coughs.</p>
<p>More and more acrid grew the air as the burning camel's dung
saturated it further and further with smoke, and more and more
frenzied grew Kettle's efforts. Once he got up and stuffed his coat
in the embrasure from which the smoke principally came. But that
did little enough good. The wall was all chinks, and the bitter
reek came in unchecked. He felt that the hacking coughs were
gnawing away his strength, and just now the utmost output of his
thews was needed.</p>
<p>He had given up his original idea of mining a passage under the
wall. Indeed, this would have been a labor of weeks with the poor
broken crock which was his only tool, for the weight of the
building above had turned the earth to something very near akin to
the hardness of stone. But he had managed to scrape out a space
underneath one brick, and found that it was loosened, and with
trouble could be dislodged; and so he was burrowing away the earth
from beneath others, to drop more bricks down from their places,
and so make a gangway through the solid wall itself.</p>
<p>But simple though this may be in theory, it was tediously
difficult work in practice. The bricks jammed even when they were
undermined, and the wall was four bricks thick to its further side.
Moreover, every alternate course was cross-pinned, and the workman
was rapidly becoming asphyxiated by the terrible reek which came
billowing in from the chamber beyond.</p>
<p>Still, with aching chest, and bleeding fingers, and smarting
eyes, Kettle worked doggedly on, and at last got a hole made
completely through. What lay in the blackness beyond he did not
know; either Rad el Moussa or the fireman might be waiting to give
him a <i>coup de grace</i> the moment his head appeared; but he was
ready to accept every risk. He felt that if he stayed in the smoke
of that burning camel's dung any longer he would be strangled.</p>
<p>The hole in the brickwork was scarcely bigger than a fox-earth,
but he was a slightly built man, and with a hard struggle he
managed to push his way through. No one opposed him. He found and
scraped his only remaining match, and saw that he was in another
bottle-shaped chamber similar to the one he had left; but in this
there was a doorway. There was pungent smoke reek here also, and,
though its slenderness came to him as a blessed relief after what
he had been enduring, he lusted desperately for a taste of the pure
air outside.</p>
<p>The door gave to his touch, and he found a stair. He ran up this
and stepped out into the corridor, where Rad had lured him to
capture, and then, walking cautiously by the wall so as not to step
into any more booby-traps, he came to the place where he calculated
Murray would be jailed. A large thick carpet had been spread over
the door so as to prevent any egress of the stinging smoke, or any
ingress of air, and this he pulled away, and lifted the trap.</p>
<p>There was no sound from below. "Great heavens," he thought, "was
the mate dead?" He hailed sharply, and a husky voice answered.
Seeing nothing else at hand that would serve, he lowered an end of
the carpet, keeping a grip on the other, and presently Murray got a
hold and clambered up beside him.</p>
<p>In a dozen whispered words Kettle told his plans, and they were
on the point of starting off to carry them out, when the
<i>slop-slop</i> of slippers made itself heard advancing down the
corridors. Promptly the pair of them sank into the shadows, and
presently the ex-fireman came up whistling cheerfully an air from
some English music-hall. He did not see them till they were almost
within hand-grips, and then the tune froze upon his lips in a
manner that was ludicrous.</p>
<p>But neither Kettle nor his mate had any eye for the humors of
the situation just then. Murray plucked the man's legs artistically
from beneath him, and Kettle gripped his hands and throat. He
thrust his savage little face close down to the black man's. "Now,"
he said, "where's Rad? Tell me truly, or I'll make you into dog's
meat. And speak quietly. If you make a row, I'll gouge your eyes
out."</p>
<p>"Rad, he in divan," the fellow stuttered in a scared whisper.
"Sort o' front shop you savvy, sar. Don' kill me."</p>
<p>"I can recommend my late state-room," said Murray.</p>
<p>"Just the ticket," said Kettle. So into the <i>oubliette</i>
they toppled him, clapping down the door in its place above. "There
you may stay, you black beast," said his judge, "to stew in the
smoke you raised yourself. If any of your numerous wives are
sufficiently interested to get you out, they may do so. If not, you
pig, you may stay and cure into bacon. I'm sure I sha'n't miss you.
Come along, Mr. Mate."</p>
<p>They fell upon Rad el Moussa placidly resting among the cushions
of the divan, with the stem of the water-pipe between his teeth,
and his mind probably figuring out plans of campaign in which the
captured rifles would do astonishing work.</p>
<p>Kettle had no revolver in open view, but Rad had already learned
how handily that instrument could be produced on occasion, and had
the wit to make no show of resistance. The sailor went up to him,
delicately extracted the poignard from his sash, and broke the
blade beneath his feet. Then he said to him, "Stand there,"
pointing to the middle of the floor, and seated himself on the
divan in the attitude of a judge.</p>
<p>"Now, Mr. Rad el Moussa, I advise you to understand what's going
to be said to you now, so that it'll be a lesson to you in the
future.</p>
<p>"I came to you, not very long ago, asking for your card to the
Kady. I told you my business was about the mate here, and you said
you were Kady yourself. Whether you are or not I don't know, and I
don't vastly care, but anyway, I paid for justice in hard money,
and you said you'd give up the mate. You didn't do that. You played
a trick on me, which I'll own up I was a fool to get caught by; and
I make no doubt that you've been laughing at me behind my back with
that nasty nigger partner of yours.</p>
<p>"Well, prisoner at the bar, let alone I'm a blooming
Englishman--and Englishmen aren't sent into this world to be
laughed at by any foreigners--I'm myself as well, and let me tell
you I don't stand either being swindled out of justice when I've
paid for it, or being played tricks on afterward. So you are hereby
sentenced to the fine of one bag of pearls, to be paid on the spot,
and furthermore to be incarcerated in one of those smoke boxes down
the alleyway yonder till you can find your own way out. Now,
prisoner, don't move during the next operation, or I'll shoot you.
Mr. Mate, you'll find a small bag inside the top part of his
nightgown, on the left-hand side. Got 'em?"</p>
<p>"Here they are, sir," said Murray.</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Kettle, and put the bag in his pocket. "And now,
if you please, Mr. Mate, we'll just put His Whiskers into that
cellar with the nigger, and leave him there to get smoked into a
better and, we'll hope, a more penitent frame of mind."</p>
<p>They completed this pious act to their entire satisfaction, and
left the house without further interruption. The townspeople were
just beginning to move about again after the violence of the midday
heat, but except for curious stares, they passed through the narrow
streets between the whitewashed houses quite without interruption.
And in due time they came to the beach, and hired a shore boat,
which took them off to the steamer.</p>
<p>But here Kettle was not inclined to linger unnecessarily. He saw
Grain, the second mate, and asked Mm how much more cargo there was
to come off.</p>
<p>"The last lighter load is alongside this minute, sir."</p>
<p>"Then hustle it on deck as quick as you can, and then call the
carpenter, and go forward and heave up."</p>
<p>Grain looked meaningly at Murray. "Am I to take the fore deck,
sir."</p>
<p>"Yes, I appoint you acting mate for three days; and Mr. Murray
goes to his room for that time for getting into trouble ashore. Now
put some hurry into things, Mr. Grain; I don't want to stay here
longer than's needful."</p>
<p>Grain went forward about his business, but Murray, who looked
somewhat disconsolate, Kettle beckoned into the chart-house. He
pulled out the pearl bag, and emptied its contents on to the chart
table. "Now, look here, my lad," said he, "I have to send you to
your room because I said I would, and because that's discipline;
but you can pocket a thimblefull of these seed pearls just to patch
up your wounded feelings, as your share of old Rad el Moussa's
fine. They are only seed pearls, as I say, and aren't worth much.
We were due to have more as a sheer matter of justice, but it
wasn't to be got. So we must make the best of what there is. You'll
bag &pound;20 out of your lot if you sell them in the right place
ashore. I reckoned my damages at &pound;500, and I guess I've got
here about &pound;200."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," said Murray. "But it's rather hard being sent
to my room for a thing I could no more help than you could."</p>
<p>"Discipline, my lad. This will probably teach you to leave
photographing to your inferiors in the future. There's no
persuading me that it isn't that photograph box that's at the
bottom of the whole mischief. Hullo, there's the windlass going
already. I'll just lock up these pearls in the drawer, and then I
must go on the bridge. Er, and about going to your room, my lad: as
long as I don't see you for three days you can do much as you like.
I don't want to be too hard. But as I said to old Rad el Moussa,
justice is justice, and discipline's got to be kept."</p>
<p>"And what about the rifles, sir?"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle winked pleasantly. "I don't know that they are
rifles. You see the cases are down on the manifest as 'machinery,'
and I'm going to put them ashore as such; but I don't mind owning
to you, Mr. Mate, that I hope old Rad finds out he was right in his
information. I suppose his neighbors will let him know within the
next week or so whether they are rifles really, or whether they
aren't."</p>

<h3>DAGO DIVERS</h3>
<br>
<p>"I'm real glad to be able to call you 'Captain,' my lad," said
Kettle, and Murray, in delight at his new promotion, wrung his old
commander's hand again. "You've slaved hard enough as mate," Kettle
went on, "though that's only what a man's got to do at sea nowadays
if he wants promotion, and it'll probably amuse you to see Grain,
who steps into your shoes, doing the work of four deck hands and an
extra boatswain as well as his own. Grain was inclined to
stoutness--he'll soon be thin again. As for you, you've sweated and
slaved so much that your clothes hang on like you a slop-chest
shirt on a stanchion just now. But you'll fill 'em out nicely by
the time you get back to England again. Shouldn't wonder but what
you turn out to be a regular fat man one of these days, my
lad."</p>
<p>Murray stood back and looked humorously over Captain Kettle. The
pair of them liked one another well, but the ties of discipline had
kept them icily apart up to now. Murray's promotion put them on
equal footing of grade now, and they were inclined to make the most
of it for the short time they had together. "Running the
<i>Parakeet</i> doesn't seem to have made you very plump,
Skipper."</p>
<p>"Constitutional, I guess," said Kettle. "I don't believe the
food's grown that'd make me carry flesh. I'm one of those men that
was sent into the world with a whole shipload of bad luck to work
through before I came across any of the soft things."</p>
<p>"If you ask me," said Murray, cheerfully, "you haven't much to
grumble at now. Here am I kicking you out of the command of the
<i>Parakeet</i>, to be sure. And why? Because whilst you've been
her old man you've made her pay about half what she originally cost
per annum, and as out of that the firm's saved enough to build a
new and bigger ship, they're naturally going to give her to you to
scare up more fat dividends. Lord," said Murray, hitting his knee,
"the chaps on board here will be calling me the 'old man' behind my
back now."</p>
<p>"You'll get used to hearing the title," said Kettle grimly,
"before you make your pile. You'll get married, I suppose, on the
strength of the promotion? I saw a girl's photo nailed up in your
room."</p>
<p>The new captain nodded. "Got engaged when I passed for my
master's ticket. Arranged to be hitched so soon as I found a
ship."</p>
<p>Kettle sighed drearily. "I was that way, my lad. I was married,
and a kid had come before I was thirty. Not that I ever regretted
it; by James! no. But for long enough I was never able to provide
for the missus in the way I'd like, and I can tell you it was
terrible gall to me to know that our set at the chapel looked down
on her because she could only keep a poor home. Yes, my lad, you'll
have a lot to go through."</p>
<p>"Well," said Murray, "I've got this promotion, and I'm not going
to worry about dismals. I suppose you go straight home by mail from
Aden here?"</p>
<p>"Hullo, haven't they told you?"</p>
<p>"My letter was only the dry, formal announcement that you were
promoted to the new ship, and I was to take over the
<i>Parakeet</i>."</p>
<p>"They don't waste their typewriter in the office. I suppose they
thought I'd hand on my letter if I saw fit. Read through that,"
said Kettle, and handed across his news. This is how it ran:--</p>

<br>
<blockquote><i>Dear Captain Kettle,--<br>
Having noted from your cables and reports you<br>
are making a good thing for us out of tramping<br>
the "Parakeet," we have pleasure in transferring<br>
you to our new boat, which is now building on the<br>
Clyde. She will be 3,500 tons, and we may take<br>
out passenger certificate, she being constructed on<br>
that specification. Your pay will be &pound;21 (twenty-one<br>
pound) per month, with 2-1/2 per cent. commission<br>
as before. But for the present, till this new<br>
boat is finished, we want you to give over command<br>
of the "Parakeet" to Murray, and take on a<br>
new job. Our Mr. Alexander Bird has recently bought<br>
the wreck of the s.s. "Grecian," and we are sending<br>
out a steamer with divers and full equipment to get<br>
the salvage. We wish you to go on board this vessel<br>
to watch over our interests. We give you full<br>
control, and have notified Captain Tazzuchi, at<br>
present in command, to this effect</i>.</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Yours truly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;p.p. Bird, Bird and Co.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Isaac Bird.)</i><br>
<br>
<i>To Captain O. Kettle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;s.s. "Parakeet," Bird Line, Aden.</i></blockquote>
<p>"I see they have clapped me down on the bill heading for the
<i>Parakeet</i> already," said Murray, "and you're shifted along in
print for the new ship. Birds are getting on. But I've big doubts
about three new boats all at one bite. One they might manage on a
mortgage. But three? I don't think it. Old Ikey's too
cautious."</p>
<p>"Messrs. Bird are your owners and mine," said Kettle
significantly.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the newly-made captain, "I'm not one of your
old-fashioned sort that thinks an owner a little tin god."</p>
<p>"My view is," said Kettle, "that your owner pays you, and so is
entitled to your respect so long as he is your owner. Besides that,
whilst you are drawing pay, you're expected to carry out orders,
whatever they may be, without question. But I don't think we'll
talk any more about this, my lad. You're one of the newer school, I
know, and you've got such a big notion of your own rights that
we're not likely to agree. Besides, you've got to check my accounts
and see I've left it all for you ship-shape, and I've to pull my
bits of things together into a portmanteau. See you again before I
go away, and we'll have a drop of whisky together to wish the
<i>Parakeet's</i> new 'old man' a pile of luck."</p>
<p>At the edge of the harbor, Aden baked under the sun, but Kettle
was not the man to filch his employer's time for unnecessary
strolls ashore. The salvage steamer rolled at her anchor at the
opposite side of the harbor, and Kettle and two portmanteaux were
transhipped direct in one of the <i>Parakeet's</i> boats.</p>
<p>He was received on board by an affable Italian, who introduced
himself as Captain Tazzuchi. The man spoke perfect English, and was
hospitality personified. The little salvage steamer was barely 300
tons burden, and her accommodation was limited, but Tazzuchi put
the best room in the ship at his guest's disposal, and said that
anything that could act for his comfort should be done
forthwith.</p>
<p>"Y'know, Captain," said Tazzuchi, "this is what you call a
'Dago' ship, and we serve out country wine as a regular ration. But
I thought perhaps you'd like your own home ways best, and so I've
ordered the ship's chandler ashore to send off a case of Scotch,
and another of Chicago beef. Oh yes, and I sent also for some
London pickles. I know how you English like your pickles."</p>
<p>In fact, all that a man could do in the way of outward attention
Tazzuchi did, but somehow or other Captain Kettle got a suspicion
of him from the very first moment of their meeting. Perhaps it was
to some extent because the British mariner has always an
instinctive and special distrust for the Latin nations; perhaps it
was because the civility was a little unexpected and over-effusive.
Putting himself in the Italian's place, Kettle certainly would not
have gone out of his way to be pleasant to a foreigner who was sent
practically to supersede him in a command.</p>
<p>But perhaps a second letter which he had received, giving him a
more intimate list of the duties required, had something to do with
this hostile feeling. It was from the same hand which had written
the firm's formal letter, but it was couched in quite a different
vein. Isaac Bird was evidently scared for his very commercial
existence, and he thrust out his arms to Kettle on paper as his
only savior. It seemed that Alexander Bird, the younger brother,
had been running a little wild of late.</p>
<p>The wreck of the <i>Grecian</i> had been put up for auction;
Alexander strolled into the room by accident, and bought at an
exorbitant figure. He came and announced his purchase to Isaac,
declaring it as an instance of his fine business instincts. Isaac
set it down to whisky, and recriminations followed. Alexander in a
huff said he would go out and overlook the salvage operations in
person. Isaac opined that the firm might scrape to windward of
bankruptcy by that means, and advised Alexander to take remarkable
pains about keeping sober. But forthwith Alexander, still in his
cups, "and at a music hall, too, a place he knows 'Isaac's'
religious connection holds in profound horror," gets to brawling,
and is next discovered in hospital with a broken thigh.</p>
<p>"<i>I have found Alexander's department of the business very
tangled</i>," wrote Isaac, "<i>when I began to go into his books
the first day he was laid up, and the thought of this new
complication drove me near crazy. Salvage is out of our line;
Alexander should never have touched it. But there it is; money
paid, and I've had to borrow; and engaging that Italian firm for
the job was the best thing I could manage. What English firms
wanted was out of all reason. I don't wonder at Lloyds selling
wrecks for anything they will fetch. A pittance in cash is better
than getting into the hands of these sharks</i>" (sharks was
heavily underscored). "<i>And what guarantee have I that the firm
will pocket even that pittance? How do I know that I shall see even
the money outpaid again, let alone reasonable interest?
None</i>."</p>
<p>There were several words erased here, and the writer went on
with what was evidently considered a dramatic finish. "'<i>But
stay,' I say to myself, 'you have Kettle. He is down in the Red Sea
now, doing well. You had all along intended to promote him. Do it
now, and set him to overlook this Italian salvage firm whilst the
new boat is building. He is the one to see that Isaac Bird's foot
doth not fall, for Captain O. Kettle is a godly man also</i>.'"</p>
<p>The letter was shut off conventionally enough with the statement
that the writer was Captain Kettle's truly, and ended in a
post-scriptum tag to the effect that the envoy should still draw
his two and a-half per cent. on net results. The actual figures had
evidently not been conceded without a mental wrench, as the erasion
beneath them showed, but there they stood in definite ink, and
Kettle was not inclined to cavil at the process which deduced
them.</p>
<p>However, although in his recent prosperity Kettle had assumed a
hatred for risks, and bred a strong dislike for all those
commercial adventures which lay beyond the ordinary rut and routine
of trade, he took up his duties on the salvage steamer with a stout
heart and cheerful estimate for the future. Ahead of him he had
pleasant dreams of the big boat that was "building," and the
increased monthly pay in store; and for the present, well, here was
an owner's command, and of course that settled him firmly in the
berth. He had been too long an obedient slave to shipowners of
every grade to have the least fancy for disputing the imperial will
of Bird, Bird and Co.</p>
<p>Murray tooted his cheerful farewells on the <i>Parakeet's</i>
siren as the little Italian salvage boat steamed out of the baking
airs of Aden harbor, and ensigns were dipped with due formality.
Tazzuchi was all hospitality. He invited Kettle to damage his
palate with a black Italian "Virginia" cigar with a straw up the
middle; he uncorked a bottle of the Scotch whisky with his own
hand, splashed away the first wineglassful to get rid of the fusel
oil, and put it ready for reference when his guest should feel
athirst; and he produced a couple of American pirated editions of
English novels to give even intellect its dainty feast.</p>
<p>Kettle accepted it all with a dry civility. He had every
expectation of upsetting this man's plans of robbery later on, and
very possibly of coming into personal contact with him. But the
ties of bread and salt did not disturb him. Though it was Tazzuchi
who presented the Virginias and the novels, he took it for granted
that Messrs. Bird, Bird and Co. had paid for them, and he was not
averse to accepting a little luxury from the firm. The economical
Isaac had cut down the commissariat on the <i>Parakeet</i> till a
man had to be half-starved before he could stomach a meal.</p>
<p>The salvage steamer had a South of Europe leisureliness in her
movements. Her utmost pace was nine knots, but, as eight was more
economical for coal consumption, it was at that speed she moved.
The wreck of the <i>Grecian</i> was out of the usual steam lane.
She had, it appeared, got off her course in a fog, had run foul of
a half-ebb reef which holed her in two compartments, and then been
steered for the shore in the wild attempt to beach her before she
sank. She had ceased floating, however, with some suddenness, and
when the critical moment came not all of her people managed to
scrape off with their lives in the boats. Those that stayed behind
were incontinently drowned; those that got away found themselves in
a gale (to which the fog gave place), and had so much trouble to
keep afloat that they had no time left to make accurate
determination of where their vessel sank; and when they were picked
up could only give her whereabouts vaguely. However, they stated
that the <i>Grecian's</i> mast-trucks remained above the water
surface, and by these she could be found; and this fact was brought
out strongly by the auctioneer who sold the wreck, and had due
influence on the enterprising Alexander. "Masts!" said Alexander,
who daily saw them bristling from a dock, "don't tell me you can
miss masts anywhere."</p>
<p>But, as it chanced, it was only by a fluke that the salvage
steamer stumbled across the wreck at all. She wandered for several
days among an intensely dangerous archipelago, and many times over
had narrow escapes from piling up her bones on one or other of
those reefs with which the Red Sea in that quarter abounds.
Tazzuchi navigated her in an ecstasy of nervousness, and Kettle
(who regarded himself as a passenger for the time being) kept a
private store of food and water-bottles handy, and saw that one of
the quarter-boats was ready for hurried lowering. But nowhere did
they see those mast-trucks. They did not sight so much as a scrap
of floating wreckage.</p>
<p>There seemed, however, a good many dhow coasters dodging about
in and among the reefs, and from these Kettle presently drew a
deduction.</p>
<p>"Look here," he said to Tazzuchi one morning, "what price those
gentry ashore having found the wreck already? I guess they aren't
out here taking week-end trippers for sixpenny yachting
cruises."</p>
<p>"No," said Tazzuchi, "and they aren't fishing; you can see
that."</p>
<p>"Well, I give you the tip for what it's worth," said Kettle; and
that afternoon the steamer was run up alongside a dhow, which tried
desperately to escape. Her captain was dragged on board, and at
that juncture Captain Kettle took upon himself to go below. He knew
what would probably take place, and, though he disapproved of such
methods strongly, he felt he could not interfere. He was in Bird,
Bird and Co.'s employ, and what was being done would forward the
firm's interest.</p>
<p>But presently came a noise of bellowing from the deck above, and
then that was followed by shrill screams as the upper gamut of
agony was reached. Kettle was prepared for rough handling, but at
information gained by absolute torture he drew the line. It was
clear that these cruel beggars of Italians were going too far.</p>
<p>"By James!" he muttered to himself, "owners or no owners, I
can't stand this," and started hurriedly to go back to the deck.
But before he reached the head of the companion-way the cries of
pain ceased, and so he stood where he was on the stair, and waited.
The engines rumbled, and the steamer once more gathered way. A
clamor of barbaric voices reached him, which gradually died into
quietude. It was clear they were leaving the dhow behind.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle drew a long breath. They would stick at little,
these Dagos, in getting the salvage of the <i>Grecian</i>, and it
seemed preposterous to suppose that once they gripped the specie in
their own ringers they would ever give it up for the paltry pay
which had been offered by Bird, Bird and Co. Their own poverty was
aching. He saw it whenever he looked about the patched little
steamer. He felt it whenever he sat down to one of their painfully
frugal meals.</p>
<p>Still, though no man knew more bitterly than Kettle himself from
past experience what poverty meant, and how it cut, the poverty of
these Italians was no concern of his just then. They were paid
servants of the owners exactly as he was, and it was his duty to
see that they earned their hire. He took it that he was one against
the whole ship's company, but the odds did not daunt him. On the
contrary, something of his old fighting spirit, which had been of
late hustled into the background by snug commercial prosperity,
came back to him. And besides, he had always at his call that
exquisite pride of race which has so many times given victory to
the Anglo-Saxon over the Latin, when all reasonable balances should
have made it go the other way.</p>
<p>By a sort of instinct he buttoned up his trim white drill coat,
and stepped out on deck. There would be no scuffle yet awhile. With
the specie that would make the temptation still snugly stored on
the sea-floor, the dirty, untidy Italians were still all
affability. Indeed, as soon as he appeared, Tazzuchi himself
stepped down off the upper bridge to give him the news.</p>
<p>"How do you think those crafty imps have managed it?" he cried,
with a gesture. "Why they dived down and cut off her masts below
water level. The funnel was out of sight already. They just thought
they were going to have the skimming of that wreck themselves. No
wonder we couldn't pick her up."</p>
<p>"Cute beggars," said Kettle.</p>
<p>"I've bagged a pilot. If he takes us there straight, he gets
backsheesh. If he doesn't, he eats more stick. I think," said
Captain Tazzuchi, with a wide smile, "that he'll take us there the
quickest road."</p>
<p>"Shouldn't wonder," said Kettle. "But don't be surprised if his
friends come round and make things ugly. When those Red Sea niggers
get their fingers in a wreck, they think's it's their wreck."</p>
<p>"Let them come. We were ready for this sort of entertainment
when we sailed, and there are plenty of rifles and cartridges in
the cabin. If there is any trouble, we shall shoot; and if we begin
that game, we shall just imagine they are Abyssinians, and shoot to
kill. The Italians have a big bill to pay with those jokers,
anyway." He tapped Kettle on the shoulder. "And look at those two
brass signal guns, Captain. If we break up some firebars for shot,
they'll smash the side of any dhow in the Red Sea."</p>
<p>Under the black captive's guidance, the salvage steamer soon put
a term to her search. For two more hours she threaded her way among
surf which broke over unseen reefs, and swung round the capes of a
rocky archipelago, and then the pilot gave his word and the engines
were stopped and a rusty cable roared out till an anchor got its
hold of the ground. A boat was lowered with air-pump already
stepped amidships, and the boat's crew with eager hands assisted
the diver to make his toilet.</p>
<p>"You chaps seem keen enough," said Kettle, as he watched the
trail of air bubbles which showed the man's progress on the sea
floor below.</p>
<p>"They have each got a stake in the venture."</p>
<p>"I bet they have," was Kettle's grim comment to himself.</p>
<p>The kidnapped skipper of the dhow, it seemed, had done his
pilotage with a fine accuracy. The salvage steamer had been
anchored in a good position, and between them two divers in two
boats found the <i>Grecian's</i> wreck in half an hour. Indeed,
they had made their first descent practically within hand-touch of
her, but the water was full of a milky clay and very opaque, and
sight below the surface was consequently limited.</p>
<p>They came up to the air for a quarter of an hour's spell and
made their announcement, and then the copper helmets were clapped
into place again, and once more like a pair of uncouth sea monsters
they slowly and clumsily faded away into the depths. A gabble of
excited Italian kept pace to the turning of the air-pumps, and of
that language Kettle knew barely a score of words. Practically
these people might have weaved any kind of plot noisily and under
his very nose without his being any the wiser, and this possibility
did little to quell his suspicions.</p>
<p>But still Tazzuchi was all outward frankness. "It's as well we
brought out this little steamboat just to skim the wreck and survey
her," he said. "If they'd waited to fit out a big salvage
expedition, to raise her straight off, I reckon there wouldn't have
been much left but iron plates and coal bunkers. These Red Sea
niggers are pretty useful at looting, once they start. The beggars
can dive pretty nearly as well and as long in their naked skins as
their betters can in a proper diving suit."</p>
<p>Each time the divers came up from the opaque white water they
brought more reports. Binnacles, whistle, wheels, and all movable
deck fittings were gone already. The chart-house had been looted
down to the bare boards. Hatches were off, both forward and aft,
and already the cargo had begun to diminish. The black men of the
district had been making good use of their time; and as the
probabilities were that they would return in force to glean from
this store which they considered legally theirs, it was advisable
to collect as much as possible into the salvage steamer before any
disturbances began.</p>
<p>News came from the cool mysterious water to the baking region of
air above, almost at the second hour of the search, that the
<i>Grecian</i> could never be refloated. In addition to the holes
already made in two of her compartments, she had settled on a sharp
jag of rock, which had pierced her in a third place aft. But at the
same time this one piece of rock was the only solid spot in the
neighborhood. All the rest of the sea floor was paved with pulpy
white clay, and in this the unfortunate wreck had settled till
already it was flush with her lower decks. There were evidences,
too, that the ooze was creeping higher every day, so that all that
remained was to strip her as quickly as might be before she was
swallowed up for always.</p>
<p>Tazzuchi asked Captain Kettle for his opinion that night in the
chart-house. "I'm to be guided by you, of course," he said, "but my
idea is that we should go for the specie first thing, and let
everything slide till that's snugly on board here. Birds gave
&pound;5,400 for the wreck, and there's &pound;8,000 in cash down
there in a room they built specially for it over the shaft-tunnel.
If we can grab that, it will pay our expenses and commission and
all the other actual outlay, and Birds will be out of the wood.
Afterward, if we can weigh any more of the cargo, well, that will
be all clear profit."</p>
<p>"Yes," thought Kettle, "you want those gold boxes in your hands,
you blessed Dago, and then you'll begin to play your monkey tricks.
I wonder if you think you're going to jam a knife into me by way of
making things snug and safe?" But aloud he expressed agreement to
Captain Tazzuchi's plan.</p>
<p>He felt that this was diplomacy, and though the diplomatic art
was new and strange to him, he told himself that it was the correct
weapon to use under the circumstances. He had risen out of his old
grade of hole-and-corner shipmaster, where it had been his province
to carry things through by rough blows and violent words. He was a
Captain in a regular line--the Bird line--now, and (with a trifle
of a sigh) he remembered that wild fights and scrimmages were
beneath the dignity of his position.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as soon as dawn gave a waking light, the boats were
put out again, and the divers were given orders to let the further
survey of the vessel rest, and put all their efforts into getting
the specie boxes on to the end of the salvage steamer's winch
chain. They were quickly helmed and sent below, and presently an
increased cloudiness in the water told him that they were actively
at work. A lot of dhows were showing here and there amongst the
reefs, obviously watching them, and Tazzuchi was beginning to get
nervous.</p>
<p>"We're in for trouble, I'm afraid," he said to Kettle. "That
rock on which she's settled astern has made a hole in her you could
drive a cart through. I suppose it was a tight-fitting hole at
first, but as she settled more and moved about, it's got enlarged
same as the hole in a tin of beef does when you begin to waggle it
with the can-opener."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you hear the report they've just sung off from the
boats? Oh, I forgot, you don't understand Italian. Well, the news
is that the rock's acted as a can-opener to such fine effect that
it's split a hole in the bottom of the strong room, and those gold
boxes have toppled through."</p>
<p>"And buried themselves in the slime?"</p>
<p>"That's it. And Lord knows how many feet they've sunk. It's
dreadful stuff to dig amongst--slides in on you as soon as you
start to dig, and levels up. They'll have to brattice as they work.
It'll be a big job."</p>
<p>All that day Kettle watched the sea with an anxious eye. In the
two boats men ground at the air-pumps under the aching sunlight.
From below the mud came up in white billows, which danced, and
swirled, and eddied as the air bubbles from the divers' exhaust
valves stirred it. And out beyond, in and among the reefs, and
along the distant shore, which swung and shimmered in the heat
haze, hungry dhows prowled like carrion birds temporarily driven
away from a prey.</p>
<p>Tazzuchi and the chief engineer busied themselves in binding
together fragments of fire-bars with iron wire. The Italian
shipmaster had a great notion of the damage his signal-guns could
do against a dhow, if they were provided with orthodox solid shot.
As a point of fact they never came into action. As soon as the
second night came down, and the darkness became fairly fixed in
hue, there began to crackle out of the distance a desultory rifle
fire from every quarter of the compass. It was not very heavy--at
the outside there were not a score of weapons firing, and it could
not be called accurate since not one bullet in twenty so much as
hit the steamer; but it was annoying for all that, and as the
marksmen and their vessels were completely swallowed up by the
blackness of the night, it was impossible to repay their
compliments in kind.</p>
<p>Morning showed the damage of one port window smashed, two panes
gone from the engine-room skylight, and the air-pump in one of the
boats alongside with a plunger neatly cut into two pieces. But
there was a spare air-pump in store, and after dawn came, work went
on as usual. The dhows came no nearer, neither did they go much
further away. They pottered about just beyond rifle shot, and their
numbers were slightly increased. Tazzuchi, full of enthusiasm for
his artillery, tried a carefully aimed shot at one of the largest.
But the explosion was quite outdone in noise by the cackle of
laughter which followed it. So slow was the flight of the missile
that the eye could trace it. So short was its journey, and so
curved its trajectory, that it came very near to hitting one of the
boats of the divers, and the men working there cried out in
derision that they would catch cold by being wetted by the
spray.</p>
<p>"Well," thought Kettle, "these are pretty cool hands for Dagos,
anyway. I'm going to have a fine tough time of it when my part of
the scuffle comes."</p>
<p>That night he had a still further taste of their quality. So
soon as darkness fell, the dhows closed in again and recommenced
their sniping. They kept under weigh, and so it did little enough
good to aim back at the flashes. But Tazzuchi, with half a dozen
keen spirits, got down into one of the boats with their rifles and
knives, and a drum of paraffin, and pulled away silently into the
blackness.</p>
<p>There was silence for quite half an hour, and the suspense on
the anchored steamer was vivid enough to have shaken trained men.
Yet these Italian artificers and merchant seamen seemed to take it
as coolly as though such sorties were an everyday occurrence. But
at the end of that time there was a splutter of shots, a few faint
squeals, and then a bonfire lighted up away in the darkness.</p>
<p>The blaze grew rapidly, and showed in its heart the outline of a
dhow with human figures on it. With promptness every man on the
steamer emptied his rifle at the mark, and continued the fusillade
till the dhow was deserted. They had all done their spell of
military service, and they chose to decide that these snipers were
Abyssinians, and did their best toward squaring the national
accounts.</p>
<p>Tazzuchi and his friends returned in the boat, safe and
jubilant, and for the rest of that night the little salvage steamer
was left in quietude. With the next daybreak the divers and their
attendants once more applied themselves to labor. Kettle, as he
watched, was amazed to see the energy they put into it. Certainly
they seemed keen enough to get the specie weighed, and on board.
Whatever piratical plans they had got made up were evidently for
afterward.</p>
<p>But when day after day passed, and still none of the treasure
was brought to the surface, he began to modify this original
opinion. Tazzuchi--translating the divers' reports--said that the
cause of the delay was the softness of the sea-floor. The heavy
chests had sunk deep into the ooze, and directly a spadeful of the
horrible slime was dug away, more slid in to fill the gap. Of
course this might be true; but there was only Tazzuchi's word for
it. The sea was too consistently opaque to give one a chance of
seeing down from above the surface.</p>
<p>Now as suspicion had got so deep a hold on Captain Kettle's
mind, he began to cudgel his brain for some new method by which the
Italians could serve their purpose. He put himself supposititiously
in Tazzuchi's place, and made piratical theories by the score. Most
of them he had to dismiss after examination as impracticable,
others he eliminated by natural selection; and finally one stood
out as practicable beyond all the rest.</p>
<p>For one thing it did not want many participants; only the actual
divers and Tazzuchi himself. For another, it would not brand the
whole gang of them as criminals and pirates, but (properly managed)
would make them rich without any advertised stigma or stain. In
simple words, the method was this: the gold boxes must be removed
from their original site, and hidden elsewhere under the water
close at hand. The friendly slime would bury them snugly out of
sight. The old report of "un-get-at-able" would be adhered to, and
finally the steamer would give up further salvage operations as
hopeless (after fishing up some useless cargo out of the holds as a
conscience salve) and steam away to port. There Tazzuchi and his
friends would either desert or get themselves dismissed, charter a
small vessel of their own, and go back for the plunder; and with
&pound;8,000 in clear hard cash to divide, live prosperously (from
an Italian standpoint) ever afterward.</p>
<p>Kettle felt an unimaginative man's complacency in ferreting out
such a dramatic scheme, and began to think next upon the somewhat
important detail of how to get proofs before he commenced to
frustrate it. Chance seemed to make Tazzuchi play into his hand.
The air-pump which had been damaged by the rifle bullet had been
mended by the steamer's engineers, and as there were two or three
spare diving dresses on the ship, Captain Tazzuchi expressed his
intention of making a descent in person to inspect progress.</p>
<p>"I didn't do it before, because I didn't want to make the men
break time, but I can go down now without interrupting their work.
Will you come off in the boat with me, Captain, and hand my
lifeline?"</p>
<p>"I'll borrow one of those spare dresses and share the pump with
you," said Kettle.</p>
<p>Tazzuchi was visibly startled. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that the pump will give air for two, and I'm coming down
with you."</p>
<p>"But you know nothing about diving, and you might have an
accident, and I should be responsible."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll risk that! You must nursery-maid me a bit."</p>
<p>Tazzuchi lowered his voice. "To tell the truth, I'm going to pay
a surprise visit. I want to make sure those chaps below are doing
the square thing. If they aren't, and I catch them, there'll be a
row, and they'll use their knives."</p>
<p>"H'm!" said Kettle, "I've got no use for your local weapon as a
general thing. I find a gun handiest. But at a pinch like this I'll
borrow a knife of you, and if it comes to any one cutting my
air-tube you'll find I can use it pretty mischievously."</p>
<p>"I wish you wouldn't insist upon this," said Tazzuchi
persuasively.</p>
<p>"I'm going to, anyway."</p>
<p>"I'm going down merely because it's my duty."</p>
<p>"That's the very same reason that's taking me, Captain. I must
ask you not to make any more objections. I'm a man that never
changes his mind, once it's made up."</p>
<p>Whereupon Tazzuchi shrugged his shoulders, and gave way.</p>
<p>"Now," thought Kettle to himself, "that man's made up his mind
to kill me if he gets the glimmer of a chance, and, as I'm not
going to get wiped out this journey, he'll do with a lot of
watching."</p>
<p>It has been the present writer's business at one time and
another to point out that Captain Owen Kettle is a man of iron
nerve; but I cannot call to mind any instance where his indomitable
courage was more severely tried than in this voluntary descent in
the diving dress. The world beneath the waters was strange and
dangerous to him; his companion was a man against whom he held the
blackest suspicion; the men at the pump (whose language he did not
understand) might any moment cut off his supply, and leave him to
drown like a puppy under a bucket. The circumstances combined were
enough to daunt a Bayard.</p>
<p>But Kettle felt that the men in the boat, who helped to adjust
his stiff rubber dress, were regarding him with more than ordinary
curiosity, and, for his own pride's sake, he preserved an unruffled
face. He even tried a rude jest in their own tongue before they
made fast the helmet on his head, and the cackle of their laughter
was the last sound he heard before the metal dome closed the
audible world away from him.</p>
<p>They hung the weights over his chest and back, and Tazzuchi
signed to him to descend. Kettle hitched round the sheath-knife to
the front of his belt, and signed with politeness, "After you."</p>
<p>Tazzuchi did not argue the matter. He lifted his clumsy
lead-soled feet over the side of the boat, got on the ladder, and
climbed down out of sight. Kettle followed. The chill of the water
crept up and closed over his head; the steady throb-throb of the
air-pump beat against his skull; and a little shiver took him in
one small spot between the shoulder blades, because he knew that it
was there that an Italian, if he can manage it, always plants a
knife in his enemy.</p>
<p>He reached the end of the ladder and slid down a rope. He felt
curiously corky and insecure, but still when he reached the bottom
he sank up to his knees in impalpable mud. He could foggily see
Tazzuchi a few paces away waiting for him, and he went up to him at
once. If the men in the boat, acting on orders, cut his air-tube,
he wanted to be in a position to cut Captain Tazzuchi's also with
promptness.</p>
<p>However, everything went peacefully just then. The Italian set
off down a track in the slime, and Kettle waded laboriously after
him. It was terrible work making a passage through that white
glutinous ooze, but they came to the wreck directly, and, working
round her rusty flank, stood beside a great shallow pit, where two
weird-looking gray sea-monsters showed in dim outline through the
dense fog of the water.</p>
<p>Sound does not carry down there in that quiet world, and the two
new-comers stood for long enough before the two workers observed
them. But one chanced to look up and see them watching and jogged
the other with his spade, and then both frantically beckoned the
visitors to come down into the pit. Tazzuchi led, and Kettle
followed, wallowing down the slopes of slime, and there at the
bottom, in the dim, milky light, one of the professional divers
slipped a shovel into his hand and thrust it downward, till it
jarred against something solid underfoot.</p>
<p>It was clear they had come upon the gold boxes, and they wished
to impress upon the visitors, in underwater dumb show, that the
find had only been made that very minute. It was a strange enough
performance. Half-seen hands snapped red fingers in triumph.
Ponderously booted feet did a dance of ecstasy in three feet of
gluey mud. And meanwhile, Kettle, with a hand on the haft of his
knife, edged away from this uncanny demonstration, lest some one
should slit his air-tube before he could prevent it.</p>
<p>He had seen what he wanted; he had no reason to wait longer; and
besides, being a novice at diving, his lungs were half burst
already in the effort to get breath, and his head was singing like
a tea-urn. The gold boxes were there, and if they were not brought
to the surface, and carried honestly to Suez, the matter would have
to be fought out above in God's open air, and not in that horrible
choking quagmire of slime and cruel water. And so, still guarding
himself cannily, he got back again to the boat, and almost had it
in him to shake hands with the men who eased him of that
intolerable helmet.</p>
<p>Now far be it from me to raise even a suspicion that Captain
Owen Kettle resented the fact that he had been robbed of a scuffle
when the little salvage steamer actually did bring up in Suez
harbor with the specie honestly locked in one of her staterooms.
But that he was violently angry he admits himself without
qualification. He says he kicked himself for being such a bad judge
of men.</p>
<p>The <i>Parakeet</i> was in when they arrived, rebunkering for
the run home, and Murray came off as fast as a crew could drive his
boat to inquire the news.</p>
<p>He saw Tazzuchi on the deck and accosted him with a vigorous
handshake, and a "Hullo, Fizz-hookey, old man, how goes it? Who'd
have thought of seeing you here? Howdy, Captain Kettle. Had good
fishing?"</p>
<p>"Do you know Captain Tazzuchi?"</p>
<p>"Somewhat. Why, we were both boys on the <i>Conway</i>
together."</p>
<p>"You're making some mistake. Captain Tazzuchi is an
Italian."</p>
<p>"Oh, am I?" said Tazzuchi. "Not much of the Dago about me except
the name."</p>
<p>"Well, you never told me that before."</p>
<p>"You never asked me, that I know of. I speak about enough of the
lingo to carry on duty with, and I serve on an Italian ship because
I couldn't get a skipper's billet on anything else. But I'm as
English as either of you, and as English as Birds--or more English
than Birds, seeing that they come from somewhere near Jerusalem.
Great Scot, Captain Kettle, can't you tell a Dago yet for sure?
Where have you been all your days?"</p>
<p>Murray laughed. "Well, come across and discuss it in the
<i>Parakeet</i>. I've got a case of champagne on board to wet my
new ticket."</p>
<p>"Stay half a minute," said Tazzuchi, "we'll just get those boxes
of gold down into your boat, Murray, and ferry them across. I
sha'n't be sorry to have them out of my responsibility. They're too
big a temptation to leave handy for the crew there is on board
here."</p>
<p>"Phew!" said Kettle, "it's hot here in Suez. Great James! to
think of the way I've been sweating about this blame' ship without
a scrap of need of it. Here, hurry up with the lucre-boxes. I want
to get across to the old <i>Parakeet</i> and wash the taste of a
lot of things out of my mouth."</p>

<h3>THE DEAR INSURED</h3>
<br>
<p>"He isn't the 'dear deceased' yet by a very long chalk," said
Captain Kettle.</p>
<p>"If he was," retorted Lupton with a dry smile, "my immediate
interest in him would cease, and the Company would shrug its
shoulders, and pay, and look pleasant. In the mean while he's,
shall we say, 'the dear insured,' and a premium paying asset that
the Company's told me off to keep an eye on."</p>
<p>"Do much business in your particular line?" "Why yes, recently a
good deal. It's got to be quite a fashionable industry of late to
pick up some foolish young gentleman with expectations, insure his
life for a big pile, knock him quietly on the head, and then come
back home in a neat black suit to pocket the proceeds."</p>
<p>"Does this Mr.--" Kettle referred to the passenger
list--"Hamilton's the rogue's name, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"No, he's the flat. Cranze is the--er--his friend who stands to
draw the stamps."</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Hamilton know you?"</p>
<p>"Never seen me in his life."</p>
<p>"Does this thief Cranze?"</p>
<p>"Same."</p>
<p>"Then, sir, I'll tell you what's your ticket," said Kettle, who
had got an eye to business. "Take a passage with me out to the Gulf
and back, and keep an eye on the young gentleman yourself. You'll
find it a bit cold in the Western Ocean at first, but once we get
well in the Gulf Stream, and down toward New Orleans, I tell you
you'll just enjoy life. It'll be a nice trip for you, and I'm sure
I'll do my best to make things comfortable for you."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you would, Captain, but it can't be done at the
price."</p>
<p>Kettle looked thoughtfully at the passenger list. "I could
promise you a room to yourself. We're not very full up this run. In
fact, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Cranze are the only two names I've got
down so far, and I may as well tell you we're not likely to have
others. You see Birds are a very good line, but they lay themselves
out more for cargo than passengers."</p>
<p>"So our local agent in Liverpool found out for us already, and
that's mostly why I'm here. Don't you see, Captain, if the pair of
them had started off to go tripping round the Mexican Gulf in one
of the regular passenger boats, there would have been nothing
suspicious about that. But when they book berths by you, why then
it begins to look fishy at once."</p>
<p>Kettle turned on his companion with a sudden viciousness. "By
James!" he snapped, "you better take care of your-words, or
there'll be a man in this smoke-room with a broken jaw. I allow no
one to sling slights at either me or my ship. No, nor at the firm
either that owns both of us. You needn't look round at the young
lady behind the bar. She can't hear what we're saying across in
this corner, and if even she could she's quite welcome to know how
I think about the matter. By James, do you think you can speak to
me as if I was a common railway director? I can tell you that, as
Captain of a passenger boat, I've a very different social
position."</p>
<p>"My dear sir," said Lupton soothingly, "to insult you was the
last thing in my mind. I quite know you've got a fine ship, and a
new ship, and a ship to be congratulated on. I've seen her. In fact
I was on board and all over her only this morning. But what I meant
to point out was (although I seem to have put it clumsily) that
Messrs. Bird have chosen to schedule you for the lesser frequented
Gulf ports, finding, as you hint, that cargo pays them better than
passengers."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"And naturally therefore anything that was done on the
<i>Flamingo</i> would not have the same fierce light of publicity
on it that would get on--say--one of the Royal Mail boats. You see
they bustle about between busy ports crammed with passengers who
are just at their wits' end for something to do. You know what a
pack of passengers are. Give them a topic like this: Young man with
expectations suddenly knocked overboard, nobody knows by whom;
'nother young man on boat drawing a heavy insurance from him; and
they aren't long in putting two and two together."</p>
<p>"You seem to think it requires a pretty poor brain to run a
steam-packet," said Kettle contemptuously. "How long would I be
before I had that joker in irons?"</p>
<p>"If he did it as openly as I have said, you'd arrest him at
once. But you must remember Cranze will have been thinking out his
game for perhaps a year beforehand, till he can see absolutely no
flaw in it, till he thinks, in fact, there's not the vaguest chance
of being dropped on. If anything happens to Hamilton, his dear
friend Cranze will be the last man to be suspected of it. And mark
you, he's a clever chap. It isn't your clumsy, ignorant knave who
turns insurance robber--and incidentally murderer."</p>
<p>"Still, I don't see how he'd be better off on my ship than he
would be on the bigger passenger packets."</p>
<p>"Just because you won't have a crowd of passengers. Captain, a
ship's like a woman; any breath of scandal damages her
reputation,-whether it's true and deserved or not. And a
ship-captain's like a woman's husband; he'll put up with a lot to
keep any trace of scandal away from her."</p>
<p>"That's the holy truth."</p>
<p>"A skipper on one of the bigger passenger lines would be just as
keen as you could be not to have his ship mixed up with anything
discreditable. But passengers are an impious lot. They are just
bursting for want of a job, most of them; they revel in anything
like an accident to break the monotony; and if they can spot a bit
of foul play--or say they helped to spot it--why, there they are,
supplied with one good solid never-stale yarn for all the rest of
their natural lives. So you see they've every inducement to do a
lot of ferreting that a ship's officers (with other work on hand)
would not dream about."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle pulled thoughtfully at his neat red pointed
beard. "You're putting the thing in a new light, sir, and I thank
you for what you've said. I see my course plain before me. So soon
as we have dropped the pilot, I shall go straight to this Mr.
Cranze, and tell him that from information received I hear he's
going to put Mr. Hamilton over the side. And then I shall say:
'Into irons you go, my man, so soon as ever Hamilton's
missing.'"</p>
<p>Lupton laughed rather angrily. "And what would be the result of
that, do you think?"</p>
<p>"Cranze will get mad. He'll probably talk a good deal, and that
I shall allow within limits. But he'll not hit me. I'm not the kind
of a man that other people see fit to raise their hands to."</p>
<p>"You don't look it. But, my good sir, don't you see that if you
speak out like that, you'll probably scare the beggar off his game
altogether?"</p>
<p>"And why not? Do you think my ship's a blessed detective novel
that's to be run just for your amusement?"</p>
<p>Lupton tapped the table slowly with his fingers. "Now look here,
Captain," he said, "there's a chance here of our putting a stop to
a murderous game that's been going on too long, by catching a rogue
red-handed. It's to our interest to get a conviction and make an
example. It's to your interest to keep your ship free from a
fuss."</p>
<p>"All the way."</p>
<p>"Quite so. My Company's prepared to buy your interest up."</p>
<p>"You must put it plainer than that."</p>
<p>"I'll put it as definitely as you like. I'll give you &pound;20
to keep your eye on these men, and say nothing about what I've told
you, but just watch. If you catch Cranze so clearly trying it on
that the Courts give a conviction, the Company will pay you
&pound;200."</p>
<p>"It's a lot of money."</p>
<p>"My Company will find it a lot cheaper than paying out
&pound;20,000, and that's what Hamilton's insured for."</p>
<p>"Phew! I didn't know we were dealing with such big figures.
Well, Mr. Cranze has got his inducements to murder the man,
anyway."</p>
<p>"I told you that from the first. Now, Captain, are you going to
take my check for that preliminary &pound;20?"</p>
<p>"Hand it over," said Kettle. "I see no objections. And you may
as well give me a bit of a letter about the balance."</p>
<p>"I'll do both," said Lupton, and took out his stylograph, and
called a waiter to bring him hotel writing paper.</p>
<p>Now Captain Owen Kettle, once he had taken up this piece of
employment, entered into it with a kind of chastened joy. The Life
Insurance Company's agent had rather sneered at ship-captains as a
class (so he considered), and though the man did his best to be
outwardly civil, it was plain that he considered a mob of
passengers the intellectual superiors of any master mariner. So
Kettle intended to prove himself the "complete detective" out of
sheer <i>esprit de corps</i>.</p>
<p>As he had surmised, Messrs. Hamilton and Cranze remained the
<i>Flamingo's</i> only two passengers, and so he considered he
might devote full attention to them without being remarkable. If he
had been a steward making sure of his tips he could not have been
more solicitous for their welfare; and to say he watched them like
a cat is putting the thing feebly. Any man with an uneasy
conscience must have grasped from the very first that the plot had
been guessed at, and that this awkward little skipper, with his
oppressive civilities, was merely waiting his chance to act as
Nemesis.</p>
<p>But either Mr. Cranze had an easy mind, and Lupton had unjustly
maligned him, or he was a fellow of the most brazen assurance. He
refused to take the least vestige of a warning. He came on board
with a dozen cases of champagne and four of liqueur brandy as a
part of his personal luggage, and his first question to every
official he came across was how much he would have to pay per
bottle for corkage.</p>
<p>As he made these inquiries from a donkey-man, two deck hands,
three mates, a trimmer, the third engineer, two stewards, and
Captain Kettle himself, the answers he received were various, and
some of them were profane. He seemed to take a delight in
advertising his chronic drunkenness, and between-whiles he made a
silly show of the fact that he carried a loaded revolver in his hip
pocket. "Lots fellows do't now," he explained. "Never know
who-you-may-meet. S' a mos' useful habit."</p>
<p>Now Captain Kettle, in his inmost heart, considered that Cranze
was nerving himself up with drink to the committal of his horrid
deed, and so he took a very natural precaution. Before they had
dropped the Irish coast he had managed to borrow the revolver,
unbeknown to its owner, and carefully extracted the powder from the
cartridges, replacing the bullets for the sake of appearances. And
as it happened, the chief engineer, who was a married man as well
as a humorist, though working independently of his skipper, carried
the matter still further. He, too, got hold of the weapon, and
brazed up the breech-block immovably, so that it could not be
surreptitiously reloaded. He said that his wife had instructed him
to take no chances, and that meanwhile, as a fool's pendant, the
revolver was as good as ever it had been.</p>
<p>The revolver became the joke of the ship. Cranze kept up a
steady soak on king's peg--putting in a good three fingers of the
liqueur brandy before filling up the tumbler with champagne--and
was naturally inclined to be argumentative. Any one of the ship's
company who happened to be near him with a little time to spare
would get up a discussion on any matter that came to his mind, work
things gently to a climax, and then contradict Cranze flatly. Upon
which, out would come the revolver, and down would go the humorist
on his knees, pitifully begging for pardon and life, to the vast
amusement of the onlookers.</p>
<p>Pratt, the chief engineer, was the inventor of this game, but he
openly renounced all patent rights. He said that everybody on board
ought to take the stage in turn--he himself was quite content to
retire on his early laurels. So all hands took pains to contradict
Cranze and to cower with a fine show of dramatic fright before his
spiked revolver.</p>
<p>All the <i>Flamingo's</i> company except one man, that is.
Frivolity of this sort in no way suited the appetite of Captain
Owen Kettle. He talked with Cranze with a certain dry cordiality.
And at times he contradicted him. In fact the little sailor
contradicted most passengers if he talked to them for long. He was
a man with strong opinions, and he regarded tolerance as mere
weakness. Moreover, Cranze's chronic soaking nauseated him. But at
the same time, if his civility was scant, Cranze never lugged out
the foolish weapon in his presence. There was a something in the
shipmaster's eye which daunted him. The utmost height to which his
resentment could reach with Captain Kettle was a folding of the
arms and a scowl which was intended to be majestic, but which was
frequently spoiled by a hiccough.</p>
<p>In pleasant contrast to this weak, contemptible knave was the
man Hamilton, his dupe and prospective victim. For him Kettle
formed a liking at once, though for the first days of the voyage it
was little enough he saw of his actual presence. Hamilton was a bad
sailor and a lover of warmth, and as the Western Ocean was just
then in one of its cold and noisy moods, this passenger went
shudderingly out of the cabin when meals came on, and returned
shudderingly from the cold on deck as soon they were over.</p>
<p>But when the <i>Flamingo</i> began to make her southing, and the
yellow tangles of weed floating in emerald waves bore evidence that
they were steaming against the warm current of the Gulf Stream,
then Hamilton came into view. He found a spot on the top of the
fiddley under the lee of a tank where a chair could stand, and sat
there in the glow of sun and boilers, and basked complacently.</p>
<p>He was a shy, nervous little man, and though Kettle had usually
a fine contempt for all weakness, somehow his heart went out to
this retiring passenger almost at first sight. Myself, I am
inclined to think it was because he knew him to be hunted, knew him
to be the object of a murderous conspiracy, and loathed most
thoroughly the vulgar rogue who was his treacherous enemy. But
Captain Kettle scouts the idea that he was stirred by any such
feeble, womanish motives. Kettle was a poet himself, and with the
kinship of species he felt the poetic fire glowing out from the
person of this Mr. Hamilton. At least, so he says; and if he has
deceived himself on the matter, which, from an outsider's point of
view, seems likely, I am sure the error is quite unconscious. The
little sailor may have his faults, as the index of these pages has
shown; but untruthfulness has never been set down to his tally, and
I am not going to accuse him of it now.</p>
<p>Still, it is a sure thing that talk on the subject of verse
making did not come at once. Kettle was immensely sensitive about
his accomplishment, and had writhed under brutal scoffs and
polished ridicule at his poetry more times than he cared to count.
With passengers especially he kept it scrupulously in the
background, even as he did his talent for making sweet music on the
accordion.</p>
<p>But somehow he and Hamilton, after a few days' acquaintance,
seemed to glide into the subject imperceptibly. Mutual confidences
followed in the course of nature. It seemed that Hamilton too, like
Kettle, was a devotee of the stiller forms of verse.</p>
<p>"You see, Skipper," he said, "I've been a pretty bad lot, and
I've made things hum most of my time, and so I suppose I get my
hankerings after restfulness as the natural result of
contrast."</p>
<p>"Same here, sir. Ashore I can respect myself, and in our chapel
circle, though I say it myself, you'll find few more respected men.
But at sea I shouldn't like to tell you what I've done; I shouldn't
like to tell any one. If a saint has to come down and skipper the
brutes we have to ship as sailormen nowadays, he'd wear out his
halo flinging it at them. And when matters have been worst, and
I've been bashing the hands about, or doing things to carry out an
owner's order that I'd blush even to think of ashore, why then,
sir, gentle verse, to tunes I know, seems to bubble up inside me
like springs in a barren land."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know about that," said Hamilton doubtfully, "but
when I get thoroughly sick of myself, and wish I was dead, I
sometimes stave off putting a shot through my silly head by getting
a pencil and paper, and shifting my thoughts out of the beastly
world I know, into--well, it's hard to explain. But I get sort of
notions, don't you see, and they seem to run best in verse. I write
'em when the fit's on me, and I burn 'em when the fit's through;
and you'll hardly think it, but I never told a living soul I ever
did such a thing till I told you this minute. My set--I mean, I
couldn't bear to be laughed at. But you seem to be a fellow that's
been in much the same sort of box yourself."</p>
<p>"I don't know quite that. At any rate, I've never thought of
shooting myself."</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't mean to suggest we were alike at all in detail. I
was only thinking we had both seen rough times. Lord forbid that
any man should ever be half the fool that I have been." He sighed
heavily.--"However, sufficient for the day. Look out over yonder;
there's a bit of color for you."</p>
<p>A shoal of flying-fish got up out of the warm, shining water and
ran away over the ripples like so many silver rats; yellow tangles
of Gulf-weed swam in close squadron on the emerald sea; and on the
western horizon screw-pile lighthouses stood up out of the water,
marking the nearness of the low-lying Floridan beaches, and
reminding one of mysterious Everglades beyond.</p>
<p>"A man, they tell me," said Hamilton, "can go into that country
at the back there, and be a hermit, and live honestly on his own
fish and fruit. I believe I'd like that life. I could go there, and
be decent, and perhaps in time I should forget things."</p>
<p>"Don't you try it. The mosquitoes are shocking."</p>
<p>"There are worse devils than mosquitoes. Now I should have
thought there was something about those Everglades that would have
appealed to you, Skipper?"</p>
<p>"There isn't, and I've been there. You want a shot-gun in
Florida to shoot callers with, not eatables. I've written verse
there, and good verse, but it was the same old tale, sir, that
brought it up to my fingers' ends. I'd been having trouble just
then--yes, bad trouble. No, Mr. Hamilton, you go home, sir, to
England and find a country place, and get on a farm, and watch the
corn growing, and hear the birds sing, and get hold of the smells
of the fields, and the colors of the trees, and then you'll enjoy
life and turn out poetry you can be proud of."</p>
<p>"Doesn't appeal to me. You see you look upon the country with a
countryman's eye."</p>
<p>"Me," said Kettle. "I'm seaport and sea bred and brought up, and
all I know of fields and a farm is what I've seen from a
railway-carriage window. No, I've had to work too hard for my
living, and for a living for Mrs. Kettle and the youngsters, to
have any time for that sort of enjoyment; but a man can't help
knowing what he wants, sir, can he? And that's what I'm aiming at,
and it's for that I'm scratching together every sixpence of money I
can lay hands on."</p>
<p>But here a sudden outcry below broke in upon their talk. "That's
Mr. Cranze," said Kettle. "He'll be going too far in one of his
tantrums one of these days."</p>
<p>"I'm piously hoping the drunken brute will tumble overboard,"
Hamilton muttered; "it would save a lot of trouble for everybody.
Eh, well," he said, "I suppose I'd better go and look after him,"
and got up and went below.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle sat where he was, musing. He had no fear that
Cranze, the ship's butt and drunkard, would murder his man in
broad, staring daylight, especially as, judging from the sounds,
others of the ship's company were at present baiting him. But he
did not see his way to earning that extra &pound;200, which he
would very much like to have fingered. To let this vulgar, drunken
ruffian commit some overt act against Hamilton's life, without
doing him actual damage, seemed an impossibility. He had taken far
to great a fancy for Hamilton to allow him to be hurt. He was
beginning to be mystified by the whole thing. The case was by no
means so simple and straightforward as it had looked when Lupton
put it to him in the hotel smoking-room ashore.</p>
<p>Had Cranze been any other passenger, he would have stopped his
drunken riotings by taking away the drink, and by giving strict
orders that the man was to be supplied with no further intoxicants.
But Cranze sober might be dangerous, while Cranze tipsy was merely
a figure of ridicule; so he submitted, very much against his grain,
to having his ship made into a bear-garden, and anxiously awaited
developments.</p>
<p>The <i>Flamingo</i> cleared the south of Florida, sighted the
high land of Cuba, and stood across through the Yucatan channel to
commence her peddling business in Honduras, and at some twenty
ports she came to an anchor six miles off shore, and hooted with
her siren till lighters came off through the surf and the
shallows.</p>
<p>Machinery they sent ashore at these little-known stations, coal,
powder, dress-goods, and pianos, receiving in return a varied
assortment of hides, mahogany, dyewoods, and some parcels of ore.
There was a small ferrying business done also between neighboring
ports in unclean native passengers, who harbored on the foredeck,
and complained of want of deference from the crew.</p>
<p>Hamilton appeared to extract some melancholy pleasure from it
all, and Cranze remained unvaryingly drunk. Cranze passed insults
to casual strangers who came on board and did not know his little
ways, and the casual strangers (after the custom of their happy
country) tried to knife him, but were always knocked over in the
nick of time, by some member of the <i>Flamingo's</i> crew.
Hamilton said there was a special providence which looks after
drunkards of Cranze's type, and declined to interfere; and Cranze
said he refused to be chided by a qualified teetotaller, and mixed
himself further king's pegs.</p>
<p>Messrs. Bird, Bird and Co., being of an economical turn of mind,
did not fall into the error of overmanning their ships, and so as
one of the mates chose to be knocked over by six months' old
malarial fever, Captain Kettle had practically to do a mate's duty
as well as his own. A mate in the mercantile marine is officially
an officer and some fraction of a gentleman, but on tramp steamers
and liners where cargo is of more account than passengers--even
when they dine at half-past six, instead of at midday--a mate has
to perform manual labors rather harder than that accomplished by
any three regular deck hands.</p>
<p>I do not intend to imply that Kettle actually drove a winch, or
acted as stevedore below, or sweated over bales as they swung up
through a hatch, but he did work as gangway man, and serve at the
tally desk, and oversee generally while the crew worked cargo; and
his watch over the passengers was at this period of necessity
relaxed. He tried hard to interest Hamilton in the mysteries of
hold stowage, in order to keep him under his immediate eye. But
Hamilton bluntly confessed to loathing anything that was at all
useful, and so he perforce had to be left to pick his own position
under the awnings, there to doze, and smoke cigarettes, and
scribble on paper as the moods so seized him.</p>
<p>It was off one of the ports in the peninsula of Yucatan, toward
the Bay of Campeachy, that Cranze chose to fall overboard. The name
of the place was announced by some one when they brought up, and
Cranze asked where it was. Kettle marked it off with a leg of the
dividers on the chart. "Yucatan," said Cranze, "that's the ruined
cities shop, isn't it?"--He shaded his unsteady eyes, and looked
out at a clump of squalid huts just showing on the beach beyond
some three miles of tumbling surf. "Gum! here's a ruined city all
hot and waiting. Home of the ancient Aztecs, and colony of the
Atlanteans, and all that. Skipper, I shall go ashore, and enlarge
my mind."</p>
<p>"You can go if you like," said Kettle, "but remember, I steam
away from here as soon as ever I get the cargo out of her, and I
wait for no man. And mind not to get us upset in the surf going
there. The water round here swarms with sharks, and I shouldn't
like any of them to get indigestion."</p>
<p>"Seem trying to make yourself jolly ob--bub--jectiable's
morning," grumbled Cranze, and invited Hamilton to accompany him on
shore forthwith. "Let's go and see the girls. Ruined cities should
have ruined girls and ruined pubs to give us some ruined amusement.
We been on this steamer too long, an' we want variety. V'riety's
charming. Come along and see ruined v'riety."</p>
<p>Hamilton shrugged his shoulders. "Drunk as usual, are you? You
silly owl, whatever ruined cities there may be, are a good fifty
miles in the bush."</p>
<p>"'S all you know about it. I can see handsome majestic ruin over
there on the beach, an' I'm going to see it 'out further delay. 'S
a duty I owe to myself to enlarge the mind by studying the great
monuments of the past."</p>
<p>"If you go ashore, you'll be marooned as safe as houses, and
Lord knows when the next steamer will call. The place reeks of
fever, and as your present state of health is distinctly rocky,
you'll catch it, and be dead and out of the way inside a week
easily. Look here, don't be an ass."</p>
<p>"Look here yourself. Are you a competent medicated
practitioner?"</p>
<p>"Oh, go and get sober."</p>
<p>"Answer me. Are you competent medicated practitioner?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not."</p>
<p>"Very well then. Don't you presume t'lecture me on state of my
health. No reply, please. I don' wan' to be encumbered with your
further acquaintance. I wish you a go' morning."</p>
<p>Hamilton looked at Captain Kettle under his brows. "Will you
advise me," he said, "what I ought to do."</p>
<p>"I should say it would be healthier for you to let him have his
own way."</p>
<p>"Thanks," said Hamilton, and turned away. "I'll act on that
advice."</p>
<p>Now the next few movements of Mr. Cranze are wrapped in a
certain degree of mystery. He worried a very busy third mate, and
got tripped on the hard deck for his pains; he was ejected forcibly
from the engineers' mess-room, where it was supposed he had designs
on the whisky; and he was rescued by the carpenter from an irate
half-breed Mosquito Indian, who seemed to have reasons for desiring
his blood there and then on the spot. But how else he passed the
time, and as to how he got over the side and into the water, there
is no evidence to show.</p>
<p>There were theories that he had been put there by violence as a
just act of retribution; there was an idea that he was trying to
get into a lighter which lay alongside for a cast ashore, but saw
two lighters, and got into the one which didn't exist; and there
were other theories also, but they were mostly frivolous. But the
very undoubted fact remained that he was there in the water, that
there was an ugly sea running, that he couldn't swim, and that the
place bristled with sharks.</p>
<p>A couple of lifebuoys, one after the other, hit him accurately
on the head, and the lighter cast off, and backed down to try and
pick him up. He did not bring his head on to the surface again, but
stuck up an occasional hand, and grasped with it frantically. And,
meanwhile, there was great industry among the black triangular
dorsal fins that advertised the movements of the sharks which owned
them underneath the surface. Nobody on board the <i>Flamingo</i>
had any particular love for Cranze, but all hands crowded to the
rail and shivered and felt sick at the thought of seeing him
gobbled up.</p>
<p>Then out of the middle of these spectators jumped the mild,
delicate Hamilton, with a volley of bad language at his own
foolishness, and lit on a nice sleek wave-crest, feet first in an
explosion of spray. Away scurried the converging sharks' fins, and
down shot Hamilton out of sight.</p>
<p>What followed came quickly. Kettle, with a tremendous flying
leap, landed somehow on the deck of the lighter, with bones
unbroken. He cast a bowline on to the end of the main sheet, and,
watching his chance, hove the bight of it cleverly into Hamilton's
grasp, and as Hamilton had come up with Cranze frenziedly clutching
him round the neck, Kettle was able to draw his catch toward the
lighter's side without further delay.</p>
<p>By this time the men who had gone below for that purpose had
returned with a good supply of coal, and a heavy fusillade of the
black lumps kept the sharks at a distance, at any rate for the
moment. Kettle heaved in smartly, and eager hands gripped the pair
as they swirled up alongside, and there they were on the lighter's
deck, spitting, dripping, and gasping. But here came an unexpected
developement. As soon as he had got back his wind, the mild
Hamilton turned on his fellow passenger like a very fury, hitting,
kicking, swearing, and almost gnashing with his teeth; and Cranze,
stricken to a sudden soberness by his ducking, collected himself
after the first surprise, and returned the blows with a murderous
interest.</p>
<br>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/page278.jpg" width="45%" alt=

<b>Out of the middle of these spectators jumped the mild, delicate
Hamilton.</b></p>
<br>
<p>But one of the mates, who had followed his captain down on to
the lighter to bear a hand, took a quick method of stopping the
scuffle. He picked up a cargo-sling, slipped it round Cranze's
waist, hooked on the winch chain, and passed the word to the deck
above. Somebody alive to the jest turned on steam, and of a sudden
Cranze was plucked aloft, and hung there under the derrick-sheave,
struggling impotently, like some insane jumping-jack.</p>
<p>Amid the yells of laughter which followed, Hamilton laughed
also, but rather hysterically. Kettle put a hand kindly on his wet
shoulder. "Come on board again," he said. "If you lie down in your
room for an hour or so, you'll be all right again then. You're a
bit over-done. I shouldn't like you to make a fool of
yourself."</p>
<p>"Make a fool of myself," was the bitter reply. "I've made a
bigger fool of myself in the last three minutes than any other man
could manage in a lifetime."</p>
<p>"I'll get you the Royal Humane Society's medal for that bit of a
job, anyway."</p>
<p>"Give me a nice rope to hang myself with," said Hamilton
ungraciously, "that would be more to the point. Here, for the
Lord's sake let me be, or I shall go mad." He brushed aside all
help, clambered up the steamer's high black side again, and went
down to his room.</p>
<p>"That's the worst of these poetic natures," Kettle mused as he,
too, got out of the lighter; "they're so highly strung."</p>
<p>Cranze, on being lowered down to deck again, and finding his
tormentors too many to be retaliated upon, went below and changed,
and then came up again and found solace in more king's pegs. He was
not specially thankful to Hamilton for saving his life; said, in
fact, that it was his plain duty to render such trifling
assistance; and further stated that if Hamilton found his way over
the side, he, Cranze, would not stir a finger to pull him back
again.</p>
<p>He was very much annoyed at what he termed Hamilton's
"unwarrantable attack," and still further annoyed at his journey up
to the derrick's sheave in the cargo-sling, which he also laid to
Hamilton's door. When any of the ship's company had a minute or so
to spare, they came and gave Cranze good advice and spoke to him of
his own unlovableness, and Cranze hurled brimstone back at them
unceasingly, for king's peg in quantity always helped his
vocabulary of swear-words.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the <i>Flamingo</i> steamed up and dropped cargo
wherever it was consigned, and she abased herself to gather fresh
cargo wherever any cargo offered. It was Captain Kettle who did the
abasing, and he did not like the job at all; but he remembered that
Birds paid him specifically for this among other things; and also
that if he did not secure the cargo, some one else would steam
along, and eat dirt, and snap it up; and so he pocketed his pride
(and his commission) and did his duty. He called to mind that he
was not the only man in the world who earned a living out of
uncongenial employment. The creed of the South Shields chapel made
a point of this: it preached that to every man, according to his
strength, is the cross dealt out which he has to bear. And Captain
Owen Kettle could not help being conscious of his own vast
lustiness.</p>
<p>But one morning, before the <i>Flamingo</i> had finished with
her calls on the ports of the Texan rivers, a matter happened on
board of her which stirred the pulse of her being to a very
different gait. The steward who brought Captain Kettle's early
coffee coughed, and evidently wanted an invitation to speak.</p>
<p>"Well?' said Kettle.</p>
<p>"It's about Mr. Hamilton, sir. I can't find 'im anywheres."</p>
<p>"Have you searched the ship?"</p>
<p>"Hunofficially, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, get the other two stewards, and do it thoroughly."</p>
<p>The steward went out, and Captain Kettle lifted the coffee cup
and drank a salutation to the dead. From that very moment he had a
certain foreboding that the worst had happened. "Here's luck, my
lad, wherever you now may be. That brute Cranze has got to windward
of the pair of us, and your insurance money's due this minute. I
only sent that steward to search the ship for form's sake. There
was the link of poetry between you and me, lad; and that's closer
than most people could guess at; and I know, as sure as if your
ghost stood here to tell me, that you've gone. How, I've got to
find out."</p>
<p>He put down the cup, and went to the bathroom for his morning's
tub. "I'm to blame, I know," he mused on, "for not taking better
care of you, and I'm not trying to excuse myself. You were so
brimful of poetry that you hadn't room left for any thought of your
own skin, like a chap such as I am is bound to have. Besides,
you've been well-off all your time and you haven't learned to be
suspicious. Well, what's done's done, and it can't be helped. But,
my lad, I want you to look on while I hand in the bill. It'll do
you good to see Cranze pay up the account."</p>
<p>Kettle went through his careful toilet, and then in his spruce
white drill went out and walked briskly up and down the hurricane
deck till the steward came with the report. His forebodings had not
led him astray. Hamilton was not on board: the certain alternative
was that he lay somewhere in the warm Gulf water astern, as a
helpless dead body.</p>
<p>"Tell the Chief Officer," he said, "to get a pair of irons out
of store and bring them down to Mr. Cranze's room. I'm going there
now."</p>
<p>He found Cranze doctoring a very painful head with the early
application of stimulant, and Cranze asked him what the devil he
meant by not knocking at the door before opening it.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle whipped the tumbler out of the passenger's
shaking fingers, and emptied its contents into the wash-basin.</p>
<p>"I'm going to see you hanged shortly, you drunken beast," he
said, "but in the mean while you may as well get sober for a
change, and explain things up a bit."</p>
<p>Cranze swung his legs out of the bunk and sat up. He was feeling
very tottery, and the painfulness of his head did not improve his
temper. "Look here," he said, "I've had enough of your airs and
graces. I've paid for my passage on this rubbishy old water-pusher
of yours, and I'll trouble you to keep a civil tongue in your head,
or I'll report you to your owners. You are like a railway guard, my
man. After you have seen that your passengers have got their proper
tickets, it's your duty to--"</p>
<p>Mr. Cranze's connective remarks broke off here for the time
being. He found himself suddenly plucked away from the bunk by a
pair of iron hands, and hustled out through the state-room door. He
was a tall man, and the hands thrust him from below, upward, and,
though he struggled wildly and madly, all his efforts to have his
own way were futile. Captain Owen Kettle had handled far too many
really strong men in this fashion to even lose breath over a
dram-drinking passenger. So Cranze found himself hurtled out on to
the lower fore-deck, where somebody handcuffed him neatly to an
iron stanchion, and presently a mariner, by Captain Kettle's
orders, rigged a hose, and mounted on the iron bulwark above him,
and let a three-inch stream of chilly brine slop steadily on to his
head.</p>
<p>The situation, from an onlooker's point of view, was probably
ludicrous enough, but what daunted the patient was that nobody
seemed to take it as a joke. There were a dozen men of the crew who
had drawn near to watch, and yesterday all these would have laughed
contemptuously at each of his contortions. But now they are all
stricken to a sudden solemnity.</p>
<p>"Spell-o," ordered Kettle. "Let's see if he's sober yet."</p>
<p>The man on the bulwarks let the stream from the hose flop
overboard, where it ran out into a stream of bubbles which joined
the wake.</p>
<p>Cranze gasped back his breath, and used it in a torrent of
curses.</p>
<p>"Play on him again," said Kettle, and selected a good black
before-breakfast cigar from his pocket. He lit it with care. The
man on the bulwark shifted his shoulder for a better hold against
the derrick-guy, and swung the limp hose in-board again. The water
splashed down heavily on Cranze's head and shoulders, and the
onlookers took stock of him without a trace of emotion. They had
most of them seen the remedy applied to inebriates before, and so
they watched Cranze make his gradual recovery with the eyes of
experts.</p>
<p>"Spell-o," ordered Kettle some five minutes later, and once more
the hose vomited sea water ungracefully into the sea. This time
Cranze had the sense to hold his tongue till he was spoken to. He
was very white about the face, except for his nose, which was red,
and his eye had brightened up considerably. He was quite sober, and
quite able to weigh any words that were dealt out to him.</p>
<p>"Now," said Kettle judicially, "what have you done with Mr.
Hamilton?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"You deny all knowledge of how he got overboard?"</p>
<p>Cranze was visibly startled. "Of course I do. Is he
overboard?"</p>
<p>"He can't be found on this ship. Therefore he is over the side.
Therefore you put him there."</p>
<p>Cranze was still more startled. But he kept himself in hand.
"Look here," he said, "what rot! What should I know about the
fellow? I haven't seen him since last night."</p>
<p>"So you say. But I don't see why I should believe you. In fact,
I don't."</p>
<p>"Well, you can suit yourself about that, but it's true enough.
Why in the name of mischief should I want to meddle with the poor
beggar? If you're thinking of the bit of a scrap we had yesterday,
I'll own I was full at the time. And so must he have been. At least
I don't know why else he should have set upon me like he did. At
any rate that's not a thing a man would want to murder him
for."</p>
<p>"No, I should say &pound;20,000 is more in your line."</p>
<p>"What are you driving at?"</p>
<p>"You know quite well. You got that poor fellow insured just
before this trip, you got him to make a will in your favor, and now
you've committed a dirty, clumsy murder just to finger the
dollars."</p>
<p>Cranze broke into uncanny hysterical laughter. "That chap
insured; that chap make a will in my favor? Why, he hadn't a penny.
It was me that paid for his passage. I'd been on the tear a bit,
and the Jew fellow I went to about raising the wind did say
something about insuring, I know, and made me sign a lot of law
papers. They made out I was in such a chippy state of health that
they'd not let me have any more money unless I came on some beastly
dull sea voyage to recruit a bit, and one of the conditions was
that one of the boys was to come along too and look after me."</p>
<p>"You'll look pretty foolish when you tell that thin tale to a
jury."</p>
<p>"Then let me put something else on to the back of it. I'm not
Cranze at all. I'm Hamilton. I've been in the papers a good deal
just recently, because I'd been flinging my money around, and I
didn't want to get stared at on board here. So Cranze and I swapped
names, just to confuse people. It seems to have worked very
well."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Kettle, "it's worked so well that I don't think
you'll get a jury to believe that either. As you don't seem
inclined to make a clean breast of it, you can now retire to your
room, and be restored to your personal comforts. I can't hand you
over to the police without inconvenience to myself till we get to
New Orleans, so I shall keep you in irons till we reach there.
Steward--where's a steward? Ah, here you are. See this man is kept
in his room, and see he has no more liquor. I make you responsible
for him."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said the steward.</p>
<p>Continuously the dividends of Bird, Bird and Co. outweighed
every other consideration, and the <i>Flamingo</i> dodged on with
her halting voyage. At the first place he put in at, Kettle sent
off an extravagant cablegram of recent happenings to the
representative of the Insurance Company in England. It was not the
cotton season, and the Texan ports yielded the steamer little, but
she had a ton or so of cargo for almost every one of them, and she
delivered it with neatness, and clamored for cargo in return. She
was "working up a connection." She swung round the Gulf till she
came to where logs borne by the Mississippi stick out from the
white sand, and she wasted a little time, and steamed past the
nearest outlet of the delta, because Captain Kettle did not
personally know its pilotage. He was getting a very safe and
cautious navigator in these latter days of his prosperity.</p>
<p>So she made for the Port Eads pass, picked up a pilot from the
station by the lighthouse, and steamed cautiously up to the
quarantine station, dodging the sandbars. Her one remaining
passenger had passed from an active nuisance to a close and unheard
prisoner, and his presence was almost forgotten by every one on
board, except Kettle and the steward who looked after him. The
merchant seaman of these latter days has to pay such a strict
attention to business, that he has no time whatever for extraneous
musings.</p>
<p>The <i>Flamingo</i> got a clean bill from the doctor at the
quarantine station, and emerged triumphantly from the cluster of
craft doing penance, and, with a fresh pilot, steamed on up the
yellow river, past the white sugar-mills, and the heavy cypresses
behind the banks. And in due time the pilot brought her up to New
Orleans, and, with his glasses on the bridge, Kettle saw his
acquaintance, Mr. Lupton, waiting for him on the levee.</p>
<p>He got his steamer berthed in the crowded tier, and Mr. Lupton
pushed on board over the first gang-plank. But Kettle waved the man
aside till he saw his vessel finally moored. And then he took him
into the chart-house and shut the door.</p>
<p>"You seem to have got my cable," he said. "It was a very
expensive one, but I thought the occasion needed it."</p>
<p>His visitor tapped Kettle confidentially on the knee. "You'll
find my office will deal most liberally with you, Captain. But I
can tell you I'm pretty excited to hear your full yarn."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you won't like it," said Kettle. "The man's
obviously dead, and, fancy it or not, I don't see how your office
can avoid paying the full amount. However, here's the way I've
logged it down"--and he went off into detailed narration.</p>
<p>The New Orleans heat smote upon the chart-house roof, and the
air outside clattered with the talk of negroes. Already hatches
were off, and the winch chains sang as they struck out cargo, and
from the levee alongside, and from New Orleans below and beyond,
came tangles of smells which are peculiarly their own. A steward
brought in tea, and it stood on the chart-table untasted, and at
last Kettle finished, and Lupton put a question.</p>
<p>"It's easy to tell," he said, "if they did swap names. What was
the man that went overboard like?"</p>
<p>"Little dark fellow, short sighted. He was a poet, too."</p>
<p>"That's not Hamilton, anyway, but it might be Cranze. Is your
prisoner tall?"</p>
<p>"Tall and puffy. Red-haired and a spotty face."</p>
<p>"That's Hamilton, all the way. By Jove! Skipper, we've saved our
bacon. His yarn's quite true. They did change names. Hamilton's a
rich young ass that's been painting England red these last three
years."</p>
<p>"But, tell me, what did the little chap go overboard for?"</p>
<p>"Got there himself. Uneasy conscience, I suppose. He seems to
have been a poor sort of assassin anyway. Why, when that drunken
fool tumbled overboard amongst the sharks, he didn't leave him to
be eaten or drowned, is more than I can understand. He'd have got
his money as easy as picking it up off the floor, if he'd only had
the sense to keep quiet."</p>
<p>"If you ask me," said Kettle, "it was sheer nobility of
character. I had a good deal of talk with that young gentleman,
sir. He was a splendid fellow. He had a true poetical soul."</p>
<p>Mr. Lupton winked sceptically. "He managed to play the part of a
thorough-paced young blackguard at home pretty successfully. He was
warned off the turf. He was kicked out of his club for
card-sharping. He was--well, he's dead now, anyway, and we won't
say any more about him, except that he's been stone-broke these
last three years, and has been living on his wits and helping to
fleece other flats. But he was only the tool, anyway. There is a
bigger and more capable scoundrel at the back of it all, and,
thanks to the scare you seem to have rubbed into that spotty-faced
young mug you've got locked up down below, I think we can get the
principal by the heels very nicely this journey. If you don't mind,
I'll go and see this latest victim now, before he's had time to get
rid of his fright."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle showed his visitor courteously down to the
temporary jail, and then returned to the chart-house and sipped his
tea.</p>
<p>"His name may really have been Cranze, but he was a poet, poor
lad," he mused, thinking of the dead. "That's why he couldn't do
the dirty work. But I sha'n't tell Lupton that reason. He'd only
laugh--and--that poetry ought to be a bit of a secret between the
lad and me. Poor, poor fellow! I think I'll be able to write a few
lines about him myself after I've been ashore to see the agent,
just as a bit of an epitaph. As to this spotty-faced waster who
swapped names with him, I almost have it in me to wish we'd left
him to be chopped by those sharks. He'd his money to his credit
anyway--and what's money compared with poetry?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE FIRE AND THE FARM</h3>
<br>
<p>The quartermaster knocked smartly, and came into the
chart-house, and Captain Kettle's eyes snapped open from deep sleep
to complete wakefulness.</p>
<p>"There's some sort of vessel on fire, sir, to loo'ard, about
five miles off."</p>
<p>The shipmaster glanced up at the tell-tale compass above his
head. "Officer of the watch has changed the course, I see. We're
heading for it, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. The second mate told me to say so."</p>
<p>"Quite right. Pass the word for the carpenter, and tell him to
get port and starboard lifeboats ready for lowering in case they're
wanted. I'll be on the bridge in a minute."</p>
<p>"Aye, aye, sir," said the quartermaster, and withdrew into the
darkness outside.</p>
<p>Captain Owen Kettle's toilet was not of long duration. Like most
master mariners who do business along those crowded steam lanes of
the Western Ocean, he slept in most of his clothes when at sea as a
regular habit, and in fact only stripped completely for the few
moments which were occupied by his morning's tub. If needful, he
could always go out on deck at a second's notice, and be ready to
remain there for twenty-four hours. But in this instance there was
no immediate hurry, and so he spent a full minute and a half over
his toilet, and emerged with washed hands and face, sprucely
brushed hair and beard, and his person attired in high rubber
thigh-boots and leather-bound black oilskins.</p>
<p>The night was black and thick with a drizzle of rain, and a
heavy breeze snored through the <i>Flamingo's</i> scanty rigging.
The second mate on the bridge was beating his fingerless woollen
gloves against his ribs as a cure for cold fingers. The first mate
and the third had already turned out, and were on the boatskids
helping the carpenter with the housings, and overhauling davit
falls. On that part of the horizon against which the
<i>Flamingo's</i> bows sawed with great sweeping dives was a
streaky, flickering yellow glow.</p>
<p>Kettle went on to an end of the bridge and peered ahead through
the bridge binoculars. "A steamer," he commented, "and a big one
too; and she's finely ablaze. Not much help we shall be able to
give. It will be a case of taking off the crew, if they aren't
already cooked before we get there." He looked over the side at the
eddy of water that clung to the ship's flank. "I see you're shoving
her along," he said to the second mate.</p>
<p>"I sent word down to the engine-room to give her all they knew
the moment we raised the glow. I thought you wouldn't grudge the
coal, sir."</p>
<p>"No, quite right. Hope there aren't too many of them to be
picked off, or we shall make a tight fit on board here."</p>
<p>"Funny we should be carrying the biggest cargo the old boat's
ever had packed into her. But we shall find room to house a few
poor old sailormen. They won't mind much where they stow, as long
as they're picked up out of the wet. B-r-r-rh!" shivered the second
mate, "I shouldn't much fancy open-boat cruising in the Western
Ocean this weather."</p>
<p>Captain Kettle stared on through the shiny brass binoculars.
"Call all hands," he said quietly. "That's a big ship ahead of us,
and she'll carry a lot of people. God send she's only an old tramp.
At those lifeboats there!" he shouted. "Swing the davits outboard,
and pass your painters forward. Hump yourselves, now."</p>
<p>"There's a lot of ice here, sir," came a grumbling voice out of
the darkness, "and the boats are frozen on to the chocks. We've got
to hammer it away before they'll hoist. The falls are that froze,
too, that they'll not render--"</p>
<p>"You call yourself a mate and hold a master's ticket, and want
to get a ship of your own!"--Kettle vaulted over the rail on to the
top of the fiddley, and made for his second in command. "Here, my
man, if your delicate fingers can't do this bit of a job, give me
that marlinspike. By James! do you hear me? Give up the
marlinspike. Did you never see a boat iced up before? Now then,
carpenter. Are you worth your salt? Or am I to clear both ends in
this boat by myself?"</p>
<p>So, by example and tongue, Captain Kettle got his boats swung
outboard, and the <i>Flamingo</i>, with her engines working at an
unusual strain, surged rapidly nearer and nearer to the blaze.</p>
<p>On shore a house on fire at any hour draws a crowd. At sea, in
the bleak cold wastes of the water desert, even one other shipload
of sympathizers is too often wished for vainly. Wind, cold, and
breakdowns of machinery the sailor accepts with dull indifference;
shipwrecks, strandings, and disease he looks forward to as part of
an inevitable fate; but fire goes nearer to cowing him than all
other disasters put together; and the sight of his fellow-seamen
attacked by these same desolating flames arouses in him the warmest
of his sympathy, and the full of his resourcefulness. Moreover, in
Kettle's case, he had known the feel of a ship afire under his own
feet, and so he could appreciate all the better the agony of these
others.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, as the <i>Flamingo</i> made her way up wind
against the charging seas, a fear was beginning to grip the little
shipmaster by the heart that was deep enough to cause him a
physical nausea. The burning steamer ahead grew every minute more
clear as they raced toward her. She was on fire forward, and she
lay almost head-on toward them, keeping her stern to the seas, so
that the wind would have no help in driving the flames aft, and
making her more uninhabitable.</p>
<p>From a distance it had been hard to make out anything beyond
great stacks of yellow flame, topped by inky, oily smoke, which
drove in thick columns down the wind. As they drew nearer, and her
size became more apparent, some one guessed her as a big cargo
tramp from New Orleans with cotton that had overheated and fired,
and Kettle took comfort from the suggestion and tried to believe
that it might come true.</p>
<p>But as they closed with her, and came within earshot of her
syren, which was sending frightened useless blares across the
churning waters, there was no being blind to the true facts any
longer. This was no cargo boat, but a passenger liner; outward
bound, too, and populous. And as they came still nearer, they saw
her after-decks black and wriggling with people, and Kettle got a
glimpse of her structure and recognized the vessel herself.</p>
<p>"The <i>Grosser Carl</i>," he muttered, "out of Hamburg for New
York. Next to no first-class, and she cuts rates for third and gets
the bulk of the German emigrant traffic. She'll have six hundred on
her this minute, and a hundred of a crew. Call it seven hundred all
told, and there's hell waiting for them over yonder, and getting
worse every minute. Oh, great James! I wonder what's going to be
done. I couldn't pack seventy of them on the old <i>Flam</i> here,
if I filled her to bursting."</p>
<p>He clapped the binoculars to his eyes again, and stared
diligently round the rim of the night. If only he could catch a
glimpse of some other liner hurrying along her route, then these
people could be saved easily. He could drop his boats to take them
till the other passenger ship came up. But the wide sea was empty
of lights; the <i>Flamingo</i> and the <i>Grusser Carl</i> had the
stage severely to themselves; and between them they had the making
of an intolerable weight of destiny.</p>
<p>The second mate broke in upon his commander's brooding. "We
shall have a nice bill for Lloyds this journey."</p>
<p>Kettle made no answer. He continued staring moodily at the
spouting flames ahead. The second mate coughed. "Shall I be getting
derricks rigged and the hatch covers off?"</p>
<p>Kettle turned on him with a sudden fierceness. "Do you know
you're asking me to ruin myself?"</p>
<p>"But if we jettison cargo to make room for these poor beggars,
sir, the insurance will pay."</p>
<p>"Pay your grandmother. You've got a lot to learn, my lad, before
you're fit to take charge of a ship, if you don't know any more
than that about the responsibility of the cargo."</p>
<p>"By Jove! that's awkward. Birds would look pretty blue if the
bill was handed in to them."</p>
<p>"Birds!" said Kettle with contempt. "They aren't liable for
sixpence. Supposing you were travelling by train, and there was
some one else's portmanteau in the carriage, and you flung it out
of the window into a river, who do you suppose would have to stand
the racket?"</p>
<p>"Why, me. But then, sir, this is different."</p>
<p>"Not a bit. If we start in to jettison cargo, it means I'm a
ruined man. Every ton that goes over the side I'll have to pay
for."</p>
<p>"We can't leave those poor devils to frizzle," said the second
mate awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, of course we can't. They're a pack of unclean Dutchmen
we never saw before, and should think ourselves too good to brush
against if we met them in the street, but sentiment demands that we
stay and pull them out of their mess, and cold necessity leaves me
to foot the bill. You're young, and you're not married, my lad. I'm
neither. I've worked like a horse all my life, mostly with bad
luck. Lately luck's turned a bit. I've been able to make a trifle
more, and save a few pounds out of my billets. And here and there,
what with salvage and other things, I've come in the way of a plum.
One way and another I've got nearly enough put by at home this
minute to keep the missis and me and the girls to windward of the
workhouse, even if I lost this present job with Birds, and didn't
find another."</p>
<p>"Perhaps somebody else will pay for the cargo we have to put
over the side, sir."</p>
<p>"It's pretty thin comfort when you've got a 'perhaps' of that
size, and no other mortal stop between you and the workhouse. It's
all very well doing these things in hot blood; but the reckoning's
paid when you're cold, and they're cold, and with the Board of
Trade standing-by like the devil in the background all ready to
give you a kick when there's a spare place for a fresh foot." He
slammed down the handle of the bridge-telegraph, and rang off the
<i>Flamingo's</i> engines. He had been measuring distances all this
time with his eye.</p>
<p>"But, of course, there's no other choice about the matter.
There's the blessed cause of humanity to be looked after--humanity
to these blessed Dutch emigrants that their own country doesn't
want, and every other country would rather be without. Humanity to
my poor old missis and the kids doesn't count. I shall get a sludgy
paragraph in the papers for the <i>Grosser Carl</i>, headed
'Gallant Rescue,' with all the facts put upside down, and twelve
months later there'll be another paragraph about a 'case of pitiful
destitution.'"</p>
<p>"Oh, I say, sir, it won't be as bad as all that. Birds will see
you through."</p>
<p>"Birds will do a fat lot. Birds sent me to work up a connection
in the Mexican Gulf, and I've done it, and they've raised my screw
two pound a month after four years' service. I jettison the
customers' cargo, and probably sha'n't be able to pay for half of
it. Customers will get mad, and give their business to other lines
which don't run foul of blazing emigrant packets."</p>
<p>"Birds would never dare to fire you out for that."</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord, no! They'd say: 'We don't like the way you've taken
to wear your back hair, Captain. And, besides, we want younger
blood amongst our skippers. You'll find your check ready for you in
the outer office. Mind the step!'"</p>
<p>"I'm awfully sorry, Skipper. If there's anything I can do,
sir--"</p>
<p>Captain Kettle sighed, and looked drearily out at the blazing
ship and the tumbled waste of sea on which she floated. But he felt
that he had been showing weakness, and pulled himself together
again smartly. "Yes, there is, my lad. I'm a disappointed man, and
I've been talking a lot more than's dignified. You'll do me a real
kindness if you'll forget all that's been said. Away with you on to
the main deck, and get hatches off, and whip the top tier of that
cargo over the side as fast as you can make the winches travel. If
the old <i>Flamingo</i> is going to serve out free hospitality, by
James! she shall do it full weight. By James! I'd give the beggars
champagne and spring mattresses if I'd got 'em."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those on the German emigrant steamer had seen the
coming of the shabby little English trader with bumping hearts.
Till then the crew, with (so to speak) their backs up against a
wall, had fought the fire with diligence; but when the nearness of
a potential rescuer was reported, they discovered for themselves at
once that the fire was beyond control. They were joined by the
stokehold gangs, and they made at once for the boats, overpowering
any officer who happened to come between them and their desires.
The limp, tottery, half-fed, wholly seasick emigrants they easily
shoved aside, and these in their turn by sheer mass thrust back the
small handful of first-class passengers, and away screamed out the
davit tackles, as the boats were lowered full of madly frightened
deck hands and grimy handlers of coal.</p>
<p>Panic had sapped every trace of their manhood. They had concern
only for their own skins; for the miserables remaining on the
<i>Grosser Carl</i> they had none. And if for a minute any of them
permitted himself to think, he decided that in the Herr Gott's good
time the English would send boats and fetch them off. The English
had always a special gusto for this meddling rescue work.</p>
<p>However, it is easy to decide on lowering boats, but not always
so easy to carry it into safe fact if you are mad with scare, and
there is no one whom you will listen to to give the necessary
simple orders. And, as a consequence, one boat, chiefly manned by
the coal interest, swamped alongside before it could be shoved
clear; the forward davit fall of another jammed, and let it dangle
vertically up and down when the after fall overhauled; and only one
boat got away clear.</p>
<p>The reception which this small cargo of worthies met with
surprised them. They pulled with terrified haste to the
<i>Flamingo</i>, got under her lee, and clung desperately to the
line which was thrown to them. But to the rail above them came the
man who expected to be ruined by this night's work, and the pearls
of speech which fell from his lips went home through even their
thick hides.</p>
<p>Captain Kettle, being human, had greatly needed some one during
the last half-hour to ease his feelings on--though he was not the
man to own up to such a weakness, even to himself--and the boat
came neatly to supply his want. It was long enough since he had
found occasion for such an outburst, but the perfection of his
early training stood him in good stead then. Every biting insult in
his vocabulary, every lashing word that is used upon the seas,
every gibe, national, personal, or professional, that a lifetime of
hard language could teach, he poured out on that shivering boat's
crew then.</p>
<p>They were Germans certainly, but being an English shipmaster, he
had, of course, many a time sailed with a forecastle filled with
their nationality, and had acquired the special art of adapting his
abuse to the "Dutchman's" sensibilities, even as he had other
harangues suited for Coolie or Dago mariners, or even for that rare
sea-bird, the English sailorman. And as a final wind-up, after
having made them writhe sufficiently, he ordered them to go back
whence they came, and take a share in rescuing their fellows.</p>
<p>"Bud we shall trown," shouted back one speaker from the wildly
jumping boat.</p>
<p>"Then drown, and be hanged to you," shouted Kettle. "I'm sure I
don't care if you do. But I'm not going to have cowards like you
dirtying my deck-planks." He cast off the line to which their boat
rode under the steamer's heaving side. "You go and do your whack at
getting the people off that packet, or, so help me James! none of
you shall ever see your happy Dutchland again."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, so the irony of the fates ordered it, the two mates,
each in charge of one of the <i>Flamingo's</i> lifeboats, were
commanding crews made up entirely of Germans and Scandinavians, and
pluckier and more careful sailormen could not have been wished for.
The work was dangerous, and required more than ordinary nerve and
endurance and skill. A heavy sea ran, and from its crests a
spindrift blew which cut the face like whips, and numbed all parts
of the body with its chill. The boats were tossed about like
playthings, and required constant bailing to keep them from being
waterlogged. But Kettle had brought the <i>Flamingo</i> to windward
of the <i>Grosser Carl</i>, and each boat carried a line, so that
the steam winches could help her with the return trips.</p>
<p>Getting a cargo was, however, the chief difficulty. All attempt
at killing the fire was given up by this time. All vestige of order
was swamped in unutterable panic. The people on board had given
themselves up to wild, uncontrollable anarchy. If a boat had been
brought alongside, they would have tumbled into her like sheep,
till their numbers swamped her. They cursed the flames, cursed the
sea, cursed their own brothers and sisters who jostled them. They
were the sweepings from half-fed middle Europe, born with raw
nerves; and under the sudden stress of danger, and the absence of
some strong man to thrust discipline on them, they became
practically maniacs. They were beyond speech, many of them. They
yammered at the boats which came to their relief, with noises like
those of scared beasts.</p>
<p>Now the <i>Flamingo's</i> boats were officered by two cool,
profane mates, who had no nerves themselves, and did not see the
use of nerves in other people. Neither of them spoke German, but
(after the style of their island) presuming that some of those who
listened would understand English, they made proclamation in their
own tongue to the effect that the women were to be taken off
first.</p>
<p>"Kids with them," added the second mate.</p>
<p>"And if any of you rats of men shove your way down here," said
the chief mate, "before all the skirt is ferried across, you'll get
knocked on the head, that's all. Savvy that belaying-pin I got in
my fist? Now then, get some bowlines, and sway out the ladies."</p>
<p>As well might the order have been addressed to a flock of sheep.
They heard what was said in an agonized silence. Then each poor
soul there stretched out his arms or hers, and clamored to be
saved--and--never mind the rest. And meanwhile the flames bit
deeper and deeper into the fabric of the steamer, and the breath of
them grew more searching, as the roaring gale blew them into
strength.</p>
<p>"You ruddy Dutchmen," shouted the second mate. "It would serve
you blooming well right if you were left to be frizzled up into one
big sausage stew together. However, we'll see if kindness can't
tame you a bit yet." He waited till the swirl of a sea swung his
boat under one of the dangling davit falls, and caught hold of it,
and climbed nimbly on board. Then he proceeded to clear a space by
the primitive method of crashing his fist into every face within
reach.</p>
<p>"Now then," he shouted, "if there are any sailormen here worth
their salt, let them come and help. Am I to break up the whole of
this ship's company by myself?"</p>
<p>Gradually, by ones and twos, the <i>Grosser Carl's</i> remaining
officers and deck hands came shamefacedly toward this new nucleus
of authority and order, and then the real work began. The
emigrants, with sea sights and sea usage new to them, were still
full of the unreasoning panic of cattle, and like cattle they were
herded and handled, and their women and young cut out from the
general mob. These last were got into the swaying, dancing boats as
tenderly as might be, and the men were bidden to watch, and wait
their turn. When they grew restive, as the scorching fire drew more
near, they were beaten savagely; the <i>Grosser Carl's</i> crew,
with the shame of their own panic still raw on them, knew no mercy;
and the second mate of the <i>Flamingo</i>, who stood against a
davit, insulted them all with impartial cheerfulness. He was a very
apt pupil, this young man, of that master of ruling men at the
expense of their feelings, Captain Owen Kettle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the two lifeboats took one risky journey after
another, being drawn up to their own ship by a chattering winch,
discharging their draggled freight with dexterity and little
ceremony, and then laboring back under oars for another. The light
of the burning steamer turned a great sphere of night into day, and
the heat from her made the sweat pour down the faces of the toiling
men, though the gale still roared, and the icy spindrift still
whipped and stung. On the <i>Flamingo</i>, Captain Kettle cast into
the sea with a free hand what represented the savings of a
lifetime, provision for his wife and children, and an old-age
pension for himself.</p>
<p>The <i>Grosser Carl</i> had carried thirty first-class
passengers, and these were crammed into the <i>Flamingo's</i>
slender cabin accommodation, filling it to overflowing. The
emigrants--Austrians, Bohemians, wild Poles, filthy, crawling
Russian Jews, bestial Armenians, human <i>debris</i> which even
soldier-coveting Middle Europe rejected--these were herded down
into the holds, as rich cargo was dug out by the straining winches,
and given to the thankless sea to make space for them.</p>
<p>"Kindly walk up," said Kettle, with bitter hospitality, as fresh
flocks of them were heaved up over the bulwarks. "Don't hesitate to
grumble if the accommodation isn't exactly to your liking. We're
most pleased to strike out cargo to provide you with an elegant
parlor, and what's left I'm sure you'll be able to sit on and
spoil. Oh, you filthy, long-haired cattle! Did none of you ever
wash?"</p>
<p>Fiercely the <i>Grosser Carl</i> burned to the fanning of the
gale, and like furies worked the men in the boats. The <i>Grosser
Carl's</i> own boat joined the other two, once the ferrying was
well under way. She had hung alongside after Kettle cast off her
line, with her people madly clamoring to be taken on board; but as
all they received for their pains was abuse and coal-lumps--mostly,
by the way, from their own fellow-countrymen, who made up the
majority of the <i>Flamingo's</i> crew--they were presently driven
to help in the salving work through sheer scare at being left
behind to drown unless they carried out the fierce little English
Captain's orders.</p>
<p>The <i>Flamingo's</i> chief mate oversaw the dangerous ferrying,
and though every soul that was transshipped might be said to have
had ten narrow escapes in transit over that piece of tossing water,
luck and good seamanship carried the day, and none was lost. And on
the <i>Grosser Carl</i> the second mate, a stronger man, brazenly
took entire command, and commended to the nether gods all who
suggested ousting him from that position. "I don't care a red what
your official post was on this ship before I came," said the second
mate to several indignant officers. "You should have held on to it
when you had it. I've never been a skipper before, but I'm skipper
here now by sheer right of conquest, and I'm going to stay on at
that till the blooming old ship's burnt out. If you bother me, I'll
knock your silly nose into your watch-pocket. Turn-to there and
pass down another batch of those squalling passengers into the
boats. Don't you spill any of them overboard either, or, by the Big
Mischief, I'll just step down and teach you handiness."</p>
<p>The second mate was almost fainting with the heat before he left
the <i>Grosser Carl</i>, but he insisted on being the last man on
board, and then guyed the whole performance with caustic gayety
when he was dragged out of the water, into which he had been forced
to jump, and was set to drain on the floor gratings of a boat.</p>
<p>The <i>Grosser Carl</i> had fallen away before the wind, and was
spouting flame from stem-head to poop-staff by the time the last of
the rescuers and the rescued were put on the <i>Flamingo's</i>
deck, and on that travel-worn steamboat were some six hundred and
fifty visitors that somehow or other had to be provided for.</p>
<p>The detail of famine now became of next importance. They were
still five days' steam away from port, and their official provision
supply was only calculated to last the <i>Flamingos</i> themselves
for a little over that time. Things are cut pretty fine in these
days of steam voyages to scheduled time. So there was no
sentimental waiting to see the <i>Grosser Carl</i> finally burn out
and sink. The boats were cast adrift, as the crews were too
exhausted to hoist them in, and the <i>Flamingo's</i> nose was
turned toward Liverpool. Pratt, the chief engineer, figured out to
half a ton what coal he had remaining, and set the pace so as to
run in with empty bunkers. They were cool now, all hands, from the
excitement of the burning ship, and the objectionable prospect of
semi-starvation made them regard their visitors less than ever in
the light of men and brothers.</p>
<p>But, as it chanced, toward the evening of next day, a hurrying
ocean greyhound overtook them in her race from New York toward the
East, and the bunting talked out long sentences in the commercial
code from the wire span between the <i>Flamingo's</i> masts. Fresh
quartettes of flags flicked up on both steamers, were acknowledged,
and were replaced by others; and when the liner drew up alongside,
and stopped with reversed propellers, she had a loaded boat ready
swung out in davits, which dropped in the water the moment she had
lost her way. The bunting had told the pith of the tale.</p>
<p>When the two steamers' bridges were level, the liner's captain
touched his cap, and a crowd of well-dressed passengers below him
listened wonderingly. "Afternoon, Captain. Got 'em all?"</p>
<p>"Afternoon, Captain. Oh, we didn't lose any. But a few drowned
their silly selves before we started to shepherd them."</p>
<p>"What ship was it? The French boat would be hardly due yet."</p>
<p>"No, the old <i>Grosser Carl</i>. She was astern of her time.
Much obliged to you for the grub, Captain. We'd have been pretty
hard pushed if we hadn't met you. I'm sending you a payment order.
Sorry for spoiling your passage."</p>
<p>The liner captain looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"Can't be helped. It's in a good cause, I suppose, though the
mischief of it is we were trying to pull down the record by an hour
or so. The boat, there! Are you going to be all night with that bit
of stuff?"</p>
<p>The cases of food were transshipped with frantic haste, and the
boat returned. The greyhound leaped out into her stride again the
moment she had hooked on, and shot ahead, dipping a smart blue
ensign in salute. The <i>Flamingo</i> dipped a dirty red ensign and
followed, and, before dark fell, once more had the ocean to
herself.</p>
<p>The voyage home was not one of oppressive gayety. The
first-class passengers, who were crammed into the narrow cabin
found the quarters uncomfortable, and the little shipmaster's
manner repellent. Urged by the precedent in such matters, they
"made a purse" for him, and a presentation address. But as they
merely collected some thirty-one pounds in paper promises, which,
so far, have never been paid, their gratitude may be said to have
had its economical side.</p>
<p>To the riffraff in the hold, for whose accommodation a poor
man's fortune had been jettisoned, the thing "gratitude" was an
unknown emotion. They plotted mischief amongst themselves, stole
when the opportunity came to them, were unspeakably foul in their
habits, and, when they gave the matter any consideration at all,
decided that this fierce little captain with the red torpedo beard
had taken them on board merely to fulfil some selfish purpose of
his own. To the theorist who has sampled them only from a distance,
these off-scourings of Middle Europe are downtrodden people with
souls; to those who happen to know them personally, all their
qualities seem to be conspicuously negative.</p>
<p>The <i>Flamingo</i> picked up the landmarks of the Southern
Irish coast, and made her number to Lloyd's station on Brow Head,
stood across for the Tuskar, and so on up St. George's Channel for
Holyhead. She flew a pilot jack there, and off Point Lynus picked
up a pilot, who, after the custom of his class, stepped up over the
side with a hard felt hat on his head, and a complete wardrobe, and
a selection of daily papers in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Well, pilot, what's the news?" said Kettle, as the man of
narrow waters swung himself up on to the bridge, and his boat
swirled away astern.</p>
<p>"You are," said the pilot. "The papers are just full of you,
Captain, all of them, from the <i>Shipping Telegraph</i> to the
London <i>Times</i>. The Cunard boat brought in the yarn. A pilot
out of my schooner took her up."</p>
<p>"How do they spell the name? Cuttle?"</p>
<p>"Well, I think it's 'Kattle' mostly, though one paper has it
'Kelly.'"</p>
<p>"Curse their cheek," said the little sailor, flushing. "I'd like
to get hold of some of those blowsy editors that come smelling
round the dock after yarns and drink, and wring their necks."</p>
<p>"Starboard a point," said the pilot, and when the quartermaster
at the wheel had duly repeated the course, he turned to Kettle with
some amusement. "Blowsy or not, they don't seem to have done you
much harm this journey, Captain. Why, they're getting up
subscriptions for you all round. Shouldn't wonder but what the
Board of Trade even stands you a pair of binoculars."</p>
<p>"I'm not a blessed mendicant," said Kettle stiffly, "and as for
the Board of Trade, they can stick their binoculars up their
trousers." He walked to the other end of the bridge, and stood
there chewing savagely at the butt end of his cigar.</p>
<p>"Rum bloke," commented the pilot to himself, though aloud he
offered no comment, being a man whose business it was to keep on
good terms with everybody. So he dropped his newspapers to one of
the mates, and applied himself to the details of the pilotage.</p>
<p>Still, the pilot was right in saying that England was ringing
with the news of Kettle's feat. The passengers of the Cunarder,
with nothing much else to interest them, had come home thrilled and
ringing with it. A smart New Yorker had got a "scoop" by slipping
ashore at Queenstown and cabling a lavish account to the American
Press Association, so that the first news reached London from the
States. Followed Reuter's man and the Liverpool reporters on
Prince's landing-stage, who came to glean copy as in the ordinary
course of events, and they being spurred on by wires from London
for full details, got down all the facts available, and imagined
others. Parliament was not sitting, and there had been no newspaper
sensation for a week, and, as a natural consequence, the papers
came out next morning with accounts of the rescue varying from two
columns to a page in length.</p>
<p>It is one of the most wonderful attributes of the modern Press
that it can, at any time between midnight and publishing hours,
collate and elaborate the biography of a man who hitherto has been
entirely obscure, and considering the speed of the work, and the
difficulties which hedge it in, these lightning life sketches are
often surprisingly full of accuracies. But let the frillings in
this case be fact or fiction, there was no doubt that Kettle and
his crew had saved a shipload of panic-stricken foreign emigrants,
and (to help point the moral) within the year, in an almost similar
case, another shipload had been drowned through that same blind,
helpless, hopeless panic. The pride of race bubbled through the
British Daily Press in prosaic long primer and double-leaded
bourgeois. There was no saying aloud, "We rejoice that an
Englishman has done this thing, after having it proved to us that
it was above the foreigner's strength." The newspaper man does not
rhapsodize. But the sentiment was there all the same, and it was
that which actuated the sudden wave of enthusiasm which thrilled
the country.</p>

<b>Strangers came up and wrung Kettle's unwilling hand.</b></p>
<br>
<p>The <i>Flamingo</i> was worked into dock, and a cheering crowd
surged aboard of her in unrestrainable thousands. Strangers came up
and wrung Kettle's unwilling hand, and dropped tears on his
coat-sleeve; and when he swore at them, they only wept the more and
smiled through the drops. It was magnificent, splendid, gorgeous.
Here was a man! Who said that England would ever lose her proud
place among the nations when she could still find men like Oliver
Kelly--or Kattle--or Cuttle, or whatever this man was called,
amongst her obscure merchant captains?</p>
<p>Even Mr. Isaac Bird, managing owner, caught some of the general
enthusiasm, and withheld, for the present, the unpleasant remarks
which occurred to him as suitable, touching Kettle's neglect of the
firm's interest in favor of a parcel of bankrupt foreigners. But
Kettle himself had the subject well in mind. When all this absurd
fuss was over, then would come the reckoning; and whilst the crowd
was cheering him, he was figuring out the value of the jettisoned
cargo, and whilst pompous Mr. Isaac was shaking him by the hand and
making a neat speech for the ear of casual reporters, poor Kettle
was conjuring up visions of the workhouse and pauper's
corduroy.</p>
<p>But the Fates were moving now in a manner which was beyond his
experience. The public, which had ignored his bare existence before
for all of a lifetime, suddenly discovered that he was a hero, and
that, too, without knowing half the facts. The Press, with its
finger on the public's pulse, published Kettle literature in lavish
columns. It gave twenty different "eye-witnesses' accounts" of the
rescue. It gave long lists of "previous similar disasters." It drew
long morals in leading articles. And finally, it took all the
little man's affairs under its consideration, and settled them with
a lordly hand.</p>
<p>"Who pays for the cargo Captain Kuttle threw overboard?" one
paper headed an article; whilst another wrote perfervidly about
"Cattle ruined for his bravery." Here was a new and striking side
issue. Lloyds' were not responsible. Should the week's hero pay the
bill himself out of his miserable savings? Certainly not. The
owners of the <i>Grosser Carl</i> were the benefiting parties, and
it was only just that they should take up the expense. So the
entire Press wired off to the German firm, and next morning were
able to publish a positive assurance that of course these grateful
foreigners would reimburse all possible outlay.</p>
<p>The subject of finance once broached, it was naturally
discovered that the hero toiled for a very meagre pittance, that he
was getting on in years, and had a wife and family depending on
him--and--promptly, there opened out the subscription lists. People
were stirred, and they gave nicely, on the lower scale certainly,
with shillings and guineas predominating; but the lists totalled up
to &pound;2,400, which to some people, of course, is gilded
affluence.</p>
<p>Now Captain Kettle had endured all this publicity with a good
deal of restiveness, and had used language to one or two
interviewers who managed to ferret him out, which fairly startled
them; but this last move for a public subscription made him
furious. He spoke in the captain's room of the hostelry he used, of
the degradation which was put on him, and various other master
mariners who were present entirely agreed with him. "I might be a
blessed missionary, or India-with-a-famine, the way they're
treating me," he complained bitterly. "If they call a meeting to
give me anything, I'll chuck the money in their faces, and let them
know straight what I think. By James! do they suppose I've got no
pride? Why can't they let me alone? If the <i>Grosser Carl</i>
people pay up for that cargo, that's all I want."</p>
<p>But the eternal healer, Time, soothed matters down wonderfully.
Captain Owen Kettle's week's outing in the daily papers ran its
course with due thrills and headlines, and then the Press forgot
him, and rushed on to the next sensation. By the time the
subscription list had closed and been brought together, the
<i>Flamingo</i> had sailed for her next slow round trip in the
Mexican Gulf, and when her captain returned to find a curt, formal
letter from a firm of bankers, stating that &pound;2,400 had been
placed to his credit in their establishment, he would have been
more than human if he had refused it. And, as a point of fact,
after consulting with Madam, his wife, he transformed it into
houses in that terrace of narrow dwellings in Birkenhead which
represented the rest of his savings.</p>
<p>Now on paper this house property was alleged by a sanguine agent
to produce at the rate of &pound;15 per annum apiece, and as there
were thirty-six houses, this made an income--on paper--of well over
&pound;500 a year, the which is a very nice possession.</p>
<p>A thing, moreover, which Captain Kettle had prophesied had come
to pass. The "trade connection" in the Mexican Gulf had been very
seriously damaged. As was somewhat natural, the commercial gentry
there did not relish having their valuable cargo pitched
unceremoniously to Neptune, and preferred to send what they had by
boats which did not contrive to meet burning emigrant liners. This,
of course, was quite unreasonable of them, but one can only relate
what happened.</p>
<p>And then the second part of the prophecy evolved itself
naturally. Messrs. Bird discovered from the last indent handed them
that more paint had been used over the <i>Flamingo's</i> fabric
than they thought consistent with economy, and so they relieved
Captain Kettle from the command, handed him their check for wages
due--there was no commission to be added for such an unsatisfactory
voyage as this last--and presented him gratis with their best
wishes for his future welfare.</p>
<p>Kettle had thought of telling the truth in print, but the
mysterious law of libel, which it is written that all mariners
shall dread and never understand, scared him; and besides, he was
still raw from his recent week's outing in the British Press. So he
just went and gave his views to Mr. Isaac Bird personally and
privately, threw the ink-bottle through the office window, pitched
the box of business cigars into the fire, and generally pointed his
remarks in a way that went straight to Mr. Bird's heart, and then
prepared peacefully to take his departure.</p>
<p>"I shall not prosecute you for this--" said Mr. Isaac.</p>
<p>"I wish you dare. It would suit me finely to get into a
police-court and be able to talk. I'd willingly pay my 'forty
shillings and' for the chance. They'd give me the option fast
enough."</p>
<p>"I say I shall not prosecute you because I have no time to
bother with law. But I shall send your name round amongst the
shipowners, and with my word against you, you'll never get another
command so long as the world stands."</p>
<p>"You knock-kneed little Jew," said Kettle truculently, "do you
think I'm giving myself the luxury of letting out at a shipowner,
after knuckling down to the breed through all of a weary life,
unless I knew my ground? I've done with ships and the sea for
always, and if you give me any more of your lip, I'll burn your
office down and you in it."</p>
<p>"You seem pleased enough with yourself about something," said
Mr. Isaac.</p>
<p>"I am," said Kettle exultantly. "I've chucked the sea for good.
I've taken a farm in Wharfedale, and I'm going to it this very
week."</p>
<p>"Then," said Mr. Isaac sardonically, "if you've taken a farm,
don't let me wish you any further ill. Good-morning."</p>
<p>But Kettle was not to be damped out of conceit with his life's
desire by a few ill-natured words. He gave Mr. Isaac Bird his final
blessing, commenting on his ancestors, his personal appearance, his
prospects of final salvation, and then pleasantly took his leave.
He was too much occupied in the preliminaries of his new life to
have much leisure just then for further cultivation of the gentle
art of insult.</p>
<p>The farm he had rented lay in the Wharfe Valley above Skipton,
and, though its acreage was large, a good deal was made up of mere
moorland sheep pasture. Luckily he recognized that a poetical taste
for a rural life might not necessarily imply the whole mystery of
stock rearing and agriculture, and so he hired a capable foreman as
philosopher and guide. And here I may say that his hobby by no
means ruined him, as might reasonably be expected; for in the worst
years he never dropped more than fifty or sixty pounds, and
frequently he ran the place without loss, or even at a profit.</p>
<p>But though it is hard to confess that a man's ideal comes short
of his expectations when put to the trial, I am free to confess
that although he enjoyed it all, Kettle was not at his happiest
when he was attending his crops or his sheep, or haggling with his
fellow farmers on Mondays over fat beasts in Skipton market.</p>
<p>He had gone back to one of his more practiced tastes--if one
calls it a taste--the cultivation of religion. The farm stood bleak
and lonely on the slope of a hillside, and on both flanks of the
dale were other lonely farms as far as the eye could see. There was
no village. The nearest place of worship was four miles away, and
that was merely a church. But in the valley beside the Wharfe was a
small gray stone chapel, reared during some bygone day for the
devotions of some forgotten sect. Kettle got this into his
control.</p>
<p>He was by no means a rich man. The row of houses in Birkenhead
were for the most part tenanted by the wives of mercantile marine
engineers and officers, who were chronically laggard with their
rent, and whom <i>esprit de corps</i> forbade him to press; and so,
what with this deficit, and repairs and taxes, and one thing and
another, it was rarely that half the projected &pound;500 a year
found its way into his banking account. But a tithe of whatever
accrued to him was scrupulously set aside for the maintenance of
the chapel.</p>
<p>He imported there the grim, narrow creed he had learned in South
Shields, and threw open the door for congregations. He was entirely
in earnest over it all, and vastly serious. Failing another
minister, he himself took the services, and though, on occasion,
some other brother was induced to preach, it was he himself who
usually mounted the pulpit beneath the sounding-board. He purchased
an American organ, and sent his eldest daughter weekly to take
lessons in Skipton till she could play it. And Mrs. Kettle herself
led the singing.</p>
<p>Still further, the chapel has its own collection of hymns,
specially written, printed and dedicated to its service. The book
is Captain Kettle's first published effort. Heaven and its author
alone know under what wild circumstances most of those hymns were
written.</p>
<p>The chapel started its new span of life with a congregation
meagre enough, but Sunday by Sunday the number grew. They are
mostly Nonconformists in the dales, and when once a man acquires a
taste for dissent, he takes a sad delight in sampling his
neighbors' variations of creed. Some came once and were not seen
again. Others came and returned. They felt that this was the
loneliest of all modern creeds; indeed, Kettle preached as much,
and one can take a melancholy pride in splendid isolation.</p>
<p>I am not sure that Captain Kettle does not find the restfulness
of his present life a trifle too accentuated at times, though this
is only inevitable for one who has been so much a man of action.
But at any rate he never makes complaint. He is a strong man, and
he governs himself even as he governs his family and the chapel
circle, with a strong, just hand. The farm is a model of neatness
and order; paint is lavished in a way that makes dalesmen lift
their eyebrows; and the routine of the household is as strict as
that of a ship.</p>
<p>The house is unique, too, in Wharfedale for the variety of its
contents. Desperately poor though Kettle might be on many of his
returns from his unsuccessful ventures, he never came back to his
wife without some present from a foreign clime as a tangible proof
of his remembrance, and because these were usually mere
curiosities, without intrinsic value, they often evaded the
pawn-shop in those years of dire distress, when more negotiable
articles passed irretrievably away from the family possession. And
with them too, in stiff, decorous frames, are those certificates
and testimonials which a master mariner always collects, together
with photographs of gratuitously small general interest.</p>
<p>But one might turn the house upside down without finding so
carnal an instrument as a revolver, and when I suggested to Kettle
once that we might go outside and have a little pistol practice, he
glared at me, and I thought he would have sworn. However, he let me
know stiffly enough that whatever circumstances might have made him
at sea, he had always been a very different man ashore in England,
and there the matter dropped.</p>
<p>But speaking of mementoes, there is one link with the past that
Mrs. Kettle, poor woman, never ceases to regret the loss of. "Such
a beautiful gold watch," she says it was too, "with the Emperor's
and the Captain's names engraved together on the back, and just a
nice mention of the <i>Gross of Carl</i>." As it happened, I saw
the letter with which it was returned. It ran like this:--</p>
<blockquote><br>
<i>To His Majesty the German Emperor,<br>
Berlin, Germany<br>
<br>
S.S. "Flamingo,"<br>
Liverpool</i>,</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote><br>

<br>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://gutenberg.net/etext06/">http://gutenberg.net/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
