<p class="indent">In dire dis-tress de-mand-ing aid;</p>
<p>Her pre-cious ball is up a tree,</p>
<p class="indent">And ev-ery boy shrinks back a-fraid.</p>
<br>

<p>It hangs a-loft, a shin-ing thing,</p>
<p class="indent">Caught by the ve-ry top-most spray,</p>
<p>Where slen-der branch-es ta-per-ing</p>
<p class="indent">'Neath the light bur-den move and sway.</p>
<br>

<p>Hur-rah! he comes whom all ad-mire,</p>
<p class="indent">Whose nim-ble legs, and lis-som back,</p>
<p>And read-y pluck, that naught can tire,</p>
<p class="indent">Win him the name of "Mon-key Jack."</p>
<br>

<p>See how he leaps from bough to bough</p>
<p class="indent">To gain that most be-lov'd of balls!</p>
<p>His out-stretch'd hand has caught it now;</p>
<p class="indent">The branch gives way&mdash;the he-ro falls!</p>
<br>

<p>The fright-en'd chil-dren ut-ter cries,</p>
<p class="indent">But e-ven yet he does his best;</p>
<p>His vic-tor hand re-tains the prize,</p>
<p class="indent">And clasps it to his faith-ful breast.</p>
<br>

<p>Laid on his bed, com-pos'd, though sad,</p>
<p class="indent">With bro-ken leg and in-jured back,</p>
<p>We find a lit-tle pa-tient lad,</p>
<p class="indent">A-las, no long-er "Mon-key Jack!"</p>

<p>Placed at the win-dow, day by day,</p>

<p>Rain, rain, rain! How it did rain! The great drops ran down the glass in

<p>"Why do you not go up to the gar-ret, and play?" asked their mam-ma.</p>

<p>That struck them as a fine plan; and off they trooped, pound-ing up
the bare stairs with their nois-y feet. They found three old brooms,
and be-gan to play soldier,&mdash;Tom first, then Jack, with Meg last of
all. The gar-ret was ver-y large; and their mam-ma could hear them
as they tramped a-long, and could hear Tom's com-mand to right a-bout
face when they had reached the farth-er end.</p>

<p>By and by they tired of play-ing sol-dier; and then they pulled down
some old dress-es and hats that hung on a peg, and put them on, and
made be-lieve that they were grown peo-ple. Then, out of an old box,
they dragged a scrap-book full of pic-tures, and sat them down to
look them o-ver.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bell," said Car-rie; "and then per-haps we can have a romp in
the hay-field. You will have to hur-ry, for the men are cart-ing it
in-to the barn."</p>

<p>Thus urged, Bell made a fresh ef-fort; and soon the les-son was learned
and re-cit-ed.</p>

<p>Off scam-pered the two girls to the hay-field. Soon Miss Gray fol-lowed,
but there was noth-ing to be seen of them. She looked all a-bout, and at
last walked up to the man who was load-ing the hay on the cart.</p>

She looked back, and there were the laugh-ing fa-ces of Bell and Car-rie.
They had been on the cart, all hid-den un-der the hay in or-der to play
a lit-tle joke on Miss Gray. Then they scram-bled down, and came run-ning
to her.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man; "but she is get-ting bet-ter now."</p>

<p>"We'll ask mam-ma to take us to see her," said Bell.</p>

<p>The ver-y next day their mam-ma did take them. They found Ruth sit-ting
pil-lowed up in a chair, ver-y pale and white. Bell had picked her a
bunch of flow-ers, which she seemed ver-y glad to get; and the three
girls soon be-came good friends. Car-ree found a lit-tle gray kitten
with which she played.</p>

<p>The vis-it seemed to do Ruth a great deal of good; for a pink flush came
in her cheeks, and she e-ven laughed, which her moth-er said she had not
done before for weeks.</p>

<p>They came a-gain the ver-y next day. Miss Gray was with them, and car-ried
a bas-ket on her arm in which were some dain-ties to tempt the sick girl's
ap-pe-tite. She was glad to see them, and told them they should have the
kit-ten for their ver-y own. So pus-sy went back in the bas-ket which had
brought the dain-ties.</p>

<p>Near-ly ev-er-y day af-ter this the chil-dren went to see Ruth, for at
least a week. By that time she was well e-nough to be out, and some-times
came to see them.</p>

<p>The merry boats of Brixham</p>

<p>A staunch and sturdy fleet are they,</p>
<p>Who love a swinging breeze;</p>
<p>And before the woods of Devon,</p>
<p>And the silver cliffs of Wales,</p>
<p>You may see, when summers evenings fall,</p>
<p>The light upon their sails.</p>
<br>

<p>But when the year grows darker,</p>
<p>And gray winds hunt the foam,</p>
<p>They go back to Little Brixham,</p>
<p>And ply their toil at home.</p>
<p>And thus it chanced one winter's night,</p>
<p>When a storm began to roar,</p>
<p>That all the men were out at sea,</p>
<p>And all the wives on shore.</p>
<br>

<p>Then as the wind grew fiercer,</p>
<p>The women's cheeks grew white,</p>
<p>It was fiercer in the twilight.</p>
<p>And fiercest in the night.</p>
<p>The strong clouds set themselves like ice,</p>
<p>Without a star to melt,</p>
<p>The blackness of the darkness</p>
<p>Was darkness to be felt.</p>
<br>

<p>The storm like an assassin</p>
<p>Went on its wicked way,</p>
<p>And struck a hundred boats adrift,</p>
<p>To reel about the bay.</p>
<p>They meet, they crash&mdash;God keep the men!</p>
<p>God give a moment's light!</p>
<p>There is nothing but the tumult,</p>
<p>And the tempest and the night.</p>
<br>

<p>The men on shore were anxious,</p>
<p>They dreaded what they knew;</p>
<p>What do you think the women did?</p>
<p>Love taught them what to do!</p>
<p>Out spake a wife, "We've beds at home,</p>
<p>We'll burn them for a light:</p>
<p>Give us the men and the bare ground!</p>
<p>We want no more to-night."</p>

<p>And knew not all the while</p>
<p>If they were heaping a bonfire,</p>
<p>Or only a funeral pile.</p>
<br>

<p>And fed with precious food, the flame</p>
<p>Shone bravely on the black,</p>
<p>Till a cry rang through the people,</p>
<p>"A boat is coming back!"</p>
<p>Staggering dimly through the fog,</p>
<p>Come shapes of fear and doubt,</p>
<p>But when the first prow strikes the pier,</p>
<p>Cannot you hear them shout?</p>
<br>

<p>Then all along the breadth of flame</p>
<p>Dark figures shrieked and ran,</p>
<p>With "Child, here comes your father!"</p>
<p>Or, "Wife, is this your man?"</p>
<p>And faint feet touch the welcome stone,</p>
<p>And wait a little while;</p>
<p>And kisses drop from frozen lips,</p>
<p>Too tired to speak or smile.</p>
<br>

<p>So, one by one they struggled in,</p>
<p>All that the sea would spare;</p>
<p>We will not reckon through our tears</p>
<p>The names that were not there;</p>
<p>But some went home without a bed,</p>
<p>When all the tale was told,</p>

<p>To know the night was cold.</p>

sum-mer. Both were fond of pets and both played so much with A-grip-pa
that he grew rath-er la-zy and did not try to catch ma-ny mice.</p>

<p>Ned and Lau-ra were ver-y good friends, but it happened now and then that
both want-ed the same thing and then, sad to say, some loud words might
be heard. Ned would say, "Give me Grip-pa," and Lau-ra would an-swer,
"You shan't have Grip-pa!" and Ned would say a-gain, "I will have Grip-pa,"
and so it would go on till some-times poor Grip-pa would run a-way. But
they al-ways made up and were friends a-gain.</p>

<p>Grip-pa grew up a large, fine cat, and lived some years. But he was at
length taken ill. He came no more to the house, but stayed in the barn
and grew ver-y weak, till he could hard-ly walk. At last, one day he
came walk-ing fee-bly to the house. He went in-to the kitch-en, then
to the pan-try, then to the din-ing room. In-to all the rooms went
Grip-pa, and in each room sat down and looked a-round, as if tak-ing
a last fare-well; then slow-ly walked out of doors. It was in-deed his
last vis-it. Next morn-ing poor Grip-pa was found dead.</p>

<br>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>Frank More had been out skat-ing near-ly the whole af-ter-noon, for there
was no school this week, and the ice was in fine or-der. It was al-most
dark, and he was go-ing home, skates in hand, when a poor boy a-bout as
large as him-self came up and be-gan to beg from him.</p>

<p>"Go home with me," said Frank, "and you shall have some sup-per."</p>

<p>The boy went glad-ly, and on the way Frank asked him ma-ny ques-tions.
When they ar-rived, Frank took him to the kitch-en, where Jane the cook
gave him a warm seat and plen-ty of sup-per, for his thin face made her
feel sor-ry.</p>
</div>

<div class="img">
<img width="400" height="497" src="images/mjaos22.png" id="mjaos22.png"
 title="Frank's Boy"
 alt="Warm kitchen with a tattered young man being looked after by two adults and another young man.">
<br>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>When Frank had seen him com-fort-a-bly set-tled, he went up stairs to
tell his fa-ther and moth-er a-bout the lad.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, fa-ther," he said, "that grand-pa would like such a
boy? He says he will be glad to work, and if moth-er will let me give
him my old suit, I can take him to see grand-pa in the morning."</p>

<p>"Well, Frank, you may try," said his fa-ther. So poor Sam had a good
bed to sleep in that night, and next morn-ing the two boys went to see
a-bout work for him. Dressed in the warm clothes Frank's moth-er gave
him, he looked like quite a dif-fer-ent boy, and was ve-ry grate-ful
for her kind-ness.</p>

<p>It was soon set-tled that Sam should live at old Mr. More's. He had a
good ma-ny things to do: to help take care of the chick-ens, the sheep
and lambs, the cows and horses; and be-sides all this, he went to school,
and with all the other boys, had great fun at coast-ing and skat-ing when
school was out. But he worked as well as he played, and proved so trust-y,
that grand-ma said: "Frank's boy was a boy worth hav-ing."</p>

<p>So Sam found a good home and Frank had the pleas-ure of know-ing that he
had helped one boy to be both use-ful and hap-py.</p>

<p class="chapter-head">JOEY'S EXPLOIT</p>

<div class="text">
<p>Jo-ey Hart was a boy who was sent by his fath-er to spend the sum-mer
with an un-cle in the coun-try. Jo-ey had been ill, and the doc-tor
said that there was noth-ing like coun-try air to make him well a-gain.</p>

<p>So he set off one bright morn-ing, and be-fore night was safe at his
un-cle's farm. His pa-pa had thought that Jo-ey might go to school
dur-ing the sum-mer, but when the doc-tor heard of it he said no.
"Let the boy run wild for three months. He will learn twice as fast
next win-ter."</p>

<p>He was wild with joy when he was at last at his un-cle's. He was so
hun-gry, and the bread and but-ter and milk tast-ed so nice-ly, that
he thought he should nev-er have e-nough. Each day he was up with the
sun, and by night had played so hard that al-most be-fore it was dark
he was read-y to go to bed.</p>

<p>It was great fun to watch the men in the fields at work. Some-times his
un-cle let him ride the mow-ing ma-chine, and at such times he was ve-ry
proud. Then it was ve-ry ex-cit-ing to ride on the top of a great sway-ing
load of hay, right in on to the barn floor.</p>

<p>La-ter on, when the hay was all gath-ered, the wheat be-gan to rip-en,
and the men were bu-sy cut-ting it and gath-er-ing it in-to sheaves. The
birds act-ed as if they thought it was cut for them on-ly, for they came
in such swarms that it looked as if they would eat it all and leave none
for the farm-er.</p>
<br>

<img width="400" height="536" src="images/mjaos23.png" id="mjaos23.png"
 title="Joey's Exploit"
 alt="Hundreds of birds decending on a havested field.">
<br>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>Some-times his aunt would ask him to take their lunch-eon to the men
at work in the fields, for dur-ing hay-ing and har-vest when the work
is heav-i-est the men al-ways have a lunch at ten in the morn-ing.</p>

<p>Now on one day when Jo-ey took his bas-ket and left the house for the
fields, he got him-self in-to trou-ble, and this was the way. Close by
his un-cle's house on the main street lived a gen-tle-man who had a
fine gar-den. All a-round it was a high fence and a no-tice was post-ed
up, "Tres-pas-sers will be pros-e-cu-ted." That no-tice was be-cause
the school house was not far a-way, and the boys some-times helped
them-selves to the old gen-tle-man's ap-ples.</p>

<p>Jo-ey had to pass di-rect-ly by the gar-den wall, and it so hap-pened
that his bas-ket was heav-y and he set it down to rest.</p>

<p>What took place you can see in the pic-ture on the next page bet-ter
than I can tell you. Jo-ey got the ap-ples but a bad fall, and when
he went to get up he found that he could not stand and that one an-kle
hurt him se-vere-ly.</p>

<p>How long he would have staid there I can not tell, had not the men in
the field grown hun-gry and sent one of their num-ber to see what had
be-come of their lunch.</p>

<p>The mes-sen-ger found Jo-ey, and picked him up and car-ried him home.
Then, com-ing back, he took the bas-ket and all the ap-ples that lay
a-bout, and went back to the field and the men ate them all for lunch-eon.</p>

<p>And so Jo-ey not on-ly got no ap-ples but had to lie in bed for a week
be-fore his an-kle got well e-nough for him to run a-bout a-gain.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
