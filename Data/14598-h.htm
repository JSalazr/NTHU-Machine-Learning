<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I" />CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>SOME IN RAGS</h3>


<p><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1" />An old man, clothed in picturesque patches
and tatters, paused and leaned on his stout
oak staff. He was tired. He drew off his
rusty felt hat, swept a sleeve across his forehead,
and sighed. He had walked many miles that day,
and even now the journey's end, near as it really
was, seemed far away. Ah, but he would sleep
soundly that night, whether the bed were of
earth or of straw. His peasant garb rather enhanced
his fine head. His eyes were blue and
clear and far-seeing, the eyes of a hunter or a
woodsman, of a man who watches the shadows in
the forest at night or the dim, wavering lines on
the horizon at daytime; things near or far or
roundabout. His brow was high, his nose large
and bridged; a face of more angles than con<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" />tours,
bristling with gray spikes, like one who
has gone unshaven several days. His hands,
folded over the round, polished knuckle of his
staff, were tanned and soiled, but they were long
and slender, and the callouses were pink, a certain
indication that they were fresh.</p>

<p>The afternoon glow of the September sun
burned along the dusty white highway. From
where he stood the road trailed off miles behind
and wound up five hundred feet or more above
him to the ancient city of Dreiberg. It was not
a steep road, but a long and weary one, a steady,
enervating, unbroken climb. To the left the
mighty cliff reared its granite side to the hanging
city, broke in a wide plain, and then went on
up several thousand feet to the ledges of dragon-green
ice and snow. To the right sparkled and
flashed a wild mountain stream on its way to the
broad, fertile valley, which, mistily green and
brown and yellow with vineyards and hops and
corn, spread out and on to the north, stopping
abruptly at the base of the more formidable chain
of mountains.</p>

<p>Across this lofty jumble of barren rock and
glacial cleft, now purpling and darkening as the
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" />sun mellowed in its decline, lay the kingdom of
Jugendheit; and toward this the wayfarer gazed
meditatively, absorbing little or nothing of the
exquisite panorama. By and by his gaze wavered,
and that particular patch in the valley,
brown from the beating of many iron-shod
horses, caught and chained his interest for a
space. It was the military field, and it glittered
and scintillated as squadron after squadron of
cavalry dashed from side to side or wheeled in
bewildering circles.</p>

<p>&quot;The philosophy of war is to prepare for it,&quot;
mused the old man, with a jerk of his shoulders.
&quot;France! So the mutter runs. There is a Napoleon
in France, but no Bonaparte. Clatter-clatter!
Bang-bang!&quot; He laughed ironically
and cautiously glanced at his watch, an article
which must have cost him many and many a
potato-patch. He pulled his hat over his eyes,
scratched the irritating stubble on his chin, and
stepped forward.</p>

<p>He had followed yonder goose-girl ever since
the incline began. Oft the little wooden shoes
had lagged, but here they were, still a hundred
yards or more ahead of him. He had never been
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" />close enough to distinguish her features. The
galloping of soldiers up and down the road from
time to time disturbed her flock, but she was evidently
a patient soul, and relied valiantly upon
her stick of willow. Once or twice he had been inclined
to hasten his steps, to join her, to talk, to
hear the grateful sound of his own voice, which
he had not heard since he passed the frontier customs;
yet each time he had subdued the desire
and continued to lessen none of the distance between
them.</p>

<p>The little goose-girl was indeed tired, and the
little wooden shoes grew heavier and heavier, and
the little bare feet ached dully; but her heart
was light and her mind sweet with happiness.
Day after day she had tended the geese in the
valley and trudged back at evening alone, all
told a matter of twelve miles; and now she was
bringing them into the city to sell in the market
on the morrow. After that she would have little
to do save an hour or two at night in a tavern
called the Black Eagle, where she waited on
patrons.</p>

<p>On the two went, the old man in tatters, the
goose-girl in wooden shoes. The man listened;
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" />she was singing brightly, and the voice was sweet
and strong and true.</p>

<p>&quot;She is happy; that is some recompense. She
is richer than I am.&quot; And the peasant fell into
a reverie.</p>

<p>Presently there was a clatter of horses, a jingle
of bit and spur and saber. The old man
stepped to the side of the road and sat down on
the stone parapet. It would be wiser now to wait
till the dust settled. Half a dozen mounted officers
trotted past. The peasant on the parapet
instantly recognized one of the men. He saluted
with a humbleness which lacked sincerity. It was
the grand duke himself. There was General Ducwitz,
too, and some of his staff, and a smooth-faced,
handsome young man in civilian riding-clothes,
who, though he rode like a cavalryman,
was obviously of foreign birth, an Englishman
or an American. They were laughing and chatting
amiably, for the grand duke of Ehrenstein
bothered himself about formalities only at formal
times. The outsider watched them regretfully as
they went by, and there was some envy in his
heart, too.</p>

<p>When the cavalcade reached the goose-girl, the
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" />peace of the scene vanished forthwith. Confusion
took up the scepter. The silly geese, instead
of remaining on the left of the road, in safety,
straightway determined that their haven of refuge
was on the opposite side. Gonk-gonk! Quack-quack!
They scrambled, they blundered, they
flew. Some tried to go over the horses, some endeavored
to go under. One landed, full-winged,
against the grand duke's chest and swept his vizored
cap off his head and rolled it into the dust.
The duke signed to his companions to draw up;
to proceed in this undignified manner was impossible.
All laughed heartily, however; all excepting
the goose-girl. To her it was far from being
a laughing matter. It would take half an hour
to calm her stupid charges. And she was <i>so</i> tired.</p>

<p>&quot;Stupids!&quot; she cried despairingly.</p>

<p>&quot;From pigs and chickens, good Lord deliver
us!&quot; shouted the civilian, sliding from his horse
and recovering the duke's cap.</p>

<p>Now, the duke was a kind-hearted, thoughtful
man, notwithstanding his large and complex affairs
of state; as he ceased laughing, he searched
a pocket, and tossed a couple of coins to the forlorn
goose-girl.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" />I am sorry, little one,&quot; he said gravely. &quot;I
hope none of your geese is hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Highness!&quot; cried the girl, breathless
from her recent endeavors and overcome with the
grandeur of the two ducal effigies in her hand.
She had seen the grand duke times without number,
but she had never yet been so near to him.
And now he had actually spoken to her. It was a
miracle. She would tell them all that night in
the dark old Krumerweg. And for the moment
his prospect overshadowed all thought of her
geese.</p>

<p>The civilian dusted the royal cap with his
sleeve, returned it, and mounted. He then looked
casually at the girl.</p>

<p>&quot;By George!&quot; he exclaimed, in English.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked the duke, gathering up
the reins.</p>

<p>&quot;The girl's face; it is beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke, after a glance, readily agreed.
&quot;You Americans are always observant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whenever there's a pretty face about,&quot; supplemented
Ducwitz.</p>

<p>&quot;I certainly shouldn't trouble to look at a
homely one,&quot; the American retorted.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" />Pretty figure, too,&quot; said one of the aides, a
colonel. But his eye held none of the abstract admiration
which characterized the American's.</p>

<p>The goose-girl had seen this look in other
men's eyes; she knew. A faint color grew under
her tan, and waned, but her eyes wavered not the
breadth of a hair. It was the colonel who finally
was forced to turn his gaze elsewhere, chagrined.
His face was not unfamiliar to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Beauty is a fickle goddess,&quot; remarked Ducwitz
tritely, settling himself firmly in the saddle.
&quot;In giving, she is as blind as a bat. I know a
duchess now&mdash;but never mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us be going forward,&quot; interrupted the
duke. There were more vital matters under hand
than the beauty of a strolling goose-girl.</p>

<p>So the troop proceeded with dust and small
thunder, and shortly passed the city gates, which
in modern times were never closed. It traversed
the lumpy cobbles of the narrow streets, under
hanging gables, past dim little shops and markets,
often unintentionally crowding pedestrians
into doorways or against the walls. One among
those so inconvenienced was a youth dressed
as a vintner. He was tall, pliantly built, blond
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" />as a Viking, possessing a singular beauty of the
masculine order. He was forced to flatten himself
against the wall of a house, his arms extended
on either side, in a kind of temporary
crucifixion. Even then the stirrup of the American
touched him slightly. But it was not the
touch of the stirrup that startled him; it was the
dark, clean-cut face of the rider. Once they were
by, the youth darted into a doorway.</p>

<p>&quot;He? What can he be doing here? No, it is
utterly impossible; it is merely a likeness.&quot;</p>

<p>He ventured forth presently, none of the perturbation,
however, gone from his face. He ran
his hand across his chin; yes, he would let his
beard grow.</p>

<p>The duke and his escort turned into the broad
and restful sweep of the K&ouml;nig Strasse, with its
fashionable residences, shops, caf&eacute;s and hotels.
At the end of the <i>Strasse</i> was the Ehrenstein
Platz, the great square round which ran the palaces
and the royal and public gardens. On the
way many times the duke raised his hand in salutations;
for, while not exactly loved, he was liked
for his rare clean living, his sound sense of justice
and his honest efforts to do what was right.<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" />
Opera-singers came and went, but none had ever
penetrated into the private suites of the palace.
The halt was made in the courtyard, and all dismounted.</p>

<p>The American thanked the duke gratefully
for the use of the horse.</p>

<p>&quot;You are welcome to a mount at all times, Mr.
Carmichael,&quot; replied the duke pleasantly. &quot;A
man who rides as well as yourself may be trusted
anywhere with any kind of a horse.&quot;</p>

<p>The group looked admiringly at the object of
this marked attention. Here was one who had
seen two years of constant and terrible warfare,
who had ridden horses under fire, and who bore
on his body many honorable scars. For the great
civil strife in America had come to its close but
two years before, and Europe was still captive to
her amazement at the military prowess of the
erstwhile inconsiderable American.</p>

<p>As Carmichael saluted and turned to leave the
courtyard, he threw a swift, searching glance at
one of the palace windows. Did the curtain stir?
He could not say. He continued on, crossing the
Platz, toward the Grand Hotel. He was a bachelor,
so he might easily have had his quarters at
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" />the consulate; but as usual with American consulates&mdash;even
to the present time&mdash;it was situated
in an undesirable part of the town, over a <i>Bierhalle</i>
frequented by farmers and the middle class.
Having a moderately comfortable income of his
own, he naturally preferred living at the Grand
Hotel.</p>

<p>Where had he seen that young vintner before?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Meanwhile, the goose-girl set resolutely about
the task of remarshaling her awkward squad.
With a soft, clucking sound she moved hither
and thither. A feather or two drifted lazily about
in the air. At last she gathered them in, all but
one foolish, blank-eyed gander, which, poising on
a large boulder, threatened to dive headforemost
into the torrent. She coaxed him gently, then severely,
but without success. The old man in
patches came up.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me get him for you, <i>Kindchen</i>,&quot; he volunteered.</p>

<p>The good-fellowship in his voice impressed her
far more than the humble state of his dress. But
she smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;It is dangerous,&quot; she affirmed. &quot;It will be
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" />wiser to wait. In a little while he will come down
of his own accord.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bah!&quot; cried the old man. &quot;It is nothing; I
am a mountaineer.&quot;</p>

<p>In spite of his weariness, he proved himself to
be a dexterous climber. Foot by foot he crawled
up the side of the huge stone. A slip, and his life
would not have been worth one of the floating
feathers. The gander saw him coming and stirred
uneasily. Nearer and nearer came this human
spider. The gander flapped its wings, but hesitated
to take the leap. Instantly a brown hand
shot up and caught the scaly yellow legs. There
was much squawking on the way down, but when
his gandership saw his more tractable brothers
and sisters peacefully waddling up the road, he
subsided and took his place in the ranks without
more ado.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a brave man, Herr.&quot; There was admiration
in the girl's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;To court danger and to overcome obstacles
is a part of my regular business. I do not know
what giddiness is. You are welcome to the service.
It is a long walk from the valley.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have walked it many times this summer.<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />
But this is the last day. To-morrow I sell the
geese in the market to the hotels. They have all
fine livers&quot;&mdash;lightly touching a goose with her
willow stick.</p>

<p>&quot;What, the hotels?&quot;&mdash;humorously.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, my geese!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What was that song you were singing before
the horses came up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That? It was from the poet Heine&quot;&mdash;simply.</p>

<p>He stared at her with a rudeness not at all intentional.</p>

<p>&quot;Heine? Can you read?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>The other walked along beside her in silence.
After all, why not? Why should he be surprised?
From one end of the world to the other
printer's ink was spreading and bringing light.
But a goose-girl who read Heine!</p>

<p>&quot;And the music?&quot; he inquired presently.</p>

<p>&quot;That is mine&quot;&mdash;with the first sign of diffidence.
&quot;Melodies are always running through
my head. Sometimes they make me forget things
I ought to remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your own music? An impresario will be
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />discovering you some fine day, and your fortune
will be made.&quot;</p>

<p>The light irony did not escape her. &quot;I am
only a goose-girl.&quot;</p>

<p>He felt disarmed. &quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What else?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing else&quot;&mdash;wistfully. &quot;I never knew
any father or mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So?&quot; This was easier for the other to understand.
&quot;But who taught you to read?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A priest. Once I lived in the mountains, at an
inn. He used to come in evenings, when the snow
was not too deep. He taught me to read and
write, and many things besides. I know that
Italy has all the works of art; that France has
the most interesting history; that Germany has
all the philosophers, and America all the money,&quot;
adding a smile. &quot;I should like to see America.
Sometimes I find a newspaper, and I read it all
through.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;History?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little, and geography.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With all this wide learning you ought to be
something better than a tender of geese.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" />It is honest work, and that is good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I meant nothing wrong, <i>Kindchen</i>. But you
would find it easier in a milliner's shop, as a
lady's maid, something of that order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With these?&quot;&mdash;holding out her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;It would not take long to whiten them. Do
you live alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I live with my foster-mother, who is
very old. I call her grandmother. She took
me in when I was a foundling; now I am taking
care of her. She has always been good to me.
And what might your name be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwig.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ludwig what?&quot;&mdash;inquisitive in her turn.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the other does not matter. I am a
mountaineer from Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jugendheit?&quot; She paused to look at him
more closely. &quot;We are not friendly with your
country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More's the pity. It is a grave blunder on
the part of the grand duke. There is a mote
in his eye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wasn't it all about the grand duke's daughter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. But she has been found. Yet the
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" />duke is as bitter as of old. He is wrong, he was
always wrong.&quot; The old man spoke with feeling.
&quot;What is this new-found princess like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is beautiful and kind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p>The geese were behaving, and only occasionally
was she obliged to use her stick. And as
her companion asked no more questions, she
devoted her attention to the flock, proud of their
broad backs and full breasts.</p>

<p>On his part, he observed her critically, for
he was more than curious now, he was interested.
She was not tall, but her lithe slenderness
gave her the appearance of tallness. Her hands,
rough-nailed and sunburnt, were small and
shapely; the bare foot in the wooden shoe might
have worn without trouble Cinderella's magic
slipper. Her clothes, coarse and homespun, were
clean and variously mended. Her hair, in a
thick braid, was the tone of the heart of a
chestnut-bur, and her eyes were of that mystifying
hazel, sometimes brown, sometimes gray,
according to whether the sky was clear or overcast.
And there was something above and beyond
all these things, a modesty, a gentleness
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" />and a purity; none of the bold, rollicking,
knowing manner so common in handsome peasant
girls. He contemplated her through half-closed
eyes and gave her in fancy the triffing furbelows
of a woman of fashion; she would have
been beautiful.</p>

<p>&quot;How old are you, Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know,&quot; she answered, &quot;perhaps
eighteen, perhaps twenty.&quot;</p>

<p>Again they went forward in silence. By the
time they reached the gates the sun was no
longer visible on the horizon, but it had gone
down ruddy and uncrowned by any cloud, giving
promise of a fair day on the morrow. The
afterglow on the mountains across the valley was
now in its prime glory; and once the two wayfarers
paused and commented upon it. Once
more the mountaineer was agreeably surprised;
the average peasant is impervious to atmospheric
splendor, beauty carries no message.</p>

<p>Arriving at length in the city, they passed
through the crooked streets, sometimes so narrow
that the geese were packed from wall to wall.
Oft some jovial soldier sent a jest or a query
to them across the now gray backs of the geese.<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" />
But Gretchen looked on ahead, purely and serenely.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, where shall I find the Adlergasse?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We pass through it shortly. I will show
you. You are also a stranger in Dreiberg?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>They took the next turn, and the weather-beaten
sign <i>Zum Schwartzen Adler</i>, hanging in
front of a frame house of many gables, caused
the mountaineer to breathe gratefully.</p>

<p>&quot;Here my journey ends, Gretchen. The
Black Eagle,&quot; he added, in an undertone; &quot;it is
unchanged these twenty years. Heaven send
that the beds are softer than aforetime!&quot;</p>

<p>They were passing a clock-mender's shop.
The man from Jugendheit peered in the window,
which had not been cleaned in an age, but
there was no clock in sight to give him warning
of the time, and he dared not now look at
his watch. He had a glimpse of the ancient
clock-mender himself, however, huddled over a
table upon which sputtered a candle. It touched
up his face with grotesque lights. Here was
age, mused the man outside the window; nothing
less than fourscore years rested upon those
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />rounded shoulders. The face was corrugated
with wrinkles, like a frosted road; eyes heavily
spectacled, a ragged thatch of hair on the head,
a ragged beard on the chin. Aware of a shadow
between him and the fading daylight, the clock-mender
looked up from his work. The eyes of
the two men met, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>The mountaineer, who felt rejuvenated by
this contrast, straightened his shoulders and
started to cross the street to the tavern.</p>

<div class="center">

alt="&quot;Good night, Gretchen. Good luck to you.&quot;" width="50%"
title="&quot;Good night, Gretchen. Good luck to you.&quot;" /></a>
</div>
<h3>&quot;Good night, Gretchen. Good luck to you.&quot;</h3>

<p>&quot;Good night, Gretchen. Good luck to you and
your geese to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Herr Ludwig. And will you be
long in the city?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That depends; perhaps,&quot; adding a grim
smile in answer to a grim thought.</p>

<p>He offered his hand, which she accepted
trustfully. He was a strange old man, but
she liked him. When she withdrew her hand,
something cold and hard remained in her palm.
Wonders of all the world! It was a piece of gold.
Her eyes went up quickly, but the giver smiled
reassuringly and put a finger against his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Herr,&quot; she remonstrated.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep it; I give it to you. Do not question
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />providence, and I am her handmaiden just now.
Go along with you.&quot;</p>

<p>So Gretchen in a mild state of stupefaction
turned away. Clat-clat! sang the little wooden
shoes. A plaintive gonk rose as she prodded
a laggard from the dank gutter. A piece of
gold! Clat-clat! Clat-clat! Surely this had been
a day of marvels; two crowns from the grand
duke and a piece of gold from this old man in
peasant clothes. Instinctively she knew that he
was not a peasant. But what could he be?
Comparison would have made him a king. She
was too tired and hungry to make further deductions.</p>

<p>She was regarded with kindly eyes till the
dark jaws of the Krumerweg swallowed up both
her and her geese.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor little goose-girl!&quot; he thought. &quot;If she
but knew, she could make a bonfire of a thousand
hearts. A fine day!&quot; He eyed again the
battered sign. It was then that he discerned
another, leaning from the ledge of the first story
of the house adjoining the tavern. It was the
tarnished shield of the United States.</p>

<p>&quot;What a penurious government it must be!<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" />
Two weeks, tramping about the country in this
unholy garb, following false trails half the time,
living on crusts and cold meats. Ah, you have
led me a merry dance, nephew, but I shall not
forget!&quot;</p>

<p>He entered the tavern and applied for a room,
haggling over the price.</p>

<h3>AN AMERICAN CONSUL</h3>


<p>The nights in Dreiberg during September
are often chill. The heavy mists from
the mountain slip down the granite clifts and
spread over the city, melting all sharp outlines,
enfeebling the gas-lamps, and changing the
moon, if there happens to be one, into something
less than a moon and something more than a pewter
disk. And so it was this night.</p>

<p>Carmichael, in order to finish his cigar on the
little balcony fronting his window, found it necessary
to put on his light overcoat, though he
perfectly knew that he was in no manner forced
to smoke on the balcony. But the truth was he
wanted a clear vision of the palace and the
lighted windows thereof, and of one in particular.
He had no more sense than Tom-fool, the
abetter of follies. She was as far removed from
him as the most alien of the planets; but the
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" />magnet shall ever draw the needle, and a woman
shall ever draw a man. He knew that it was
impossible, that it grew more impossible day by
day, and he railed at himself bitterly and satirically.</p>

<p>He sighed and teetered his legs. A sigh moves
nothing forward, yet it is as essential as life itself.
It is the safety-valve to every emotion; it
is the last thing in laughter, the last thing in
tears. One sighs in entering the world and in
leaving it, perhaps in protest. A child sighs for
the moon because it knows no better. Carmichael
sighed for the Princess Hildegarde, understanding.
It was sigh or curse, and the latter mode
of expression wastes more vitality. Oh, yes;
they made over him, as the world goes; they
dined and wined him and elected him honorary
member to their clubs; they patted him on the
back and called him captain; but it was all in a
negligent toleration that turned every pleasure
into rust.</p>

<p>Arthur Carmichael was Irish. He was born
in America, educated there and elsewhere, a little
while in Paris, a little while at Bonn, and, like
all Irishmen, he was baned with the wandering
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" />foot; for the man who is homeless by choice has
a subtle poison in his blood. He was at Bonn
when the Civil War came. He went back to
America and threw himself into the fight with all
the ardor that had made his forebears famous
in the service of the worthless Stuarts. It wasn't
a question with him of the mere love of fighting,
of tossing the penny; he knew with which side
he wished to fight. He joined the cavalry of
the North, and hammered and fought his way
to a captaincy. He was wounded five times and
imprisoned twice. His right eye was still weak
from the effects of a powder explosion; and
whenever it bothered him he wore a single glass,
abominating, as all soldiers do, the burden of
spectacles. At the end of the conflict he returned
to Washington.</p>

<p>And then the inherent curse put a hand on his
shoulder; he must be moving. His parents were
dead; there was no anchor, nor had lying ambition
enmeshed him. There was a little property,
the income from which was enough for his wants.
Without any influence whatever, save his pleasing
address and his wide education, he blarneyed
the State Department out of a consulate. They
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" />sent him to Ehrenstein, at a salary not worth
mentioning, with the diplomatic halo of dignity
as a tail to the kite. He had been in the service
some two years by now, and those who knew him
well rather wondered at his sedative turn of
mind. Two years in any one place was not in
reckoning as regarded Carmichael; yet, here he
was, caring neither for promotion nor exchange.
So, then, all logical deductions simmered down to
one: <i>Cherchez la femme</i>.</p>

<p>He knew that his case would never be tried in
court nor settled out of it; and he realized that
it would be far better to weigh anchor and set
his course for other parts. But no man ever
quite forsakes his dream-woman; and he had endued
a princess with all the shining attributes of
an angel, when, had he known it, she was only
angelic.</p>

<p>The dreamer is invariably tripping over his
illusions; and Carmichael was rather boyish in
his dreams. What absurd romances he was always
weaving round her! What exploits on her
behalf! But never anything happened, and
never was the grand duke called upon to offer
his benediction.</p>

<p><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" />It was all very foolish and romantic and impossible,
and no one recognized this more readily
than he. No American ever married a princess
of a reigning house, and no American ever will.
This law is as immovable as the law of gravitation.
Still, man is master of his dreams, and he
may do as he pleases in the confines of this small
circle. Outside these temporary lapses, Carmichael
was a keen, shrewd, far-sighted young
man, close-lipped and observant, never forgetting
faces, never forgetting benefits, loving a
fight but never provoking one. So he and the
world were friends. Diplomacy has its synonym
in tact, and he was an able tactician, for all that
an Irishman is generally likened to a bull in a
china-shop.</p>

<p>&quot;How the deuce will it end?&quot;&mdash;musing half
aloud. &quot;I'll forget myself some day and trip
so hard that they'll be asking Washington for
my recall. I'll go over to the gardens and listen
to the band. They are playing dirges to-night,
and anything funereal will be a light and happy
tonic to my present state of mind.&quot;</p>

<p>He was standing on the curb in front of the
hotel, his decision still unrounded, when he no<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />ticed
a closed carriage hard by the fountain in
the Platz. The driver dozed on his box.</p>

<p>&quot;Humph! There's a man who is never troubled
with counting the fool's beads. Silver and
copper are his gods and goddesses. Ha! a
fare!&quot;</p>

<p>A woman in black, thoroughly veiled and
cloaked, came round from the opposite side of
the fountain. She spoke to the driver, and he
tumbled off the box, alive and hearty. There
seemed to be a short interchange of words of
mutual satisfaction. The lady stepped into the
carriage, the driver woke up his ancient Bucephalus,
and went clickety-clack down the K&ouml;nig
Strasse toward the town.</p>

<p>To Carmichael it was less than an incident.
He twirled his cane and walked toward the public
gardens. Here he strolled about, watching
the people, numerous but orderly, with a bright
military patch here and there. The band struck
up again, and he drifted with the crowd toward
the pavilion. The penny-chairs were occupied,
so he selected a spot off-side, near enough for all
auditual purposes. One after another he carelessly
scanned the faces of those nearest. He
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" />was something of an amateur physiognomist,
but he seldom made the mistakes of the tyro.</p>

<p>Within a dozen feet of him, her arms folded
across her breast, her eyes half shut in the
luxury of the senses, stood the goose-girl. He
smiled as he recalled the encounter of that afternoon.
It was his habit to ride to the maneuvers
every day, and several times he had noticed her,
as well as any rider is able to notice a pedestrian.
But that afternoon her beauty came home to him
suddenly and unexpectedly. Had she been other
than what she was, a woman well-gowned, for instance,
riding in her carriage, his interest would
have waned in the passing. But it had come
with the same definite surprise as when one finds
a rare and charming story in a dilapidated book.</p>

<p>&quot;Why couldn't I have fallen in love with some
one like this?&quot; he cogitated.</p>

<p>With a friendly smile on his lips, he took a
step toward her, but instantly paused. Colonel
von Wallenstein of the general staff approached
her from the other side, and Carmichael was curious
to find out what that officer's object was.
Wallenstein was a capital soldier, and a jolly
fellow round a board, but beyond that Car<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" />michael
had no real liking for him. There were
too many scented notes stuck in his pockets.</p>

<p>The colonel dropped his cigarette, leaned over
Gretchen's shoulder and spoke a few words. At
first she gave no heed. The colonel persisted.
Without a word in reply, she resolutely sought
the nearest policeman. Wallenstein, remaining
where he was, laughed. Meantime the policeman
frowned. It was incredible; his excellency could
not possibly have intended any wrong, it was
only a harmless pleasantry. Gretchen's lips
quivered; the law of redress in Ebrenstein had
no niche for the goose-girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, colonel,&quot; said Carmichael
pleasantly. &quot;Why can't your bandmaster give
us light opera once in a while?&quot;</p>

<p>The colonel pulled his mustache in chagrin,
but he did not give Carmichael the credit for
bringing about this cheapening sense. For the
time being Gretchen was freed from annoyance.
The colonel certainly could not rush off to her
and give this keen-eyed American an opportunity
to witness a further rebuff.</p>

<p>&quot;Light operas are rare at present,&quot; he replied,
accepting his defeat amiably enough.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />Paris is full of them just now,&quot; continued
Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Paris? Would you like a riot in the gardens?&quot;
asked the colonel, amused.</p>

<p>&quot;A riot?&quot; said Carmichael derisively. &quot;Why,
nothing short of a bombshell would cause a riot
among your phlegmatic Germans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you love your Paris better than
your Dreiberg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit of doubt. And down in your heart
you do, too. Think of the lights, the theaters,
the caf&eacute;s and the pretty women!&quot; Carmichael's
cane described a flourish as if to draw a picture
of these things.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; agreed the colonel reminiscently;
&quot;you are right. There is no other night equal
to a Parisian night. <i>Ach, Gott!</i> But think of
the mornings, think of the mornings!&quot;&mdash;dolefully.</p>

<p>&quot;On the contrary, let us not think of them!&quot;&mdash;with
a mock shudder.</p>

<p>And then a pretty woman rose from a chair
near-by. She nodded brightly at the colonel,
who bowed, excused himself to Carmichael, and
made off after her.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" />I believe I stepped on his toe that time,&quot; said
Carmichael to himself.</p>

<p>Then he looked round for Gretchen. She was
still at the side of the policeman. She had
watched the scene between the two men, but was
quite unconscious that it had been set for her
benefit. She came back. Carmichael stepped
confidently to her side and raised his hat.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you get your geese together without
mishap?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>The instinct of the child always remains with
the woman. Gretchen smiled. This young man
would be different, she knew.</p>

<p>&quot;They were only frightened. But his highness&quot;&mdash;eagerly&mdash;&quot;was
he very angry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Angry? Not the least. He was amused.
But he was nearly knocked off his horse. If
you lived in America now, you might reap a
goodly profit from that goose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;America? How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You could put him in a museum and exhibit
him as an intimate friend of the grand duke of
Ehrenstein.&quot;</p>

<p>But Gretchen did not laugh. It was a serious
thing to talk lightly of so grand a person as the
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" />duke. Still, the magic word America, where the
gold came from, flamed her curiosity.</p>

<p>&quot;You are from America?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you rich?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In fancy, in dreams&quot;&mdash;humorously.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! I thought they were all rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only one or two of us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it very large, this America?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;France, Spain, Prussia would be lonesome if
set down in America. Only Russia has anything
to boast of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you fight in the war?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Do you like music?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Were you ever wounded?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A scratch or two, nothing to speak of. But
do you like music?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very, very much. When they play Beethoven,
Bach, or Meyerbeer, <i>ach</i>, I seem to live in
another country. I hear music in everything,
in the leaves, the rain, the wind, the stream.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed strange to him that he had not noticed
it at first, the almost Hanoverian purity
of her speech and the freedom with which she
spoke. The average peasant is diffident, with
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />a vocabulary of few words, ignorant of art or
music or where the world lay.</p>

<p>&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a good name; it is famous, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goethe used it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So he did.&quot; Carmichael ably concealed his
surprise: &quot;You have some one who reads to
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Herr. I can read and write and do sums
in addition.&quot;</p>

<p>He was willing to swear that she was making
fun of him. Was she a simple goose-girl?
Was she not something more, something deeper?
War-clouds were forming in the skies; they
might gather and strike at any time. And who
but the French could produce such a woman
spy? Ehrenstein was not Prussia, it was true;
but the duchy with its twenty thousand troops
was one of the many pulses that beat in unison
with this man Bismarck's plans. Carmichael
addressed her quickly in French, aiming to catch
her off her guard.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not speak French, Herr,&quot;&mdash;honestly.</p>

<p>He was certainly puzzled, but a glance at her
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" />hands dissolved his doubts. These hands were
used to toil, they were in no way disguised. No
Frenchwoman would sacrifice her hands for her
country; at least, not to this extent. Yet the
two things in his mind would not readily cohese:
a goose-girl who was familiar with the
poets and composers.</p>

<p>&quot;You have been to school?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After a manner. My teacher was a kind
priest. But he never knew that, with knowledge,
he was to open the gates of discontent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you are not happy with your lot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is any one, Herr?&quot;&mdash;quietly. &quot;And who
might you be, and what might you be doing here
in Dreiberg, riding with the grand duke?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am the American consul.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen took a step back.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it is nothing that will bite you,&quot; he
added.</p>

<p>&quot;But perhaps I have been disrespectful!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pray, how?&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen found that she had no definite explanation
to offer.</p>

<p>&quot;What did Colonel Wallenstein say to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing of importance. I am used to it. I
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" />am perfectly able to take care of myself,&quot; she
answered.</p>

<p>&quot;But he annoyed you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is true,&quot; she admitted.</p>

<p>&quot;What did the policeman say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What would he say to a goose-girl?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I speak to him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would it really do any good?&quot;&mdash;skeptically.</p>

<p>&quot;It might. The duke is friendly toward me,
and I am certain he would not tolerate such
conduct in his police.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You would only make enemies for me; insolence
would become persecution. I know. Yet,
I thank you, Herr&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Carmichael. Now, listen, Gretchen; if at any
time you are in trouble, you will find me at the
Grand Hotel or at the consulate next door to the
Black Eagle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall remember. Sometimes I work in the
Black Eagle.&quot; And recollection rose in her mind
of the old man who had given her the gold piece.</p>

<p>&quot;Good night,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen extended her hand and Carmichael
took it in his own, inspecting it.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" />Why do you do that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a good hand; it is strong, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It has to be strong, Herr. Good night.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael raised his hat again, and Gretchen
breathed contentedly as she saw him disappear
in the crowd. That little act of courtesy made
everything brighter. There was only one other
who ever touched his hat to her respectfully.
And as she stood there, dreaming over the unusual
happenings of the day, she felt an arm
slip through hers, gently but firmly, even with
authority. Her head went round.</p>

<p>&quot;Leo?&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p>The young vintner whom Carmichael had
pushed against the wall that day smiled from
under the deep shade of his hat, drawn down
well over his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, who was that speaking to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Carmichael, the American consul.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Carmichael!&quot; The arm in Gretchen's stiffened.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, Leo?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. Only, I grow mad with rage when
any of these gentlemen speak to you. Gentlemen!
I know them all too well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />This one means no harm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would I were certain. Ah, how I love you!&quot;
he whispered.</p>

<p>Gretchen thrilled and drew his arm closely
against her side.</p>

<p>&quot;To me the world began but two weeks ago.
I have just begun to live.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad,&quot; said Gretchen. &quot;But listen.&quot;</p>

<p>The band was playing again.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes I am jealous even of that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you none the less for loving it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know; but I am sad and lonely to-night&quot;&mdash;gloomily.
&quot;I want all your thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are they not always yours? And why should
you be sad and miserable?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, indeed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leo, as much as I love you, there is always
a shadow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What shadow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is always at night that I see you, rarely
in the bright daytime. What do you do during
the day? It is not yet vintage. What do you
do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you trust me a little longer, Gretchen,
just a little longer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" />Always, not a little longer, always. But wait
till the music stops and I will tell you of my
adventure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have had an adventure?&quot;&mdash;distrustfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Be still.&quot;</p>

<p>There were tones in Gretchen's voice that the
young vintner could never quite understand.
There was a will little less than imperial, and
often as he rebelled, he never failed to bow to it.</p>

<p>&quot;What was this adventure?&quot; he demanded, as
the music stopped.</p>

<p>She told him about the geese, the grand duke,
and the two crowns. He laughed, and she joined
him, for it was amusing now.</p>

<p>The musicians were putting away their instruments,
the crowd was melting, the attendants
were stacking the chairs, so the two lovers went
out of the gardens toward the town and the
Krumerweg.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Carmichael had lectured the policeman,
who was greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Excellency, I am sure Colonel von Wallenstein
meant no harm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" />Are you truthfully sure?&quot;</p>

<p>The policeman plucked at his beard nervously.
&quot;It is every man for himself, as your excellency
knows. Had I spoken to the colonel, he would
have had me broken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You could have appealed to the duke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps. I am sorry for the girl, but I have
a family to take care of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, mark me; this little woman loves music;
she comes here often. The next time she is
annoyed by Wallenstein or any one else, you
report it to me. I'll see that it reaches his highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall gladly do that, your Excellency.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael left the gardens and wandered
with aimless step. He was surprised to find
that he was opposite the side gates to the royal
gardens. His feet had followed the bent of his
mind. Yet he did not cross the narrow side
street. The sound of carriage wheels caused
him to halt. He waited. The carriage he had
seen by the fountain drew up before the gates,
and the woman in black alighted. She spoke to
the sentinel, who opened the gates and closed
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" />them. The veiled lady vanished abruptly beyond
the shrubbery.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder who that was?&quot; was Carmichael's
internal question. &quot;Bah! Some lady-in-waiting
with an affair on hand.&quot;</p>

<h3>FOR HER COUNTRY</h3>


<p>&quot;Count, must I tell you again not to broach
that subject? There can be no alliance between
Ehrenstein and Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Count von Herbeck, chancellor,
coolly returning the angry flash from the
ducal eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;There are a thousand reasons why, but it
is not my purpose to name them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Name only one, your Highness, only one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will that satisfy you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One of my reasons is that I do not want any
alliance with a country so perfidious as Jugendheit.
What! I make overtures? I, who have
been so cruelly wronged all these years? You
are mad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what positive evidence have you that
Jugendheit wronged you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" />Positive? Have I eyes and ears? Have I
not seen and read and heard?&quot; This time the
duke struck the desk savagely. &quot;Why do you
always rouse me in this fashion, Herbeck?
You know how distasteful all this is to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness knows that I look only to the
welfare of the country. In the old days it was
a foregone conclusion that this alliance was to
be formed. Now, you persist in averring that
the late king was the chief conspirator in abducting
her serene highness, aided by Arnsberg,
whose successor I have the honor to be.
I have never yet seen any proofs. You have
never yet produced them. Show me something
which absolutely convicts them, and I'll surrender.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On your honor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My word.&quot;</p>

<p>The grand duke struck the bell on the chancellor's
desk.</p>

<p>&quot;My secretary, and tell him to bring me the
packet marked A. He will understand.&quot;</p>

<p>The two men waited without speaking, each
busy with thought. The duke had been in
his youth, and was still, a handsome man,
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" />splendidly set up, healthy and vigorous, keen
mentally, and whatever stubbornness he possessed
nicely balanced by common sense. He
might have been guilty in his youth of a few
human peccadillos, but the kingly and princely
excesses which at that time were making the
east side of the Rhine the scandal of the world
had in no wise sullied his name. Ehrenstein
means &quot;stone of honor,&quot; and he had always
carried the thought of this in his heart. He
was frank in his likes and dislikes, he hated
secrets, and he loved an opponent who engaged
him in the open. Herbeck often labored with
him over this open manner, but the mind he
sought to work upon was as receptive to political
hypocrisy as a wall of granite. It was
this extraordinary rectitude which made the duke
so powerful an aid to Bismarck in the days
that followed. The Man of Iron needed this sort
of character as a cover and a buckler to his
own duplicities.</p>

<p>Herbeck was an excellent foil. He was as
silent and secretive as sand. He moved, as it
were, in circles, thus always eluding dangerous
corners. He was tall, angular, with a thin, im<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" />mobile
countenance, well guarded by his gray
eyes and straight lips. He was a born financier,
with almost limitless ambition, though only he
himself knew how far this ambition reached.
He had not brought prosperity to Ehrenstein,
but he had fortified and bastioned it against
extravagance, and this was probably the larger
feat of the two. He loved his country, and
brooded over it as a mother broods over her
child. Twice had he saved Ehrenstein from the
drag-net of war, and with honor. So he was
admired by fathers and revered by mothers.</p>

<p>The secretary came in and laid a thin packet
of papers on the chancellor's desk. &quot;It was
the packet A, your Highness?&quot;&mdash;his hand still
resting upon the documents.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. You may go.&quot;</p>

<p>The secretary bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>The duke stirred the papers angrily, took one
of them and spread it out with a rasp.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at that. Whose writing, I ask?&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck adjusted his glasses and scrutinized
the slanting hieroglyphics. He ran over it several
times. At length he opened a drawer in
his desk, sorted some papers, and brought out
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" />a yellow letter. This he laid down beside the
other.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they are alike. This will be Arnsberg.
But&quot;&mdash;mildly&mdash;&quot;who may say that it is not a
cunning forgery?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forgery!&quot; roared the duke. &quot;Read this one
from the late king of Jugendheit to Arnsberg,
then, if you still doubt.&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck read slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>Then he rose and walked to the nearest window,
studying the letter again in the sharper
light. Presently his hands fell behind his back
and met about the paper, while he himself stared
over into the royal gardens. He remained in
this attitude for some time.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said the duke impatiently.</p>

<p>Herbeck returned to his chair. &quot;I wish that
you had shown me these long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To what end?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You accused the king?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly, but he denied it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In a letter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Here, read it.&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck compared the two. &quot;Where did you
find these?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" />In Arnsberg's desk,&quot; returned the duke, the
anger in his eyes giving place to gloomy retrospection.
&quot;Arnsberg, my boyhood playmate,
the man I loved and trusted and advanced to the
highest office in my power. Is that not the way?
Do we ever trust any one fully without being
in the end deceived? Well, dead or alive,&quot; the
duke continued, his throat swelling, &quot;ten thousand
crowns to him who brings Arnsberg to me,
dead or alive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will never come back,&quot; said Herbeck.</p>

<p>&quot;Not if he is wise. He was clever. He sent
all his fortune to Paris, so I found, and what
I confiscated was nothing but his estate. But
do you believe me&quot;&mdash;putting a hand against his
heart&mdash;&quot;something here tells me that some day
fate will drag him back and give him into my
hands?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are very bitter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And have I not cause? Did not my wife die
of a broken heart, and did I not become a broken
man? You do not know all, Herbeck, not quite
all. Franz also sought the hand of the Princess
Sofia. He, too, loved her, but I won. Well, his
revenge must have been sweet to him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" />But your daughter has been restored to
her own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Due to your indefatigable efforts alone. Ah,
Herbeck, nothing will ever fill up the gap between,
nothing will ever restore the mother.&quot;
The duke bowed his head.</p>

<p>Herbeck studied him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;I love my daughter and she loves me, but I
don't know what it is, I can't explain it,&quot; irresolutely.</p>

<p>&quot;What can not your highness explain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps the gap is too wide, perhaps the
separation has been too long.&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck did not press the duke to be more
explicit. He opened another drawer and took
forth a long hood envelope, crested and sealed.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness, here is a letter from the
prince regent of Jugendheit, formally asking
the hand of the Princess Hildegarde for his
nephew, Frederick, who will shortly be crowned.
My advice is to accept, to let bygones be bygones.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Write the prince that I respectfully decline.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do nothing in haste, your Highness. Temporize;
say that you desire some time to think
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" />about the matter. You can change your mind
at any time. A reply like this commits you to
nothing, whereas your abrupt refusal will only
widen the breach.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The wider the breach the better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, your Highness; the past has disturbed
you. We can stand war, and it is
possible that we might win, even against Jugendheit;
but war at this late day would be a colossal
blunder. Victory would leave us where we
began thirty years ago. One does not go to
war for a cause that has been practically dead
these sixteen years. And an insult to Jugendheit
might precipitate war. It would be far
wiser to let me answer the prince regent, saying
that your highness will give the proposal your
thoughtful consideration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have your way, then, but on your head be
it if you commit me to anything.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke was about to gather up his documentary
evidence, when Herbeck touched his
hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I have an idea,&quot; said the chancellor. &quot;A
great many letters reach me from day to day.
I have an excellent memory. Who knows but
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" />that I might find the true conspirator, the archplotter?
Leave them with me, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not ask you to be careful with them,
Herbeck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall treasure them as my life.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke departed, stirred as he had not been
since the restoration of the princess. Herbeck
sometimes irritated him, for he was never in the
wrong, he was never impatient, he was never
hasty, he never had to go over a thing twice.
This supernal insight, which overlooked all
things but results, set the duke wondering if
Herbeck was truly all human. If only he could
catch him at fault once in a while!</p>

<p>Count von Herbeck remained at his desk, his
face as inscrutable as ever, his eyes without expression,
and his lips expressing nothing. He
smoothed out a sheet of paper, affixed the state
seal, and in a flowing hand wrote a diplomatic
note, considering the proposal of his royal highness,
the prince regent of Jugendheit, on behalf
of his nephew, the king. This he placed in the
diplomatic pouch, called for a courier, and despatched
him at once for the frontier.</p>

<p>The duke sought his daughter. She was in
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" />the music-room, surrounded by several of her
young women companions, each holding some
musical instrument in her hands. Hildegarde
was singing. The duke paused, shutting his
eyes and striving to recall the voice of the
mother. When the voice died away and the
young women leaned back in their chairs to
rest, the duke approached. Upon seeing him
all rose. With a smile he dismissed them.</p>

<p>&quot;My child,&quot; he began, taking Hildegarde's
hand and drawing her toward a window-seat,
&quot;the king of Jugendheit asks for your hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mine, father?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I am to marry the king of Jugendheit?&quot;
There was little joy in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, we have not gone so far as that. The
king, through his uncle, has simply made a
proposal. How would you regard it, knowing
what you do of the past, the years that you
lived in comparative penury, amid hardships,
unknown, and almost without name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is for you to decide, father. Whatever
your decision is, I shall abide by it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a hard lesson we have to learn, my child.<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" />
We can not always marry where we love; diplomacy
and politics make other plans. But fortunately
for you you love no one yet.&quot; He put
his hand under her chin and searched the deeps
of her gray eyes. These eyes were more like
her mother's than anything else about her. &quot;The
king is young, handsome, they say, and rich.
Politically speaking, it would be a great match.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am in your hands. You know what is
best.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke was poignantly disappointed. Why
did she not refuse outright, indignantly, contemptuously,
as became one of the House of Ehrenstein?
Anything rather than this complacency.</p>

<p>&quot;What is he like?&quot; disengaging his hand and
turning her face toward the window.</p>

<p>&quot;That no one seems to know. He has been
to his capital but twice in ten years, which
doubtless pleased his uncle, who loves power for
its own sake. The young king has been in Paris
most of the time. That's the way they educate
kings these days. They teach them all the vices
and make virtue an accident. Your father loves
you, and if you are inclined toward his majesty,
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" />if it is in your heart to become a queen, I shall
not let my prejudices stand in the way.&quot;</p>

<p>She caught up his hand with a strange passion
and kissed it.</p>

<p>&quot;Father, I do not want to marry any one,&quot;
wistfully. &quot;But a queen!&quot; she added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;It is only a sound, my dear; do not let it
delude you. Herbeck advises this alliance, and
while I realize that his judgment is right, my
whole soul revolts against it. But all depends
upon you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would it benefit the people? Would it be
for the good of the state?&quot;</p>

<p>Here was reason. &quot;Yes; my objections are
merely personal,&quot; said the duke.</p>

<p>&quot;For the good of my country, which I love,
I am ready to make any sacrifice. I shall think
it over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well; but weigh the matter carefully.
There is never any retracing a step of this kind.&quot;
He stood up, his heart heavy. Saying no more,
he moved toward the door.</p>

<p>She gazed after him, and suddenly and silently
she stretched out her arms, her eyes and face
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" />and lips yearning with love. Curiously enough,
the duke happened to turn. He was at her side
in a moment, holding her firm in his embrace.</p>

<p>&quot;You are all I have, girl!&quot; with a bit of break
in his voice.</p>

<p>&quot;My father!&quot; She stroked his cheek.</p>

<p>When he left the room it was with lighter
step.</p>

<p>The restoration of the Princess Hildegarde
of Ehrenstein had been the sensation of Europe,
as had been in the earlier days her remarkable
abduction. For sixteen years the search had
gone on fruitlessly. The cleverest adventuresses
on the continent tried devious tricks to
palm themselves off as the lost princess. From
France they had come, from Prussia, Italy,
Austria, Russia and England. But the duke
and the chancellor held the secret, unknown to
any one else&mdash;a locket. In a garret in Dresden
the agents of Herbeck found her, a singer
in the chorus of the opera. The newspapers
and illustrated weeklies raged about her for a
while, elaborated the story of her struggles, the
mysterious remittances which had, from time to
time, saved her from direst poverty, her ambi<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" />tion,
her education which, by dint of hard work,
she had acquired. It was all very puzzling and
interesting and romantic. For what purpose
had she been stolen, and by whom? The duke
accused Franz of Jugendheit, but he did so
privately. Search as they would, the duke and
the chancellor never traced the source of the remittances.
The duke held stubbornly that the
sender of these benefactions was moved by the
impulse of a guilty conscience, and that this
guilty conscience was in Jugendheit. But these
remittances, argued Herbeck, came long after
the death of the old king. He had his agents,
vowed the duke. Herbeck would not listen to
this. He preferred to believe that Count von
Arnsberg was the man.</p>

<p>There was an endless tangle of red tape before
the girl became secure in her rights. But
finally, when William of Prussia and Franz
Josef of Austria congratulated the duke, everybody
else fell into line, and every troop in the
duchy came to Dreiberg to the celebration. Then
the world ran away in pursuit of other adventures,
and forgot all about her serene highness.</p>

<p>And was she happy with all this grandeur,
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" />with all these lackeys and attentions and environs?
Who can say? Sometimes she longed
for the freedom and lack-care of her Dresden
garret, her musician friends, the studios, the
crash and glitter of the opera. To be suddenly
deprived of the fruits of ambition, to reach
such a pinnacle without striving, to be no longer
independent, somehow it was all tasteless with the
going of the novelty.</p>

<p>She looked like a princess, she moved and
acted like one, but after the manner of kindly
fairy princesses in story-books. All fell in love
with her, from the groom who saddled her horse,
to the chancellor, who up to this time was known
never to have loved anything but the state.</p>

<p>She was lovely enough to inspire fervor and
homage and love in all masculine minds. She
was witty and talented. Carmichael said she
was one of the most beautiful women in Europe.
Later he modified this statement by declaring
that she was the most beautiful woman in Europe
or elsewhere. Yet, often she went about as one
in a waking dream. There was an aloofness
which was not born of hauteur but rather of a
lingering doubt of herself.</p>

<p><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" />She was still in the window-seat when the
chancellor was announced. She distrusted him
a little, she knew not why; yet, when he bent
over her hand she was certain that his whole
heart was behind his salute.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness,&quot; he said, &quot;I am come to announce
to you that there waits for you a high
place in the affairs of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The second crown in Jugendheit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your father&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He leaves the matter wholly in my
hands.&quot;</p>

<p>The sparkle in his eyes was the first evidence
of emotion she had ever seen in him. It rather
pleased her.</p>

<p>&quot;It is for the good of the state. A princess
like yourself must never wed an inferior.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would a man who was brave and kind and
resourceful, but without a title, would he be an
inferior?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Assuredly, politically. And I regret to say
that your marriage could never be else than a
matter of politics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am, then, for all that I am a princess,
simply a certificate of exchange?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" />His keen ear caught the bitter undercurrent.
&quot;The king of Jugendheit is young. I do not
see how he can help loving you the moment he
knows you. Who can?&quot; And the chancellor
enjoyed the luxury of a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;But he may not be heart whole.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will be, politically.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Politics, politics; how I hate the word!
Sometimes I regret my garret.&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor frowned. &quot;Your Highness, I
beg of you never to give that thought utterance
in the presence of your father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, believe me, I am not ungrateful; but
all this is new to me, even yet. I am living in
a dream, wondering and wondering when I shall
wake.&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor wrinkled his lips. It was more
of a grimace than a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you consent to this marriage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would it do any good to reject it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the contrary, it would do Ehrenstein
great harm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me a week,&quot; wearily.</p>

<p>&quot;A week!&quot; There was joy on the chancellor's
face now, unmasked, unconcealed. &quot;Oh,
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" />when the moment comes that I see the crown of
Jugendheit on your beautiful head, all my work
shall not have been in vain. So then, within
seven days I shall come for your answer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One way or the other, my answer will be
ready then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is one thing more, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There must not be so many rides in the morning
with his excellency, Herr Carmichael.&quot;</p>

<p>She met his piercing glance with that mild
duplicity known only to women. &quot;He is a gentleman,
he amuses me, and there is no harm.
Grooms are always with us. And often he is only
one of a party.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is politics again, your Highness; I merely
offer the suggestion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marry me to the king of Jugendheit, if you
will, but in this I shall have my way.&quot; But she
laughed as she laid down this law.</p>

<p>He surrendered his doubt. &quot;Well, for a week.
But once the banns are published, it will be neither
wise nor&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Proper? That is a word, Count, that I do
not like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" />Pardon me, your Highness. All this talk is
merely for the sake of saving you needless embarrassment.&quot;</p>

<p>He bowed and took his leave of her.</p>

<p>&quot;Jugendheit! Ah, I had rather my garret, my
garret!&quot;</p>

<p>And her gaze sped across the Platz and lingered
about one of the little window-balconies of
the Grand Hotel.</p>

<h3>THE YOUNG VINTNER</h3>


<p>The Black Eagle (<i>Zum Schwartzen Adler</i>)
in the Adlergasse was a prosperous tavern
of the second rate. The house was two hundred
years old and had been in the Bauer family all
that time.</p>

<p>Had Fr&auml;u Bauer, or Fr&auml;u-Wirtin, as she
was familiarly called, been masculine, she would
have been lightly dubbed Bauer VII. She was a
widow, and therefore uncrowned. She had been
a widow for many a day, for the novelty of being
her own manager had not yet worn off. She was
thirty-eight, plump, pretty in a free-hand manner,
and wise. It was useless to loll about the
English bar where she kept the cash-drawer; it
was useless to whisper sweet nothings into her
ear; it was more than useless, it was foolish.</p>

<p>&quot;Go along with you, Herr; I wouldn't marry
the best man living. I can add the accounts, I
can manage. Why should I marry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" />But marriage is the natural state!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Herr, I crossed the frontier long ago, but
having recrossed it, never again shall I go back.
One crown-forty, if you please. Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>This retort had become almost a habit with
the Fr&auml;u-Wirtin; and when a day went by without
a proposal, she went to bed with the sense
that the day had not been wholly successful.</p>

<p>To-night the main room of the tavern swam in
a blue haze of smoke, which rose to the blackened
rafters, hung with many and various sausages,
cheeses, and dried vegetables. Dishes clattered,
there was a buzzing of voices, a scraping
of feet and chairs, a banging of tankards, altogether
noisy and cheerful. The Fr&auml;u-Wirtin preferred
waitresses, and this preference was shared
by her patrons. They were quicker, cleaner;
they remembered an order better; they were not
always surreptitiously emptying the dregs of
tankards on the way to the bar, as men invariably
did. Besides, the barmaid was an English institution,
and the Fr&auml;u-Wirtin greatly admired
that race, though no one knew why. The girls
fully able to defend themselves, and were
not at all diffident in boxing a smart fellow's ears.<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" />
They had a rough wit and could give and take.
If a man thought this an invitation and tried to
take a kiss, he generally had his face slapped for
his pains, and the Fr&auml;u-Wirtin was always on
the side of her girls.</p>

<p>The smoke was so thick one could scarcely see
two tables away, and if any foreigner chanced to
open a window there was a hubbub; windows were
made for light, not air. There were soldiers, non-commissioned
officers&mdash;for the fall maneuvers
brought many to Dreiberg&mdash;farmers and their
families, and the men of the locality who made
the Black Eagle a kind of socialist club. Socialism
was just taking hold in those days, and the
men were tremendously serious and secretive regarding
it, as it wasn't strong enough to be popular
with governments which ruled by hereditary
might and right.</p>

<p>Gretchen came in, a little better dressed than
in the daytime, the change consisting of coarse
stockings and shoes of leather, of which she was
correspondingly proud.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you want me, Fr&auml;u-Wirtin, for a little
while to-night?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Till nine. Half a crown as usual.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" />Gretchen sought the kitchen and found an
apron and cap. These half-crowns were fine
things to pick up occasionally, for it was only
upon occasions that she worked at the Black
Eagle.</p>

<p>In an obscure corner sat the young vintner.
He had finished his supper and was watching
and scrutinizing all who came in. His face
brightened as he saw the goose-girl; he would
have known that head anywhere, whether he saw
the face or not. He wanted to go to her at once,
but knew this action would not be wise.</p>

<p>In the very corner itself, his back to the vintner's,
and nothing but the wall to look at, was the
old man in tatters and patches, the mountaineer
who possessed a Swiss watch and gave golden
coins to goose-girls. He was busily engaged in
gnawing the leg of a chicken. Between times he
sipped his beer, listening.</p>

<p>Carmichael had forgotten some papers that
day. He had dined early at the hotel and returned
at once to the consulate. He was often a
visitor at the Black Eagle. The beer was sweet
and cool. So, having pocketed his papers, he
was of a mind to carry on a bit of badinage with<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" />
Fr&auml;u Bauer. As he stepped into the big hall,
in his evening clothes, he was as conspicuous as a
passing ship at sea.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, Fr&auml;u-Wirtin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, your Excellency.&quot; She was
quite fluttered when this fine young man spoke to
her. He was the only person who ever caused her
embarrassment, even though temporary. There
was always a whimsical smile on his lips and in
his eyes, and Fr&auml;u Bauer never knew exactly
how to take him. &quot;What is on your mind?&quot;
brightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Many things. You haven't aged the least
since last I saw you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which was day before yesterday!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not any further back than that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned to make change, while Carmichael's
eyes roved in search of a vacant chair. He saw
but one.</p>

<p>&quot;The goose-girl?&quot; he murmured suddenly. &quot;Is
Gretchen one of your waitresses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She comes in once in a while. She's a good
girl and I'm glad to help her,&quot; Fr&auml;u Bauer replied.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" />I do not recollect having seen her here before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is because you rarely come at night.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen carried a tray upon which steamed
a vegetable stew. She saw Carmichael and nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be at yonder table,&quot; he said indicating
the vacant chair. &quot;Will you bring me a
tankard of brown Ehrensteiner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At once, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael made his way to the table. Across
the room he had not recognized the vintner, but
now he remembered. He had crowded him against
a wall two or three days before.</p>

<p>&quot;This seat is not reserved, Herr?&quot; he asked
pleasantly, with his hand on the back of the
chair.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; There was no cordiality in the answer.
The vintner turned back the lid of his stein and
drank slowly.</p>

<p>Carmichael sat down sidewise, viewing the
scene with never-waning interest. These German
taverns were the delight of his soul. Everybody
was so kindly and orderly and hungry.<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" />
They ate and drank like persons whose consciences
were not overburdened. From the corner
of his eye he observed that the vintner was studying
him. Now this vintner's face was something
familiar. Carmichael stirred his memory. It
was not in Dreiberg that he had seen him before.
But where?</p>

<p>Gretchen arrived with the tankard which she
sat down at Carmichael's elbow.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you not join me, Herr?&quot; he invited.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the vintner, without hesitation.</p>

<p>He smiled at Gretchen and she smiled at him.
Carmichael smiled at them both tolerantly.</p>

<p>&quot;What will you be drinking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brown,&quot; said the vintner.</p>

<p>Gretchen took up the empty tankard and
made off. The eyes of the two men followed her
till she reached the dim bar, then their glances
swung round and met. Carmichael was first to
speak, not because he was forced to, but because
it was his fancy at that moment to give the
vintner the best of it.</p>

<p>&quot;She is a fine girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; tentatively.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" />She is the handsomest peasant I ever saw or
knew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know her?&quot; There was a spark in the
vintner's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Only for a few days. She interests me.&quot;
Carmichael produced a pipe and lighted it.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes, the pretty peasant girl always interests
you gentlemen.&quot; There was a note of bitterness.
&quot;Did you come here to seek her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the first time I ever saw her here. And
let me add,&quot; evenly, &quot;that my interest in her is
not of the order you would infer. She is good
and patient and brave, and my interest in her is
impersonal. It is not necessary for me to make
any explanations, but I do so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me!&quot; The vintner was plainly
abashed.</p>

<p>&quot;Granted. But you, you seem to possess a peculiar
interest.&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner flushed. &quot;I have that right,&quot; with
an air which rather mystified Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;That explains everything. I do not recollect
seeing you before in the Black Eagle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am from the north; a vintner, and there
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" />is plenty of work here in the valleys late in September.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The grape,&quot; mused Carmichael. &quot;You will
never learn how to press it as they do in France.
It is wine there; it is vinegar this side of the
Rhine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;France,&quot; said the vintner moodily. &quot;Do you
think there will be any France in the future?&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael laughed. &quot;France is an incurable
cosmic malady; it will always be. It may be
beaten, devastated, throttled, but it will not die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are fond of France?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think it wise to say so here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am the American consul; nobody minds my
opinions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The American consul,&quot; repeated the vintner.</p>

<p>Gretchen could now be seen, wending her return
in and out among the clustering tables. She
set the tankards down, and Carmichael put out
a silver crown.</p>

<p>&quot;And do not bother about the change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are all Americans rich?&quot; she asked soberly.
&quot;Do you never keep the change yourselves?&quot;</p>

<div class="center">

</div>
<h3>&quot;Are all Americans rich?&quot; she asked, soberly.</h3>

<p>&quot;Not when we are in our Sunday clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" />Then it is vanity.&quot; Gretchen shook her head
wisely.</p>

<p>&quot;Mine is worth only four coppers to-night,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p>The vintner laughed pleasantly. Gretchen
looked into his eyes, and an echo found haven in
her own.</p>

<p>Carmichael thirstily drank his first tankard,
thinking: &quot;So this vintner is in love with our
goose-girl? Confound my memory! It never
failed me like this before. I would give twenty
crowns to know where I have seen him. It's only
the time and place that bothers me, not the face.
A fine beer,&quot; he said aloud, holding up the second
tankard.</p>

<p>The vintner raised his; there was an unconscious
grace in the movement. A covert glance
at his hand satisfied Carmichael in regard to one
thing. He might be a vintner, but the hand was
as soft and well-kept as a woman's, for all that
it was stained by wind and sunshine. A handsome
beggar, whoever and whatever he was. But a
second thought disturbed him. Could a man with
hands like these mean well toward Gretchen? He
was a thorough man of the world; he knew inno<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" />ence
at first glance, and Gretchen was both innocent
and unworldly. To the right man she
might be easy prey. Never to a man like Colonel
von Wallenstein, whose power and high office
were alike sinister to any girl of the peasantry;
but a man in the guise of her own class, of her
own world and people, here was a snare Gretchen
might not be able to foresee. He would watch
this fellow, and at the first sign of an evil&mdash;Carmichael's
muscular brown hands opened and shut
ominously. The vintner did not observe this peculiar
expression of the hands; and Carmichael's
face was bland.</p>

<p>A tankard, rapping a table near-by, called
Gretchen to her duties. There was something reluctant
in her step, in the good-by glance, in
the sudden fall of the smiling lips.</p>

<p>&quot;She will make some man a good wife,&quot; said
Carmichael.</p>

<p>The vintner scowled at his tankard.</p>

<p>&quot;He is not sure of her,&quot; thought Carmichael.
Aloud he said: &quot;What a funny world it is!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen is beautiful enough to be a queen,
and yet she is merely a Hebe in a tavern.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />Hebe?&quot; suspiciously. The peasant is always
suspicious of anything he doesn't understand.</p>

<p>&quot;Hebe was a cup-bearer to the mythological
gods in olden times,&quot; Carmichael explained. He
had set a trap, but the vintner had not fallen
into it.</p>

<p>&quot;A fairy-story.&quot; The vintner nodded; he understood
now.</p>

<p>Carmichael's glance once more rested on the
vintner's hand. He would lay another trap.</p>

<p>&quot;What happened to her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Carmichael, &quot;she spilled wine on a
god one day, and they banished her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It must have been a rare vintage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you are familiar with all valleys.
Moselle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. That is a fine country.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man in tatters sat erect in his chair,
but he did not turn his head.</p>

<p>&quot;You have served?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little. If I could be an officer I should like
the army.&quot; The vintner reached for his pipe
which lay on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Try this,&quot; urged Carmichael, offering his
pouch.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" />This will be good tobacco, I know.&quot; The
vintner filled his pipe.</p>

<p>Carmichael followed this gift with many questions
about wines and vintages; and hidden in
these questions were a dozen clever traps. But
the other walked over them, unhesitant, with a
certainty of step which chagrined the trapper.</p>

<p>By and by the vintner rose and bade his table-companion
a good night. He had not offered to
buy anything, another sign puzzling to Carmichael.
This frugality was purely of the thrifty
peasant. But the vintner was not ungrateful,
and he expressed many thanks. On his way to
the door he stopped, whispered into Gretchen's
ear, and passed out into the black street.</p>

<p>&quot;Either he is a fine actor, or he is really what
he says he is.&quot; Carmichael was dissatisfied. &quot;I'll
stake my chances on being president of the
United States, which is safe enough as a wager,
that this fellow is not genuine. I'll watch him.
I've stumbled upon a pretty romance of some
sort, but I fear that it is one-sided.&quot; He wrinkled
his forehead, but that part of his recollection he
aimed to stir remained fallow, in darkness.</p>

<p>The press in the room was thinning. There
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" />were vacant chairs here and there now. A carter
sauntered past and sat down unconcernedly at
the table occupied by the old man whose face
Carmichael had not yet seen. The two exchanged
not even so much as a casual nod. A little later
a butcher approached the same table and seated
himself after the manner of the carter. It was
only when the dusty baker came along and repeated
this procedure, preserving the same silence,
that Carmichael's curiosity was enlivened.
This curiosity, however, was only of the evanescent
order. Undoubtedly they were socialists
and this was a little conclave, and the peculiar
manner of their meeting, the silence and mystery,
were purely fictional. Socialism at that
time revolved round the blowing up of kings, of
demolishing established order. Neither kings
were blown up nor order demolished, but it was
a congenial topic over which to while away an
evening. This was in the German states; in
Russia it was a different matter.</p>

<p>Had Carmichael not fallen a-dreaming over
his pipe he would have seen the old man pass
three slips of paper across the table; he would
have seen the carter, the butcher, and the baker
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" />pocket these slips stolidly; he would have seen the
mountaineer wave his hand sharply and the trio
rise and disperse. And perhaps it would have
been well for him to have noted these singular
manifestations of conspiracy, since shortly he
was to become somewhat involved. It was growing
late; so Carmichael left the Black Eagle,
nursing the sunken ember in his pipe and surrendering
no part of his dream.</p>

<p>Intermediately the mountaineer paid his score
and started for the stairs which led to the bedrooms
above. But he stopped at the bar. A very
old man was having a pail filled with hot cabbage
soup. It was the ancient clock-mender across
the way. The mountaineer was startled out of his
habitual reserve, but he recovered his composure
almost instantly. The clock-mender, his heavy
glasses hanging crookedly on his nose, his whole
aspect that of a weary, broken man, took down
his pail and shuffled noiselessly out. The mountaineer
followed him cautiously. Once in his
shop the clock-mender poured the steaming soup
into a bowl, broke bread in it, and began his
evening meal. The other, his face pressed
against the dim pane, stared and stared.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" /><i>Gott in Himmel!</i> It is <i>he</i>!&quot; he breathed, then
stepped back into the shadow, while the moisture
from his breath slowly faded and disappeared
from the window-pane.</p>

<h3>A COMPATRIOT</h3>


<p>Krumerweg was indeed a crooked way.
It formed a dozen elbows and ragged
half-circles as it slunk off from the Adlergasse.
Streets have character even as humans, and the
Krumerweg reminded one of a person who was
afraid of being followed. The shadow of the
towering bergs lay upon it, and the few stars
that peered down through the narrow crevice of
rambling gables were small, as if the brilliant
planets had neither time nor inclination to watch
over such a place. And yet there lived in the
Krumerweg many a kind and loyal heart,
stricken with poverty. In old times the street
had had an evil name, now it possessed only a pitiful
one.</p>

<p>It was half after nine when Gretchen and the
vintner picked their way over cobbles pitted here
and there with mud-holes. They were arm in arm,
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" />and they laughed when they stumbled, laughed
lightly, as youth always laughs when in love.</p>

<p>&quot;Only a little farther,&quot; said Gretchen, for the
vintner had never before passed over this way.</p>

<p>&quot;Long as it is and crooked, Heaven knows it
is short enough!&quot; He encircled her with his arms
and kissed her. &quot;I love you! I love you!&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>Gretchen was penetrated with rapture, for her
ears, sharp with love and the eternal doubting of
man, knew that falsehood could not lurk in such
music. This handsome boy loved her. Buffeted
as she had been, she could separate the false from
the true. Come never so deep a sorrow, there
would always be this&mdash;he loved her. Her bosom
swelled, her heart throbbed, and she breathed in
ecstasy the sweet chill air that rushed through
the broken street.</p>

<p>&quot;After the vintage,&quot; she said, giving his arm
a pressure. For this handsome fellow was to be
her husband when the vines were pruned and
freshened against the coming winter.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, after the vintage,&quot; he echoed; but there
was tragedy in his heart as deep and profound
as his love.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" />My grandmother&mdash;I call her that for I
haven't any grandmother&mdash;is old and seldom
leaves the house. I promised that after work to-night
I'd bring my man home and let her see how
handsome he is. She is always saying that we
need a man about; and yet, I can do a man's
work as well as the next one. I love you, too,
Leo!&quot; She pulled his hand to her lips and quickly
kissed it, frightened but unashamed.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, Gretchen!&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped. &quot;What is it?&quot; keenly. &quot;There
was pain in your voice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The thought of how I love you hurts me.
There is nothing else, nothing, neither riches nor
crowns, nothing but you, Gretchen. How long
ago was it I met you first?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two weeks? Is it not years? Have I not always
known and loved you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I! What an empty heart and head were
mine till that wonderful day! You were tired and
dusty and footsore; you had walked some twenty
odd miles; yet you helped me with the geese.
There were almost tears in your eyes, but I knew
that your heart was a man's when you smiled at
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" />me.&quot; She stopped again and turned him round
to her. &quot;And you love me like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever betide, <i>Lieberherz</i>, whatever befall.&quot;
And he embraced her with a fierce tenderness,
and so strong was he in the moment that
Gretchen gave a cry. He kissed her, not on the
lips, but on the fine white forehead, reverently.</p>

<p>They proceeded, Gretchen subdued and the
vintner silent, until they came to the end of their
journey at number forty in the Krumerweg. It
was a house of hanging gables, almost as old as
the town itself, solid and grim and taciturn.
There are some houses which talk like gossips,
noisy, obtrusive and provocative. Number forty
was like an old warrior, gone to his chair by the
fireside, who listens to the small-talk of his neighbors
saturninely. What was it all about? Had he
not seen battles and storms, revolutions and
bloodshed? The prattle of children was preferable.</p>

<p>Gretchen's grandmother, Fr&auml;u Schwarz,
owned the house; it was all that barricaded her
from poverty's wolves, and, what with sundry
taxes and repairs and tenants who paid infrequently,
it was little enough. Whatever luxuries
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" />entered at number forty were procured by
Gretchen herself. At present the two stories
were occupied; the second by a malter and his
brood of children, the third by a woman who was
partially bedridden. The lower or ground floor
of four rooms she reserved for herself. As a
matter of fact the forward room, with its huge
middle-age fireplace and the great square of
beamed and plastered walls and stone flooring,
was sizable for all domestic purposes. Gretchen's
pallet stood in a small alcove and the old woman's
bed by the left of the fire.</p>

<p>Gretchen opened the door, which was unlocked.
There was no light in the hall. She pressed her
lover in her arms, kissed him lightly, and pushed
him into the living-room. A log smoldered dimly
on the irons. Gretchen ran forward, turned
over the log, lighted two candles, then kissed the
old woman seated in the one comfortable chair.
The others were simply three-legged stools.
There was little else in the room, save a poor reproduction
of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>&quot;Here I am, grandmother!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who is here with you?&quot; sharply but not
unkindly.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" />My man!&quot; cried Gretchen gaily, her eyes
bright as the candle flames.</p>

<p>&quot;Bring him near me.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen gathered up two stools and placed
them on either side of her grandmother and motioned
to the vintner to sit down. He did so,
easily and without visible embarrassment, even
though the black eyes plunged a glance into his.</p>

<p>Her hair was white and thin, her nose aquiline,
her lips fallen in, a cobweb of wrinkles round her
eyes, down her cheeks, under her chin. But her
sight was undimmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you from? You are not a Dreiberger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From the north, grandmother,&quot; forcing a
smile to his lips.</p>

<p>The reply rather gratified her.</p>

<p>&quot;Your name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leopold Dietrich, a vintner by trade.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak like a Hanoverian or a Prussian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have passed some time in both countries. I
have wandered about a good deal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me your hand.&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner looked surprised for a moment.
Gretchen approved. So he gave the old woman
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" />his left hand. The grandmother smoothed it out
upon her own and bent her shrewd eyes. Silence.
Gretchen could hear the malter stirring above;
the log cracked and burst into flame. A frown
began to gather on the vintner's brow and a
sweat in his palm.</p>

<p>&quot;I see many strange things here,&quot; said the
palmist, in a brooding tone.</p>

<p>&quot;And what do you see?&quot; asked Gretchen eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;I see very little of vineyards. I see riches,
pomp; I see vast armies moving against each
other; there is the smell of powder and fire;
devastation. I do not see you, young man,
among those who tramp with guns on their shoulders.
You ride; there is gold on your arms. You
will become great; but I do not understand. I do
not understand,&quot; closing her eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>The vintner sat upright, his chin truculent,
his arm tense.</p>

<p>&quot;War!&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>Gretchen's heart sank; there was joy in his
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on, grandmother,&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I live?&quot; asked the vintner, whose belief
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" />in prescience till this hour had been of a negative
quality.</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing here save death in old age,
vintner.&quot; Her gnarled hand seized his in a vise.
&quot;Do you mean well by my girl?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Grandmother!&quot; Gretchen remonstrated.</p>

<p>&quot;Silence!&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner withdrew his hand slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this the hand of a liar and a cheat? Is it
the hand of a dishonest man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no dishonesty there; but there are
lines I do not understand. Oh, I can not see
everything; it is like seeing people in a mist.
They pass instantly and disappear. But I repeat,
do you mean well by my girl?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before God and His angels I love her; before
all mankind I would gladly declare it. Gretchen
shall never come to harm at these hands. I
swear it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you.&quot; The old woman's form relaxed
its tenseness.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, grandmother,&quot; said Gretchen.
&quot;Now, read what my hand says.&quot;</p>

<p>The old woman took the hand. She loved
Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" />I read that you are gentle and brave and
cheerful, that you have a loyal heart and a pure
mind. I read that you are in love and that some
day you will be happy.&quot; A smile went over her
face, a kind of winter sunset.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not looking at my hand at all,
grandmother,&quot; said Gretchen in reproach.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not need, my child. Your life is written
in your face.&quot; The grandmother spoke
again to the vintner. &quot;So you will take her
away from me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will it be necessary?&quot; he returned quietly.
&quot;Have you any objection to my becoming your
foster grandchild, such as Gretchen is?&quot;</p>

<p>The old woman made no answer. She closed
her eyes and did not open them. Gretchen motioned
that this was a sign that the interview
was ended. But as he rose to his feet there was
a sound outside. A carriage had stopped. Some
one opened the door and began to climb the
stairs. The noise ceased only when the visitor
reached the top landing. Then all became still
again.</p>

<p>&quot;There is something strange going on up
there,&quot; said Gretchen in a whisper.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" />In what way?&quot; asked the vintner in like undertones.</p>

<p>&quot;Three times a veiled lady has called at night,
three times a man muffled up so one could not
see his face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us not question our twenty-crowns rent,
Gretchen,&quot; interrupted the grandmother, waking.
&quot;So long as no one is disturbed, so long
as the police are not brought to our door, it is
not our affair. Leopold, Gretchen, give me your
hands.&quot; She placed them one upon the other,
then spread out her hands above their heads.
&quot;The Holy Mother bring happiness and good
luck to you, Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to me?&quot; said the youth.</p>

<p>&quot;I could not wish you better luck than to give
you Gretchen. Now, leave me.&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner picked up his hat and Gretchen
led him to the street.</p>

<p>He hurried away, giving no glance at the
closed carriage, the sleepy driver, the weary
horse. Neither did he heed the man dressed as
a carter who, when he saw the vintner, turned
and followed. Finally, when the vintner veered
into the Adlergasse, he stopped, his hands
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" />clenched, his teeth hard upon each other. He
even leaned against the wall of a house, his face
for the moment hidden in his arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Wretch that I am! Damnable wretch!
Krumerweg, Krumerweg! Crooked way, indeed!&quot;
He flung down his arm passionately.
&quot;There will be a God up yonder,&quot; looking at
the stars. &quot;He will see into my heart and know
that it is not bad, only young. Oh, Gretchen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen?&quot; The carter stepped into a
shadow and waited.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Carmichael did not enjoy the opera that
night. He had missed the first acts, and the last
was gruesome, and the royal box was vacant.
Outside he sat down on one of the benches near
the fountains in the Platz. His prolific imagination
took the boundaries. Ah! That morning's
ride, down the southern path of the mountains,
the black squirrels in the branches, the red
fox in the bushes, the clear spring, and the
drink out of the tin cup which hung there for
the thirsty! How prettily she had wrapped a
leaf over the rusted edge of the cup! The leaf
lay in his pocket. He had kissed a dozen times
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" />the spot where her lips had pressed it. Blind
fool! Deeper and deeper; he knew that he never
could go back to that safe ledge of the heart-free.
Time could not change his heart, not if
given the thousand years of the wandering Jew.</p>

<p>Bah! He would walk round the fountain
and cool his crazy pulse. He was Irish, Irish
to the core. Would any one, save an Irishman,
give way, day after day, to those insane maunderings?
His mood was savage; he was at odds
with the world, and most of all, with himself.
If only some one would come along and shoulder
him rudely! He laughed ruefully. He was in
a fine mood to make an ass of himself.</p>

<p>He left the bench and strolled round the fountain,
his cane behind his back, his chin in his
collar. He had made the circle several times,
then he blundered into some one. The fighting
mood was gone now, the walk having calmed
him. He murmured a short apology for his
clumsiness and started on, without even looking
at the animated obstacle.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a moment, my studious friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wallenstein? I didn't see you.&quot; Carmichael
halted.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" />That was evident,&quot; replied the colonel jestingly.
&quot;Heavens! Have you really cares of
state, that you walk five times round this fountain,
bump into me, and start to go on without
so much as a how-do-you-do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm absent-minded,&quot; Carmichael admitted.</p>

<p>&quot;Not always, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not always. You have some other meaning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is possible. Now, I do not believe that
it was absent-mindedness which made you step
in between me and that pretty goose-girl, the
other night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; Carmichael was all alertness.</p>

<p>&quot;It was not, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was coldly premeditated,&quot; said Carmichael,
folding his arms over his cane which he
still held behind his back. His attitude and
voice were pleasant.</p>

<p>&quot;It was not friendly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not to you, perhaps. But that happens to
be an innocent girl, Colonel. You're no Herod.
There was nothing selfish in my act. You really
annoyed her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretense; they always begin that way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" />I confess I know little about that kind of
hunting, but I'm sure you've started the wrong
quarry this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are positive that you were disinterested?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come, Colonel, this sounds like the beginning
of a quarrel; and a quarrel should never
come into life between you and me. I taught
you draw-poker; you ought to be grateful for
that, and to accept my word regarding my disinterestedness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not wish any quarrel, my Captain; but
that girl's face has fascinated me. I propose to
see her as often as I like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no objection to offer; but I told
Gretchen that if any one, no matter who, ever
offers her disrespect, to report the matter to me
at the consulate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is meddling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Call it what you like, my Colonel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, in case she is what you consider insulted,
what will you do?&quot; a challenge in his
tones.</p>

<p>&quot;Report the matter to the police.&quot;</p>

<p>Wallenstein laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" />And if the girl finds no redress there,&quot;
tranquilly, &quot;to the chancellor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You would go so far?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even further,&quot; unruffled.</p>

<p>&quot;It looks as though you had drawn your
saber,&quot; with irony.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I can draw it, Colonel, and when I do I
guarantee you'll find no rust on it. Come,&quot; and
Carmichael held out his hand amicably, &quot;Gretchen
is already in love with one of her kind. Let
the child be in peace. What! Is not the new
ballerina enough conquest? They are all talking
about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good night, Herr Carmichael!&quot; The colonel,
ignoring the friendly hand, saluted stiffly,
wheeled abruptly, and left Carmichael staring
rather stupidly at his empty hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm hanged! All right,&quot; with a tilt
of the shoulders. &quot;One enemy more or less
doesn't matter. I'm not afraid of anything save
this fool heart of mine. If he says an ill word
to Gretchen, and I hear of it, I'll cane the blackguard,
for that's what he is at bottom. Well, I
was looking for trouble, and here it is, sure
enough.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" />He saw a carriage coming along. He recognized
the white horse as it passed the lamps.
He stood still for a space, undecided. Then he
sped rapidly toward the side gates of the royal
gardens. The vehicle stopped there. But this
time no woman came out. Carmichael would
have recognized that lank form anywhere. It
was the chancellor. Well, what of it? Couldn't
the chancellor go out in a common hack if he
wanted to? But who was the lady in the veil?</p>

<p>&quot;I've an idea!&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as the chancellor disappeared, Carmichael
hailed the coachman.</p>

<p>&quot;Drive me through the gardens.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is too late, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, drive me up and down the Strasse
while I finish this cigar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two crowns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three, if your horse behaves well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's as gentle as a lamb, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And doubtless will be served as one before
long. Can't you throw back the top?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In one minute!&quot; Five crowns and three
made eight crowns; not a bad business these dull
times.</p>

<p><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" />Carmichael lolled in the worn cushions, wondering
whether or not to question his man. But
it was so unusual for a person of such particular
habits as the chancellor to ride in an ordinary
carriage. Carmichael slid over to the forward
seat and touched the jehu on the back.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you take the chancellor to-night?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Du lieber Gott!</i> Was that his excellency?
He said he was the chief steward.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So he is, my friend. I was only jesting.
Where did you take him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I took him to the Krumerweg. He was there
half an hour. Number forty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you take the veiled lady?&quot;</p>

<p>The coachman drew in suddenly and apprehensively.
&quot;Herr, are you from the police?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thousand thunders, no! It was by accident
that I stood near the gate when she got out.
Who was she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is better. They both told me that they
were giving charity. I did not see the lady's
face, but she went into number forty, the same
as the steward. You won't forget the extra
crown, Herr?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" />No; I'll make it five. Turn back and leave
me at the Grand Hotel.&quot; Then he muttered:
&quot;Krumerweg, crooked way, number forty. If I
see this old side-paddler stopping at the palace
steps again, I'll take a look at number forty myself.&quot;</p>

<p>On the return to the hotel the station omnibus
had arrived with a solitary guest. A
steamer trunk and a couple of bags were being
trundled in by the porter, while the concierge
was helping a short, stocky man to the ground.
He hurried into the hotel, signed the police slips,
and asked for his room. He seemed to be afraid
of the dark. He was gone when Carmichael
went into the office.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Excellency,&quot; said the concierge, rubbing
his hands and smiling after the manner of
concierges born in Switzerland, &quot;a compatriot
of yours arrived this evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What name?&quot; indifferently. Compatriots
were always asking impossible things of Carmichael,
introductions to the grand duke, invitations
to balls, and so forth, and swearing to
have him recalled if he refused to perform these
offices.</p>

<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" />The concierge picked up the slips which were
to be forwarded to the police.</p>

<p>&quot;He is Hans Grumbach, of New York.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An adopted compatriot, it would seem. He'll
probably be over to the consulate to-morrow to
have his passports looked into. Good night.&quot;</p>

<p>So Hans Grumbach passed out of his mind;
but for all that, fortune and opportunity were
about to knock on Carmichael's door. For there
was a great place in history ready for Hans
Grumbach.</p>

<h3>AT THE BLACK EAGLE</h3>


<p>The day promised to be mild. There was
not a cloud anywhere, and the morning
mists had risen from the valleys. It was good
to stand in the sunshine which seemed to draw
forth all the vagaries and weariness of sleep
from the mind and body. Hans Grumbach
shook himself gratefully. He was standing on
the curb in front of the Grand Hotel, his back
to the sun. It was nine o'clock. The broad
K&ouml;nig Strasse shone, the white stone of the palaces
glared, the fountains glistened, and the coloring
tree tops scintillated like the head-dress of
an Indian prince. Hans was short but strongly
built; a mild blue-eyed German, smooth-faced,
ruddy-cheeked, white-haired, with a brown button
of a nose. He drank his beer with the best
of them, but it never got so far as his nose save
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" />from the outside. His suit was tight-fitting,
but the checks were ample, and the watch-chain
a little too heavy, and the huge garnet on his
third finger was not in good taste. But what's
the odds? Grumbach was satisfied, and it's one's
own satisfaction that counts most.</p>

<p>Presently two police officers came along and
went into the hotel. Grumbach turned with a
sigh and followed them. Doubtless they had
come to look over his passports. And this happened
to be the case.</p>

<p>The senior officer unfolded the precious document.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not yet vis&eacute;ed by your consul,&quot; said
the officer.</p>

<p>&quot;I arrived late last night. I shall see him
this morning,&quot; replied Grumbach.</p>

<p>&quot;You were not born in America?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no; I came from Bavaria.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At what age?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was twenty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you go to America with your parents?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I was alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You still have your permit to leave Bavaria?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" />I believe so; I am not certain. I never
thought in those days I should become rich
enough to travel.&quot;</p>

<p>The word that tingled with gold soothed the
suspicious ear of the officer.</p>

<p>&quot;What is your business in America?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a plumber, now retired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And your business here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Simply pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are forty?&quot; said the officer, referring to
the passports.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is rather young to retire from business.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in America,&quot; easily.</p>

<p>&quot;True, everybody grows rich there, with
gold mines popping open at one's feet. It must
be a great country.&quot; The officer sighed as he
refolded the documents. &quot;As soon as these are
approved by his excellency the American consul,
kindly have a porter bring them over to the
bureau of police. It will be only a matter of
form. I shall return them at once.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach produced a Louis Napoleon which
was then as now acceptable that side of the<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" />
Rhine. It was not done with pomposity, but
rather with the exuberance of a man whose purse
and letter of credit possess an assuring circumference.</p>

<p>&quot;Drink a bottle, you and your comrade,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>This the officer promised to do forthwith. He
returned the passports, put a hand to his cap
respectfully and, followed by his assistant,
walked off briskly.</p>

<p>Grumbach took off his derby and wiped the
perspiration from his forehead. This moisture
had not been wrung forth by any atmospheric
effect. From the top of his forehead to the cowlick
on the back of his head ran a broad white
scar. At one time or another Grumbach had
been on the ragged edge of the long journey.
He went out of doors. There is nothing like
sunshine to tonic the ebbing courage.</p>

<p>Coming up the thoroughfare, with a dash of
spirit and color, was a small troop of horses.
The sunlight broke upon the steel and silver.
A waiter, cleaning off the little iron tables on
the sidewalk, paused. The riders passed, all
but two in splendid uniforms. Grumbach
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" />watched them till they disappeared into the palace
courtyard. He called to the waiter.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The grand duke and some of his staff,
Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The grand duke? Who was the gentleman
in civilian clothes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was his excellency, Herr Carmichael,
the American consul.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good. And the young lady?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her serene highness, the Princess Hildegarde.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bring me a glass of beer,&quot; said Grumbach,
sinking down at a table. A thousand questions
surged against his lips, but he kept them shut
with all the stolidity of his native blood. When
the waiter set the beer down before him, he said:
&quot;Where does Herr Carmichael live?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The consulate is in the Adlergasse. He
himself lives here at the Grand Hotel. <i>Ach</i>!
He is a great man, Herr Carmichael.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A friend of the grand duke, a friend of her
serene highness, liked everywhere, a fine shot
and a great fencer, and rides a horse as if he
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" />were sewn to the saddle. And all the ladies admire
him because he dances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So he dances? Quite a lady's man.&quot; To
Grumbach a man who danced was a lady's man,
something to be held in contempt.</p>

<p>&quot;You would not call him a lady's man, if you
mean he wastes his time on them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you say he dances?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ach, Gott!</i> Don't we all dance to some tune
or other?&quot; cried the waiter philosophically.</p>

<p>&quot;You are right; different music, different
jigs. Take the coppers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Herr.&quot; The waiter continued his
work.</p>

<p>So Herr Carmichael lived here. That would
be convenient. Grumbach decided to wait for
him. He had seen enough of men to know if he
could trust the consul. He glared at the amber-gold
in the glass, took a vigorous swallow, and
smacked his lips. A sentimental old fool; he was
neither more nor less.</p>

<p>The wait for Carmichael was short. The
American consul came along with energetic
stride. He had been to the earlier maneuvers,
and aside from coffee and bacon he had had no
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" />breakfast. The ride and the cold air of morning
had made him ravenous. Grumbach rose
and caught Carmichael by the arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Your pardon, sir,&quot; he said in good English,
&quot;but you are Mr. Carmichael, the American
consul?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you kindly look over my papers?&quot;
Grumbach asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You are from the United States?&quot; Then
Carmichael remembered that this must be the
compatriot who arrived the night before. &quot;I
shall be very glad to see you in the Adlergasse
at half after ten. It is one flight up, next door
to the Black Eagle. Any one will show you the
way. I haven't breakfasted yet, and I can not
transact any business in these dusty clothes.
Good morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach liked the consul's smile. More than
that, he recognized instantly that this handsome
young man was a gentleman. The inherent
respect for caste had not been beaten
out of Grumbach's blood; he had come from a
brood in a peasant's hovel. To him the word
gentleman would always signify birth and good
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" />clothes; what the heart and mind were did not
matter much.</p>

<p>He had more than an hour to idle away, so he
wandered through the park, admiring the freshness
of the green, the well-kept flower-beds, the
crisp hedges, and the clean graveled paths.
There was nothing like it back there in America.
They hadn't the time there; everybody was in the
market, speculating in bubbles. He admired the
snowy fountains, too, and the doves that darted
in and out of the wind-blown spray. There was
nothing like this in America, either. He was
not belittling; he was only making comparisons.
He knew that he would be far happier in his
adopted country, which would accomplish all
these beautiful things farther on.</p>

<p>He looked up heavenward, where the three
bergs shouldered the dazzling snow into the
blue. This impressed him more than all else;
that little wrinkle in the middle berg's ice had
been there when he was a boy. Nothing had
changed in Dreiberg save the K&ouml;nig Strasse,
whose cobbles had been replaced by smooth
blocks of wood. At times he sent swift but uncertain
glances toward the palaces. He longed
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" />to peer through the great iron fence, but he
smothered this desire. He would find out what
he wanted to know when he met Carmichael at
the consulate. Here the bell in the cathedral
struck the tenth hour; not a semitone had this
voice of bronze changed in all these years. It
was good to be here in Dreiberg again. Should
he ask the way to the Adlergasse? Perhaps
this would be wiser. So he put the question to a
policeman. The officer politely gave him a detailed
route.</p>

<p>&quot;Follow these directions and you will have no
trouble in finding the Adlergasse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Much obliged.&quot;</p>

<p>Trouble? Scarcely! He had put out his first
protest against the world in the Adlergasse,
forty years since. He came to a stand before
the old tavern. Not even the sign had been
painted anew, though the oak board was a trifle
paler and there was a little more rust on the
hinges. Many a time he had fought with the
various pot-boys. He wondered if there were
any pot-boys inside now. He noted the dingy
consulate sign, then started up the dark and
narrow stairs. The consulate door stood open.</p>

<p><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />A clerk, native to Ehrenstein, was writing at a
table. At a desk by the window sat Carmichael,
deep in a volume of Dumas. No one ever hurried
here; no one ever had palpitation of the
heart over business. The clerk lifted his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Carmichael?&quot; said Grumbach in English.</p>

<p>The clerk indicated with his pen toward the
individual by the window. Carmichael read on.
Grumbach had assimilated some Americanisms.
He went boldly over and seated himself in the
chair at the side of the desk. With a sigh Carmichael
left Porthos in the grotto of Locmaria.</p>

<p>&quot;I am Mr. Grumbach. I spoke to you this
morning about my passports. Will you kindly
look them over?&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael took the papers, frowning slightly.
Grumbach laid his derby on his knees. The
consul went over the papers, vis&eacute;ed them, and
handed them to their owner.</p>

<p>&quot;You will have no trouble going about with
those,&quot; Carmichael said listlessly. &quot;How long
will you be in Dreiberg?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know,&quot; said Grumbach truthfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything I can do for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" />There is only one thing,&quot; answered Grumbach,
&quot;but you may object, and I shall not blame
you if you do. It will be a great favor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you wish?&quot; more listlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;An invitation to the military ball at the
palace, after the maneuvers,&quot; quietly.</p>

<p>Carmichael sat up. He had not expected so
large an order as this.</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid you are asking something impossible
for me to obtain,&quot; he replied coldly,
thumbing the leaves of his book.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Mr. Carmichael, it is very important
that I should be there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can give you no explanations. I wish to
attend this ball. I do not care to meet the grand
duke or any one else. Put me in the gallery
where I shall not be noticed. That is all I ask
of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That might be done. But you have roused
my curiosity. Your request is out of the ordinary.
You have some purpose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A perfectly harmless one,&quot; said Grumbach,
mopping his forehead.</p>

<p>This movement brought Carmichael's eye to
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" />the scar. Grumbach acknowledged the stare by
running his finger along the subject.</p>

<p>&quot;I came near passing in my checks the day
I got that,&quot; he volunteered. &quot;Everybody looks
at it when I take off my hat. I've tried tonics,
but the hair won't grow there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you get it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At Gettysburg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gettysburg?&quot; with a lively facial change.
&quot;You were in the war?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All through it.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael was no longer indifferent. He
gave his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got a few scars myself. What regiment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The&mdash;&mdash; th cavalry, New York.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What troop?&quot; with growing excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;C troop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was captain of B troop in the same regiment.
Hurrah! Work's over for the day.
Come along with me, Grumbach, and we'll talk
it over down-stairs in the Black Eagle. You're
a godsend. C troop! Hanged if the world
doesn't move things about oddly. I was in the
hospital myself after Gettysburg; a ball in the
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" />leg. And I've rheumatism even now when a
damp spell comes.&quot;</p>

<p>So down to the tavern they went, and there
they talked the battles over, sundry tankards
interpolating. It was &quot;Do you remember this?&quot;
and, &quot;Do you recall that?&quot; with diagrams drawn
in beer on the oaken table.</p>

<p>&quot;But there's one thing, my boy,&quot; said Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The odds were on our side, or we'd be fighting
yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That we would. The poor devils were always
hungry when we whipped them badly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you're from this side of the water?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; went over when I was twenty-two.&quot;
Grumbach sucked his pipe stolidly.</p>

<p>&quot;What part of Germany?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bavaria; it is so written in my passports.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Munich?&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach circled the room. All the near
tables were vacant. The Black Eagle was generally
a lonely place till late in the afternoon.
Grumbach touched the scar tenderly. Could he
trust this man? Could he trust any one in the
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />world? The impulse came to trust Carmichael,
and he did not disregard it.</p>

<p>&quot;I was born in this very street,&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sh! Not so loud! Yes, in this very street.
But if the police knew, I wouldn't be worth
<i>that!</i>&quot;&mdash;with a snap of the fingers. &quot;My passports,
my American citizenship, they would be
worthless. You know that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what does this all mean? What have
you done that you can't come back here openly?&quot;
Here was a mystery. This man with the kindly
face and frank eyes could be no ordinary criminal.
&quot;Can I help you in any way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; no one can help me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why did you come back? You were safe
enough in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who can say what a man will do? Don't
question me. Let be. I have said too much
already. Some day perhaps I shall tell you why.
When I went away I was thin and pale and had
yellow hair. To-day I am fat, gray-headed; I
have made money. Who will recognize me now?
No one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" />But your name?&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach laughed unmusically. &quot;Grumbach
is as good as another. Listen. You are my comrade
now; we have shed our blood on the same
field. There is no tie stronger than that. When
I left Dreiberg there was a reward of a thousand
crowns for me. Dead or alive, preferably
dead.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael was plainly bewildered. He tried
to recall the past history of Ehrenstein which
would offer a niche for this inoffensive-looking
German. He was blocked.</p>

<p>&quot;Dead or alive,&quot; he repeated.</p>

<p>&quot;So.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were mad to return.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know it. But I had to come; I couldn't
help it. Oh, don't look like that! I never hurt
anybody, unless it was in battle&quot;&mdash;na&iuml;vely.
&quot;Ask no more, my friend. I promise to tell you
when the right time comes. Now, will you get
me that invitation to the gallery at the military
ball?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will, if you will give me your word, as a
soldier, as a comrade in arms, that you have
no other purpose than to look at the people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" />As God is my judge&quot;&mdash;solemnly&mdash;&quot;that is
all I wish to do. Now, what has happened since
I went away? I have dared to ask questions of
no one.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael gave him a brief summary of
events, principal among which was the amazing
restoration of the Princess Hildegarde. When
he had finished, Grumbach remained dumb and
motionless for a time.</p>

<p>&quot;And what is her serene highness like?&quot;</p>

<p>To describe the Princess Hildegarde was not
only an easy task, but a pleasant one to Carmichael,
and if he embroidered this description
here and there, Grumbach was too deeply concerned
with the essential points to notice these
variations in the theme.</p>

<p>&quot;So she is gentle and beautiful? Why not?
<i>Ach</i>! You should have seen her mother. She
was the most beautiful woman in all Germany,
and she sang like one of those Italian nightingales.
I recall her when I was a boy. I would
gladly have died at a word from her. All loved
her. The king of Jugendheit wanted her, but
she loved the grand duke. So the Princess<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" />
Hildegarde has come back to her own? God is
good!&quot; And Grumbach bent his head reverently.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Carmichael, beckoning to the
waitress, and paying the score, &quot;if any trouble
rises, send for me. You don't look like a man
who has done anything very bad.&quot; He offered
his hand again.</p>

<p>Grumbach pressed it firmly, and there was a
moisture in his eyes.</p>

<p>Together they returned to the Grand Hotel
for lunch. On the way neither talked very much.
They were both thinking of the same thing, but
from avenues diametrically opposed. Grumbach
declined Carmichael's invitation to lunch, and
immediately sought his own room.</p>

<p>Once there, he closed the shutters so as to
admit but half the day's light, and opened his
battered trunk. From the false bottom, which
had successfully eluded the vigilance of a dozen
frontiers, he took out a small bundle. This he
opened carefully, his eyes blurring. Mad fool
that he had been! How many times had he
gazed at these trinkets in these sixteen or more
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />years? How often had he uttered lamentations
over them? How many times had the talons of
remorse gashed his heart?</p>

<p>Two little yellow shoes, so small that they lay
on his palm as lightly as two butterflies; a
little cloak trimmed with ermine; a golden locket
shaped like a heart!</p>

<h3>AN ELDER BROTHER</h3>


<p>Grumbach was very fond of music, and
in America there were never any bands
except at political meetings or at the head of
processions; and that wasn't the sort of music
he preferred. There was nothing at the Opera,
so he decided to spend the earlier part of the
evening in the public gardens. He was lonely;
he had always been lonely. Men who carry
depressing secrets generally are. He searched
covertly among the many faces for one that was
familiar, but he saw none; and he was at once
glad, and sorry. Yes, there was one face; the
rubicund countenance of the bandmaster. It was
older, more wrinkled, but it was the same. How
many years had the old fellow swung the baton?
At least thirty years. In his boyhood days
Grumbach had put that brilliant uniform side
by side with the grand duke's. As it was impos<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />sible
for him ever to become a duke, his ambition
had been to arrive at the next greatest thing&mdash;the
bandmaster. As he neared the pavilion he
laughed silently and grimly. To have grown
wealthy as a master plumber instead! So much
for ambition!</p>

<p>Subsequently he found himself standing beside
a young vintner and his peasant sweetheart.
Their hands secretly met and locked behind their
backs. Grumbach sighed. Never would he know
aught of this double love. This Eden would
never have any gate for him to push aside. He
would always go his way alone.</p>

<p>The girl turned her head. Seeing Grumbach,
she loosened the vintner's hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not mind me, girl,&quot; said Grumbach, his
face broadening.</p>

<p>The girl laughed easily and without confusion.
Her companion, however, flushed under
his tan, and a scowl ran over his forehead.</p>

<p>The band struck up, and the little comedy
was forgotten. But Grumbach could not see
anything except the girl's face, the fresh,
exquisite turn of her profile. Once his eye
wandered rather guiltily. Her figure was in
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />keeping with her face. Then he saw the little
wooden shoes. Ah, well, as long as kings surrounded
themselves with armies and with pomp,
there would always be wooden shoes. The band
was playing <i>Les Huguenots</i>, and the girl
hummed the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not go there to-night, Gretchen,&quot; said
the vintner.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a crown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will give you two if you will not go,&quot; the
vintner urged.</p>

<p>&quot;Foolish boy, what good would that do? We
need every crown we have or can get, if we are
to be married soon. And you have not gone to
work yet. And every day costs you a crown
to live, and more, for all I know. You spend
a crown as carelessly as if all you had to do was
to pick them off the vines. Crowns are hard
to get.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When one is happy, one does not stop to
bother about crowns,&quot; he said impatiently.</p>

<p>&quot;But will such happiness last? Shall we not
be happier as our crowns accumulate, to ward
off sickness and hunger? Must I teach you
economy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />I shall apply for work to-morrow and waste
no more crowns, my heart.&quot; The vintner's hand
again sought hers, and he sent Grumbach a look
which said: &quot;Smile if you dare!&quot;</p>

<p>But Grumbach did not smile. He was too sad.
He fell into a dream, and the music faded in his
ear and the lights of the pavilion grew dim. He
was a boy again, and he was carrying posies to
the pretty little fr&auml;ulein in the Adlergasse.
Dreams never last, and sometimes they are
rudely interrupted.</p>

<p>A hand was put upon his shoulder authoritatively.
The police officer who had examined
his passports that morning stood at Grumbach's
elbow.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Grumbach,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;his excellency
the chancellor has directed me to bring
you at once to the palace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the palace?&quot; Grumbach's face was expressive
of great astonishment. The officer saw
nothing out of the ordinary in this expression.
Any foreigner would have been seized with confusion
under like circumstances. &quot;To the palace?&quot;
Grumbach repeated. &quot;My passports
were wrong in some respect?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" />Oh, no, Herr; they were correct.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach roused his mind energetically. He
forced down the fast beating of his heart, banished
the astonishment from his face, and even
brought a smile to his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;But whatever can the chancellor want of
me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is not my business. I was simply sent
to find you. His excellency is always interested
in German-Americans. It may be that he wishes
to ask what the future is there in America. We
have more in Dreiberg than we can reasonably
take care of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the prisons?&quot;</p>

<p>The officer laughed. &quot;There and elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that right?&quot; asked Grumbach, now thoroughly
on guard.</p>

<p>&quot;It may not be right to ship our criminals
over there, but it is considered very good politics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go at once? I never expected to
enter the palace of the grand duke of Ehrenstein,&quot;
Grumbach added. &quot;It will be something
to tell of when I go back to America.&quot;</p>

<p>The only thing that reassured him was the
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" />presence of one officer. When they came for a
man on a serious charge, in Ehrenstein, they
came in pairs or fours. So then, there could be
pending nothing vital to his liberty or his incognito.
Besides, his papers were all right, and
now there would be Carmichael to fall back on.</p>

<p>&quot;The palace is lighted up,&quot; was Grumbach's
comment as the two passed the sentry outside
the gates.</p>

<p>&quot;The duke gives the dinner to the diplomatic
corps to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A fine thing to be a diplomat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I myself prefer fighting in the open. Diplomats?
Their very precious hides are never
anywhere near the wars they bring about. No,
no; this way. We go in at the side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll have to guide me. Yes, these diplomats.
Men like you and me do all the work. I
was in the Civil War in America.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was a great fight,&quot; remarked the officer.
&quot;I should like to have been there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Four years; pretty long. Do you know
Herr Carmichael?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The American consul? Oh, yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He and I fought in the same regiment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" />Then you saw some pretty battles.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach took off his hat. &quot;See that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gott</i>! That must have been an ugly one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Almost crossed over when I got it. Is this
the door?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I'll put you in snugly. You will
probably have to wait for his excellency. But
you'll have me for company till he appears.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach entered the palace with a brave
heart and a steady mind.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The grand duke had a warm place in his heart
for the diplomatic corps. He liked to see them
gathered round his table, their uniforms glittering
with orders and decorations. It was always
a night of wits; and he sprang a hundred traps
for comedy's sake, but these astonishing linguists
seldom if ever blundered into one of them.
They were eternally vigilant. It was no trifling
matter to swing the thought from German into
French or Italian or Hungarian; but they were
seasoned veterans in the game, all save Carmichael,
who spoke only French and German
fluently. The duke, however, never tried needlessly
to embarrass him. He admired Car<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" />michael's
mental agility. Never he thrust so
keenly that the American was found lacking in
an effective though simple parry.</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness must recollect that I am not
familiar with that tongue.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, Herr Captain!&quot;</p>

<p>But there was always a twinkle in the ducal
eye and an answering smile in the consul's.</p>

<p>The somber black of Carmichael's evening
dress stood out conspicuously among the blue
and green and red uniforms. Etiquette compelled
him to wear silk stockings, but that was the
single concession on his part. He wore no
orders. An order of the third or fourth class
held no allurement. Nothing less than the
Golden Fleece would have interested him, and
the grand duke himself could not boast of this
rare and distinguished order. In truth, Carmichael
coveted nothing but a medal for valor,
and his own country had not yet come to recognize
the usefulness of such a distinction.</p>

<p>All round him sat ministers or ambassadors;
he alone represented a consulate. So his place
at the table was honorary rather than diplomatic.
It was his lively humorous personality
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" />the grand duke admired, not his representations.</p>

<p>The duke sat at the head of the table and her
serene highness at the foot; and it was by the
force of his brilliant wit that the princess did
not hold in perpetuity the court at her end of
the table. For a German princess of that time
she was highly accomplished; she was ardent,
whimsical, with a flashing mentality which
rounded out and perfected her physical loveliness.
Above and beyond all this, she had suffered,
she had felt the pangs of poverty, the
smart of unrecognized merit; she had been one
of the people, and her sympathies would always
be with them, for she knew what those about her
only vaguely knew, the patience, the unmurmuring
bravery of the poor. Never would she
become sated with power so long as it gave her
the right to aid the people. Never a new tax
was levied that she did not lighten it in some
manner; never an oppressive law was promulgated
that she did not soften its severity. And
so the populace loved her, for it did not take
the people long to find out what she was trying
to do for them. And perhaps they loved her
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" />because she had lived the greater part of her
young life as one of them.</p>

<p>To-night there was love in the duke's eyes as
he looked down the table's length; there was
love in the old chancellor's eyes, too; and in
Carmichael's. And there was love in her eyes
as she gazed back at the two old men. But who
could read her eyes whenever they roved in
Carmichael's direction? Not even Gretchen's
grandmother, who lived in the Krumerweg.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said the duke, rising and holding
up his glass, &quot;this night I give you a toast
which I believe will be agreeable to all of you,
especially to his excellency, Baron von Steinbock
of Jugendheit. What is past is past; a new
regime begins this night.&quot; He paused. All
eyes were focused upon him in wonder. Only
Baron von Steinbock displayed no more than
ordinary interest. &quot;I give you,&quot; resumed the
duke, &quot;her serene highness and his majesty,
Frederick of Jugendheit!&quot;</p>

<p>The princess grew delicately pale as the men
and women sprang to their feet. Every hand
swept toward her, holding a glass. She had
surrendered that morning. Not because she
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" />wished to be a queen, not because she cared to
bring about an alliance between the two countries;
no, it was because she was afraid and had
burned the bridge behind her.</p>

<p>The tan thinned on Carmichael's face, but his
hand was steady. Never would he forget the
tableau. She sat still in her chair, her lids
drooped, but a proud lift to her chin. The collar
of pearls round her neck had scarce more luster
than her shoulders. How red her lips seemed
against the whiteness of her skin! Beautiful
to him beyond all dreams of beauty. God send
another war and let him die in the heart of it,
fighting! To dream lies as he had done this
twelvemonth, to break his heart over the moon!
He sat his glass down untouched, happily unobserved.
He was in misery; he wanted to be
alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Long live her majesty!&quot; thundered the chancellor.
He, too, was pale, but the fire of great
things burned in his eyes and his lank form
took upon itself a transient majesty.</p>

<p>In the ball-room the princess was surrounded;
everybody flattered her; congratulated her,
and complimented her. All agreed that it was
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />a great political stroke. And indeed it was, but
none of them knew how great.</p>

<p>Carmichael was among the last to approach
her. By this time he had his voice and nerves
under control. Without apparent volition they
walked down the stairs which led to the
conservatory.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought perhaps you had forgotten me,&quot;
she said.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/image004.jpg"><img src="images/image004.jpg"
alt="&quot;I thought you had forgotten me,&quot; she said." width="50%"
title="&quot;I thought you had forgotten me,&quot; she said." /></a>
</div>
<h3>&quot;I thought you had forgotten me,&quot; she said.</h3>

<p>&quot;Forget your highness? Do not give me
credit for such an impossibility.&quot; He bowed
over her hand and brushed it with his lips, for
she was almost royal now. &quot;Your highness will
be happy. It is written.&quot; He stepped back
slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you the gift of prescience?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this instance. You will be a great queen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; dreamily. &quot;When I recall
what I have gone through, all this seems like an
enchantment out of a fairy-book, and that I must
soon wake up in my garret in Dresden.&quot;</p>

<p>If only it might be an enchantment! he
thought. If only he might find her as the grim
old chancellor had found her, in a garret! What?</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" />Why did you do that?&quot; she asked quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shrugged.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your highness' pardon!&quot; flushing. &quot;I
was not conscious of such rudeness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is not answering my question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg of your highness&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My highness commands!&quot; But her voice was
gentle.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a momentary dream I had; and the
thought of its utter impossibility caused me to
shrug. I assure your highness that it was a
philosophical shrug, such as the Stoics were wont
to indulge in.&quot; He spoke lightly. Only his eyes
were serious.</p>

<p>&quot;And this dream; was there not a woman in
it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no; there was only an angel.&quot;</p>

<p>She knew that it was not proper to question
him in this manner; but neither her heart nor her
mind were formal to-night.</p>

<p>&quot;You interest me; you always interest me.
You have seen so many wonderful things. And
now it is angels.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only one, your Highness.&quot; This was daring.<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" />
&quot;But perhaps I am putting my foot where angels
fear to tread,&quot; which was still more daring.</p>

<p>&quot;Angels ought not to be afraid of anything.&quot;
She laughed; there was a pain and a joy in the
sound of it. She read his heart as one might
read a written line.</p>

<p>&quot;Dreams are always unfinished things,&quot; he
said, getting back on safer ground.</p>

<p>&quot;What is she like, this angel?&quot; forcing him
upon dangerous ground again wilfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Who may describe an angel one has seen only
in a golden dream?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will not tell me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dare not!&quot; His eyes sought hers unflinchingly.
This moment he was mad, and had not
the chancellor and Baron von Steinbock came up,
Heaven only knew what further madness would
have unbridled his tongue.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness,&quot; began the benign voice of
the chancellor, &quot;the baron desires, in the name of
his august master, to open the ball with you. Behold
my fairy-wand,&quot; gaily. &quot;This night I have
made you a queen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you make me happy also?&quot; said she, so
low that only the chancellor heard her.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" />I shall try. Ah, Herr Captain,&quot; with a
friendly jerk of his head toward Carmichael;
&quot;will you do me the honor to join me in my cabinet,
quarter of an hour hence?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be there, your Excellency.&quot; Carmichael
was uneasy. He was not certain how much
the chancellor had heard.</p>

<p>&quot;A little diplomatic business in which I shall
need your assistance,&quot; supplemented the chancellor.</p>

<p>Carmichael, instead of loitering uselessly in
the ball-room, at once sought the chancellor's
cabinet. He wanted to be alone. He made
known his business to the chancellor's valet who
admitted him. He stopped just across the
threshold. To his surprise the room was already
tenanted. Grumbach and a police officer!</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Grumbach, what are you doing here?&quot;
cried Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Waiting for his excellency. We have been
here something past an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the trouble?&quot; Carmichael inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Your excellency knows as much as I do,&quot; said
the officer, who was in fact no less than the sub-chief
of the bureau.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" />And I am in the dark, also,&quot; said Grumbach,
twirling his hat.</p>

<p>Carmichael walked about, studying the many
curios. Occasionally Grumbach wiped his forehead,
and, absently, the inner rim of his hat.
Perhaps the three of them waited twenty minutes;
then the chancellor came in. He bowed
cordially and drew chairs about his desk. He
placed Grumbach in the full glare of the lamp.
Carmichael and the sub-chief were in the half-light.
The chancellor was last to seat himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Grumbach,&quot; said the chancellor in a
mild tone, &quot;I should like to see your papers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My passports, your Excellency?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach laid them on the desk imperturbably.
The chancellor struck the bell. His valet
answered immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;Send Breunner, the head gardener, at once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is in the anteroom, Excellency.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell him to come in.&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor shot a piercing glance at
Grumbach, but the latter was studying the mural
decorations.</p>

<p>Carmichael sat tight in his chair, curious to
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" />learn what it was all about. Breunner entered.
He was thin and partly bald and quite fifty.</p>

<p>&quot;Breunner, her highness will need many flowers
to-morrow. See to it that they are cut in the
morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It shall be done, Excellency.&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor turned to the passports.</p>

<p>&quot;There is only one question, Herr Grumbach.
It says here that you were a native of Bavaria
before going to America. How long ago did
you leave Bavaria?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A good many years, your Excellency.&quot;
Grumbach inspected the label in his hat.</p>

<p>&quot;You have, of course, retained your Bavarian
passport?&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael was now leaning forward in his
chair, deeply interested. He saw that the chancellor
was watching Grumbach as a cat watches
a mouse-hole.</p>

<p>Grumbach brought forth a bulky wallet. The
edges of Bank of England notes could be seen,
of fat denominations.</p>

<p>&quot;Here it is, your Excellency; a little ragged,
but readable still.&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor went over it carefully.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" />Herr Captain, do you know this compatriot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We fought side by side in the American war.
I saw no irregularity in his papers. I am rather
astonished to see him here and not at the police
bureau, if any question has arisen over his passports.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fought side by side,&quot; the chancellor repeated
thoughtfully. &quot;Then he is no stranger to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not say that. We were, however, in the
same cavalry, only in different troops. Grumbach,
you have your honorable discharge with
you?&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach went into his wallet still again.
This document the chancellor read with an interest
foreign to the affair under his hand. Presently
he laughed softly. Why, he could not
readily have told.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry, Herr Grumbach. All this unnecessary
trouble simply because of the word Bavaria.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No trouble at all, your Excellency,&quot; restoring
his papers. &quot;I have seen the inside of a real
palace, and I never expected such an honor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How long will you be making your visit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" />Only a few days, your Excellency. Then I
shall proceed to Bavaria.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your excellency has no further orders?&quot; said
the head gardener patiently.</p>

<p>&quot;Good Heaven, Breunner, I had forgotten all
about you! There is nothing more. Gentlemen,
your pardon for having detained you so long.
Herr Captain, you will return with me to the
ball-room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If your excellency will excuse me, no. I am
tired. I shall return to the hotel with Herr
Grumbach.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you please. Good night.&quot;</p>

<p>The three left the cabinet under various emotions.
The sub-chief bowed himself off at the
gates, and Carmichael and Grumbach crossed
the Platz leisurely.</p>

<p>&quot;How did you come by that Bavarian passport?&quot;
asked Carmichael abruptly.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a forgery, my friend, but his excellency
will never find that out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have me all at sea. Why did he bring
in the head gardener and leave him standing
there all that while?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" />He had a sound purpose, but it fell. The
head gardener did not recognize me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He is my elder brother.&quot;</p>

<h3>THE KING'S LETTER</h3>


<p>The ambassador from Jugendheit, Baron
von Steinbock, was not popular in Dreiberg,
at least not among the people, who still held
to the grand duke's idea that the kingdom had
been behind the abduction of the Princess Hildegarde.
The citizens scowled at his carriage, they
scowled at the mention of his name, they scowled
whenever they passed the embassy, which stood
in the heart of the fashionable residences in the
K&ouml;nig Strasse. Never a hot-headed Dreiberger
passed the house without a desire to loot it, to
scale the piked fence and batter in the doors and
windows. Steinbock himself was a polished, amiable
gentleman, in no wise meriting this ill-feeling.
The embassy was in all manner the most
important in Dreiberg, though Prussia and Austria
overshadowed it in wealth and prestige.</p>

<p><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" />At this moment the people gazed at the house
less in rancor than in astonishment. The king
of Jugendheit was to marry her serene highness!
It was a bad business, a bad business; no good
would come of it. The great duke was a weak
man, after all.</p>

<p>The menials in and about the embassy felt the
new importance of their positions. So then, imagine
the indignation of the majordomo, when,
summoned at dusk one evening to the carriage
gates, three or four days after the portentous
news had issued from the palace, he found only
a ragged and grimy carter who demanded peremptorily
to be admitted and taken to his excellency
at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Be off with you, ragamuffin!&quot; growled the
majordomo.</p>

<p>&quot;Be quick; open the gates!&quot; replied the carter,
swinging his whip threateningly.</p>

<p>&quot;Go away!&quot; The majordomo spun on his
heels contemptuously.</p>

<p>&quot;I will skin you alive,&quot; vowed the carter, striking
the iron with the butt of his whip, &quot;if you do
not open these gates immediately. Open!&quot;</p>

<p>There was real menace this time. Could the
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" />fellow be crazy? The majordomo concluded to
temporize.</p>

<p>&quot;My good man,&quot; he said conciliatorily, &quot;you
have brains. You ought to know that his excellency
will receive no man in your condition. If
you do not stop hammering on those bars, I shall
send for the police.&quot;</p>

<p>The carter thrust a hand through the grill.
There was a ring on one of his fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;Imbecile, set your eye on that and admit me
without more ado!&quot;</p>

<p>The majordomo was thunderstruck. Indeed, a
blast from the heavens would have jarred him
less.</p>

<p>&quot;Open, then!&quot;</p>

<p>The majordomo threw back the bolts and the
carter pushed his way in. That ring on the
carter's finger? The majordomo felt himself
slipping into a fantastic dream.</p>

<p>&quot;Take me to the baron.&quot;</p>

<p>Vastly subdued the majordomo preceded the
carter into the office of the embassy. There he
left the strange guest and went in search of the
baron. The ambassador was in his study, reading.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" />Your Excellency, there is a man in the office
who desires to see you quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>The ambassador laid down his book. &quot;Upon
what pretense did he gain admittance at this
hour?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;I refused him admittance, your Excellency,
because he was dressed like a carter.&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A carter!&quot; The ambassador wrathfully
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;One moment, your Excellency. He wore a
ring on his finger, and I could not refuse him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A ring, you say?&quot;</p>

<p>Guarding his voice with his hand, the majordomo
whispered two words.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, and dressed like a carter? What the
devil!&quot; The ambassador rushed from the study.</p>

<p>It was dark in the embassy office. Quickly the
ambassador lighted some candles. Gas would be
too bright for such a meeting.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, your Excellency?&quot; said a voice from
the leather lounge.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; For this was not the voice
the baron expected to hear.</p>

<p>&quot;My name at present does not matter. The
news I bring is far more important. His majesty
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" />emphatically declines any alliance with the House
of Ehrenstein.&quot;</p>

<p>The ambassador stumbled into a chair, his
mind dulled, his shoulders inert. This was a
blow.</p>

<p>&quot;Declines?&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>&quot;He repudiates his uncle's negotiations absolutely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Damnation!&quot; swore the ambassador, coming
to life once more.</p>

<p>&quot;The exact word used by the prince; in fact,
the word has become common property in the last
forty-eight hours. Now then, what's to be done?
What do you suggest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This means war. The duke will never swallow
such an insult.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;War! It looks as if you and I, Baron, shall
not accompany the king of Prussia into Alsace-Lorraine.
We shall have entertainment at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is horrible!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The devil of a muddle!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what possessed the prince to blunder like
this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The prince really is not to blame. Our king,
Baron, is a young colt. A few months ago he
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" />gave his royal uncle carte blanche to seek a wife
for him. Politics demanded an alliance between
Jugendheit and Ehrenstein. There have been
too many years of useless antagonism. On the
head of this bolt from Heaven comes the declaration
of his majesty that he will marry any other
princess on the continent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They will pull this place down, brick by
brick!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let them! We have ten thousand more
troops than Ehrenstein.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You young men are a pack of fools!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Softly, Baron.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You would like nothing better than war.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unless it is peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the king?&quot;</p>

<p>The carter smiled. &quot;He is hunting, they say,
with the crown prince of Bavaria.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you, why have you come dressed like
this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is a little secret which I am not at liberty
to disclose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, great God, what's to be done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lie,&quot; urbanely.</p>

<p>&quot;What good will lies do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" />They will suspend the catastrophe till we are
ready to meet it. The marriage is not to take
place till spring. That will give us plenty of
time. After the coronation his majesty may be
brought to reason. This marriage must not fall
through now. The grand duke will not care to
become the laughing-stock of Europe. The
prince's advice is for you to go about your affairs
as usual. Only one man must be taken into
your confidence, and that man is Herbeck. If
any one can straighten out his end of the tangle
it is he. He is a big man, of fertile invention;
he will understand. If this thing falls through
his honors will fall with it. He will work toward
peace, though from what I have learned the duke
would not shun war.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the prince?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wherever he is, he is working for the best
interests of the state. Don't worry about his
royal highness; he's a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When did you come?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This morning. Though I have been here
before in this same guise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is the Bavarian princess,&quot; remarked
the ambassador musingly.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" />Ha! A good thought! But the king is romantic;
she is older than he, and ugly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not telling me everything,&quot; intuitively.</p>

<p>&quot;I know it. I am telling you all that is at
present necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You make me the unhappiest man in the
kingdom! I have worked so hard and long toward
this end. When did the king decline this
alliance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Evidently the moment he heard of it. I have
his letter in my pocket. I am requested to read
it to you. Listen:</p>

<p>&quot;'MY ILLUSTRIOUS AND INDUSTRIOUS UNCLE:
I regret exceedingly that at this late day I
should cause you political embarrassment; but
when I gave my consent to the espousal of any of
the various princesses at liberty, surely it was
understood that Ehrenstein was not to be considered.
I refuse to marry the daughter of the
man who privately strove to cover my father
with contumely, who dared impute to him a crime
that was any man's but my father's. I realize
that certain policies called for this stroke on
your part, but it can not be. My dear uncle, you
have digged a fine pit, and I hope you will find
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" />a safe way out of it. I refuse to marry the Princess
Hildegarde. This is final. It can be arranged
without any discredit to the duke or to
yourself. Let it be said that her serene highness
has thrown me over. I shan't go to war about it.</p>

<p>&quot;'FREDERICK.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Observe 'My illustrious and industrious uncle'!&quot;
laughed the carter without mirth. &quot;Our
king, you will see, has a graceful style.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your tone is not respectful,&quot; warned the ambassador.</p>

<p>&quot;Neither is the state of my mind. Oh, my king
is a fine fellow; he will settle down like his father
before him; but to-day&mdash;&quot; The carter dropped
his arms dejectedly.</p>

<p>&quot;There is something going on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What, you are likely to learn at any moment.
Pardon me, Baron, but if I dared I would tell you
all. But his highness' commands are over me
and I must obey them. It would be a mental relief
to tell some one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Curse these opera-dancers!&quot;</p>

<p>The carter laughed. &quot;Aye, where kings are
concerned. But you do him injustice. Frederick
is as mild as Strephon.&quot; He gained his feet.<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" />
He was young, pleasant of face, but a thorough
soldier.</p>

<p>&quot;You are Lieutenant von Radenstein!&quot; cried
the ambassador. &quot;I recognize you now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, your Excellency!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are in the royal household, the regent's
invisible arm. I have heard a good deal about
you. I knew your father well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again, thanks. Now, the regent has heard
certain rumors regarding an American named
Carmichael, a consul. He is often seen with her
highness. Rather an extraordinary privilege.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rest your mind there, Lieutenant. This Carmichael
is harmless. You understand, her highness
has not always been surrounded by royal etiquette.
She has had her freedom too long not to
grow restive under restraint. The American is a
pleasant fellow, but not worth considering.
Americans will never understand the ways of
court life. Still, he is a gentleman, and so far
there is nothing compromising in that situation.
He can be eliminated at any time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is reassuring. You will see the chancellor
to-night and show him this letter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" />I will, and God help us all to straighten out
this blunder!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Amen to that! One word more, and then I'm
off. If a butcher or a baker, or even a mountaineer
pulls the bell-cord and shows this ring,
admit him without fail. He will have vital news.
And now, good night and good luck to your excellency.&quot;</p>

<p>For half an hour the ambassador remained
staring at the candlesticks. By and by he resumed
his chair. What should he do? Where
should he begin? Suppose the chancellor
should look at the situation adversely, from the
duke's angle of vision, should the duke learn?
There was but one thing to do and that was to
go boldly to Herbeck and lay the matter before
him frankly. Neither Jugendheit nor Ehrenstein
wanted war. The chancellor was wise; it
would be better to dally with the truth than needlessly
to sacrifice ten thousand lives. But what
had the lieutenant further to conceal? The ambassador
wanted no dinner. He rang for his hat
and coat, and twenty minutes later he was in the
chancellor's cabinet.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" />You seem out of health, Baron,&quot; was the
chancellor's greeting.</p>

<p>&quot;I am indeed that, Count. I received a letter
to-day from the prince regent. It was sent to
him by his majesty, who is hunting in Bavaria.
Read it, Count, but I pray to you to do nothing
hastily.&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor did not open the letter, he
merely balanced it. That so light a thing should
be so heavy with dark portents! His accustomed
pallor assumed a grayish tinge.</p>

<p>&quot;So his majesty declines?&quot; he said evenly.
&quot;You have already heard?&quot; cried the amazed
ambassador.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing; I surmise. The hour, your appearance,
the letter&mdash;to what else could they point?</p>

<p>I was afraid all along. Strange instinct we have
at times. The regent is to be pitied; he took
too much for granted. He has been used to
power one day too long. Ah, if his majesty
could but see her, could only know how lovely
she is in heart and mind and face! Is she not
worthy a crown?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Herbeck, nothing would please me better,
nothing would afford my country greater pleas<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" />ure
and satisfaction, than to see this marriage
consummated. It would nail that baseless lie
which has so long been current.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you. We two peoples should be
friendly. It has taken me months to bring this
matter round. The duke rebelled; her highness
scorned the hand of Frederick. One by one I
had to overcome their objections&mdash;to this end.
The past refuses to be buried. Still, if you saw
all the evidence in the case you would not blame
the duke for his attitude.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But those documents are rank forgeries!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So they may be, but that has not been
proved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should his late majesty abduct the
daughter of the grand duke? For what benefits?
To what end? Ah, Count, if some motive could
be brought forward, some motive that could
stand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Motives, my friend? They spring from the
most unheard-of places. And motives in action
are always based on impulses. But let us waste
no time on retrospection. It is the present which
confronts us. You do not want war.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No more do you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" />What remedy do you suggest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ask, nay, I plead that question of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I represent the offended party.&quot; The chancellor's
gaunt features lighted with a transient
smile. &quot;Proceed, Baron.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suggest, then, that the duke must not
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Agreed. Go on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will put the matter before her highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will be difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let her repudiate the negotiations. Let her
say that she has changed her mind. His majesty
is quite willing that the humiliation be his.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is generous. But suppose she has set
her heart on the crown of Jugendheit? What
then?&quot;</p>

<p>The baron bit the ends of his mustache.</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose that?&quot; the chancellor pressed relentlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;In that event, the affair is no longer in our
hands but in God's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As all affairs are. Is there no way of changing
the king's mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Read the letter, Count,&quot; said the ambassador.</p>

<p>Herbeck hunted for the postmark: Bavaria.<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" />
He read the letter. There was nothing between
the lines. It was the work of rather an irresponsible boy.</p>

<p>&quot;May I take this to her highness?&quot; asked the
chancellor.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I promise its contents will not go beyond her
eye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will take the risk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His majesty is very young,&quot; was the chancellor's
comment.</p>

<p>&quot;Young! He is a child. He has been in his
palace twice in ten years. He is travel-mad. He
has been wandering in France, Holland, England,
Belgium. He tells his uncle to play the
king till the coronation. Imagine it! And the
prince has found this authority so pleasant and
natural that he took it for granted that his
majesty would marry whomever he selected for
him. To have allowed us to go forward, as we
have done, believing that he had the whole confidence
of the king!&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck consulted his watch. It was half
after six. Her highness did not dine till eight.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall go to her highness immediately,<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" />
Baron. I shall return the letter by messenger,
and he will tell you the result of the interview.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God be with you,&quot; said the ambassador, preparing
to take his leave, &quot;for all women are contrary.&quot;</p>

<p>After the baron was gone the chancellor paced
the room with halting step. Then, toward the
wraith of his ambition he waved a hand as if to
explain how futile are the schemes of men. He
shook himself free from this idle moment and
proceeded to the apartments of her highness.
Would she toss aside this crown, or would she
fight for it? He found her alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, my good fairy, what is in your magic
wand to-night?&quot; she asked. How fond she was
of this great good man, and how lonely he always
seemed!</p>

<p>He saluted her hand respectfully. &quot;I am not
a good fairy to-night, your Highness. On the
contrary, I am an ogre. I have here a letter. I
have given my word that its contents shall not
be repeated to the duke, your father. If I let you
read it, will you agree to that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And who has written this letter?&quot; non-committally.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" />His majesty, the king of Jugendheit,&quot;
slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;A letter from the king?&quot; she cried, curious.
&quot;Should it not be brought to me on a golden salver?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is probable that I am bringing it to you at
the end&mdash;of a bayonet,&quot; solemnly. &quot;If the duke
learns its contents the inevitable result will be
war.&quot;</p>

<p>A silence fell upon them and grew. This was
the bitterest moment but one in the chancellor's
life.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe,&quot; she said finally, &quot;that it will not be
necessary to read his majesty's letter. He declines
the honor of my hand: is that not it?&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor signified that it was.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; with a note of pride in her voice and a
flash in her eyes. &quot;And I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will tell the duke that you have changed
your mind,&quot; gravely.</p>

<p>&quot;Do princesses change their minds like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have often done so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In spite of publicity?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I refuse to change my mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" />I am resigned to any and all events.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;War.&quot; Her face was serious. &quot;And what
has the king to suggest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He proposes to accept the humiliation of being
rejected by you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, this is a gallant king! Pouff! There
goes a crown of thistledown.&quot; She smiled at the
chancellor, then she laughed. There was nothing
but youth in the laughter, youth and gladness.
&quot;Oh, I knew that you were a good fairy. Listen
to me. I declare to you that I am happier at this
moment than I have been in days. To marry a
man I have never seen, to become the wife of a
man who is nothing to me, whose looks, character,
and habits are unknown; why, I have lived
in a kind of horror. You did not find me soon
enough; there are yet some popular ideas in my
head which are alien to the minds of princesses.
I am free!&quot; And she uttered the words as with
the breath of spring.</p>

<p>The chancellor's shoulders drooped a trifle
more, and his hand closed down over the letter.
Otherwise there was no notable change in his appearance.
He was always guarding the muscles
of his face. Inscrutability is the first lesson of
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" />the diplomat; and he had learned it thirty years
before.</p>

<p>&quot;There will be no war,&quot; resumed her highness.
&quot;I know my father; our wills may clash, but in
this instance mine shall be the stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But this is not the end.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean that there will be other kings?&quot;
She had not thought of this, and some of the
brightness vanished from her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, there will be other kings. I am sorry.
What young girl has not her dream of romance?
But princesses must not have romances. Yours,
my child, must be a political marriage. It is a
harsh decree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have not princesses married commoners?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never wisely. Your highness will not make
a mistake like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My highness will or will not marry, as she
pleases. Am I a chattel, that I am to be offered
across this frontier or that?&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor moved uneasily. &quot;If your
highness loved out of your class, which I know
you do not, I should be worried.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I did?&quot; with a rebel tilt to her chin.</p>

<p>&quot;Till that moment arrives I shall not borrow
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" />trouble. You will, then, tell the duke that you
have changed your mind, that you have reconsidered?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This evening. Now, godfather, you may kiss
her serene highness on the forehead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This honor to me?&quot; The chancellor trembled.</p>

<p>&quot;Even so.&quot;</p>

<p>He did not touch her with Ne hands, but the
kiss he put on her forehead was a benediction.</p>

<p>&quot;You may go now,&quot; she said, &quot;for I shall need
the whole room to dance in. I am free, if only
for a little while!&quot;</p>

<p>Outside the door the chancellor paused. She
was singing. It was the same aria he had heard
that memorable night when he found her in the
dim garret.</p>

<h3>GRETCHEN'S DAY</h3>


<p>Gretchen was always up when the
morning was rosy, when the trees were
still dark and motionless, and the beads of dew
white and frostlike. For what is better than to
meet the day as it comes over the mountains, and
silence breaks here and there, in the houses and
streets, in the fields and the vineyards? Let old
age, which has played its part and taken to the
wings of the stage, let old age loiter in the morning,
but not green years. Gretchen awoke as the
birds awoke, with snatches and little trills of
song. To her nearest neighbors there was about
her that which reminded them of the regularity
of a good clock; when they heard her voice they
knew it was time to get up.</p>

<p>She was always busy in the morning. The tinkle
of the bell outside brought her to the door,
and her two goats came pattering in to be re<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" />lieved
of their creamy burden. Gretchen was
fond of them; they needed no care at all. The
moment she had milked them they went tinkling
off to the steep pastures.</p>

<p>Even in midsummer the dawn was chill in
Dreiberg. She blew on her fingers. The fire was
down to the last ember; so she went into the cluttered
courtyard and broke into pieces one of the
limbs she had carried up from the valley earlier
in the season. The fire renewed its cheerful
crackle, the kettle boiled briskly, and the frugal
breakfast was under way.</p>

<p>There was daily one cup of coffee, but neither
Gretchen nor her grandmother claimed this luxury;
it was for the sick woman on the third floor.
Sometimes at the Black Eagle she had a cup
when her work was done, but to Gretchen the
aroma excelled the taste. Her grandmother's
breakfast and her own out of the way, she carried
the coffee and bread and a hot brick up to
the invalid. The woman gave her two crowns a
week to serve this morning meal. Gretchen would
have cheerfully done the work for nothing.</p>

<p>What the character of the woman's illness was
Gretchen hadn't an idea, but there could be no
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" />doubt that she was ill, desperately, had the goose-girl
but known it. Her face was thin and the
bones were visible under the drum-like skin; her
hands were merely claws. But she would have
no doctor; she would have no care save that
which Gretchen gave her. Sometimes she remained
in bed all the day. She had been out of
the house but once since she came. She mystified
the girl, for she never complained, never
asked questions, talked but little, and always
smiled kindly when the pillow was freshened.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Fr&auml;u,&quot; said Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, <i>Liebchen</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have brought you a brick this morning, for
it will be cold till the sun is high.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen pulled the deal table to the side of
the cot, poured out the coffee, and buttered the
bread.</p>

<p>&quot;I ought not to drink coffee, but it is the only
thing that warms me. You have been very patient with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad to help you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that is why I love you. Now, I have some
instructions to give you this morning. Presently<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" />
I shall be leaving, and there will be something
besides crowns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are thinking of leaving?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. When I go I shall not come back. Under
my pillow there is an envelope. You will
find it and keep it.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen, young and healthy, touched not this
melancholy undercurrent. She accepted the
words at their surface value. She knew nothing
about death except by hearsay.</p>

<p>&quot;You will promise to take it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Fr&auml;u.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, little gosling. I have an errand for
you this morning. It will take you to the palace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the palace?&quot; echoed Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Does that frighten you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Fr&auml;u; it only surprises me. What shall
I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will seek her highness and give her this
note.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The princess?&quot; Gretchen sadly viewed her
wooden shoes and roughened hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind your hands and feet; your face
will open any gate or door for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" />I have never been to the palace. Will they
not laugh and turn me out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If they try that, demand to see his excellency,
Count von Herbeck, and say that you
came from forty Krumerweg.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen shuddered with a mixture of apprehension
and delight. To meet and speak to all
these great ones!</p>

<p>&quot;And if I can not get in?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will have no trouble. Be sure, though,
to give the note to no one but her highness.
There will be no answer. All I ask is that when
you return you will tell me if you were successful.
You may go.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen put the note away and went down-stairs.
She decked her beautiful head with a
little white cap, which she wore only on Sundays
and at the opera, and braided and beribboned
her hair. It never occurred to her that
there was anything unusual in the incident. It
was only when she came out into the K&ouml;nig
Strasse that the puzzle of it came to her forcibly.
Who was this old woman who thought nothing
of writing a letter to her serene highness? And
who were her nocturnal visitors? Gretchen had
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" />no patience with puzzles, so she let her mind
revel in the thought that she was to see and
speak to the princess whom she admired and revered.
What luck! How smoothly the world
was beginning to run!</p>

<p>Being of a discerning mind, she idled about
the Platz till after nine, for it had been told to
her that the great sleep rather late in the morning.
What should she say to her serene highness?
What kind of a curtsy should she make?
These and a hundred other questions flitted
through her head. At least she would wear no
humble, servile air. For Gretchen was a bit of
a socialist. Did not Herr Goldberg, whom the
police detested, did he not say that all men were
equal? And surely this sweeping statement included
women! She attended secret meetings in
the damp cellar of the Black Eagle, and, while
she laughed at some of the articles in the propaganda,
she received seriously enough that which
proclaimed her the equal of any one. So long
as she obeyed nature's laws and Heaven's, was
she not indeed the equal of queens and princesses,
who, it was said, did not always obey these laws?</p>

<p>With a confidence born of right and inno<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" />cence,
she proceeded toward the east or side gates
of the palace. The sentry smiled at her.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a letter for her serene highness,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p>&quot;Leave it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am under orders to give it to her highness
herself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good day, then!&quot; laughed the soldier. &quot;You
can not enter the gardens without a permit.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen remembered. &quot;Will you send some
one to his excellency the chancellor and tell him
I have come from number forty Krumerweg?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Krumerweg? The very name ought to close
any gate. But, girl, are you speaking truthfully?&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen exhibited the note. He scratched
his chin, perplexed.</p>

<p>&quot;Run along. If they ask me, I'll say that I
didn't see you.&quot; The sentry resumed his beat.</p>

<p>Gretchen stepped inside the gates, and the
real beauty of the gardens was revealed to her
for the first time. Strange flowers she had never
seen before, plants with great broad leaves,
grass-like carpet, and giant ferns, unlike anything
she had plucked in the valleys and the
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" />mountains. It was all a fairy-land. There were
marble urns with hanging vines, and marble
statues. She loitered in this pebbled path and
that, forgetful of her errand. Even had her
mind been filled with the importance of it, she
did not know where to go to find the proper entrance.</p>

<p>A hand grasped her rudely by the arm.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; thundered the
head gardener. &quot;Be off with you! Don't you
know that no one is allowed in here without a
permit?&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen wrenched free her arm. She was
angry.</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you touch me like that?&quot;</p>

<p>Something in her glance, which was singularly
arrogant, cooled even the warm-blooded Hermann.</p>

<p>&quot;But you live in Dreiberg and ought to
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You could have told me without bruising my
arm,&quot; defiantly.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry if I hurt you, but you ought to
have known better. By which sentry did you
pass?&quot; for there was that about her beauty
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" />which made him suspicious regarding the sentry's
imperviousness to it.</p>

<p>&quot;Hermann!&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen and the head gardener whirled.
Through a hedge which divided the formal gardens
from the tennis and archery grounds came
a young woman in riding-habit. She carried a
book in one hand and a riding-whip in the other.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the trouble, Hermann?&quot; she inquired.
&quot;Your voice was something high.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness, this young woman here had
the impudence to walk into the gardens and
stroll about as nice as you please,&quot; indignantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Has she stolen any flowers or trod on any of
the beds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, no, your Highness; but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is the harm, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it is not customary, your Highness. If
we permitted this on the part of the people, the
gardens would be ruined in a week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We, you and I, Hermann,&quot; said her highness,
with a smile that won Gretchen on the spot,
&quot;we will overlook this first offense. Perhaps this
young lady had some errand and lost her way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Highness,&quot; replied Gretchen eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" />Ah! You may go, Hermann.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness alone with&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go at once,&quot; kindly, but with royal firmness.</p>

<p>Hermann bowed, gathered up his pruning
knives and scissors which he had let fall, and
stalked down the path. What was it? he wondered.
She was a princess in all things save her
lack of coldness toward the people. It was
wrong to meet them in this way, it was not in
order. Her highness had lived too long among
them. She would never rid herself of the idea
that the humble had hearts and minds like the
exalted.</p>

<p>As the figure of the head gardener diminished
and shortly vanished behind a bed of palms, her
highness laughed brightly, and Gretchen, to
her own surprise, found herself laughing also,
easily and without constraint.</p>

<p>&quot;Whom were you seeking?&quot; her highness
asked, rather startled by the undeniable beauty
of this peasant.</p>

<p>&quot;I was seeking your serene highness. I live
at number forty the Krumerweg, and the sick
woman gave me this note for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Krumerweg?&quot; Her highness reached for the
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" />note and read it, and as she read tears gathered
in her eyes. &quot;Follow me,&quot; she said. She led
Gretchen to a marble bench and sat down.
Gretchen remained on her feet respectfully.
&quot;What is your name?&quot;</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/image005.jpg"><img src="images/image005.jpg"
alt="She led Gretchen to a marble bench and sat down." width="50%"
title="She led Gretchen to a marble bench and sat down." /></a>
</div>
<h3>She led Gretchen to a marble bench and sat down.</h3>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Gretchen, sit down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In your presence, Highness?&quot; aghast.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't bother about my presence on a morning
like this. Sit down.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a command and Gretchen obeyed
with alacrity. It would not be difficult, thought
Gretchen, to love a princess like this, who was
not only lovely but sensible. The two sat mutely.
They were strangely alike. Their eyes nearly
matched, their hair, even the shape of their faces.
They were similarly molded, too; only, one was
slender and graceful, after the manner of fashion,
while the other was slender and graceful
directly from the hands of nature. The health
of outdoors was visible in their fine skins and
clear eyes. The marked difference lay, of
course, in their hands. The princess had never
toiled with her fingers except on the piano.
Gretchen had plucked geese and dug vegetables
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" />with hers. They were rough, but toil had not
robbed them of their natural grace.</p>

<p>&quot;How was she?&quot; her highness asked.</p>

<p>&quot;About the same, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you wondered why she should write to
me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Highness, it was natural that I should,&quot; was
Gretchen's frank admission.</p>

<p>&quot;She took me in when nobody knew who I
was, clothed and fed me, and taught me music
so that some day I should not be helpless when
the battle of life began. Ah,&quot; impulsively, &quot;had
I my way she would be housed in the palace, not
in the lonely Krumerweg. But my father does
not know that she is in Dreiberg; and we dare
not tell him, for he still believes that she had
something to do with my abduction.&quot; Then
she stopped. She was strangely making this
peasant her confidante. What a whim!</p>

<p>&quot;Highness, that could not be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Gretchen; she had nothing to do with
it.&quot; Her highness leveled her gaze at the flowers,
but her eyes saw only the garret or the
barnlike loneliness of the opera during rehearsals.</p>

<p><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" />Gretchen did not move. She saw that her
highness was dreaming; and she herself had
dreams.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like music?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Highness, I am always singing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;La-la&mdash;la!&quot; sang the princess capriciously.</p>

<p>&quot;La-la&mdash;la!&quot; sang Gretchen smiling. Her
voice was not purer or sweeter; it was merely
stronger, having been accustomed to the open
air.</p>

<p>&quot;Brava!&quot; cried the princess, dropping book
and whip and folding the note inside the book.
&quot;Who taught you to sing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody, highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a goose-girl; in the fall and winter I
work at odd times in the Black Eagle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Black Eagle? A tavern?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me all about yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>This was easy for Gretchen; there was so
little.</p>

<p>&quot;Neither mother nor father. Our lives are
something alike. A handsome girl like you must
have a sweetheart.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" />Gretchen blushed. &quot;Yes, Highness. I am to
be married soon. He is a vintner. I would not
trade him for your king, Highness,&quot; with a spice
of boldness.</p>

<p>Her highness did not take offense; rather she
liked this frankness. In truth, she liked any one
who spoke to her on equal footing; it was a
taste of the old days when she herself could have
chosen a vintner and married him, with none to
say her nay. Now she was only a pretty bird in
a gilded cage. She could fly, but whenever she
did so she blundered painfully against the bright
wires. If there was any envy between these two,
it existed in the heart of the princess only. To
be free like this, to come and go at will, to love
where the heart spoke! She surrendered to another
vagrant impulse.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, I do not think I shall marry the
king of Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen grew red with pride. Her highness
was telling her state secrets!</p>

<p>&quot;You love some one else, Highness?&quot; How
should a goose-girl know that such a question
was indelicate?</p>

<p>Her highness did not blush; the color in her
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" />cheeks receded. She fondled the heart-shaped
locket which she invariably wore round her
throat. That this peasant girl should thus
boldly put a question she herself had never dared
to press!</p>

<p>&quot;You must not ask questions like that,
Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon, Highness; I did not think.&quot;
Gretchen was disturbed.</p>

<p>But the princess comforted her with: &quot;I know
it. There are some questions which should not
be asked even by the heart.&quot;</p>

<p>This was not understandable to Gretchen; but
the locket pleased her eye. Her highness, observing
her interest, slipped the trinket from her
neck and laid it in Gretchen's hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Open it,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a picture of my
mother, whom I do not recollect having ever seen.
Wait,&quot; as Gretchen turned it about helplessly.</p>

<p>&quot;I will open it for you.&quot; Click!</p>

<p>Gretchen sighed deeply. To have had a
mother so fair and pretty! She hadn't an idea
how her own mother had looked; indeed, being
sensible and not given much to conjuring, she
had rarely bothered her head about it. Still, as
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" />she gazed at this portrait, the sense of her isolation
and loneliness drew down upon her, and she
in her turn sought the flowers and saw them not.
After a while she closed the locket and returned
it.</p>

<p>&quot;So you love music?&quot; picking up the safer
thread.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you ever go to the opera?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As often as I can afford. I am very poor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will give you a ticket for the season. How
can I reward you for bringing this message?
Don't have any false pride. Ask for something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, Highness, give me an order on
the grand duke's head vintner for a place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the man who is to become your husband?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall have it to-morrow. Now, come
with me. I am going to take you to Herr Ernst.
He is the director of the opera. He rehearses
in the court theater this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen, undetermined whether she was waking
or dreaming, followed the princess. She
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" />was serenely unafraid, to her own great wonder.
Who could describe her sensations as she passed
through marble halls, up marble staircases,
over great rugs so soft that her step faltered?
Her wooden shoes made a clatter whenever they
left the rugs, but she stepped as lightly as she
could. She heard music and voices presently,
and the former she recognized. As her highness
entered the Bijou Theater, the Herr Direktor
stopped the music. In the little gallery, which
served as the royal box, sat several ladies and
gentlemen of the court, the grand duke being
among them. Her highness nodded at them
brightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Herr Direktor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have brought you a prima donna,&quot; touching
Gretchen with her whip.</p>

<p>The Herr Direktor showed his teeth; her highness
was always playing some jest.</p>

<p>&quot;What shall she sing in, your Highness? We
are rehearsing <i>The Bohemian Girl</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>The chorus and singers on the little stage exchanged
smiles.</p>

<p>&quot;I want your first violin,&quot; said her highness.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" />Anton!&quot;</p>

<p>A youth stood up in the orchestral pit.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, your Highness?&quot; said the Herr Direktor.</p>

<p>&quot;Try her voice.&quot;</p>

<p>And the Herr Direktor saw that she was not
smiling. He bade the violinist to draw his bow
over a single note.</p>

<p>&quot;Imitate it, Gretchen,&quot; commanded her highness;
&quot;and don't be afraid of the Herr Direktor
or of the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen lifted her voice. It was sweeter and
mellower than the violin.</p>

<p>&quot;Again!&quot; the Herr Direktor cried, no longer
curious.</p>

<p>Without apparent effort Gretchen passed
from one note to another, now high, now low,
or strong or soft; a trill, a run. The violinist,
of his own accord, began the jewel song from
<i>Faust</i>. Gretchen did not know the words, but
she carried the melody without mishap. And
then, <i>I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls</i>. This
song she knew word for word, and ah, she sang
it with strange and haunting tenderness! One
by one the musicians dropped their instruments
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" />to their knees. The grand duke in the gallery
leaned over the velvet-buffered railing. All realized
that a great voice was being tried before
them. The Herr Direktor struck his music-stand
sharply. It was enough.</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness has played a fine jest this day.
Where does madame your guest sing, in Berlin
or Vienna?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In neither,&quot; answered her highness, mightily
gratified with Gretchen's success. &quot;She lives in
Dreiberg, and till this morning I doubt if I ever
saw her before.&quot;</p>

<p>The Herr Direktor stared blankly from her
highness to Gretchen, and back to her highness
again. Then he grasped it. Here was one of
those moments when the gods make gifts to
mortals.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you read music?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Herr,&quot; said Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;That is bad. You have a great voice, Fr&auml;ulein.
Well, I shall teach you. I shall make you
a great singer. It is hard work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have always worked hard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good! Your Highness, a thousand thanks!
What is your name?&quot; to Gretchen. She told
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" />him. &quot;It is a good name. Come to me Monday
at the opera and I shall put you into good hands.
Some day you will be rich, and I shall become
great because I found you.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, with the artist's positive indifference to
the presence of exalted blood, he turned his back
upon the two young women and roused his men
from the trance.</p>

<p>&quot;So, Gretchen,&quot; said her highness, when the
two came out again into the garden, &quot;you are to
be rich and famous. That will be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Highness, thanks! God grant the
day to come when I may be of service to you!&quot;
Gretchen kissed the hands of her benefactress.</p>

<p>&quot;Whenever you wish to see the gardens,&quot; added
the princess, &quot;the gates will be open for you.&quot;</p>

<p>As Gretchen went back to the Krumerweg her
wooden shoes were golden slippers and her rough
homespun, silk. Rich! Famous! She saw the
opera ablaze with lights, she heard the roll of
applause. She saw the horn of plenty pouring
its largess from the fair sky. Rainbow dreams!
But Gretchen never became a prima donna.
There was something different on the knees of
the gods.</p>

<h3>AFFAIRS OF STATE</h3>


<p>The grand duke stamped back and forth
with a rumble as of distant thunder. He
would search the very deeps of this matter. He
was of a patient mold, but this was the final
straw. He would have his revenge if it upset
the whole continent. They would play with
him, eh? Well, they had loosed the lion this
time. He had sent his valet to summon her
highness and Herbeck.</p>

<p>&quot;And tell them to put everything else aside.&quot;</p>

<p>He kneaded the note in his hand powerfully.
It was anonymous, but it spoke clearly like truth.
It had been left with one of the sentries, who declared
that a small boy had delivered it. The
sender remained undiscoverable.</p>

<p>His highness had just that hour returned
from the military field. He was tired; and it
was not the psychological moment for a thing
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" />like this to turn up. Had he not opposed it for
months? And now, having surrendered against
his better judgment, this gratuitous affront was
offered him! It was damnable. He smote the
offending note. He would soon find out whether
it was true or not. Then he flung the thing
violently to the floor. But he realized that this
burst of fury would not translate the muddle,
so he stooped and recovered the missive. He
laughed, but the laughter had a grim Homeric
sound. War! Nothing less. He was prepared
for it. Twenty thousand troops were now in
the valley, and there were twenty thousand reserves.
What Franz Josef of Austria or William
of Prussia said did not amount to the snap
of his two fingers. To avenge himself of the
wrongs so long endured of Jugendheit, to wipe
out the score with blood! Did they think that
he was in his dotage, to offer an insult of this
magnitude? They should see, aye, that they
should! It did not matter that the news reached
him through subterranean channels or by treachery;
there was truth here, and that sufficed.</p>

<p>&quot;Enter!&quot; he cried, as some one knocked on the
door.</p>

<p><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" />Herbeck came in, as calm, as imperturbable
as ever.</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness sent for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did. Why the devil couldn't you have left
well enough alone? Read this!&quot; flinging the
note down on his desk.</p>

<p>Herbeck picked it up and worked out the
creases. When he had read to the final word,
his hand, even as the duke's, closed spasmodically
over the stiff paper.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; The query tingled with rage.</p>

<p>The answer on the chancellor's lips was not
uttered. Hildegarde came in. She blew a kiss
at her father, who caught the hand and drew
her toward him. He embraced her and kissed her
brow.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, father?&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck waited.</p>

<p>&quot;Read,&quot; said the duke.</p>

<p>As the last word left Herbeck's lips, she
slipped from her father's arms and looked with
pity at the chancellor.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think of this, Hildegarde?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, father, I think it is the very best thing
in the world,&quot; dryly.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" />An insult like this?&quot; The duke grew rigid.
&quot;You accept it calmly, in this fashion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I weep and tear my hair over a boy I
have never seen? No, thank you. I was about
to make known to you this very evening that I
had reconsidered the offer. I shall never marry
his majesty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A fine time!&quot; The duke's hand trembled.
&quot;Why, in God's name, did you not refuse when
the overtures were first made? The truth, Herbeck,
the whole truth; for there is something
more than this.&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck, in few words and without evasion,
explained the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness, the regent is really not to
blame, for his majesty had given him free rein
in the matter; and his royal highness, working
as I have been for the best interests of the two
countries, never dreamed that the king would
rebel. All my heart and all my mind have been
working toward this end, toward a greater peace
and prosperity. The king has been generous
enough to leave the publicity in our hands; that
is to say, he agrees to accept the humiliation of
being rejected by her serene highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" />That is very generous of him!&quot; said the duke
sarcastically. &quot;Send for Ducwitz.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ducwitz, your Highness?&quot; cried the chancellor, chilled.</p>

<p>&quot;Immediately!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Father!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Must I give an order twice?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness, if you call Ducwitz I shall
surrender my portfolio to you.&quot; The chancellor
spoke without anger, quietly but firmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Do so. There are others to take up your
work.&quot; The duke, for the moment, had thrown
reason to the winds. Revenge, the clamor of
revenge, was all the voice he heard.</p>

<p>The chancellor bowed, turned to leave the
room, when Hildegarde flew to the duke's side
and snatched at his sleeve.</p>

<p>&quot;Father, you are mad!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least I am master in Ehrenstein. Herbeck,
you will have the kindness to summon
General Ducwitz.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness,&quot; replied Herbeck, &quot;I have
worked long and faithfully in your service. I
can not recollect that I ever asked one personal
favor. But I do so now. Do not send for Duc<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" />witz
to-night. See him in the morning. This
is no time for haste. You will throw the army
into Jugendheit, and there will follow a bloody
war. For I have to inform you that the prince
regent, recognizing the false position he is in,
has taken the ram by the horns. His troops are
already bivouacked on the other side of the pass.
This I learned to-day. He will not strike first;
he will wait for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will have my revenge!&quot; stubbornly.</p>

<p>&quot;Father, listen to me. <i>I</i> am the affronted
person; <i>I</i>, I alone, have the right to say what
shall be done in the matter. And I say to you
if you do these cruel things, dismiss his excellency
and bring war and death to Ehrenstein, I
will never forgive you, never, never! You are
wrong, wrong, and I, your daughter, tell you so
frankly. Leave it to me. There will be neither
war nor humiliation.&quot;</p>

<p>As the duke gazed at her the wrath gathering
in his throat receded and his admiration grew.
His daughter! She was a princess, indeed, as
she stood there, fearless, resolute, beautiful. And
her very beauty gave recurrence to his wrath.
A fool of a king he was, a fool of a king!</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" />My dear child,&quot; he said, &quot;I have suffered too
much at the hands of Jugendheit. It was my
daughter the first time; it is my honor now,&quot;
proudly.</p>

<p>&quot;Will it balance war and devastation?&quot; the
girl asked quietly. &quot;Is it not pride rather than
honor? The prince regent made a pardonable
blunder. Do not you, my father, make an unpardonable
one. The king is without blame, for
you appeal to his imagination as a man who
deeply wronged his father. I harbor no ill-feeling
against him or his uncle, because I look
at the matter from an impersonal point of view;
it was for the good of the state. This blunder
can be undone; therefore it is not wise to double
it, to make it irreparable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Portia to the judgment!&quot; said the chancellor,
his eye kindling. &quot;Let it all rest upon
my shoulders. I alone am to blame. It was I
who first suggested the alliance. We all have
dreams, active or passive, futile or purposeful.
My ambition was to bring about a real and lasting
peace. Your Highness, I have failed signally.
There is nothing to do now but to appoint
my successor.&quot; All the chancellor's force and
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" />immobility of countenance gave way, and he
looked the broken man.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that he was generally hasty,
the duke was a just man. In his heart of hearts
he understood. He offered his hand, with half
a smile; and when he smiled he was a handsome
old man.</p>

<p>&quot;You are bidding me farewell, your Highness?&quot;
said Herbeck.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Count. I would not let you go for half
my duchy. What should I do without your solid
common sense? No; remain; we are both of us
too old to quarrel. Even a duke may be a fool
sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck laid his cold hand upon the duke's.
Then he went over to her highness and kissed her
hand gratefully, for it was truly at her feet the
wreath of victory lay.</p>

<p>&quot;Highness,&quot; he said softly, &quot;you are the fairest,
finest princess in the world, and you shall
marry when you will.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And where?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would that I could make it so. But there
is a penalty for being placed so high. We can
not change this unwritten law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" />Heaven did not write it,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>&quot;No, my daughter,&quot; said the duke. &quot;Man is
at the bottom of all the kinks and twists in this
short life; not Heaven. But Herbeck is right;
you shall marry <i>when</i> you will.&quot;</p>

<p>She sprang into his arms and kissed him. It
was, however, a traitorous kiss; for she was saying
in her heart that now she would never marry.
Herbeck's eyes wandered to the portrait over
the fireplace. It was the girl's mother.</p>

<p>The knock of the valet was again heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness, there is a young woman, a
peasant, who desires to speak to her serene highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is she?&quot; asked the duke.</p>

<p>&quot;She is outside, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! She enters the palace without any
more trouble than this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By my orders, father,&quot; said Hildegarde, who
gathered that this privileged visitor must be
Gretchen of the Krumerweg. &quot;Admit her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truly we are becoming socialists,&quot; said the
duke, appealing to Herbeck, who replied with
his usual grim smile.</p>

<p>Gretchen was ushered in. Her throat was a
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" />little full as she recognized the three most important
persons in the grand duchy. Outwardly
she was composed. She made a curtsy to which
the duke replied with his most formal bow of
state. The sparkle of amusement was in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;The little goose-girl!&quot; he said half-audibly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Highness.&quot; Gretchen's face was serious
and her eyes were mournful. She carried an
envelope in her hand tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Come to me, Gretchen,&quot; said the princess.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen's eyes roamed undecidedly from the
duke to Herbeck.</p>

<p>&quot;She is dead, Highness, and I found this letter
under her pillow.&quot;</p>

<p>It was Herbeck's hand that took the envelope.
But he did not open it at once.</p>

<p>&quot;Dead?&quot; Hildegarde's eyes filled.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is dead?&quot; demanded the duke.</p>

<p>&quot;Emma Schultz, father. Oh, I know you will
forgive me for this deception. She has been in
Dreiberg for a month, dying, and I have often
stolen out to see her.&quot; She let her tears fall unrestrained.</p>

<p><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" />The duke stared at the rug. Presently he
said: &quot;Let her be buried in consecrated ground.
Wrong or right, that chapter is closed, my child,
and I am glad you made her last moments happy.
It was like you. It was like your mother. What
is in the letter, Herbeck?&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck was a strong man; he was always far
removed from tears; but there was a mist over
the usual clarity of his vision. He ripped down
the flap. It was only a simple note to her serene
highness, begging her to give the enclosed banknotes
to one Gretchen who lived in the Krumerweg.
The notes represented a thousand crowns.</p>

<p>&quot;Take them, little goose-girl,&quot; said the duke;
&quot;your ship has come in. This will be your
dowry.&quot;</p>

<p>An icy shiver ran up and down Gretchen's
spine, a shiver of wonder, delight, terror. A
thousand crowns! A fortune!</p>

<p>&quot;Hold out your hand,&quot; requested Herbeck.
One by one he laid the notes on the goose-girl's
hand. &quot;This is only a just reward for being
kind and gentle to the unfortunate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I shall add to it another thousand,&quot;
said Hildegarde. &quot;Give them to me, father.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" />In all, this fortune amounted to little more
than four hundred dollars; but to Gretchen,
frugal and thrifty, to whom a single crown was
a large sum, to her it represented wealth. She
was now the richest girl in the lower town.
Dreams of kaleidoscopic variety flew through
her head. Little there was, however, of jewels
and gowns. This vast sum would be the buffer
between her and hunger while she pursued the
one great ambition of her life&mdash;music. She tried
to speak, to thank them, but her voice was gone.
Tears sprang into her eyes. She had the power
to do no more than weep.</p>

<p>The duke was the first to relieve the awkwardness
of the moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Count, has it not occurred to you that we
stand in the presence of two very beautiful
young women?&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck scrutinized Gretchen with care; then
he compared her with the princess. The duke
was right. The goose-girl was not a whit the
inferior of the princess. And the thing which
struck him with most force was that, while each
possessed a beauty individual to herself, it was
not opposite, but strangely alike.</p>

<p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" />The goose-girl had returned to her gloomy
Krumerweg, the princess had gone to her apartments,
and Herbeck to his cabinet. The duke
was alone. For a long period he stood before
the portrait of his wife. The beauties of his
courtship trooped past him; for God had given
to the grand duke of Ehrenstein that which He
denies most of us, high or low, a perfect love.</p>

<p>&quot;Always, always, dear heart,&quot; he whispered;
&quot;in this life and in the life to come. To love,
what is the sickle of death?&quot;</p>

<p>He passed on to his secretary and opened a
drawer. He laid a small bundle on the desk and
untied the string. One by one he ranged the
articles; two little yellow shoes, a little cloak
trimmed with ermine. There had been a locket,
but that was now worn by her highness.</p>

<h3>THE SOCIALISTS</h3>


<p>Hermann Breunner lived in the
granite lodge, just within the eastern
gates of the royal gardens. He was a widower
and shared the ample lodge with the undergardeners
and their families. He lived with them,
but signally apart. They gave him as much respect
as if he had been the duke himself. He
was a lonely, taciturn man, deeply concerned
with his work, and a botanical student of no
mean order. No comrade helped him pass away
an evening in the chimney-corner, pipe in hand
and good cheer in the mug. This isolation was
not accidental, it was Hermann's own selection.
He was a man of brooding moods, and there was
no laughter in his withered heart, though the
false sound of it crossed his lips at infrequent
intervals.</p>

<p>He adjusted his heavy spectacles and held the
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" />note slantingly toward the candle. A note or a
letter was a singular event in Hermann's life.
Not that he looked forward with eagerness to
receive them, but that there was no one existing
who cared enough about him to write. This
note left by the porter of the Grand Hotel moved
him with surprise. It requested that he present
himself at eight o'clock at the office of the hotel
and ask to be directed to the room of Hans
Grumbach.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, who is Hans Grumbach? I never knew
or heard of a man of that name.&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he decided to go. Certainly this
man Grumbach did not urge him without some
definite purpose. He laid down his pipe, reached
for his hat and coat&mdash;for in the lodge he generally
went about in his shirt-sleeves&mdash;and went
over to the hotel. The concierge, who knew
Hermann, conducted him to room ten on the entresole.
Hermann knocked. A voice bade him
enter. Ah, it was the German-American, whose
papers had puzzled his excellency.</p>

<p>&quot;You wished to see me, Herr Grumbach?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Grumbach, offering a chair.</p>

<p>Hermann accepted the courtesy with dignity.<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" />
His host drew up another chair to the opposite
side of the reading-table. The light overhead
put both faces in a semishadow.</p>

<p>&quot;You are Hermann Breunner,&quot; began Grumbach.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You once had a brother named Hans.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermann grew rigid in his chair. &quot;I have no
brother,&quot; he replied, his voice dull and empty.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps not now,&quot; continued Grumbach,
&quot;but you did have.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermann's head drooped. &quot;My God, yes, I
did have a brother; but he was a scoundrel.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach lighted a cigar. He did not offer
one to Hermann, who would have refused it.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he was a scoundrel. He is&mdash;dead!&quot;
softly.</p>

<p>&quot;God's will be done!&quot; But Hermann's face
turned lighter.</p>

<p>&quot;As a boy he loved you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And did I not love him?&quot; said Hermann
fiercely. &quot;Did I not worship that boy, who was
to me more like a son than a brother? Had not
all the brothers and sisters died but he? But
you&mdash;who are you to recall these things?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" />I knew your brother; I knew him well. He
was not a scoundrel; only weak. He went to
America and became successful in business. He
fought with the North in the war. He was not
a coward; he did his fighting bravely and honorably.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no; Hans could never, have been a coward;
even his villainy required courage. But
go on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He died facing the enemy, and his last words
were of you. He begged your forgiveness; he
implored that you forget that black moment.
He was young, he said; and they offered him
a thousand crowns. In a moment of despair he
fell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Despair? Did he confess to you the crime
he committed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he tell you to whom he sold his honor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That he never knew. A Gipsy from the
hills came to him, so he said.</p>

<p>&quot;From Jugendheit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say that he knew nothing. He believed
that the Gipsy wanted her highness to hold for
ransom. Hans spoke of a girl called Tekla.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" />Tekla? Ah, yes; Hans was in love with that
doll-face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doll-face or not, Hans evidently loved her.
She jilted him, and he did not care then what
happened. His one desire was to leave Dreiberg.
And this Gipsy brought the means and the opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not Jugendheit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who knows? Hans followed the band of
Gipsies into the mountains. The real horror of
his act did not come home to him till then. Ah,
the remorse! But it was too late. They dressed
the little one in rags. But when I ran away
from them I took her little shoes and cloak and
locket.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermann was on his feet!</p>

<p>Grumbach relighted his cigar which had gone
out. The smoke wavered about his face and
slowly ascended. His eyes were as bright and
glowing as coals. He waited. He had made
the slip without premeditation; but what was
done was done. So he waited.</p>

<p>Hermann dropped his hands on the table and
leaned forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it you, Hans, and I did not know you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" />It is I, brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My God!&quot; Hermann sank down weakly.
The ceiling spun and the gaslight separated itself
into a hundred flames. &quot;You said he was
dead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I am, to the world, to you, and to all who
knew me,&quot; quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Why have you returned?&quot;</p>

<p>Hans shrugged. &quot;I don't know. Perhaps I
am a fool; perhaps I am willing to pay the penalty
of my crime. At least that was uppermost
in my mind till I learned that her highness had
been found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hans, Hans, the duke has sworn to hang
you!&quot;</p>

<p>Hans laughed. &quot;The rope is not made that
will fit my neck. Will you denounce me,
brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I?&quot; Hermann shrank back in horror.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not? Five thousand crowns still hang
over me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blood-money for me? No, Hans!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, I have made a will. At my death
you will be rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rich?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" />Yes, Hermann. I am worth two hundred
thousand crowns.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermann breathed with effort. So many
things had beaten upon his brain in the past
ten minutes that he was dazed. His brother
Hans alive and here, and rich?</p>

<p>&quot;But riches are not everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes they are little enough,&quot; Hans
agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you do it?&quot; Hermann's voice was
full of agony.</p>

<p>&quot;Have I not told you, Hermann? There is
nothing more to be added.&quot; Then, with rising
passion: &quot;Nothing more, now that my heart is
blistered and scarred with regret and remorse.
God knows that I have repented and repented.
I went to war because I wanted to be killed.
They shot me here, and here, and here, and this
saber-cut would have split the skull of any other
man. But it was willed that I should come back
here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My poor brother! You must fly from here
at once!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From what?&quot; tranquilly.</p>

<p>&quot;The chancellor is suspicious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" />I know that. But since you, my brother,
failed to identify me, certainly his excellency
will not. I shall make no slip as in your case.
And you will not betray me when I tell you that
I have returned principally to find out whence
came those thousand crowns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Find that out, Hans; yes, yes!&quot; Hermann
began to look more like himself. &quot;But
what was your part?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mine? I was to tell where her highness and
her nurse were to be at a certain hour of the
day. Nothing more was necessary. My running
away was the expression of my guilt;
otherwise they would never have connected me
with the abduction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any suspicions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None. And remember, you must not know
me, Hermann, no matter where we meet. I am
sleepy.&quot; Hans rose.</p>

<p>And this, thought Hermann, his bewilderment
gaining life once more, and this calm, unruffled
man, whose hair was whiter than his own, a veteran
of the bloodiest civil war in history, this
prosperous mechanic, was his little brother
Hans!</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" />Hans, have you no other greeting?&quot; Hermann
asked, spreading out his arms.</p>

<p>The wanderer's face beamed; and the brothers
embraced.</p>

<p>&quot;You forgive me, then, Hermann?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Must I not, little Hans? You are all that
is left me of the blood. True, I swore that if
ever I saw you again I should curse you.&quot;</p>

<p>The two stood back from each other, but with
arms still entwined.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps, Hans, I did not watch you closely
enough in those days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what has become of the principal
cause?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The cause?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tekla.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bah! She is fat and homely and the mother
of seven squalling children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a world! To think that Tekla should
be at the bottom of all this tangle! What irony!
I ruin my life, I break the heart of the grand
duke, I nearly cause war between two friendly
states&mdash;why? Tekla, now fat and homely and
the mother of seven, would not marry me. The
devil rides strange horses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" />Good night, Hans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good night, Hermann, and God bless you
for your forgiveness. Always come at night if
you wish to see me, but do not come often; they
might remark it.&quot;</p>

<p>A rap on the door startled them. Hans, a
finger of warning on his lips, opened the door.
Carmichael stood outside.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Captain!&quot; Hans took Carmichael by
the hand and drew him into the room.</p>

<p>Carmichael, observing Hermann, was rather
confused as to what to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, Hermann,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, Herr Carmichael.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermann passed into the hail and softly closed
the door after him. It was better that the American
should not see the emotion which still illumined
his face.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the good word, Captain?&quot; inquired
Hans.</p>

<p>Carmichael put in a counter-query: &quot;What
was your brother doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have told him who I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was it wise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hermann sleeps soundly; he will talk neither
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" />in his sleep nor in his waking hours. He has
forgiven me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;The time for explanations has not yet come,
Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, Grumbach; I was not thinking.
But I came to bring you the invitation to the
military ball.&quot;</p>

<p>The broad white envelope, emblazoned with
the royal arms, fascinated Hans, not by its resplendency,
but by the possibilities which it afforded.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you; it was very good of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was a pleasure, comrade. What do you
say to an hour or two at the Black Eagle? We'll
drown our sorrows together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any sorrows, Captain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who hasn't? Life is a patchwork with the
rounding-out pieces always missing. Come
along. I'm lonesome to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So am I,&quot; said Hans.</p>

<p>The Black Eagle was lively as usual; and
there were some familiar faces. The vintner
was there and so was Gretchen. Carmichael
hailed her.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" />This is my last night here, Herr Carmichael,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody has left you a fortune?&quot; There
was a jest in Carmichael's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Gretchen, her lips unsmiling.</p>

<p>&quot;The poor lady who lived on the top floor of
my grandmother's house was rich. She left me
a thousand crowns.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael and Grumbach: &quot;A thousand
crowns!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what will you do with all that money?&quot;
asked Hans.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going to study music.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you were going to be married
soon,&quot; said Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Surely. But that will not hinder. I shall
have enough for two.&quot; Gretchen saw no reason
why she should tell them of the princess' generosity.</p>

<p>&quot;But how does he take it?&quot; asked Carmichael,
with a motion of his head toward the vintner,
half hidden behind a newspaper.</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn't like the idea at all. But the Herr
Direktor says that I am a singer, and that some
day I shall be rich and famous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" />When that day comes I shall be there with
many a brava!&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner, who sat near enough to catch a
bit of the conversation, scowled over the top of
his paper. Carmichael eyed him mischievously.
Gretchen picked up her coppers and went
away.</p>

<p>&quot;A beautiful girl,&quot; said Hans abstractedly.
&quot;She might be Hebe with no trouble at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael admired Hans. There was always
some new phase in the character of this quiet and
unassuming German. A plumber who was familiar
with the classics was not an ordinary person.
He raised his stein and Hans extended his.
After that they smoked, with a word or two occasionally
in comment.</p>

<p>At that day there was only one newspaper in
Dreiberg. It was a dry and solid sheet, of four
pages, devoted to court news, sciences, and agriculture.
The vintner presently smoothed down
the journal, opened his knife, and cut out a
paragraph. Carmichael, following his movements
slyly, wondered what he had seen to interest
him to the point of preservation. The
vintner crushed the remains of the sheet into a
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" />ball and dropped it to the floor. Then he finished
his beer, rose, and proceeded toward the stairs
leading to the rathskeller below. Down these
he disappeared.</p>

<p>An idea came to Carmichael. He called a
waitress and asked her to bring a copy of that
day's paper. Meantime he recovered the vintner's
paper, and when he finally put the two together,
it was a simple matter to replace the
missing cutting. Grumbach showed a mild interest
over the procedure.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you do that, Captain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little idea I have; it may not amount to
anything.&quot; But the American was puzzled over
the cutting. There were two sides to it: which
had interested the vintner? &quot;Do you care for
another beer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I am tired and sleepy, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right; we'll go back to the hotel. There
is nothing going on here to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>But Carmichael was mistaken for once.</p>

<p>A little time later Herr Goldberg harangued
his fellow socialists bitterly. Gretchen's business
in this society was to serve. They had selected
her because they knew that she inclined toward
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" />the propaganda. Few spoke to her, outside of
giving orders, and then kindly.</p>

<p>The rathskeller had several windows and doors.
These led to the <i>Biergarten</i>, to the wine-cellar,
and to an alley which had no opening on the
street. The police had as yet never arrested anybody;
but several times the police had dispersed
Herr Goldberg and his disciples on account of
the noise. The window which led to the blind
alley was six feet from the floor, twice as broad
as it was high, and unbarred. Under this window
sat the vintner. He was a probationer, a
novitiate; this was his second attendance. He
liked to sit in the shadow and smile at Herr Goldberg's
philosophy, which, summed up briefly,
meant that the rich should divide with the poor
and that the poor should hang on to what they
had or got. It may have never occurred to Herr
Goldberg that the poor were generally poor because
of their incapabilities, their ignorance, and
incompetence. To-night, however, there were
variety and spice with his Jeremiad.</p>

<p>&quot;Brothers, shall this thing take place? Shall
the daughter of Ehrenstein become Jugendheit's
vassal? Oh, how we have fallen! Where is the
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" />grand duke's pride we have heard so much about?
Are we, then, afraid of Jugendheit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; roared his auditors, banging their
stems and tankards. The vintner joined the
demonstration, banging his stein as lustily as the
next one.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you thought what this marriage will
cost us in taxes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thousands of crowns, thousands! Do we not
always pay for the luxuries of the rich? Do not
their pleasures grind us so much deeper into the
dirt? Yes, we are the corn they grind. And
shall we submit, like the dogs in Flanders, to become
beasts of burden?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a plan, brothers; it will show the duke
to what desperation he has driven us at last. We
will mob the Jugendheit embassy on the day of
the wedding; we will tear it apart, brick by brick,
stone by stone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hurrah!&quot; cried the noisy ones. They liked
talk of this order. They knew it was only here
that great things happened, the division of riches
and mob-rule. Beer was cheaper by the keg.</p>

<p><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" />The noise subsided. Gretchen spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Her serene highness will not marry the king
of Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>Every head swung round in her direction.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that you say?&quot; demanded Herr
Goldberg.</p>

<p>Gretchen repeated her statement. It was the
first time she had ever raised her voice in the
councils.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, indeed!&quot; said Goldberg, bowing with ridicule:
&quot;Since when did her serene highness make
you her confidante?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her serene highness told me so herself.&quot;
Gretchen's eyes, which had held only mildness
and good-will, now sparkled with contempt.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter went up, for the majority
of them thought that Gretchen was indulging in
a little pleasantry.</p>

<p>&quot;Ho-ho! So you are on speaking terms with
her highness?&quot; Herr Goldberg laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything strange in this fact?&quot; she
asked, keeping her tones even.</p>

<p>The vintner made a sign to her, but she ignored
it.</p>

<p>&quot;Strange?&quot; echoed Herr Goldberg, becoming
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" />furious at having the interest in himself thus
diverted. &quot;Since when did goose-girls and barmaids
become on intimate terms with her serene
highness?&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen pressed the vintner's arm to hold
him in his chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Does not your socialism teach that we are all
equal?&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner thumped with his stein in approval,
and others imitated him. Goldberg was
no ordinary fool. He sidestepped defeat by an
assumption of frankness.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell us about it. If I have spoken harshly
it is only reasonable. Tell us under what circumstance
you met her highness and how she
happened to tell you this very important news.
Every one knows that this marriage is to take
place.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen nodded. &quot;Nevertheless, her highness
has changed her mind.&quot; And she recounted picturesquely
her adventure in the royal gardens,
and all hung on her words in a kind of maze. It
was all very well to shout, &quot;Down with royalty!&quot;
it was another matter to converse and shake
bands with it.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" />Hurrah!&quot; shouted the vintner. &quot;Long live
her highness! Down with Jugendheit!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a fine chorus.</p>

<p>And there was a fine tableau not down on the
evening's program. A police officer and three
assistants came down the stairs quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Let no one leave this room!&quot; the officer said
sternly.</p>

<p>The dramatic pause was succeeded by a babel
of confusion. Chairs scraped, stems clattered,
and the would-be liberators huddled together like
so many sheep rounded up by a shepherd-dog.</p>

<p>&quot;Ho, there! Stop him, you!&quot;</p>

<p>It was the vintner who caused this cry; and
the agility with which he scrambled through the
window into the blind alley was an inspiration.</p>

<p>&quot;After him!&quot; yelled the officer. &quot;He is probably
the one rare bird in the bunch.&quot;</p>

<p>But they searched in vain.</p>

<p>Gretchen stared ruefully at the blank window.</p>

<p>Somehow this flight pained her; somehow it gave
her the heartache to learn that her idol was
afraid of such a thing as a policeman.</p>

<p>&quot;Out into the street, every mother's son of
you!&quot; cried the officer angrily to the quaking so<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" />cialists.
&quot;This is your last warning, Goldberg.
The next time you go to prison for seditious
teachings. Out with you!&quot;</p>

<p>The socialists could not have emptied the cellar
any quicker had there been a fire.</p>

<p>Gretchen alone remained. It was her duty to
carry the steins up to the bar. The officer, rather
thorough for his kind, studied the floor under the
window. He found a cutting from a newspaper.
This interested him.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know who this fellow was?&quot; with a
jerk of his head toward the window.</p>

<p>&quot;He is Leopold Dietrich, a vintner, and we are
soon to be married.&quot; There was a flaw in the
usual sweetness of her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;So? What made him run away like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is new to Dreiberg. Perhaps he thought
you were going to arrest every one. Oh, he has
done nothing wrong; I am sure of that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is one way to prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask him if he is not a spy from Jugendheit,&quot;
roughly.</p>

<p>The steins clicked crisply in Gretchen's arms;
one of them fell and broke at her feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII" /><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" />CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>LOVE'S DOUBTS</h3>


<p>Gretchen, troubled in heart and mind
over the strange event of the night, walked
slowly home, her head inclined, her arms swinging
listlessly at her side. A spy, this man to
whom she had joyously given the flower of her
heart and soul? There was some mistake; there
must be some mistake. She shivered; for the
word spy carried with it all there was in deceit,
treachery, cunning. In war time she knew that
spies were necessary, that brave men took perilous
hazards, without reward, without renown;
but in times of peace nothing but opprobrium
covered the word. A political scavenger, the
man she loved? No; there was some mistake.
The bit of newspaper cutting did not worry her.
Anybody might have been curious about the doings
of the king of Jugendheit and his uncle the
prince regent. Because the king hunted in Ba<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" />varia
with the crown prince, and his uncle conferred
with the king of Prussia in Berlin, it did
not necessarily follow that Leopold Dietrich was
a spy. Gretchen was just. She would hear his
defense before she judged him.</p>

<p>Marking the first crook in the Krumerweg was
an ancient lamp hanging from the side of the
wall. The candle in this lamp burned night and
day, through winter's storms and summer's
balms. The flame dimmed and glowed, a kindly
reminder in the gloom. It was a shrine to the
Virgin Mary; and before this Gretchen paused,
offering a silent prayer that the Holy Mother
preserve this dream of hers.</p>

<p>A footstep from behind caused her to start.
The vintner took her roughly in his arms and
kissed her many times.</p>

<p>Her heart shook within her, but she did not
surrender her purpose under these caresses. She
freed herself energetically and stood a little
away from him, panting and star-eyed.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>She did not speak.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ask?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" />Was it a crime, then, to jump out of the
window?&quot; He laughed.</p>

<p>Gretchen's face grew sterner. &quot;Were you
afraid?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For a moment. I have never run afoul the
police. I thought perhaps we were all to be arrested.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, and what then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What then? Uncomfortable quarters in
stone rooms. I preferred discretion to valor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you did not care to have the police
ask you questions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is all this about?&quot; He pulled her toward
him so that he could look into her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter? Answer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you not a spy from Jugendheit?&quot; thinly.</p>

<p>He flung aside her hand. &quot;So! The first doubt
that enters your ear finds harbor there. A spy
from Jugendheit; that is a police suggestion,
and you believed it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you deny it?&quot; Gretchen was not cowed
by his anger, which her own evenly matched.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; proudly, snatching his hat from his
head and throwing it violently at her feet; &quot;yes,
I deny it. I am not a spy from any country; I
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" />have not sold the right to look any man in the
eye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have asked you many questions,&quot; she replied,
&quot;but you are always laughing. It is a
pleasant way to avoid answering. I have given
you my heart and all its secrets. Have you
opened yours as frankly?&quot;</p>

<p>To meet anger with logic and sense is the simplest
way to overcome it. The vintner saw himself
at bay. He stooped to recover his hat, not
so much to regain it but to steal time to conjure
up some way out.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, here under the Virgin I swear to
you that I love you as a man loves but once in
his life. If I were rich, I would gladly fling these
riches to the wind for your sake. If I were a
king, I'd barter my crown for a smile and a kiss.
I have done no wrong; I have committed no
crime. But you must have proof; so be it. We
will go together to the police-bureau and settle
this doubt once and for all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When?&quot; Gretchen's heart was growing warm
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, to-night, while they are hunting for
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" />Forgive me!&quot; brokenly.</p>

<p>&quot;Come!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Leopold, this test is not necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I insist. This thing must be righted publicly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I was thinking that the man I loved was
a coward!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am braver than you dream, Gretchen.&quot;
And in truth he was, for he was about to set
forth for the lion's den, and only amazing cleverness
could extricate him. Man never enters
upon the foolhardy unless it be to dazzle a woman.
And the vintner's love for Gretchen was no
passing thing. &quot;Let us hurry; it is growing
late. They will be shutting off the lights before
we return.&quot;</p>

<p>The police-bureau was far away, but the distance
was nothing to these healthy young people.</p>

<p>They progressed at a smart pace and in less than
twenty minutes they arrived. It was Gretchen
who drew back fearfully.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, will it not be foolish?&quot; she suggested.</p>

<p>&quot;They will be searching for me,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;It will be easier if I present myself. It will
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" />bear testimony that I am innocent of any
wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will go in with you,&quot; determinedly.</p>

<p>The police officer, or, to be more particular,
the sub-chief of the bureau, received them with
ill-concealed surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;I have learned that you are seeking me,&quot; said
the vintner, taking off his cap. His yellow curls
waved about his forehead in moist profusion.</p>

<p>Immediately the sub-chief did not know what
to say. This was out of the ordinary, conspicuously
so. There was little precedent by which to
act in a case like this. So in order to appear that
nothing could destroy his official poise, he let the
two stand before his desk while he sorted some
papers.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not a native of Dreiberg,&quot; he began.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Herr; I am from Bavaria. If you will
look into your records you will find that my papers
were presented two or three weeks ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me see them.&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner's passports were produced. The
sub-chief compared them to the corresponding
number in his book. There was nothing wrong
about them.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" />I do not recollect seeing you here before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was one of your assistants who originally
went over the papers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is your business?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a vintner by trade, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And are there not plenty of vineyards in
Bavaria?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We vintners,&quot; with an easy gesture, &quot;are of
a roving disposition. I have been all along the
Rhine and the Moselle. I prefer grapes to hops.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why Dreiberg? The best vineyards are
south.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who can say where we shall go next? Dreiberg
seemed good enough for me,&quot; with a shy
glance at Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you jump out of the window?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was frightened at first, Herr. I did not
know that you merely dispersed meetings. I believed
that we were all to be arrested. Such
measures are in force in Munich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You accused him of being a Jugendheit
spy,&quot; broke in Gretchen, who was growing impatient
under these questions, which seemed to
go nowhere in particular.</p>

<p>&quot;You be silent,&quot; warned the sub-chief.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" />I am here because of that accusation,&quot; said
the vintner.</p>

<p>&quot;What have you to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I deny it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is easy to do. But can you prove it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is for you to prove, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Read this.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the cutting. The vintner read it, his
brows drawn together in a puzzled frown. He
turned the slip over carelessly. The sub-chief's
eyes bored into him like gimlets.</p>

<p>&quot;I can make nothing of this, Herr. When I
cut this out of the paper it was to preserve the
notice on the other side.&quot; The vintner returned
the cutting.</p>

<p>The sub-chief read aloud:</p>

<p>&quot;Vintners and presses and pruners wanted for
the season. Find and liberal compensation. Apply,
Holtz.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen laughed joyously; the vintner
grinned; the sub-chief swore under his breath.</p>

<p>&quot;The devil fly away with you both!&quot; he cried,
making the best of his chagrin. &quot;And when you
marry, don't invite me to the wedding.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" />After they had gone, however, he called for an
assistant.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you see that young vintner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Follow him, night and day. Find out where
he lives and what he does; and ransack his room
if possible. He is either an innocent man or a
sleek rascal. Report to me this time each night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the girl?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't trouble about her. She is under the
patronage of her serene highness. She's as right
as a die. It's the man. He was too easy; he
didn't show enough concern. An ordinary vintner
would have been frightened. This fellow
smiled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I find out anything suspicious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Arrest him out of hand and bring him here
at once.&quot;</p>

<p>Alone once more the sub-chief studied the cutting
with official thoroughness. He was finally
convinced, by the regularity of the line on the
printed side as compared with the irregularity of
the line on the advertising side, that the vintner
had lied. And yet there was no proof that he
had.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" />This young fellow will go far,&quot; he mused,
with reluctant admiration.</p>

<p>On reaching the street Gretchen gave rein to
her laughter. What promised to be a tragedy
was only a farce. The vintner laughed, too, but
Momus would have criticized his laughter.</p>

<p>The night was not done yet; there were still
some more surprises in store for the vintner. As
they turned into the Krumerweg they almost ran
into Carmichael. What was the American consul
doing in this part of the town, so near midnight?
Carmichael recognized them both. He
lifted his hat, but the vintner cavalierly refused
to respond.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Carmichael!&quot; said Gretchen. &quot;And
what are you doing here this time of the night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been on a fool's errand,&quot; urbanely.</p>

<p>&quot;And who sent you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The god of fools himself, I guess. I am
looking for a kind of ghost, a specter in black
that leaves the palace early in the evening and
returns late, whose destination has invariably
been forty Krumerweg.&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner started.</p>

<p>&quot;My house?&quot; cried Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" />Yours? Perhaps you can dispel this phantom?&quot;
said Carmichael.</p>

<p>Gretchen was silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! You know something. Who is she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A lady who comes on a charitable errand.
But now she will come no more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And why not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The object of her visits is gone,&quot; Gretchen
answered sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;My luck!&quot; exclaimed Carmichael ruefully.</p>

<p>&quot;I am always building houses of cards. I don't
suppose I shall ever reform.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you not afraid to walk about in this part
of the town so late?&quot; put in the vintner, who was
impatient to be gone.</p>

<p>&quot;Afraid? Of what? Thieves? Bah, my little
man, I carry a sword-stick, and moreover I know
how to use it tolerably well. Good night.&quot; And
he swung along easily, whistling an air from
<i>The Barber of Seville</i>.</p>

<p>The insolence in Carmichael's tone set the vintner's
ears a-burning, but he swallowed his wrath.</p>

<p>&quot;I like him,&quot; Gretchen declared, as she stopped
before the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; jealously.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" />Because he is always like that; pleasant,
never ruffled, kindly. He will make a good husband
to some woman.&quot;</p>

<p>The vintner shrugged. He was not patient
to-night.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is this mysterious woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not free to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leopold, what is the matter with you to-night?
You act like a boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps the police muddle is to blame. Besides,
every time I see this man Carmichael I
feel like a baited dog.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In Heaven's name, why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing that I can remember. But I have
asked you a question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I have declined to answer that question.
All my secrets are yours, but this one is another's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it her highness?&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen fingered the latch suggestively.</p>

<p>&quot;I am wrong, Gretchen; you are right. Kiss
me!&quot;</p>

<p>She liked the tone; she liked the kisses, too,
though they hurt.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" />Good night, my man!&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Good night, my woman! To-morrow night
at eight.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned and ran lightly and swiftly up the
street. Gretchen remained standing in the doorway
till she could see him no more. Why should
he run like that? She raised the latch and went
inside.</p>

<p>From the opposite doorway a mountaineer, a
carter, a butcher, and a baker stepped cautiously
forth.</p>

<p>&quot;He heard something,&quot; said the mountaineer.
&quot;He has ears like a rat for hearing. What a
pretty picture!&quot; cynically. &quot;All the world loves
a lover&mdash;sometimes. Touching scene!&quot;</p>

<p>No one replied; no one was expected to reply;
more than that, no one cared to court the fury
which lay thinly disguised in the mountaineer's
tones.</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrow night; you heard what he said.
I am growing weary of this play. You will stop
him on his way to yonder house. A closed carriage
will be at hand. Before he enters, remember.
She watches him too long when he leaves.
Fool!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" />The quartet stole along in the darkness, noiselessly
and secretly.</p>

<p>The vintner had indeed heard something. He
knew not what this noise was, but it was enough
to set his heels to flying. A phase had developed
in his character that defied analysis; suspicion,
suspicion of daylight, of night, of shadows moving
by walls, of footsteps behind. Only a little
while ago he had walked free-hearted and careless.
This growing habit of skulking was gall
and wormwood. Once in his room, which was directly
over the office of the American consulate,
he fell into a chair, inert and breathless. What
a night! What a series of adventures!</p>

<p>&quot;Only a month ago I was a boy. I am a man
now, for I know what it is to suffer. Gretchen,
dear Gretchen, I am a black scoundrel! But if I
break your heart I shall break my own along
with it. I wonder how much longer it will last.
But for that vintner's notice I should have been
lost.&quot;</p>

<p>By and by he lighted a candle. The room held
a cot, a table, and two chairs. The vintner's
wardrobe consisted of a small pack thrown carelessly
into a corner. Out of the drawer in the
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" />table he took several papers and burned them.
The ashes he cast out of the window. He knew
something about police methods; they were by
no means all through with him. Ah! A patch
of white paper, just inside the door, caught his
eye. He fetched it to the candle. What he read
forced the color from his cheeks and his hands
were touched with transient palsy.</p>

<p>&quot;The devil! What shall I do now?&quot; he muttered,
thoroughly dismayed.</p>

<p>What indeed should he do? Which way should
he move? How long had <i>he</i> been in Dreiberg?
Ah, that would be rich! What a joke! It would
afford him a smile in his old age. Carmichael,
Carmichael! The vintner chuckled softly as he
scribbled this note:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;If Herr Carmichael would learn the secret of
number forty Krumerweg, let him attire himself
as a vintner and be in the Krumerweg at
eight o'clock to-night.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>&quot;So there is a trap, and I am to beware of a
mountaineer, a carter, a butcher, and a baker?
Thanks, Scharfenstein, my friend, thanks! You
are watching over me.&quot;</p>

<p>He blew out his candle and went to bed.</p>

<h3>A DAY DREAM</h3>


<p>Colonel Von Wallenstein curled
his mustaches. It was a happy thought
that had taken him into the Adlergasse. This
Gretchen had been haunting his dreams, and
here she was, coming into his very arms, as it
were. The sidewalk was narrow. Gretchen,
casually noting that an officer stood in the way,
sensibly veered into the road. But to her surprise
the soldier left the sidewalk and planted
himself in the middle of the road. There was no
mistaking this second maneuver. The officer,
whom she now recognized, was bent on intercepting
her. She stopped, a cold fury in her heart.</p>

<p>To make sure, she essayed to go round. It was
of no use. So she stopped again.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I wish to pass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is possible, Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock in the morning. The Adlergasse
was at this time deserted.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" />Will you stand aside?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have been haunting my dreams,
Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would be a pity. But I wish to pass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Presently. Do you know that you are the
most beautiful being in all Dreiberg?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am in a hurry,&quot; said Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;There is plenty of time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not to listen to foolish speeches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not going to let you pass till I have had
a kiss.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; Battle flamed up in Gretchen's eyes.
Somewhere in the past, in some remote age, her
forebears had been men-at-arms or knights in the
crusades.</p>

<p>&quot;You are very hard to please. Some women&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what kind of women?&quot; bitingly. &quot;Not
such as I should care to meet. Will you let me
by peacefully?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After the toll, after the toll!&quot;</p>

<p>Too late she started to run. He laughed and
caught hold of her. Slowly but irresistibly he
drew her toward his heart. The dead-white of
her face should have warned him. With a su<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" />preme
effort she freed herself and struck him
across the face; and there was a man's strength
in the flat of her hand. Quick as a flash she
whirled round and ran up the street, he hot upon
her heels. He was raging now with pain and
chagrin. The one hope for Gretchen now lay in
the Black Eagle; and into the tavern she darted
excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Fr&auml;u Bauer,&quot; she cried, gasping as much in
wrath as for lack of breath, &quot;may I come behind
your counter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure, child. Whatever is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>Wallenstein's entrance was answer sufficient.
His hand, held against his stinging cheek, was
telltale enough for the proprietress of the Black
Eagle.</p>

<p>&quot;Shame!&quot; she cried. She knew her rights.
She was not afraid to speak plainly to any officer
in the duchy, however high he might be
placed.</p>

<p>&quot;I can not get at you there, Gretchen,&quot; said
the colonel, giving to his voice that venom which
the lady's man always has at hand when thwarted
in his gallantries. &quot;You will have to come
hence presently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" />She shall stay here all day,&quot; declared Fr&auml;u
Bauer decidedly.</p>

<p>&quot;I can wait.&quot; The colonel, now possessing
two smarts, one to his cheek and one to his vanity,
made for the door. But there was a bulk in the
doorway formidable enough to be worth serious
contemplation.</p>

<p>&quot;What is going on here, little goose-girl?&quot;
asked the grizzled old man, folding his arms
round his oak staff.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Colonel insulted me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Insulted you?&quot; The colonel laughed boisterously.
This was good; an officer insult a wench
of this order! &quot;Out of the way!&quot; he snarled at
the obstruction in the doorway.</p>

<p>&quot;What did he try to do to you, Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He tried to kiss me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man who tries to kiss a woman against
her will is always at heart a coward,&quot; said the
mountaineer.</p>

<p>The colonel seized the old man by the shoulder
to push him aside. The other never so much as
stirred. He put out one of his arms and clasped
the colonel in such a manner that he gasped. He
was in the clutch of a Carpathian bear.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" />Well, my little soldier?&quot; said the mountaineer,
his voice even and not a vein showing in
his neck.</p>

<p>&quot;I will kill you for this!&quot; breathed the colonel
heavily.</p>

<p>&quot;So?&quot; The old man thrust him back several
feet, without any visible exertion. He let his
staff slide into his hand.</p>

<p>The moment the colonel felt himself liberated,
he drew his saber and lunged toward his assailant.
There was murder in his heart. The two
women screamed. The old man laughed. He
turned the thrust with his staff. The colonel,
throwing caution to the four winds, surrendered
to his rage. He struck again. The saber rang
against the oak. This dexterity with the staff
carried no warning to the enraged officer. He
struck again and again. Then the old man
struck back. The pain in the colonel's arm was
excruciating. His saber rattled to the stone
flooring. Before he could recover the weapon
the victor had put his foot upon it. He was still
smiling, as if the whole affair was a bit of
pastime.</p>

<p>On his part the colonel's blood suddenly cooled.<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" />
This was no accident; this meddling peasant had
at some time or other held a saber in his hand
and knew how to use it famously well. The colonel
realized that he had played the fool nicely.</p>

<p>&quot;My sword,&quot; he demanded, with as much dignity
as he could muster.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you sheathe it?&quot; the old man asked
mildly.</p>

<p>&quot;Since it is of no particular use,&quot; bitterly.</p>

<p>&quot;I could have broken it half a dozen times.
Here, take it. But be wise in the future, and
draw it only in the right.&quot;</p>

<p>The gall was bitter on the colonel's tongue,
but his head was evenly balanced now. He
jammed the blade into the scabbard.</p>

<p>&quot;I should like a word or two with you outside,&quot;
said the mountaineer.</p>

<p>&quot;To what purpose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To a good one, as you will learn.&quot;</p>

<p>The two of them went out. Gretchen, overcome,
fell upon Fr&auml;u Bauer's neck and wept
soundly. The whole affair had been so sudden
and appalling.</p>

<p>Outside the old man laid his hand on the colonel's
arm.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" />You must never bother her again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Must?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The very word. Listen, and do not be a fool
because you have some authority on the general
staff. You are Colonel von Wallenstein; you are
something more besides.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you infer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I infer nothing. Now and then there happens
strange leakage in the duke's affairs. The
man is well paid. He is a gambler, and one is
always reasonably certain that the gambler will
be wanting money. Do you begin to understand
me, or must I be more explicit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who I am is of no present consequence. But
I know who and <i>what</i> you are. That is all-sufficient.
If you behave yourself in the future,
you will be allowed to continue in prosperity.
But if you attempt to molest that girl again
and I hear of it, there will be no more gold coming
over the frontier from Jugendheit. Now,
do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; The colonel experienced a weakness
in the knees.</p>

<p>&quot;Go. But be advised and walk circumspect<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" />ly.&quot;
The speaker showed his back insolently,
and re&euml;ntered the Black Eagle.</p>

<p>The colonel, pale and distrait, stared at the
empty door; and he saw in his mind's eye a squad
of soldiers, a wall, a single volley, and a dishonored
roll of earth. Military informers were
given short shrift. It was not a matter of tearing
off orders and buttons; it was death. Who
was this terrible old man, with the mind of a serpent
and the strength of a bear? The colonel
went to the barracks, but his usual debonair
was missing.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going into the garden, Gretchen. Bring
me a stein of brown.&quot; The mountaineer smiled
genially.</p>

<p>&quot;But I am not working here any more,&quot; said
Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;No?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She has had a fortune left her,&quot; said Fr&auml;u
Bauer.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; The mountaineer seemed vastly
pleased. &quot;And how much is this fortune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two thousand crowns.&quot; Gretchen was not
sure, but to her there always seemed to be a secret
laughter behind those clear eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229" />Handsome! And what will you do now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is to study for the opera.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I not prophesy it?&quot; he cried jubilantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I not say that some impresario would discover
you and make your fortune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is plenty of work ahead,&quot; said Gretchen
sagely.</p>

<p>&quot;Always, no matter what we strive for. But
a brave heart and a cheerful smile carry you
half-way up the hill. Where were you going
when this popinjay stopped you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was going to the clock-mender's for a clock
he is repairing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've nothing to do. I'll go with you. I've
an idea that I should like to talk with you about
a very important matter. Perhaps it would be
easier to talk first and then go for the clock. If
you have it you'll be watching it. Will you come
into the garden with me now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Herr.&quot; Gretchen would have gone anywhere
with this strange man. He inspired confidence.</p>

<p>The garden was a snug little place; a few
peach-trees and arbor-vines and vegetables, and
tables and chairs on the brick walk.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" />So you are going to become a prima donna?&quot;
he began, seating himself opposite her.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going to try,&quot; she smiled. &quot;What is it
you wish to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am wondering how to begin,&quot; looking at
the blue sky.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it difficult?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, very.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why bother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some things are written before we are born.
And I must, in the order of things, read this
writing to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Begin,&quot; said Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you any dreams?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; vaguely.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean the kind one has in the daytime, the
dreams when the eyes are wide open.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who has not dreamed of riding in carriages,
of dressing in silks, of wearing rich ornaments?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; Gretchen clasped her hands and leaned
on her elbows. &quot;And there are palaces, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure.&quot; There was a long pause. &quot;How
would you like a dream of this kind to come
true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" />Do they ever come true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this particular case, I am a fairy. I know
that I do not look it; still, I am. With one touch
of my wand&mdash;this oak staff&mdash;I can bring you all
these things you have dreamed about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what would I do with carriages and jewels?
I am only a goose-girl, and I am to be married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To that young rascal of a vintner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is not a rascal!&quot; loyally.</p>

<p>&quot;It will take but little to make him one,&quot; with
an odd grimness.</p>

<p>Gretchen did not understand.</p>

<p>He resumed, &quot;how would you like a little palace,
with servants at your beck and call, with
carriages to ride in, with silks and velvets to
wear, and jewels to adorn your hair? How
would you like these things? Eh? Never again
to worry about your hands, never again to know
the weariness of toil, to be mistress of swans instead
of geese?&quot;</p>

<p>A shadow fell upon Gretchen's face; the eagerness
died out of her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not understand you, Herr. By what
right should I possess these things?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" />By the supreme right of beauty, beauty
alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would it be&mdash;honest?&quot;</p>

<p>For the first time he lowered his eyes. The
clear crystal spirit in hers embarrassed him.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, let us go for your clock,&quot; he said,
rising. &quot;I am an old fool. I forgot that one
talks like this only to opera-dancers.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Gretchen understood. &quot;I am all alone,&quot;
she said; &quot;I have had to fight my battles with
these two hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a black devil, <i>Kindchen</i>. Forget what I
have said. You are worthy the brightest crown
in Europe; but you wear a better one than that&mdash;goodness.
If any one should ever make you
unhappy, come to me. I will be your godfather.
Will you forgive an old man who ought to have
known better?&quot;</p>

<p>There was such unmistakable honesty in his
face and eyes that she did not hesitate, but placed
her hand in his.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you ask all those questions?&quot; she
inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps it was only to test your strength.
You are a brave and honest girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233" />And if trouble came,&quot; now smiling, &quot;where
should I find you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be near when it comes. Good fairies
are always close at hand.&quot; He swept his hat
from his head; ease and grace were in the movement;
no irony, nothing but respect. &quot;And do
you love this vintner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With all my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he loves you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. His lips might lie, but not his eyes and
the touch of his hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So much the worse!&quot; said the mountaineer inaudibly.</p>

<p>Gretchen had gone home with her clock; but
still Herr Ludwig, as the mountaineer called
himself, tarried in the dim and dusty shop.
Clocks, old and new, broken and whole, clocks
from the four ends of the world; and watches,
thick and clumsy, thin and graceful, of gold and
silver and pewter.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything you want?&quot; asked the
clock-mender.</p>

<p>Herr Ludwig turned. How old this clock-mender
was, how very old!</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;I've a watch I should like
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" />you to look over.&quot; And he carelessly laid the
beautiful time-piece on the worn wooden counter.</p>

<p>The clock-mender literally pounced upon it.
&quot;Where did you get a watch like this?&quot; he demanded
suspiciously.</p>

<p>&quot;It is mine. You will find my name engraved
inside the back lid.&quot;</p>

<p>The clock-mender pried open the case, adjusted
his glass&mdash;and dropped it, shaking with terror.</p>

<p>&quot;You?&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; said Herr Ludwig, putting a finger to
his lips.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV" /><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" />CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>FIND THE WOMAN</h3>


<p>The watch, slipping from the clock-mender's
hand, spun like a coin on the counter,
while the clock-mender himself, his eyes bulging,
his jaw dangling, it might be said, staggered
back upon his stool.</p>

<p>&quot;So this is the end?&quot; he said in a kind of mutter.</p>

<p>&quot;The end of what?&quot; demanded the owner of
the watch.</p>

<p>&quot;Of all my labors, to me and to what little I
have left!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fiddlesticks! I am here for no purpose regarding
you, my comrade. So far as I am concerned,
your secret is as dead as it ever was. I
had a fancy that you were living in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Paris! <i>Gott!</i> For seventeen, eighteen years
I have traveled hither and thither, always on
some false clue. Never a band of Gipsies I
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" />heard of that I did not seek them out. Nothing,
nothing! You will never know what I have gone
through, and uselessly, to prove my innocence.
It always comes back in a circle; what benefit to
me would have been a crime like that of which I
was accused? Was I not high in honor? Was I
not wealthy? Was not my home life a happy
one? What benefit to me, I say?&quot; a growing
fierceness in his voice and gestures. &quot;All my estates
confiscated, my wife dead of shame, and I
molding among these clocks!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why the clocks?&quot; in wonder.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a pastime of mine when I was a boy.
I used to be tinkering among all the clocks in the
house. So I bought out this old shop. From
time to time I have left it in the hands of an assistant.
The grand duke has a wonderful Friesian
clock. One day it fell out of order, and the
court jeweler could do nothing with it. I was
summoned, I! No one recognized me, I have
changed so. I mended the clock and went away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what is the use of all this, now that her
highness is found?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My honor; to the duke it is black as ever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you gone forward any?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" />Like Sisyphus! I had begun to give up
hope, when the Gipsy I was seeking was seen by
one of my agents. He alone knows the secret.
And I am waiting, waiting. But you believe,
Ludwig?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Carl, you are as innocent of it all as I am
or as my brother was. Come with me to Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Ludwig, this is my country, however unjustly
it has treated me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes. And to think that you and I and
the grand duke were comrades at Heidelberg!
But if your Gipsy fails you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Still I shall remain. This will be all I shall
have, these clocks. I am only sixty-eight, yet no
one would believe me under eighty. I no longer
gaze into mirrors. I have forgotten how I look.
There were letters found in my desk, all forgeries,
I knew, but so cleverly done I could only
deny. I saw that my case was hopeless, so I fled
to Paris. I wrote Herbeck once while there. He
believed that I was innocent. I have his letter
yet. He has a great heart, Ludwig, and he has
done splendid work for Ehrenstein.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He keeps a steady hand on the duke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" />But you, what are you doing in Dreiberg, in
this guise?&quot;</p>

<p>Herr Ludwig sat upon the counter and
clasped a knee. &quot;Do you care for fairy-stories?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, once upon a time there lived a king. He
was young. He had an uncle who watched over
him and his affairs. They call such uncles prince
regents. This prince regent had an idea regarding
the future welfare of this nephew. He
would bring him up to be a man, well educated,
broad-minded, and clean-lived. He should have
a pilot to guide him past the traps and vices
which befall the young. Time wore on. The
lad grew up, clean in mind, strong in body, liberal;
a fine prince. No scandalous entanglements;
no gaming; no wine-bibbing beyond what
any decent man may do. In his palace few saw
anything of him after his fifteenth year. He
went into the world under an assumed name. By
and by he came home, quietly. His uncle was
proud of him, for his eye was clear and his
tongue was clean. In one month he was to be
coronated. And now what do you think? He
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" />must have one more adventure, just one. Would
his uncle go with him? Certainly not. Moreover,
the time for adventure was over. He must
no longer wander about; he was a king; he must
put his hand to king-craft. And one morning
his uncle found him gone, gone as completely as
if he had never existed. What to do? Ah! The
prince regent set it going that his majesty had
gone a-hunting in Bavaria. Then the prince
regent put on some old clothes and went a-venturing
himself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the end?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God knows!&quot; said Ludwig, sliding off the
counter.</p>

<p>Nothing but the ticking of the clocks was
heard.</p>

<p>&quot;And fatuous fool that this uncle was, he committed
an almost irreparable blunder. He tried
to marry his nephew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. But if you are discovered
here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is not likely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Ludwig, it is not the expected that always
happens. Be careful; you know the full
wording of Herbeck's treaty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" />Herbeck; there's a man,&quot; said Herr Ludwig
admiringly. &quot;To have found her highness as
he did!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is lucky,&quot; but without resentment.</p>

<p>The other picked up his watch. &quot;Can I be
of material assistance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want nothing,&quot; haughtily.</p>

<p>&quot;Proud old imbecile!&quot; replied the mountaineer
kindly. &quot;You have been deeply wronged, but
some day you will pick up the thread in the
labyrinth, and there will be light forward. I
myself shall see what can be done with the duke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will never be brought to reason unless
indubitable evidence of my innocence confronts
him. With the restoration of the princess fifty
political prisoners were given their liberty and
restored to citizenship. The place once occupied
by my name is still blank, obliterated. It is
hard. I have given the best of my heart and
of my brain to Ehrenstein&mdash;for this! I am innocent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you, Carl. Remember, Jugendheit
will always welcome you. I must be going. I
have much to do between now and midnight.
The good God will unravel the snarl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" />Or forget it,&quot; cynically. &quot;Good-by, Ludwig.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a hand-clasp, and the mountaineer
took himself off. The clock-mender philosophically
reached for his tools. He had wasted time
enough over retrospection; he determined to occupy
himself with the present only. Tick-tock!
tick-tock! sang the clocks about him. All at
once a volume of musical sounds broke forth;
cuckoo-calls, chimes, tinkles light and thin,
booms deep and vibrant. But the clock-mender
bent over his work; all he was conscious of was
the eternal tick-tock! tick-tock! on and on, without
cessation.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Carmichael walked his horse. This morning
he had ridden out almost to the frontier and was
now on his return. As he passed through the
last grove of pines and came into the clearing
the picture was exquisite; the three majestic
bergs of ice and snow above Dreiberg, the city
shining white and fairylike in the mid-morning's
sun, and the long, half-circling ribbon of a road.
He sighed, and the horse cocked his ears at the
sound.</p>

<p><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242" />No longer did Carmichael take the south pass
for his morning rides. That was the favored
going of her highness, and he avoided her now.
In truth, he dared not meet her now; it would
have been out of wisdom. So long as she had
been free his presence had caused no comment,
only tolerant amusement among the nobles at
court. It chafed him to be regarded as a harmless
individual, for he knew that he was far from
being in that class. There was a wild strain in
him. Dreiberg might have waked up some fine
morning to learn that for a second time her
princess had been stolen, and that there was a
vacancy in the American consulate. How many
times had he been seized with the mad desire to
snatch the bridle of her horse and ride away
with her into a far country! How often had
his arms started out toward her, only to drop
stiffly to his sides!</p>

<p>March hares! They were Solons as compared
with his own futile madness. But it was different
now. She was to marry the king of Jugendheit;
it was in the order of things that he ride
alone. He knew that court etiquette demanded
the isolation of the Princess Hildegarde from
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" />male escort other than that formally provided.
The two soldiers detailed to act as her grooms
or bodyguards were not, of course, to be considered.
So, of the morning, he went down to
the military field to watch the maneuvers, which
were drawing to a close; or rode out to the frontier,
or took the side road to Eissen, where the
summer palaces were. But it was all dreary;
the zest of living had somehow dropped out of
things.</p>

<p>The road to Eissen began about six miles
north of the base of the Dreiberg mountain. It
swerved to the east. As Carmichael reached the
fork his horse began to limp. He jumped down
and removed the stone. It was then that he
heard the far-off mutter of hoofs. Coming along
the road from Eissen were a trio of riders. Carmichael
laughed weakly.</p>

<p>&quot;I swear to Heaven that this is no fault of
mine!&quot;</p>

<p>Should he mount and be off before she made
the turn? Bah! It was an accident; he would
make the most of it. The bodyguard could easily
vindicate him, in any event. He remounted and
waited.</p>

<p><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" />She came in full flight, rosy, radiant, as lovely
as Diana. Carmichael swung his cap boyishly;
and there was a swirl of dust as she drew up.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Herr Carmichael!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, your Highness!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which way have you been riding?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Toward Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you are returning?&quot; With a short nod
of her head she signaled for the two soldiers to
fall back.</p>

<p>The two looked at each other embarrassedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon, Highness,&quot; said one of them, &quot;but
the orders of the duke will not permit us to leave
you. There have been thieves along the road of
late.&quot;</p>

<p>Thieves? This was the first time Carmichael
had heard of it. The real significance of the
maneuver escaped him; but her highness was
not fooled.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; she replied. &quot;One of you ride
forward and one of you take the rear.&quot; Then
she spoke to Carmichael in English.</p>

<p>The soldiers shrugged. To them it did not
matter what language her highness adopted so
long as they obeyed the letter of the duke's in<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" />structions.
The little cavalcade directed its
course toward the city.</p>

<p>&quot;You have not been riding of late,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Then she had missed him. Carmichael's heart
expanded. To be missed is to be regretted, and
one regrets only those in whom one is interested.</p>

<p>&quot;I have ridden the same as usual, your Highness;
only I have taken this road for a change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; She patted the glistening neck of her
mare. So he had purposely tried to avoid her?
Why? She stole a sly glance at him. Why
were not kings molded in this form? All the
kings she had met had something the matter with
them, crooked legs, weak eyes, bald, young, or
old, and daft over gaming-tables and opera-dancers.
And the one man among them all&mdash;at
least she had been informed that the king of
Jugendheit was all of a man&mdash;had politely declined.
There was some chagrin in this for her,
but no bitterness or rancor. In truth, she was
more chagrined on her father's account than on
her own.</p>

<p>&quot;You should have taken the south pass. It
was lovely yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps this way has been wisest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" />Are you become afraid of me?&quot; archly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your Highness.&quot; If he had looked at
her instead of his horse's ears, and smiled, all
would have been well.</p>

<p>She instantly regretted the question. &quot;I am
sorry that I have become an ogress.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To me your highness is the most perfect of
women. I am guilty of lese-majesty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not lock you up,&quot; she said, and added
under her breath, &quot;as my good father would
like to! Besides,&quot; she continued aloud, &quot;I rather
like to set the court by the ears. Whoever heard
of a serene highness doing the things I do? I
suppose it is because I have known years of freedom,
freedom of action, of thought, of speech.
These habits can not change at once. In fact,
I do not believe they ever will. But the duke,
my father, is good; he understands and trusts
me. Ah, but I shall lead some king a merry
life!&quot; with a wicked gleam in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Frederick of Jugendheit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it true that you have not heard yet? I
have declined the honor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My serene highness,&quot; with a smile. &quot;This,
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" />of course, is as yet a state secret; and my reason
for telling you is not a princess', but a woman's.
Solve it if you can.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael fumbled the reins blindly. &quot;They
say that he is a handsome young man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What has that to do with it? The interest
he takes in his kingdom is positively negative.
I have learned that he has been to his capital but
twice since he was fifteen. He is even now absent
on a hunting trip in Bavaria, and his coronation
but a few days off. There will be only
one king in Jugendheit, and that will be the
prince regent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has done tolerably well up to the present,&quot;
observed Carmichael, welcoming this
change. &quot;Jugendheit is prosperous; it has a
splendid army. The prince regent is a fine type
of man, they say, rugged, patient, frugal and
sensible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is an instance where he made a cruel
blunder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No man is infallible,&quot; said he, wondering
what this blunder was.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose not. Look! The artillery is firing.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" />Boom-boom! They saw the smoke leap from
the muzzles of the cannon, and it seemed minutes
before the sound reached them.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a fine country, too,&quot; she said, with
pride; &quot;prosperous, and an army not inferior
to that of Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was not making comparisons, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that, my friend. I was simply speaking
from the heart. But I doubt if the prince
regent is a better man than our Herbeck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I prefer Herbeck, never having met the
prince regent. But I have some news for your
highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;News for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I am about to ask for my recall,&quot; he
said, the idea having come into his mind at that
precise moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Your recall?&quot;</p>

<p>Had he been looking at her he would have noticed
that the color on her fair cheeks had gone
a shade lighter.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is not this sudden? it is not very complimentary to Ehrenstein.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" />The happiest days in my life have been spent
here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why seek to be recalled?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am essentially a man of action, your Highness.
I am growing dull and stupid amid these
charming pleasures. Action; I have always been
mixed up in some trouble or other. Here it is
a round of pleasure from day to day. I long
for buffets. I am wicked enough to wish for
war.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Cherchez la femme!</i>&quot; she cried. &quot;There is a
woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; recklessly.</p>

<p>&quot;Then go to her, my friend, go to her.&quot; And
she waved her crop over his head as in benediction.
&quot;Some day, before you go, I shall ask
you all about her.&quot; Ah, as if she did not know!
But half the charm in life is playing with hidden
dangers.</p>

<p>He did not speak, but caught up the reins
firmly. She touched her mare on the flank, and
the four began trotting, a pace which they maintained
as far as the military field. Here they
paused, for the scene was animated and full of
color. Squadrons of cavalry raced across the
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" />field; infantry closed in or deployed; artillery
rumbled, wheeled, stopped, unlimbered. Bang-bang!
The earth shivered and rocked. Guerdons
were flying, bugles were blowing, and sabers were
flashing.</p>

<p>&quot;It is beautiful,&quot; she cried, &quot;this mimic war.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May your highness never see aught else!&quot; he
replied fervently.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes; you have seen it divested of all its
pomp. You have seen it in all its cruelty and
horror.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have known even the terror of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were afraid?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Many times.&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed. It is only the coward who denies
fear.</p>

<p>He would certainly ask for his recall or transfer.
He was eating his heart out here in Dreiberg.</p>

<p>They began the incline. She did most of the
talking, brightly and gaily; but his ears were
dull, for the undercurrent passed by him. He
was, for the first time, impressed with the fact
that the young ladies of the court never accompanied
her on her morning rides. There were
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251" />frequent afternoon excursions, when several
ladies and gentlemen rode with her highness,
but in the mornings, never.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you return to America?&quot; she queried.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall idle in Paris for a while. I have an
idea that there will be war one of these days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And which side will you take?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should be a traitor if I fought for France;
I should be an ingrate if I fought against her.
I should be a spectator, a neutral.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would expose you to danger without
the right to strike a blow in defense.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I were hurt it would be but an accident.
War correspondents would run a hundred more
risks than I. Oh, I should be careful; I know
war too well not to be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All this is strange talk for a man who is a
confessed lover.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me!&quot; his eyes rather empty.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you tell me there is a woman; and all
your talk is about war and danger. These are
opposites; please explain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a woman, but she will not hinder me
in any way. She will, in fact, know nothing
about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" />You are a strange lover. I never read anything
like you in story-books. Forgive me! I
am thoughtless. The subject may be painful to
you.&quot;</p>

<p>The horses began to pull. Under normal circumstances
Carmichael would not have dismounted,
but his horse had carried him many miles
that morning, and he was a merciful rider. In
the war days often had his life depended upon
the care of his horse.</p>

<p>&quot;You have been riding hard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, only far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not believe that there is a finer horseman
in all Ehrenstein than yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness is very good to say that.&quot;
Why had he not gone on instead of waiting at
the fork?</p>

<p>Within a few hundred yards of the gates he
mounted again. And then he saw a lonely
figure sitting on the parapet. He would have
recognized that square form anywhere. And he
welcomed the sight of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness, do you see that man yonder,
on the parapet? We fought in the same cavalry.
He is covered with scars. Not one man
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" />in a thousand would have gone through what he
did and lived.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is he an American?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By adoption. And may I ask a favor of your
highness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two!&quot; merrily.</p>

<p>&quot;May I present him? It will be the joy of
his life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly. All brave men interest me.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach rose up, uncovered, thinking that
the riders were going to pass him. But to his
surprise his friend Carmichael stopped his horse
and beckoned to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Grumbach,&quot; said Carmichael, &quot;her serene
highness desires me to present you.&quot;</p>

<p>Hans was stricken dumb. He knew of no
greater honor.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Carmichael,&quot; she said in English, &quot;tells
me that you fought with him in the American
war?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>She plied him with a number of questions;
how many battles they had fought in, how many
times they had been wounded, how they lived in
camp, and so forth; and which was the more
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" />powerful engine of war, the infantry or the
cavalry.</p>

<p>&quot;The cavalry, Highness,&quot; said Hans, without
hesitation.</p>

<p>She laughed. &quot;If you had been a foot-soldier,
you would have said the infantry; of the artillery,
you would have sworn by the cannon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is true, Highness. The three arms are
necessary, but there is ever the individual pride
in the arm one serves in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that is right. You speak good English,&quot;
she remarked.</p>

<p>&quot;I have lived more than sixteen years in
America, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like it there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a great country, full of great ideas and
great men, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you will go back?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Soon, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>The mare, knowing that this was the way
home, grew restive and began prancing and
pawing the road. She reined in quickly. As she
did so, something yellow flashed downward and
tinkled as it struck the ground. Grumbach
hastened forward.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" />My locket,&quot; said her highness anxiously.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not broken, Highness,&quot; said Grumbach;
&quot;only the chain has come apart.&quot; Then he
handed it to her gravely.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; Her highness put both chain
and locket into a small purse which she carried
in her belt, touched the mare, and sped up the
road, Carmichael following.</p>

<p>Grumbach returned to the parapet. He followed them
till they passed out of sight beyond
the gates.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gott!</i>&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>His face was as livid as the scar on his head.</p>

<h3>THE WRONG MAN</h3>


<p>Herbeck dropped his quill, and there
was a dream in his eyes. His desk was
littered with papers, well covered with ink; flowing
sentences, and innumerable figures. He was
the watch-dog of the duchy. Never a bill from
the Reichstag that did not pass under his cold
eye before it went to the duke for his signature,
his approval, or veto. Not a copper was needlessly
wasted, and never was one held back unnecessarily.
Herbeck was just both in great
and little things. The commoners could neither
fool nor browbeat him.</p>

<p>The dream in his eyes grew; it was tender and
kindly. The bar of sunlight lengthened across
his desk, and finally passed on. Still he sat
there, motionless, rapt. And thus the duke
found him. But there was no dream in <i>his</i> eyes;
they were cold with implacable anger. He held
a letter in his hand and tossed it to Herbeck.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257" />I shall throw ten thousand men across the
frontier to-night, let the consequences be what
they may.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ten thousand men?&quot; The dream was shattered.
War again?</p>

<p>&quot;Read that. It is the second anonymous communication
I have received within a week. As
the first was truthful, there is no reason to believe
this one to be false.&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck read, and he was genuinely startled.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you say to that?&quot; triumphantly.</p>

<p>&quot;This,&quot; with that rapid decision which made
him the really great tactician he was. &quot;Let them
go quietly back to Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; blazed the duke.</p>

<p>&quot;Are we rich enough for war?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Always questions, questions! What the devil
is my army for if not to uphold my dignity?
Herbeck, you shall not argue me out of this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather let me reason. This is some prank,
which I am sure does not concern Ehrenstein in
the least. They would never dare enter Dreiberg
for aught else. There must be a flaw in
our secret service.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doubtless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" />I have seen this writing before,&quot; said Herbeck.
&quot;I shall make it my business to inquire
who it is that takes this kindly interest in the
affairs of state.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke struck the bell violently.</p>

<p>&quot;Summon the chief of the police,&quot; he said to
the secretary.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, your Highness, let it be a police
affair. This letter does not state the why and
wherefore of their presence here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It holds enough for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will your highness leave the matter in my
hands?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Herbeck, in some things you are weak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And in others I am strong,&quot; smiled the chancellor.
&quot;I am weak when there is talk of war;
I am strong when peace is in the balance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it possible, Herbeck, that you do not appreciate
the magnitude of the situation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is precisely because I do that I wish to
move slowly. Wait. Let the police find out
<i>why</i> they are here. There will be time enough
then to declare war. They have never seen her
highness. Who knows?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! But they have violated the treaty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" />That depends upon whether their presence
here is or is not a menace to the state. If they
are here on private concerns which in no wise
touch Ehrenstein, it would be foolhardy to declare
war. Your highness is always letting your
personal wounds blur your eyesight. Some day
you will find that Jugendheit is innocent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God hasten the day and hour!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, let us hope that the mystery of it all
will be cleared up. You are just and patient in
everything but this.&quot; Herbeck idled with his
quill. The little finger of his right hand was
badly scarred, the mutilation of a fencing-bout
in his student days.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you advise?&quot; wearily. It seemed
to the duke that Herbeck of late never agreed
with him.</p>

<p>&quot;My advice is to wait. In a day or so arrest
them under the pretext that you believe them to
be spies. If they remain mute, then the case is
serious, and you will have them on the hip. If,
on the other hand, this invasion is harmless and
they declare themselves, the matter can be adjusted
in this wise: ignore their declaration and
confine them a day or two in the city prison,
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260" />then publish the news broadcast. Having themselves
broken the letter if not the spirit of the
treaty, they will not dare declare war. Every
court in Europe will laugh.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke struck his hands together. &quot;You
are always right, Herbeck. This plan could not
have been devised better or more to my satisfaction.&quot;
The duke laughed. &quot;You are right.
Ah, here is the chief.&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck read the letter in part to the chief,
who jotted down the words, repeating aloud in
a kind of mutter: &quot;A mountaineer, a vintner,
a carter, a butcher, and a baker. You will give
me their descriptions, your Excellency?&quot;</p>

<p>Herbeck read the postscript.</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't tell him who&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should he know?&quot; said Herbeck, glancing
shrewdly at the duke. &quot;His ignorance will
be all the better for the plot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then this is big game, your Highness?&quot;
asked the chief.</p>

<p>&quot;Big game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One is as big and powerful as a Carpathian
bear. Look out,&quot; warned Herbeck.</p>

<p>&quot;And he is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261" />The mountaineer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the vintner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he is a little fellow, and hasn't grown his
bite yet,&quot; said Herbeck dryly.</p>

<p>The duke laughed again. It would be as good
as a play.</p>

<p>&quot;I thank you, Herbeck. You have neatly arranged
a fine comedy. I do not think so clearly
as I used to. When the arrest is made, give it
as much publicity as possible. Take a squad
of soldiers; it will give it a military look. Will
you be on the field this afternoon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, your highness,&quot; touching the papers
which strewed his desk; &quot;this will keep me busy
well into evening.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke waved his hand cheerfully and left
the cabinet.</p>

<p>&quot;Your excellency, then, really leaves me to
work in the dark?&quot; asked the chief uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; tearing up the note. &quot;But you will
not be in the dark long after you have arrested
these persons. Begin with the mountaineer and
the vintner; the others do not matter so much.&quot;
Then Herbeck laughed. The chief raised his
head. He had not heard his excellency laugh
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262" />like that in many moons. &quot;Report to me your
progress. Unfortunately my informant does
not state just where these fellows are to be
found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is my business, your Excellency.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good luck to you!&quot; responded Herbeck, with
a gesture of dismissal.</p>

<p>When her highness came in from her morning's
ride she found the duke waiting in her
apartments.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, father,&quot; kissing him, &quot;what brings you
here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little idea I have in mind.&quot; He drew her
down to the arm of the chair. &quot;We all have our
little day-dreams.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who does not, father?&quot; She slid her arm
round his neck. She was full of affection for
this kindly parent.</p>

<p>&quot;But there are those of us who must not accept
day-dreams as realities; for then there will
be heartaches and futile longings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are warning me. About what, father?&quot;
There was a little stab in her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Carmichael is a fine fellow, brave,
witty, shrewd. If all Americans are like him,<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" />
America will soon become a force in the world.
I have taken a fancy to him; and you know what
they say of your father&mdash;no formality with
those whom he likes. Humanly, I am right; but
in the virtue of everyday events in court life,
I am wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>She moved uneasily.</p>

<p>He went on: &quot;Herbeck has spoken of it, the
older women speak of it; and they all say&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say!&quot; she cried hotly, leaping to her feet.
&quot;What do I care what they say? Are you not
the grand duke, and am I not your daughter?&quot;</p>

<p>In his turn the duke felt the stab.</p>

<p>&quot;You must ride no more with Herr Carmichael.
It is neither wise nor safe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Father!&quot;</p>

<p>He was up, with his arms folding round her.
&quot;Child, it is only for your sake. Listen to me.
I married your mother because I loved her and
she loved me. The case is isolated, rare, out of
the beaten path in the affairs of rulers. But
you, you must be a princess. You must steel
your heart against the invasion of love, unless it
comes from a state equal or superior to your
own. It is harsh and cruel, but it is a law that
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264" />will neither bend nor break. Do you understand me?&quot;</p>

<p>The girl stared blindly at the wall. &quot;Yes,
father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is all my fault,&quot; said the duke, deeply
agitated, for the girl trembled under his touch.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not ride with him any more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a good girl,&quot; patting her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been a princess such a little while.&quot;</p>

<p>He kissed the wheaten-colored hair. &quot;Be a
brave heart, and I shall engage to find a king for
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want any playthings, father,&quot; with
the old light touch; and then she looked him full
in the eyes. &quot;I promise to do nothing more to
create comment if, on the other hand, you will
promise to give me two years more of freedom.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke readily assented, and shortly returned
to his own suite, rather pleased that there
had been no scene; not that he had expected any.</p>

<p>Now that she was alone, she slipped into the
chair, beat a light tattoo with her riding-whip
against her teeth, and looked fixedly at the wall
again, as if to gaze beyond it, into the dim future.
But she saw nothing save that she was
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" />young and that the days in Dresden, for all their
penury, were far pleasanter than these.</p>

<p>Meantime the chief of police called his subaltern
and placed in his hands the peculiar descriptions.
The word vintner caused him to give
vent to an ejaculation of surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;He was in here last night. I have had him
followed all day. He lives over the American
consulate. Among his things was found the
uniform of a colonel in the Prussian Uhlans.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! Arrest him tom-orrow, or the day after
at the latest. But the mountaineer is the big
game. Do not arrest the vintner till you have
him. Where one is the other is likely to be.
But on the moment of arrest you must have a
squad of soldiers at your back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Soldiers?&quot; doubtfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Express orders of his highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It shall be done.&quot;</p>

<p>Considerable activity was manifest in the police
bureau the rest of that day.</p>

<p>To return to Carmichael. He had never before
concerned himself with resignations. Up
to this hour he had never resigned anything he
had set his heart upon. So it was not an easy
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" />matter for him to compose a letter to the secretary
of state, resigning the post at Dreiberg.
True, he added that he desired to be transferred
to a seaport town, France or Italy preferred.
The high altitude in Dreiberg had affected his
heart. However, in case there was no other
available post, they would kindly appoint his
successor at once. Carmichael never faltered
where his courage was concerned, and it needed
a fine quality of moral courage to write this letter
and enclose it in the diplomatic pouch which
went into the mails that night. It took courage
indeed to face the matter squarely and resolutely,
when there was the urging desire to linger on
and on, indefinitely. That she was not going
to marry the king of Jugendheit did not alter
his affairs in the least. It was all hopeless, absurd,
and impossible. He must go.</p>

<p>Some one was knocking on the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Come in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A letter for your excellency,&quot; said the
concierge.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait till I read it. There may be an answer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" />If Herr Carmichael would learn the secret
of number forty Krumerweg, let him attire
himself as a vintner and be in the Krumerweg
at eight o'clock to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>This note was as welcome to the recipient as
the flowers in the spring. An adventure? He
was ready, now and always. Anything to take
his mind off his own dismal affairs. Then he
recalled the woman in black; the letter could apply
to none but her. More than this, he might
light upon the puzzle regarding the vintner.
He had met the fellow before. But where?</p>

<p>&quot;What sort of clothes does a vintner wear?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;A vintner, your Excellency?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I shall need the costume of a vintner
this evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that will be easy,&quot; affirmed the concierge,
&quot;if your excellency does not mind wearing
clothes that have already been worn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My excellency will not care a hang. Procure
them as soon as you can.&quot;</p>

<p>So it came about that Carmichael, dressed as
a vintner, his hat over his eyes, stole into the
misty night and took the way to the Krumerweg.<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" />
He knew exactly where he wished to go: number
forty. It was gray-black in the small streets;
and but for the occasional light in a window the
dark would have had no modification. Sometimes
he would lose the point of the compass and
blunder against a wall or find himself feeling
for the curb, hesitant of foot. The wayside
shrine was a rift in the gloom, and he knew that
he had only a few more steps to take. After all,
who was the lady in black and why should he
bother himself about her? She probably came
from the back stairs of the palace. And yet,
the chancellor himself had been in this place.
What should he do? Should he wait across the
street? Should he knock at the door and ask
to be admitted? No; he must skulk in the dark,
on the opposite side. He picked his way over
the street and stood for a moment in the denser
black.</p>

<p>A step? He trained his ear. But even as he
did so his arms were grasped firmly and twisted
behind his back, and at the same time a cloth
was wrapped round the lower part of his face,
leaving only his eyes and nose visible. It was
all so sudden and unexpected that he was passive
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" />the first few seconds; after that there was some
scuffling, strenuous, too. He was fighting
against three. Desperately he surged this way
and that. Even in the heat of battle he wondered
a little why no one struck him; they simply
clung to him, and at length he could not move.
His hands were tied, not roughly, but surely.
In all this commotion, not a whisper, not a voice;
only heavy breathing.</p>

<p>Then one of the three whistled. A minute or
two after a closed carriage came into the Krumerweg,
and Carmichael was literally bundled inside.
His feet were now bound. Two of his
captors sat on the forward seat, while the third
joined the driver. Carmichael could distinguish
nothing but outlines and shadows. He choked,
for he was furious. To be trussed like this,
without any explanation whatever! What the
devil was going on? Unanswered.</p>

<p>The carriage began to move slowly. It had
to; swift driving in the Krumerweg was hardly
possible and at no time safe. Carmichael set
himself to note the turns of the street. One
turn after another he counted, fixing as well as
he could the topography of the town through
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" />which they were passing. At last he realized
that they were leaving Dreiberg behind and
were going down the mountain on the north side,
toward Jugendheit. Once the level road was
reached, a fast pace was set and maintained for
miles. At the Elirenstein barrier no question
was asked, and Carmichael's one hope was shattered.
At the Jugendheit barrier the carriage
stopped. There were voices. Carmichael saw
the flicker of a lantern. His captors got out.
Presently there appeared at the door an old man
dressed as a mountaineer. In his hand was the
lantern.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, dear nephew&mdash;Fools!&quot; he
broke off, swinging round. &quot;He has tricked you
all. This is not <i>he</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>Three astonished faces peered over the old
man's shoulder. Carmichael eyed them evilly.
He now saw that one was a carter, another a
butcher, and the third a baker. He had seen
them before, in the Black Eagle. But this signified
nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Untie him and take off that rag. It may be
Scharfenstein.&quot; The old man possessed authority.</p>

<p><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" />Carmichael, freed, stretched himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; he said, with a dangerous quiet.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Carmichael, the American consul!&quot;
The old man nearly dropped the lantern. &quot;Oh,
you infernal blockheads!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Explanations are in order,&quot; suggested Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;You are offered a thousand apologies for a
stupid mistake. Now, may I ask how you came
to be dressed in these clothes on this particular
night?&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael's anger dissolved, and he laughed.
All the mystery was gone with the abruptness of
a mist under the first glare of the sun. He saw
how neatly he had been duped. He still carried
the note. This he gave to the leader of this
midnight expedition.</p>

<p>&quot;Humph!&quot; said the old man in a growl. &quot;I
thought as much.&quot; He whispered to his companions.
&quot;Herr Carmichael, I shall have the
honor of escorting you back to Dreiberg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But will it be as easy to go in as it was to
come out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trust you for that. The American consul's
word will be sufficient for our needs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" />And if I refuse to give that word?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, you will have to use your legs,&quot;
curtly.</p>

<p>&quot;I prefer to ride.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks. I shall sit with the driver.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That also will please me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you ask no further questions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should I? I know all I wish to know,
which is more than you would care to have me.&quot;</p>

<p>The mountaineer swore.</p>

<p>&quot;If we talk any longer I shall be late for
breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Forward, then!&quot;</p>

<p>On the way, it all came back to Carmichael
with the vividness of a forgotten photograph,
come upon suddenly: Bonn, the Rhine, swift
and turbulent, a tow-headed young fellow who
could not swim well, his own plunge, his fingers
in the flaxen hair, and the hard fight to the
landing; all this was a tale twice told.</p>

<p>Vintner? Not much!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI" /><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" />CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>HER FAN</h3>


<p>It was dawn when they began to pull up the
road to Dreiberg. The return had been
leisurely despite Carmichael's impatience. In
the military field the troops were breaking camp
for their departure to the various posts throughout
the duchy. Only the officers, who were to
attend the court ball that evening, and the resident
troops would remain. The maneuvers were
over; the pomp of miniature war was done. Carmichael
peered through the window. What a
play yonder scene was to what he had been
through! To break camp before dawn, before
breakfast, rain and hail and snow smothering
one; when the frost-bound iron of the musket
caught one's fingers and tore the skin; the shriek
of shot overhead, the boom of cannon and the
gulp of impact; cold, hungry, footsore, sleepy;
here and there a comrade crumpling up strangely
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" />and lying still and white; the muddy ruts in the
road; the whole world a dead gray like the face
of death! What did those yonder know of war?</p>

<p>The carriage stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not intrude, I trust?&quot; said the old
man, opening the door and getting in.</p>

<p>&quot;Not now,&quot; replied Carmichael. &quot;What is all
this about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A trifle; I might say a damn-fool trifle. But
what did you mean when you said you knew all
you wanted to know?&quot; The mountaineer showed
some anxiety.</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly what I said. The only thing that
confuses me is the motive.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man thought for a while. &quot;Suppose
you had a son who was making a fool of himself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or a nephew?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, or a nephew?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Making a fool of himself over what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing unusual in that. But what kind of
a woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A good woman, honest, too good by far for
any man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" />Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose she was vastly his inferior in station,
that marriage to him was merely a political
contract? What would you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I begin to understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am grateful for that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the risks you run!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believed them all over last night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you would dare handle him in this way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When the devil drives, my friend!&quot; The
other smiled. &quot;I was born in the heart of a war.
I have taken so many risks that the sense of danger
no longer has a keen edge. But now that
you understand, I am sure a soldier like yourself
will pardon the blunder of last night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your nephew is an ungrateful wretch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; coldly.</p>

<p>&quot;He knew all along who I was. I dragged
him out of the Rhine upon a certain day, and
he plays this trick!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You? Carmichael, Carmichael; of course; I
should have remembered the name, as he wrote
me at the time. Thank you! And you knew
him all the while?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I recalled his face, but the time and
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" />place were in the dark till this early morning.
Here we are at the gates. What's this? Guards?
I never saw them at these gates before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will make yourself known to them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. But if they question me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wink. Every soldier knows what that
means.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When a fellow turns in early in the morning?&quot;
Carmichael laughed hilariously.</p>

<p>&quot;I ask you frankly not to let them question
me. When I left the city last night I never expected
to return.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do what I can.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael bared his head and leaned out of
the window. He recognized one of the guards.
A policeman in military uniform!</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning!&quot; said Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Carmichael?&quot; surprised. &quot;Your excellency?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I've been having a little junket, I and
my friend here.&quot; And Carmichael winked.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sh! Very important affair,&quot; said the disguised
officer. &quot;Go on.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277" />But after the carriage had passed it occurred
to him that Carmichael wore a dress like a vintner's
and that his friend was a mountaineer!
<i>Du lieber Himmel!</i> What kind of a mix-up was
this? The chancellor never could have meant
Carmichael!</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks!&quot; whispered the old man.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you see the soldier?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is one of the police in disguise. Be on
your guard. If you don't mind I'll use this carriage
to the hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a thousand times welcome. I will
leave you here. And take the advice of an old
man who has seen the four sides of humanity:
leave falling in love to poets and to fools!&quot;</p>

<p>The mountaineer got out quickly, closed the
door, spoke a word to the driver, and slipped
into an alleyway.</p>

<p>Carmichael arrived at the Grand Hotel in time
to see her serene highness, accompanied by two
of her ladies and an escort of four soldiers, start
out for her morning ride. The zest of his own
strange adventure died. He waited till they had
passed, then slunk into the hotel. The concierge
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278" />gazed at him in amazement. Carmichael winked.
The concierge smiled. He understood. <i>Americaner</i>
or <i>Ehrensteiner</i>, the young fellows were
all the same.</p>

<p>&quot;Police at the gates,&quot; mused Carmichael, as
he soaked his head and face in cold water. &quot;By
George, it looks as if my friend the vintner was
in for some excitement! Far be it that I should
warn him. He had his little joke; I can wait
for mine.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen! Carmichael stopped, his collar but
half-way around his throat. Gretchen, brave,
kindly, beautiful Gretchen! Now, by the Lord,
that should not be! He would wring the vintner's
neck. He snapped the collar viciously.
He was not in an amiable mood this fair September
morning. And when some one hammered
on the door he called sharply.</p>

<p>Grumbach entered.</p>

<p>&quot;You are angry about something,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;So I am, but you are always welcome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have overslept?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; on the contrary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poker?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After a fashion,&quot; said Carmichael, the grum<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" />ble
gone from his voice. &quot;I was beaten by three
of a kind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I found a good hand later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Four?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no; only one. I haven't drawn yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not telling me all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. You are going to the ball to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would not miss it for five thousand crowns,&quot;
sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;You look as if you were going to a funeral
instead of the greatest event of the year in Dreiberg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't sleep well either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; one does not have to go out in order not
to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to know what's going on in that bullet-head of yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing is going on; everything has
stopped.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you make a confidant of me, Hans?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" />When you are ready it may be too late. I
leave Dreiberg for good in a few weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; For the first time Grumbach showed
interest.</p>

<p>&quot;I have resigned the consulship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And for what reason</p>

<p>Carmichael silently drew on his coat.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Ach!</i> So you have one, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One secret.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. But it's the kind we can't talk about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. Have you had breakfast?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Neither have I. Let us go together. It may
be we need each other's company this morning.
You and I won't have to bother about talking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You make a good comrade, Hans.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was a large crowd outside the palace
that night, which was clear and starry. A
troop of cavalry patrolled the fence. Carriage
after carriage rolled in through the gates, coming
directly from the opera. It was eleven
o'clock. All the great in the duchy were on
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281" />hand that night. Often a cheer rose from the
ranks of the outsiders as some popular general
or some famous beauty passed. It was an orderly
crowd, jostling and good-natured, held
only by curiosity. Every window in the palace
presented a glowing square of light; and beams
crisscrossed the emerald lawns and died in the
arms of the lurking shadows. The gardens were
illuminated besides. It was fairy-land, paid for
by those who were not entitled to enter. Few,
however, thought of this inconsistency. A duchy
is a duchy; nothing more need be said.</p>

<p>Carmichael was naturally democratic. To
ride a block in a carriage was to him a waste of
time. And he rather liked to shoulder into a
press. With the aid of his cane and a frequent
push of the elbow he worked his way to the gates.
And close by the sentry-box he saw Gretchen
and her vintner. Carmichael could not resist
stopping a moment. He raised his hat to
Gretchen, to the wonder of those nearest. The
vintner would have gladly disappeared, but the
human wall behind made this impossible. But
he was needlessly alarmed. Carmichael only
smiled ironically.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282" />Do you know where the American consulate
is?&quot; he asked low, so that none but Gretchen
and the vintner heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the vintner, blushing with shame.</p>

<p>&quot;I live above the agency.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good! I shall expect to see you in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>But the vintner was determined that he
shouldn't. He would be at work in the royal
vineyards on the morrow.</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrow?&quot; repeated Gretchen, to whom
this by-play was a blank. &quot;Why should he wish
to see you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who knows? Let us be going. They are
pressing us too close to the gates.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; acquiesced Gretchen, somewhat
disappointed. She wanted to see all there was
to be seen.</p>

<p>&quot;It is half-after ten,&quot; he added, as if to put
forward some logical excuse for leaving at this
moment.</p>

<p>A man followed them all the way to the
Krumerweg.</p>

<p>Carmichael threw himself eagerly into the
gaiety of the dance. Never had he seen the ball-<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283" />room
so brilliant with color. Among all those
there his was the one somber dress. The white
cambric stock and the frill in his shirt were the
only gay touches. It was not his fault: the rules
of the service compelled him thus to dress. But
he needed no brass or cloth of gold. There was
not a male head among all the others to compare
with his.</p>

<p>He was an accomplished waltzer, after the
manner of that day, when one went round and
round like some mechanical toy wound up.
Strauss and Waldteufel tingled his feet; and he
whirled ambassadors' wives till they were breathless
and ambassadors' daughters till they no
longer knew or cared where they were. He was
full of subtle deviltry this night, with an undercurrent
of malice toward every one and himself
in particular. This would be the last affair of
the kind for him, and he wanted a full memory
of it. Between times he exchanged a jest or
two with the chancellor or talked battles with old
Ducwitz; twice he caught the grand duke's eye,
but there was only a friendly nod from that
august personage, no invitation to talk. Thrice,
while on the floor, her highness passed him; but
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284" />there was never a smile, never a glance. He became
careless and reckless. He would seek her
and talk to her and smile at her even if the duke
threw a regiment in between. The Irish blood
in him burned to-night, capable of any folly.
He no longer danced. He waited and watched;
and it was during one of these waits that he saw
Grumbach in the gallery.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, what the devil is the Dutchman doing
with a pair of opera-glasses!&quot;</p>

<p>It required some time and patience to discover
the object of this singular attention on the part
of Grumbach. Carmichael was finally convinced
that this object was no less a person than her
serene highness!</p>

<p>Later her highness stood before one of the
long windows in the conservatory, listlessly
watching the people in the square. And these
poor fools envied her! To envy her, who was a
prisoner, a chattel to be exchanged for war's
immunity, who was a princess in name but a
cipher in fact! All was wrong with the world.
She had stolen out of the ball-room; the craving
to be alone had been too strong. Little she cared
whether they missed her or not. She left the
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285" />window and sat on one of the divans, idly opening
and shutting her fan. Was that some one
coming for her? She turned.</p>

<p>It was Carmichael.</p>

<p>What an opportunity for scandal! She
laughed inwardly. The barons and their wives,
the ambassadors' wives and their daughters,
would miss them both. And the spirit of deviltry
lay also upon her heart. She smiled at the
man and with her fan bade him be seated at her
side. The divinity that hedges in a king did
not bother either of them just then.</p>

<p>&quot;You have not asked me to dance to-night,&quot;
she declared.</p>

<p>&quot;I know it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am neither a prince nor an ambassador.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you <i>have</i> danced with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; I have been to Heaven now and then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And do you eject yourself thus easily?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By turning myself out my self-esteem remains
unruffled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you expected to be turned out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sooner or later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286" />Again that word! To him it was the most
tantalizing word in the language. It crucified
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; she repeated, her eyes soft and
dreamy.</p>

<p>&quot;As I have said, I am not a prince. I am only
a consul, not even a diplomat, simply a business
arm of my government. My diplomacy never
ascends above the quality of hops and wines imported.
I am supposed to take in any wandering
sailor, feed him, and ship him home. I am
also the official guide of all American tourists.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is no reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your father&mdash;&quot; He should have said the
grand duke.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes; my father, the chancellor, the ambassadors,
and their wives and daughters! I begin
to believe that you have grown afraid of
them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I confess that I have. I had an adventure
last night. Would you like to hear about it?&quot;</p>

<p>How beautiful she was in that simple gown of
white, unadorned by any jewels save the little
crown of sparkling white stones in her hair!</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287" />He was a good story-teller. It was a crisp
narrative he made.</p>

<p>&quot;A veiled lady,&quot; she mused. &quot;What would
you say if I told you that your mystery is no
mystery at all? I am the veiled lady. And the
person I went to see was my old nurse, my foster-mother,
with whom I spent the happiest, freest
days of my life, in the garret at Dresden. Pouf!
All mysteries may be dispelled if we go to the
right person. So you are to be recalled?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have asked for my recall, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so Dreiberg no longer appeals to you?
You once told inc that you loved it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am cursed with <i>wanderlust</i>, your Highness.&quot;
He regretted that he had not remained in
the ball-room. He was in great danger.</p>

<p>&quot;You promised to tell me what she is like.&quot;
Suddenly all his fear went away, all his trepidation;
the spirit of recklessness which had vised
him a little while ago again empowered him. He
was afraid of nothing. His face flushed and
there were bright points of fire in his eyes. She
saw what she had roused, and grew afraid herself.
She pretended to become interested in the
Watteau cupids on her fan.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288" />How shall I describe her?&quot; he said. &quot;I have
seen only paintings and marbles, and these are
inanimate. I have never seen angels, so I can
not draw a comparison there. Have you ever
seen ripe wheat in a rain-storm? That is the
color of her hair. There is jade and lapis-lazuli
in her eyes. And Ole Bull could not imitate the
music of her voice.&quot; He leaned toward her.
&quot;And I love her better than life, better than
hope; and between us there is the distance of a
thousand worlds. So I must give up the dream
and go away, as an honorable man should.&quot;</p>

<p>Neither of them heard the chancellor's approach.</p>

<p>&quot;And because I love her.&quot;</p>

<p>The fan in her hand slipped unheeded to the
floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness,&quot; broke in the cold even tones
of Herbeck, &quot;your father is making inquiries
about you.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael rose instantly, white as the frill in
his shirt.</p>

<p>Hildegarde, however, was a princess. She
gained her feet leisurely, with half a smile on
her lips.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289" />Count, Herr Carmichael tells me that he is
soon to leave Dreiberg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; There was satisfaction in Herbeck's
ejaculation, satisfaction of a frank order. But
there was a glint of admiration in his eyes as he
recognized the challenge in Carmichael's. He
saw that he must step carefully in regard to this
hot-headed young Irishman. &quot;We shall miss
Herr Carmichael.&quot;</p>

<p>Her highness moved serenely toward the door.
Carmichael waited till she was gone from sight,
then he stooped and picked up the fan. Herbeck
at once held out his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Give it to me, Herr Captain,&quot; he said, with
a melancholy gentleness. &quot;I will return it to her
highness.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael deliberately thrust the fan into a
pocket and shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Excellency, I do not know how long you
stood behind us, but you were there long enough
to learn that I have surrendered my dream.
Nothing but force will cause me to surrender this
fan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keep it, then, my son,&quot; replied the chancellor,
with good understanding.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE VINTAGE</h3>

<p>The ducal vineyards covered some forty
acres of rich hillside. All day long the
sun beat squarely upon the clustering fruit. A
low rambling building of stone covered the
presses and bottling departments, and was within
comparatively easy distance of the city. During
the vintage several hundred men and women
found employment. The grand duke derived a
comfortable private revenue from these wines,
the Tokay being scarcely inferior to that made
in Hungary. There was a large brewery besides,
which supplied all the near-by cities and
towns. The German noble, be he king, duke, or
baron, has always been more or less a merchant;
and it did not embarrass the grand duke of
Ehrenstein in the least to see his coat of arms
burnt into oaken wine-casks.</p>

<p><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291" />A former steward had full charge of the business,
personally hiring and paying the help and
supervising the various branches. He was a
gruff old fellow, just and honest; and once you
entered his employ he was as much a martinet as
any captain at sea. The low cunning of the
peasant never eluded his watchful eye. He knew
to the last pound of grapes how much wine there
should be, how much beer to the last measure of
hops.</p>

<p>The entrance to the vineyards was made
through a small lodge where the ducal vintner
lived, and kept his books and moneys till such
time as he should be required to place them before
the proper official.</p>

<p>Upon this brave morning, the one following
the ball at the palace, the vintner was reclining
against the outside wall of the gates, smoking his
china-pipe and generally at peace with the world.
The bloom was early upon the grape, work was
begun, and the vintage promised to be exceptionally
fine. Through a drifting cloud of smoke
he discerned a solitary figure approaching from
the direction of Dreiberg, a youthful figure,
buoyant of step, and confident. Herr Hoffman
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292" />was rather interested. Ordinarily the peasant
who came to this gate had his hat in his hand and
his feet were laggard. Not so this youth. He
paused at the gate and inspected the old man
highly.</p>

<p>&quot;Herr Hoffman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So? What can you do?&quot; He was a clean
youngster, this, but there was something in his
eyes that vaguely disturbed the head vintner. It
was like mockery more than anything else.
The youth recounted his abilities, and Hoffman
was gracious enough to admit that he
seemed to know what he was talking about.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a letter to you also.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ach!</i> We shall be properly introduced now,&quot;
said Hoffman, growling. &quot;Let me see it.&quot;</p>

<p>He saw it, but with starting eyes. There was,
then, something new under the sun? A picker of
grapes, recommended by a princess! He turned
the letter inside out, but found no illumination.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Du lieber Gott!</i> You are Leopold Dietrich?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you come by this letter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293" />Her serene highness is patron to Gretchen,
the goose-girl, at whose request the recommendation
was given me.&quot;</p>

<p>This altered matters. &quot;Follow me,&quot; said
Hoffman.</p>

<p>The two entered the office.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you write?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then write your name on this piece of paper
and that. Each night you will present yours
with the number of pounds, which will be credited
to you. You must bring it back each morning.
If you lose it you will be paid nothing for your
labor.&quot;</p>

<p>Dietrich wrote his name twice. It was rather
hard work, for he screwed up his mouth and
cramped his fingers. Still, Hoffman was not
wholly satisfied with his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Gottlieb,&quot; he said to one of the men, &quot;take
him to terrace ninety-eight. That hasn't been
touched yet. We'll see what sort of workman
he is.&quot; He spoke to Dietrich again. &quot;What is
Gretchen to you?&quot; For Hoffman knew Gretchen;
many a time she had filled her basket and drawn
her crowns.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294" />She is my sweetheart, Herr.&quot; And there was
no mockery in the youth's eyes as he said this.</p>

<p>&quot;Take him along, Gottlieb. You will have no
further use for this letter from her highness, so
I'll keep it and frame it and hang it in the office.&quot;
Which showed that Hoffman himself had had
lessons in the gentle art of mockery.</p>

<p>Terrace ninety-eight was given over to small
grapes; thus, many bunches had to be picked to
fill the basket. But Dietrich went to work with
a will. His fingers were deft and his knife was
sharp; and by midsun he had turned his sixth
basket, which was fair work, considering.</p>

<p>As Hoffman did not feed his employees, Dietrich
was obliged to beg from his co-workers.
Very willingly they shared with him their coarse
bread and onions. He ate the bread and stuffed
the onions in his pocket. There was no idling.
As soon as the frugal meal was over, the peasants
trooped away to their respective terraces.
Once more the youth was alone. He set down his
basket and laughed. Was there ever such a fine
world? Had there ever been a more likable adventure?
The very danger of it was the spice
which gave it flavor. He stretched out his arms
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295" />as if to embrace this world which appeared so
rosal, so joyous to his imagination.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, thanks! You have given me youth,
and I accept it,&quot; he said aloud, perhaps addressing
that mutable goddess who presides over all
follies. &quot;Regret it in my old age? Not I! I
shall have lived for one short month. Youth was
given to us to enjoy, and I propose to press the
grape to the final drop. And when I grow old
this adventure shall be the tonic to wipe out many
wrinkles of care. A mad fling, a brimming cup,
one short merry month&mdash;and then, the reckoning!
How I hate the thought!&quot;</p>

<p>He sobered; the laughter went out of his eyes
and face. Changeful twenty, where so many
paths reach out into the great world, paths
straight and narrow, of devious turnings which
end at precipices, of blind alleys which lead nowhere
and close in behind!</p>

<p>&quot;I love her, I love her!&quot; His face grew bright
again, and the wooing blood ran tingling in his
veins. &quot;Am I a thief, a scoundrelly thief, because
I have that right common to all men, to
love one woman? Some day I shall suffer for
this; some day my heart shall ache; so be it!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296" />The sun began the downward circle; the shadows
crept eastward and imperceptibly grew
longer; a gray tone settled under the stones at
his feet. Sometimes he sang, sometimes he stood
dreaming. His fingers were growing sore and
sticky and there was a twinge in his back as he
shouldered his eighth basket and scrambled down
to the man who weighed the pick. He was beginning
his ninth when he saw Gretchen coming
along the purple aisle. She waved a hand in
welcome, and he sheathed his knife. No more
work this day for him. He waited.</p>

<p>&quot;What a beautiful day!&quot; said Gretchen, with
a happy laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, what a day for love!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And work!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kiss me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you fill that basket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not even a little one,&quot; mischief in her glance.
Out came the knife and the vintner plied himself
furiously. Gretchen had a knife of her own,
and she joined him. They laughed gaily. Snip,
snip; bunch by bunch the contents of the basket
grew.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297" />There!&quot; he said at last. &quot;That's what I call
work; but it is worth it. Now!&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen saw that it would be futile to hold
him off longer; what she would not give he would
of a surety take. So she put her hands behind
her back, closed her eyes, and raised her chin.
He kissed not only the lovely mouth, but the eyes
and cheeks and hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, you are as good and beautiful as
an angel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are angels like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An angel is the most beautiful woman a poet
can describe or imagine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then there are no men angels?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only Gabriel; at least I never heard of any
other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I do not want to be an angel. I had
rather be what I am. Besides, angels do not have
tempers; they do not long for things they should
not have; they have no sweethearts.&quot; She caught
him roughly by the arms. &quot;Ah, if anything
should happen to you, I should die! It seems as
though I had a hundred hearts and that they
had all melted into one for love of you. Do men
love as women love? Is it everything and all
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298" />things, or only an incident? I would give up my
soul to you if you asked for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ask only for your love, Gretchen; only
that.&quot; And he pressed her hands. &quot;All men are
rogues, more or less. There are so many currents
and eddies entering into a man's life. It is
made up of a thousand variant interests. No,
man's love is never like a woman's. But remember
this, Gretchen, I loved you the best I knew
how, as a man loves but once, honorably as it was
possible, purely and dearly.&quot;</p>

<p>The shade of trouble crossed her face.
&quot;Why are you always talking like that? Do
I not know that you love me? Have I not my
dowry, and are we not to be married after the
vintage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But your singing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Singing? Why, my voice belongs to you;
for your sake I wish to be great, for no other
reason.&quot;</p>

<p>He ripped a bunch of grapes from the vine,
a thing no careful vintner should do, and held it
toward her.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever heard of the kissing cherries?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299" />She shook her head. He explained.</p>

<p>&quot;This bunch will do very well.&quot;</p>

<p>He took one grape at the bottom in his teeth.
Gingerly Gretchen did the same. Their lips met
in a smothered laughter. Then they tried it
again.</p>

<p>And this Watteau picture met the gaze of two
persons on the terrace below. The empurpling
face of one threatened an explosion, but the smiling
face of the other restrained this vocal thunder.
The old head vintner kicked a stone
savagely, and at this rattling noise Gretchen and
her lover turned. They beheld the steward, and
peering over his shoulder the amused countenance
of the Princess Hildegarde.</p>

<p>&quot;You&mdash;&quot; began the steward, no longer able to
contain himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Patience, Hoffman!&quot; warned her highness.
Then she laughed blithely. It was such a charming
picture, and never had she seen a handsomer
pair of bucolic lovers. A sudden pang drove the
merriment from her face. Ah, but she envied
Gretchen! For the peasant there was freedom,
there was the chosen mate; but for the princess&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Your hat, scoundrel!&quot; cried Hoffman.</p>

<p><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300" />The vintner snatched off his hat apologetically
and swung it round on the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this the way you work?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have picked nine baskets.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should have picked twelve.&quot;</p>

<p>It interested her highness to note that this
handsome young fellow was not afraid of the
head vintner. So this was Gretchen's lover?
He was really handsome; there was nothing
coarse about his features or figure. And presently
she realized that he was returning her
scrutiny with interest. He had never seen her
highness at close range before, and he now saw
that Gretchen was more beautiful only because
he saw her through the eyes of a lover.</p>

<p>The pause was broken by Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon, Highness!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what, Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For not having seen your approach.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was my fault, not yours. When is the
wedding?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After the vintage, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>Her highness then spoke to the bridegroom-elect.
&quot;You will be good to her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who could help it, your Highness?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301" />The pronoun struck her oddly, for peasants as
a usual thing never used it in addressing the nobility.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, on the day of the wedding I will stand
sponsor to you both. And good luck go with
you. Come, Hoffman; my horse will be restive
and my men impatient.&quot;</p>

<p>She passed down the aisle, and the head vintner
followed, wagging his head. He was not at
all satisfied with that tableau. He employed men
to work; he wanted no love-affairs inside his vineyards.
As for her highness, she had come for
the sole purpose of seeing Gretchen's lover; and
it occurred to her that the really desirable men
were generally unencumbered by titles.</p>

<p>&quot;He will discharge me,&quot; said the young vintner
gloomily.</p>

<p>&quot;He will not dare,&quot; returned Gretchen. &quot;We
have done nothing wrong. Her highness will
stand by us. It must be five o'clock,&quot; looking at
the sun.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, no more work for the day.&quot;</p>

<p>He swung the basket to his shoulder, and the
sun, flashing upon its contents, turned the
bloomy globes into dull rubies. He presented his
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302" />card at the office and was duly credited with three
crowns, which, according to Gretchen, was a fine
day's work. Hoffman said nothing about dismissal.</p>

<p>&quot;Come day after to-morrow; to-morrow is a
feast-day. You are always having feast-days
when work begins. All summer long you loaf
about, but the minute you start to work you must
find excuses to lay off. Clear out, both of you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Work at last,&quot; said Dietrich, as he and
Gretchen started for the city. &quot;If I can get a
position in the brewery for the winter I shall be
rich.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the beautiful world!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you recall the first day I met you?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. A little more and that dog would have
killed the big gander. What little things bring
about big ones! When I walked into the city
that day, had any one told me that I should fall
in love, I should have laughed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I!&quot;</p>

<p>Arm in arm they went on. Sometimes Gretchen
sang; often he put her hand to his lips. By
and by they came abreast of an old Gipsy. He
<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303" />wore a coat of Joseph's, and his face was as lined
as a frost-bitten apple. But his eyes were keen
and undimmed, and he walked confidently and
erect, like a man who has always lived in the
open.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you tell me how to find the Adlergasse?&quot;
he asked in broken German. His accent was that
of a Magyar. He had a smattering of a dozen
tongues at his command, for in his time he had
crossed and recrossed the Danube, the Rhine, and
the Rhone.</p>

<p>They carelessly gave him specific directions
and passed on. He followed grimly, like fate,
whose agent he was, though long delayed. When
he reached the Adlergasse he looked for a sign.
He came to a stop in front of the dingy shop of
the clock-mender. He went inside, and the ancient
clock-mender looked up from his work, for
he was always working.</p>

<p>He rose wearily and asked what he could do
for his customer. His eyes were bothering him,
so the fact that the man was a Gipsy did not at
first impress him.</p>

<p>The Gipsy smiled mysteriously and laid a
hand on his heart.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304" />Who are you?&quot; sharply demanded the clock-mender.</p>

<p>&quot;Who I am does not matter. I am he whom
you seek.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God in Heaven!&quot; The bony hands of the
clock-mender shot out and clutched the other's
coat in a grip which shook, so intense was it.
The Gipsy released himself slowly. &quot;But first
show me your pretty crowns and the paper which
will give me immunity from the police. I know
something about you. You never break your
word. That is why I came. Your crowns, as
you offered, and immunity; then I speak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Man, I can give you the crowns, but God
knows I have no longer the power to give you
immunity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p>The Gipsy shouldered his bundle.</p>

<p>&quot;For God's sake, wait!&quot; begged the clock-mender.</p>

<p>But the Gipsy walked out, unheeding.</p>

<h3>A WHITE SCAR</h3>


<p>Two days later, in the afternoon.</p>

<p>&quot;Grumbach,&quot; said Carmichael, &quot;what
the deuce were you looking at the other night,
with those opera-glasses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the ball?&quot; Grumbach pressed down the
ash in his pipe and brushed his thumb on his
sleeve. &quot;I was looking into the past.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With a pair of opera-glasses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Grumbach was perfectly serious.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, pshaw! You were following her highness
with them. I want to know why.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You made a promise to me not long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did?&quot; non-committally.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Soon I shall be shaking the dust of
Dreiberg, and I want to know beforehand what
this Chinese puzzle is. What did you do that
compelled your flight from Ehrenstein?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306" />Grumbach's pipe hung pendulent in his hand.
He swung it to and fro absently.</p>

<p>&quot;I am waiting. Remember, you are an American
citizen, for all that you were born here. If
anything should happen to you, I must know the
whole story in order to help you. You know that
you may trust me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't that, Captain. I have grown to like
you in these few days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What has that to do with it?&quot; impatiently.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, perhaps. Only, if I tell you, you
will not be my friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense! What you did sixteen years ago
doesn't matter now. It is enough for me that
you fought in my regiment, and that you were
a brave soldier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those opera-glasses; it was an idea. Well,
since you will know. I was a gardener's boy. I
worked under my brother Hermann. I used to
ask the nurse, who had charge of her serene
highness, where she would go each day. Then
I'd cut flowers and meet them on the road somewhere
and give the bouquet to the child. There
was never any escort; a footman and a driver.
The little one was always greatly pleased, and
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307" />she would call me Hans. I was in love those
days.&quot; Grumbach laughed with bitterness.
&quot;Yes, even I. Her name was Tekla, and she was
a jade. I wanted to run away, but I had no
money. I had already secured a passport; no
matter how. It was the first affair, and I was
desperately hurt. One day a Gipsy came to me.
I shall always know him by the yellow spot in one
of his black eyes. I was given a thousand crowns
to tell him which road her highness was to be
driven over the next day. As I said, I was mad
with love. Why a Gipsy should want to know
where her highness was going to ride was of no
consequence to me. I told him. I was to get the
money the same night. It was thus that her
highness was stolen; it was thus that I became
accessory before the fact, as the lawyers say.
Flight with a band of Magyar Gipsies; weary
days in the mountains, with detachments of
troops scouring the whole duchy. Finally I escaped.
A fortune was offered for the immediate
return of the child. At the time I believed that it
was an abduction for ransom. But no one ever
came forward for the reward. There was a price
on my head when it was known that I had fled.&quot;<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308" />
Grumbach stared into his pipe without seeing
anything.</p>

<p>&quot;And no one ever came for the reward? That
is strange. Was immunity promised?&quot; asked
Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;It was inferred, but not literally promised.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fear kept them away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps. And there is Arnsberg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was he guilty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never saw <i>his</i> hand anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So this is the story! Well, when a man's in
love he is, more or less, in the clutch of temporary
insanity.&quot; Carmichael's tone wasn't exactly
cheery.</p>

<p>&quot;Insanity! Then you do not judge me
harshly?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Hans. I've a wild streak in me also.
But what I can't understand is why you return
and put your head in the lion's mouth. The police
will stumble on something. I tell you frankly
that if you are arrested I could do little or
nothing for you. The United States protects
only harmless political outcasts. Yours is a crime
such as nullifies your citizenship, and any government
would be compelled, according to the
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309" />terms of treaty, to send you back here, if the
demand was made for your extradition.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know all that,&quot; Grumbach replied, dumping
the ash into his palm and casting it into the
paper-basket.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose that when conscience drives we
must go on. But the princess has been found.
The best thing you can do is to put your passports
into immediate use and return to the States.
You can do no good here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Grumbach refilled his pipe, lighted
it, and without saying more went out and down
into the street.</p>

<p>Carmichael watched him through the window.
Cloud after cloud of smoke ran wavering behind
the exile. He was smoking like one deeply perturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;He's a queer codger, and it's a queer story.
I don't believe I have heard it all, either. What
was he really hunting for with those glasses? I
give it up.&quot;</p>

<p>He was not angry with Grumbach; rather he
seemed to be drawn to him more closely than ever.
Mad with love. That was the phrase. He
conned it over and over; mad with love. That
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310" />excused many things. How strangely the chess-men
were moved! Had Grumbach not assisted
in the abduction, her highness would in all probability
have grown up as other princesses, artificial,
cold, reserved, seldom touched by the fires
of animated thought or action. In fact, had
things been otherwise, he never would have ridden
with her highness in the freshness of the
morning&mdash;or fallen in love with her. By rights
he ought to curse Grumbach; but for him he
would still be captain of his heart. Mad with
love! There was no doubt of it. And the phrase
rang in his ear for some time.</p>

<p>Grumbach was indeed perturbed, and this
sensation was the result of what he had <i>not</i> told
his friend. <i>Gott!</i> What was going on? He
hadn't the least idea where his footsteps were
leading him. He went on, his teeth set strongly
on the horn mouthpiece of his pipe, his hands
jammed in his pockets. And after a time he
woke. He was in the Adlergasse. And of all
that happy, noisy family, only he and Hermann
left! In one of the open doorways, for it was
warm, a final caress of vanishing summer, he saw
a fat, youngish woman knitting woolen hose.<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311" />
Two or three children sprawled about her knees.
There was that petulance of lip and forehead
which marked the dissatisfaction of the coquette
married.</p>

<p>&quot;Tekla!&quot; Grumbach murmured.</p>

<p>He was not conscious that he had paused, but
the woman was. She eyed him with the mild indifference
of the bovine. Then she dropped her
glance and the shining needles clicked afresh.
Grumbach forced his step onward. And for this!
He laughed discordantly. The woman looked
up again wonderingly. Now, why should this
stranger laugh all by himself like that?</p>

<p>Hans saw the sign of the Black Eagle, and
directed his steps thitherward. He sat down and
ordered a beer, drinking it quickly. He repeated
the order, but he did not touch the second glass.
He threw back the lid and stared at the creamy
froth as a seer stares at his ball of crystal. Carmichael
was right; he was a doddering fool.
What was done was done, and a thousand consciences
would not right it. And what right had
conscience to drag him back to Ehrenstein, where
he had known the bitterest and happiest moments
of his life? And yet, rail as he might at this
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312" />invisible restraint called conscience, he saw God's
direction in this return. Only <i>he</i>, Hans Grumbach,
knew and one other. And that other, who?</p>

<p>Fat, Tekla was fat; and he had treasured the
fair picture of her youth these long years!
Well, there was an end to that. Little fat Tekla,
to have nearly overturned a duchy, and never a
bit the wiser! And then Hans became aware of
voices close at hand, for he sat near the bar.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Fr&auml;u, he is at work in the grand duke's
vineyards. And think, the first day he picked
nine baskets.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is good. But I know many a one who
can pick their twelve. And you are to be married
when the vintage is done? You will make a fine
wife, Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he, a fine husband.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you will bring him a dowry, too. But his
own people; what does he say of them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has no parents; only an uncle, who
doesn't count. We shall live with grandmother
and pay her rent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you are wearing a new dress,&quot; admiringly.</p>

<p>Gretchen preened herself. Hans dropped the
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313" />lid of his stein and pushed it away. His heart
always warmed at the sight of this goose~girl.
So she had a dowry and was going to be married?
He felt of his wallet, and a kindly thought
came into being. He counted down the small
change for the beer, slid back his chair, and
sauntered to the bar. Gretchen recognized him,
and the recognition brought a smile to her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Good day to you, Herr,&quot; was her greeting.</p>

<p>&quot;When is the wedding?&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen blushed.</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to come to it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will be welcome, Herr.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And may I bring along a little present?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it so please you. I must be going,&quot; she
added to Fr&auml;u Bauer.</p>

<p>&quot;May I walk along with you?&quot; asked Hans.</p>

<p>&quot;If you wish,&quot; diffidently.</p>

<p>So Grumbach walked with her to the Krumerweg,
and he asked her many questions, and some
of her answers surprised him.</p>

<p>&quot;Never knew father or mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Herr. I am only a foundling who fell
into kind hands. This is where I live.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I should ask to come in?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314" />But I shall be too busy to talk. This is bread-day,&quot;
evasively.</p>

<p>&quot;I promise to sit very quiet in a chair.&quot;</p>

<p>Her laughter rippled; she was always close to
that expression. &quot;You are a funny man. Come
in, then; but mind, you will be dusty with flour
when you leave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will undertake that risk,&quot; he replied, with
a seriousness not in tune with the comedy of the
situation.</p>

<p>Into the kitchen she led him. She was moved
with curiosity. Why should any man wish to
see a woman knead bread?</p>

<p>&quot;Sit there, Herr.&quot; And she pointed to a stool
at the left of the table. The sunlight came in
through the window, and an aureola appeared
above her beautiful head. &quot;Have you never
seen a woman knead flour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not for many years,&quot; said Hans, thinking
of his mother.</p>

<p>Gretchen deliberately rolled up her sleeves and
began work.</p>

<p>There are three things which human growth
never changes: the lines in the hand, the shape
of the ear, and scars. The head grows, and the
<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315" />general features enlarge to their predestined
mold, but these three things remain. Upon
Gretchen's left arm, otherwise perfection, there
was a white scar, rough and uneven, more like
an ancient burn than anything else. Grumbach's
eyes rested upon the scar and became fixed.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you get that?&quot; he asked. He
spoke with a strange calm.</p>

<p>&quot;The scar? I do not remember. Grandmother
says that when I was little I must have been
burned.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gott!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you say, Herr?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. You can't remember? Think!&quot;
tensely now.</p>

<p>&quot;What's all this nonsense about?&quot; she cried,
with a nervous laugh. &quot;It's only a scar.&quot;</p>

<p>She went on with the kneading. She patted
the dough into four squares. These she placed
on the oven-stove. She wiped her hands on a
cloth for that purpose, and sighed contentedly.</p>

<p>&quot;There! It's a fine mystery, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; But Grumbach was shaking as with
ague.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter, Herr?&quot; with concern.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316" />I grow dizzy like this sometimes. It doesn't
amount to anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen turned down her sleeves. &quot;You must
go now, for I have other work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so have I, Gretchen.&quot;</p>

<p>He gained the street, but how he never knew.
He floated. Objects near at hand were shadowy
and unusual. A great calm suddenly winged
down upon him, and the world became clear, clear
as his purpose, his courage, his duty. They
might shoot or hang him, as they saw fit; this
would not deter him. It might be truthfully said
that he blundered back to the Grand Hotel. He
must lay the whole matter before Carmichael.
There lay his one hope. Carmichael should be
his ambassador. But, God in Heaven, where
should he begin? How?</p>

<p>The Gipsy, standing in the center of the walk,
did not see Grumbach, for he was looking toward
the palaces, a kind of whimsical mockery in his
dark eyes. Grumbach, even more oblivious,
crashed into him.</p>

<p>Grumbach stammered an apology, and the
other replied in his peculiar dialect that no harm
had been done. The jar, however, had roused<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317" />
Hans out of his tragic musings. There was a
glint of yellow in the Gipsy's eye, a flaw in the
iris. Hans gave a cry.</p>

<p>&quot;You? I find you at this moment, of all others?&quot;</p>

<p>The Gipsy retreated. &quot;I do not know you. It
is a mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I know you,&quot; whispered Hans. &quot;And
you will know me when I tell you that I am the
gardener's boy you ruined some sixteen years
ago!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX" /><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318" />CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>DISCLOSURES</h3>


<p>The office of the American consulate in the
Adlergasse ran from the front to the rear
of the building. Carmichael's desk overlooked the
street. But whenever a flying dream came to him
he was wont to take his pipe to the chair by the
rear window, whence he could view the lofty
crests of the Jugendheit mountains. Directly below
this window and running parallel with it was
the <i>Biergarten</i> of the Black Eagle.</p>

<p>It is a quiet tonic to the mind to look off, to
gaze at sunlit, cloud-embraced mountain peaks,
Walter Pater to the contrary. Carmichael's mind
that morning needed quiet, and so he came to
this window; and with a smoldering pipe let himself
to dreams. He was still in the uniform of
the royal hunt, a meet having taken place that
morning. He saw darling faces in the rugged
outlines of the mountains, in the white clouds
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319" />billowing across, in the patches of dazzling blue
in between. Such is the fancy of a man in love!</p>

<p>His letter of resignation was on its way, but it
would be in November before he heard definitely
from the department. By that time the great
snows would have blanketed the earth, and the
nadir of his discontent would be reached. But
what to do till that time? He could ride for
some weeks, but riding without companionship
was rather a lonesome affair. His own defiance
of the chancellor had erected an impassable barrier
between her highness and himself. They
would watch him now, evade him, put small obstacles
in his path, obstacles against which he
could enter no reasonable complaint. A withered
leaf, a glove, and a fan; these represented the
sum of his romance.</p>

<p>Two figures moved in the garden beneath. At
first he gave no attention to them. But when the
two heads came together swiftly, and then separated,
both smiling, he realized that he had witnessed
a kiss. Ah, here was the opportunity;
and, by the Lord Harry, he would not let it slip.
If this fellow meant wrongly toward Gretchen&mdash;and
how could he mean else?&mdash;he, Carmichael,
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320" />would take the matter boldly in his hands to do
some caning. He laughed. Here would be another
souvenir; to have caned&mdash;</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet, dropped his pipe on the
sill of the window, and made for his hat and
sword-cane. The clerk went on with his writing.
Nothing the consul did these days either alarmed
or distracted him.</p>

<p>To gain the garden Carmichael would have to
pass through the tavern. The first person he encountered
was Colonel von Wallenstein. The
sight of this gentleman changed his plans for
the moment. He had a presentiment that this
would became rather a complicated affair. He
waited. Wallenstein spoke to Fr&auml;u Bauer, who
answered him with cold civility. She heartily
despised this fine officer. Wallenstein twirled his
mustache, laughed and went into the garden. Carmichael
was in a quandary. What should he do?</p>

<p>Neither Gretchen nor the vintner saw Wallenstein,
who remained quietly by the door. He
watched them with an evil smile. He would teach
this pretty fellow a lesson. After some deliberation
he walked lightly toward the lovers. They
did not hear him till he was almost upon them.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321" />A pretty picture!&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen colored and the vintner flushed, the
one with dismay and the other with anger.</p>

<p>&quot;A charming idyl!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leave us, Gretchen,&quot; said the vintner, with a
deceiving gentleness.</p>

<p>Gretchen started reluctantly down the path,
her glance bravely before her. She knew that
Wallenstein would not move; so she determined
to go round him. She was not afraid to leave
her vintner alone with this officer. But she miscalculated
the colonel's reckless audacity. As
she stepped off the path to go round him he
grasped her rudely and kissed her on the cheek.
She screamed as much in surprise as in
anger.</p>

<p>And this scream brought Carmichael upon the
scene. He was witness to the second kiss. He
saw the vintner run forward and dash his fist
into the soldier's face. Wallenstein, to whom
such an assault was unexpected, fell back, hurt
and blinded. The vintner, active as a cat, saw
Carmichael coming on a run. He darted toward
him, and before Carmichael could prevent him,
dragged the sword-cane away. The blade, thin
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322" />and pliant, flashed. And none too soon. The
colonel had already drawn his saber.</p>

<p>&quot;Save him!&quot; Gretchen wrung her hands.</p>

<p>The two blades met spitefully, and there were
method and science on both sides. But the sword-cane
was no match for the broad, heavy saber.
Half a dozen thrusts and parries convinced the
colonel that the raging youth knew what he was
doing. Down swooped the saber cuttingly. The
blade of the sword-cane snapped like a pipe-stem.
The vintner flung the broken part at the colonel's
head. The latter dodged it and came on, and
there was death's intent.</p>

<p>Meantime Carmichael had found a short hop-pole,
and with this he took a hand in the contest.
The pole was clumsy, but the tough wood was
stronger than steel. He hit the saber with good-will.
Back came the steel. The colonel did not
care whom or what he struck at now. When Carmichael
returned the compliment he swung his
hop-pole as the old crusaders did their broadswords.
And this made short work of the duel.
The saber dropped uninjured, but the colonel's
arm dangled at his side. He leaned back against
the arbor, his teeth set in his lip, for he was in
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323" />agony. Carmichael flung aside his primitive
weapon, his anger abated none.</p>

<p>&quot;You're a fine example of a soldier! Are you
mad to attack a man this way? They will break
you for this, or my name's not Carmichael.
You couldn't leave her in peace, could you? Well,
those two kisses will prove expensive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall kill you for this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bah! I have fought more times than you have
years to your counting,&quot; with good Yankee
spirit. &quot;But if you think I'll waste my time in
fighting a duel with you, you're up the wrong
tree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go to the devil!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not just at present; there's too much for me
to do. But this is my advice to you: apply for a
leave of absence and take the waters of Wiesbaden.
They are good for choleric dispositions.
Now, I return the compliment: go to the devil
yourself, only choose a route that will not cross
mine. That's all!&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen and the vintner had vanished. Carmichael
agreed that it was the best thing for
them to do. The vintner was no coward, but he
was discreet. Somebody might ask questions.<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324" />
So Carmichael returned to the consulate, equally
indifferent what the colonel did or where he went.
Of the vintner he thought: &quot;The hot-headed
young fool, to risk his life like that!&quot; He would
see later what he meant in regard to Gretchen.
Poor little goose-girl! They would find that there
was one man interested enough in her welfare to
stand by her. His hands yet stung from the
contact of wood against steel, and his hair was
damp at the edges. This was a bit of old war-times.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you hurt, Excellency?&quot; asked the clerk
solicitously.</p>

<p>&quot;Hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I heard a woman scream and ran to the
window. It was a good fight. But that fellow-<i>ach!</i>
To run away and leave you, an outsider,
to fight his battle!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He would have been sliced in two if I hadn't
come to the front. A hop-pole isn't half bad. I'll
bet that lady's man has a bad arm for some time
to come. As for the vintner, he had good reasons
for taking to his heels.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good reasons?&quot; But there was a sly look in
the clerk's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325" />No questions, if you please. And tell no
one, mind, what has taken place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, Excellency.&quot; And quietly the clerk
returned to his table of figures. But later he intended
to write a letter, unsigned, to his serene
highness.</p>

<p>Carmichael, scowling, undertook to answer his
mail, but not with any remarkable brilliancy or
coherency.</p>

<p>And in this condition of mind Grumbach
found him; Grumbach, accompanied by the old
clock-mender from across the way, and a Gipsy
Carmichael had never seen before.</p>

<p>&quot;What's up, Hans?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell your clerk to leave us,&quot; said Grumbach,
his face as barren of expression as a rock.</p>

<p>&quot;Something serious, eh?&quot; Carmichael dismissed
the clerk, telling him to return after the
noon hour. &quot;Now, then,&quot; he said, &quot;what is the
trouble?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have already spoken to you about it,&quot;
Grumbach returned. &quot;The matter has gone badly.
But I am here to ask a favor, a great favor, one
that will need all your diplomacy to gain for
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_326" id="Page_326" />Ah&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For myself I ask nothing. A horrible blunder
has been made. You will go to the grand duke
and ask immunity for this Gipsy and this clock-mender,
as witnesses to the disclosure which I
shall make to his highness. Without this immunity
my lips will be sealed for ever. As I said,
I ask nothing for myself, nothing. There has
been a great blunder and a great wrong, too; but
God sent me here to right it. Will you do this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I must know&mdash;,&quot; began Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;You will know everything, once you obtain
this concession from the duke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why don't you want immunity for yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There must be some one for the duke to punish,&quot;
heroically; &quot;otherwise he will refuse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Still, suppose I bargain for you, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you tell him my name is Breunner
there will be no bargaining.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What has this clock-mender to do with the
case?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is Count von Arnsberg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By George! And this Gipsy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man who bribed me. Arnsberg is an in<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327" />nocent
man; but this has to be proved, and you
are going to help us prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>All this was in English; the Gipsy and the
former chancellor understood little or nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;I will do what I can, Hans, and I will let you
know the result after dinner to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will be enough. But unless he concedes,
do not tell him our names. That would be ruin
and nothing gained.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have me a bit dazed,&quot; Carmichael admitted.
&quot;I ought to know what this blunder is,
to have something to stand on.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach shook his head. &quot;Later every question
will be answered. And remember, at this
interview Herbeck must not be present. It will
have to be broken to him gently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well; I promise to see his highness this
afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach translated the substance of this
dialogue to his companions. They approved.
The three of them solemnly trooped out, leaving
Carmichael bewildered. Alone, his mind searched
a thousand channels, but these were blind and led
nowhere. Blunder, wrong? What did Grumbach
mean by that? What kind of a blunder, and who
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328" />was innocently wronged? No use! And while
he was thus racking his mind he heard steps on
the stairs. These steps were hurried. The door
above shut noisily.</p>

<p>&quot;By George! I'll attend to that this minute.
We'll see what stuff this yellow-haired boy is
made of.&quot;</p>

<p>He mounted the stairs without sound. He
grasped the handle of the door, boldly pushed it
open, and entered, closing the door and placing
his back against it.</p>

<p>The instant he saw the intruder the vintner
snatched a pistol from the drawer in the table
and leveled it at Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Surely your majesty will not shoot an old
friend?&quot;</p>

<h3>THE KING</h3>


<p>The vintner slowly lowered the pistol till it
touched the table; then he released it.</p>

<p>&quot;That is better, your Majesty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you call me that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly I do not utter it as a compliment,&quot;
retorted Carmichael dryly.</p>

<p>&quot;You speak positively.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With absolute authority on the subject, sire.
Your face was familiar, but I failed at first to
place it rightly. It was only after you had
duped me into going after the veiled lady that I
had any real suspicion. You are Frederick Leopold
of Jugeudheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall not deny it further,&quot; proudly. &quot;And
take care how you speak to me, since I admit my
identity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330" />Oho!&quot; Carmichael gave rein to his laughter.
&quot;This is Ehrenstein; here I shall talk to you as I
please.&quot;</p>

<p>The king reddened, and his hand closed again
over the pistol.</p>

<p>&quot;I have saved your majesty twice from death.
You force me to recall it to your mind.&quot;</p>

<p>The king had the grace to lower his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;The first time was at Bonn. Don't you recollect
the day when an American took you out of
the Rhine, an American who did not trouble himself
to come round and ask for your thanks, who,
in truth, did not learn till days after what an
important person you were, or were going to be?&quot;
There was a bite in every word, for Carmichael
felt that he had been ill-treated.</p>

<p>&quot;For that moment, Herr, I thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And for that in the garden below?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For that also. Now, why are you here? You
have not come for the purpose of recalling these
two disagreeable incidents to my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; Carmichael went over to the table, his
jaws set and no kindly spirit in his eyes. &quot;No,
I have another purpose.&quot; He bent over the table,
and with his face close to that of the king, &quot;I de<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331" />mand
to know what your intentions are toward
that friendless goose-girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what is that to you?&quot; said the king, the
smoke of anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;It is this much: if you have acted toward her
otherwise than honorably&mdash;Well!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go on; you interest me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I promise to break every bone in your
kingly body. In this room it is man to man; I
recognize no king, only the physical being.&quot;</p>

<p>The king pushed aside the table, furious. No
living being had ever spoken to him like that before.
He swung the flat of his hand toward Carmichael's
face. The latter caught the hand by
the wrist and bore down upon it. The king was
no weakling. There was a struggle, and Carmichael
found himself well occupied for a time.
But his age and build were in his favor, and presently
he jammed the king to the wall and pinioned
his arms.</p>

<p>&quot;There! Will you be patient for a moment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall die for this insult!&quot; said the king,
as quietly as his hard breathing would allow.
He saw flashes of red between his face and the
other's.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332" />I have heard that before. But how?&quot; banteringly.</p>

<p>&quot;I will waive my crown; man to man!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sword-sticks, sabers or hop-poles? Come,&quot;
savagely, &quot;what do you mean by the goose-girl?&quot;</p>

<p>So intent on the struggle were they that neither
heard the door open and close.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear nephew; what do you mean by
Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael released the king, and with feline
quickness stooped and secured the pistol which
had fallen to the floor. Not sure of the new arrival's
purpose, he backed to the wall. He knew
the voice and he recognized its owner.</p>

<p>&quot;Put it in your pocket, Mr. Carmichael. And
let us finish this discussion in English, since there
are many ears about the place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His royal highness?&quot; murmured the king.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sire! True to life!&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael dropped the pistol into a pocket,
and the king smoothed down his crumpled sleeves.</p>

<p>&quot;A fine comedy!&quot; cried Herr Ludwig jovially,
folding his arms over his deep chest. &quot;A rollicking
adventure! Where's the story-book to match
it? A kingdom, working in the dark, headless;
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333" />fine reading for these sneaking journalists!
Thunder and blazes!&quot; with an amiability which
had behind it a good leaven of despair. &quot;Well,
nephew, you have not as yet answered either Mr.
Carmichael's question or my own. What do you
mean by Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love her,&quot; nobly. &quot;And well for you, my
uncle, that you come as you do. I would have
married her! Wrong her? What was a crown
to me who, till now, have never worn one save in
speech? <i>You</i> have been the king.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bodies must have heads, kingdoms must have
kings. I have tried an experiment, and this is
the result. I wanted you to be a man, a human
man; I wanted you to grow up unfettered by
power; I wanted you to mingle with peoples, here
and there, so, when you became their head physician,
you could ably minister to their political
diseases. And all this fine ambition tumbles down
before the wooden shoes of a pretty goose-girl.
Nothing makes so good a philosopher as a series
of blunders and mistakes. I am beaten; I admit
it. I did my best to save you from this tangle;
but it was written that you should put your foot
in it. But on top of this you have made a greater
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334" />mistake than you dream of, nephew. The Princess
Hildegarde is as fine a woman as ever your
Gretchen. Mr. Carmichael will agree to that,&quot;
maliciously.</p>

<p>Carmichael gave no sign that he understood;
but there was no mistaking the prince regent's
inference, however. The recipient of this compliment
stubbornly refused to give the prince the
satisfaction of seeing how neatly the barb had
gone home.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Mr. Carmichael, what is <i>your</i> interest
in Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael trembled with joy. Here was an
opening for a double shot. &quot;My interest in her
is better than yours, for I have not asked her to
become a king's mistress.&quot;</p>

<p>His royal highness bit his lip.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle!&quot; cried the king, horrified at this revelation.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Carmichael evidently has applied his ear
to some keyhole.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, thank you! The window was open. My
clerk heard you plainly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle, is this damnable thing true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. What would you? You were deter<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335" />mined
to make a fool of yourself. But rest easy.
She is ignorant where this offer came from, and,
moreover, she spurned it, as Mr. Carmichael's
clerk will affirm. Oh, Gretchen is a fine little
woman, and I would to God she was of your station!&quot;
And the mask fell from the regent's face,
leaving it bitter and careworn. &quot;Our presence is
known in Dreiberg; it has been known for three
days at least. And in coming up here I had another
errand. Oh, I haven't forgotten it. In the
street there are at least ten soldiers under the sub-chief
of the police; rather a curious conjunction.&quot;</p>

<p>The king turned white. So it had come at
last!</p>

<p>Carmichael ran to the rear window. He
shrugged. &quot;There's half a dozen in the garden,
too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there any way to the roofs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None that would serve you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Carmichael,&quot; said the king, offering his
hand, his handsome face kindly and without rancor,
&quot;I should be an ungrateful wretch if I did
not ask your full pardon. I am indebted to you
twice for my life, little as it amounts to. And in
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336" />my kingdom you will always be welcome. Will
you accept my hand, as one man to another?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With happiness, your Majesty. And I ask
that you pardon my own hasty words.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is only young,&quot; sighed Ludwig.</p>

<p>The king emptied the drawer, put the contents
in his pack, tied the strings, and put it under
his arm.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; asked the uncle,
vaguely perturbed.</p>

<p>&quot;I am going down to the soldiers. I am no
longer a vintner, I am a king!&quot; And he said this
in a manner truly royal.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gott!</i>&quot; burst from the prince regent. &quot;This
boy has marrow in his bones, after all!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you will find, dear uncle, the day after the
coronation. You will, of course, go down to them
with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As I am your uncle! But the incarceration
will not be long,&quot; Ludwig grumbled. &quot;There are
ten thousand troops on the other side of the
passes, and they have been there ever since I
learned that you had gone a-wooing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ten thousand? Well, they shall stay there,&quot;<a name="Page_337" id="Page_337" />
said the king determinedly. &quot;I shall not begin
my reign with war. I am in the wrong; I had no
business to be here. Technically I have broken
the treaty, though not in spirit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What will you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell the duke the truth. He will not dare go
far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will be a good politician, too,&quot; said Ludwig,
with a smile of approval at Carmichael.
&quot;No, boy, there will be no war. And yet I was
prepared for it; nor was I wrong in doing so.
Already, but for Herbeck, there would be plenty
of fighting in the passes. <i>Ach!</i> Could you but
see the princess!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have seen her,&quot; replied the king. &quot;Heaven
would have been kinder had I seen her months
ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say to his serene highness, then, that you are
willing to marry her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid you do not understand, uncle,&quot; the
king replied sadly. &quot;I have the supreme happiness
to love and to be loved. Of that nothing
can rob me. And for some time to come, uncle
mine, I shall treasure that happiness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the little Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338" />Yes, yes! I have been a scoundrel.&quot; And the
king's eyes grew moist. &quot;You are happy, Mr.
Carmichael; you have no crown to weigh against
your love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has he not?&quot; mocked Ludwig.</p>

<p>&quot;That, uncle, is neither kind nor gallant.&quot;</p>

<p>And from that moment Carmichael's heart
warmed toward the young man, whose sorrow
was greater than his own. For the king was giving
up the woman who loved him, while Carmichael
was only giving up the woman he loved,
which is a distinction.</p>

<p>&quot;I ask Mr. Carmichael's pardon,&quot; said Prince
Ludwig frankly. &quot;But my temper has been sadly
tried. Will you grant me a favor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it is in my power,&quot; said Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Go at once to our embassy and notify them
what has taken place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will do that at once. If only I could find
some way for you to escape!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is none,&quot; said the king. &quot;Come, uncle;
let us see what is going on down-stairs.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael followed them down.</p>

<p>&quot;There they are, men!&quot; cried the sub-chief.
&quot;You are under arrest!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339" />I am the king of Jugendheit,&quot; calmly announced
Frederick Leopold. &quot;Will you subject
me to public arrest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I,&quot; said the uncle, &quot;am Ludwig, prince
regent. Let us go to prison as quickly as possible,
blockheads!&quot;</p>

<p>The sub-chief laughed uproariously, and even
the disciplined soldiers smiled. The king of Jugendheit
and the prince regent! This was a good
joke, indeed!</p>

<p>&quot;Your majesty and your royal highness,&quot; said
the sub-chief, his eyes twinkling, &quot;will do me, a
poor sub-chief of the police, the honor of accompanying
me to the Stein-schloss.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lead on, lead on!&quot; cried Ludwig. &quot;But wait!
I forgot. There can be no harm in asking why
we are arrested.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are accused of being military spies from
Jugendheit. That is sufficient for the present.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Frederick, they do not believe us. So much
the better!&quot; Ludwig pursed his lips into a whistle.</p>

<p>&quot;May I retain this bundle?&quot; inquired the king.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I know what is in it. Forward, march!&quot;</p>

<p>The soldiers formed into a square, and in the
center the prisoners were placed. Carmichael
<a name="Page_340" id="Page_340" />made as though to protest, but Prince Ludwig
signed for him to be silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Remember!&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The king looked in vain for Gretchen. Then
he beckoned to Carmichael, and whispered brokenly:
&quot;If you see her, do not tell her what has
happened. Better to let her think that I have
gone. And she will see nothing in the arrest of
the king of Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I promise.&quot;</p>

<p>The troop marched along the street, followed
by many curious ones, and many heads popped in
and out of the gabled windows. Carmichael
watched them till they veered round a corner, and
then he returned to the consulate. There he left
a note for the clerk, telling him that he would not
be in the office again that day. Directly after,
he hurried off to the Jugendheit embassy.</p>

<p>An hour later Gretchen appeared before Fr&auml;u
Bauer. Gretchen had gone home immediately
after the termination of the fight in the garden.
It had been the will of her lord and master for
her to remain at home throughout the day; but
this she could not do. She was worried.</p>

<p>&quot;He was not hurt, Fr&auml;u?&quot; she asked timidly.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341" />Oh, no! The two of them gave themselves up
readily. They are snug in the Stein-schloss by
this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Stein-schloss!&quot; Gretchen blanched.
&quot;Holy Mother, what has happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, your vintner and Herr Ludwig were
arrested an hour ago, accused of being spies from
Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a lie!&quot; cried Gretchen hollowly. She
groped blindly for the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going, Gretchen?&quot; Fr&auml;u
Bauer inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>&quot;To her highness! She will save him!&quot;</p>

<p>Her highness was dreaming. She had fallen
into this habit of late. A flame in the fireplace,
a cloud in the sky, a dash of rain on the window,
all these drew her fancy. What the heart wishes
the mind will dream. Sunshine was without, clear,
brilliant; shadow was within, mellow, nebulous.
But to-day her dream was short. A maid of honor
announced that the young woman Gretchen
sought her presence.</p>

<p>&quot;Admit her. She will be a tonic,&quot; said Hildegarde.</p>

<p>Gretchen appeared, red-eyed and disheveled.<a name="Page_342" id="Page_342" />
Instantly she flung herself at the feet of the
princess.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Gretchen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They will not let me see him, Highness!&quot;
Gretchen choked.</p>

<p>&quot;What has happened, child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have arrested him as a spy from Jugendheit,
and he is innocent. Save him, Highness!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can I save him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is not a spy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That must be proved, Gretchen. I can not
go to the Stein-schloss and order them to liberate
him.&quot; She lifted Gretchen to her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been there, and they will not let me
see him. I love him so!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can arrange that for you. I will go with
you myself to the prison.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, Highness, thanks!&quot; Gretchen was
hysterical.</p>

<p>The Stein-schloss had been the feudal keep;
now it served as the city prison. Its grim gray
stones were battle-scarred and time-worn; a place
of deep dungeons, huge bolts and bars, and narrow
slits in the stone for windows. The prison
<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343" />was both civil and military, but was patrolled and
sentineled by soldiers. The king and his uncle
had been given adjoining cells on the ground
floor. These cells were dry, and light entered
from the modern windows in the wall of the corridor.
The princess and her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e were admitted
without objection. The sergeant in charge
of that floor even permitted them to go into the
corridor unattended.</p>

<p>Voices.</p>

<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; whispered her highness, pressing
Gretchen's arm.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ach!</i> Wail, dear nephew, beat your hands
upon the bars, curse, waste your breath on stone.
Did I not warn you against this very thing when
you proposed this mad junket? Well, there are
two of us. A fine scandal! They will laugh at
us for months to come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woe to the duke for this affront!&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen started to speak, but the princess
quickly put her hand over the goose-girl's
mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! So war is gathering in your veins?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will have revenge for this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good! Bang&mdash;bang! Slash and cut! War
<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344" />is a great invention&mdash;on paper. Come, my boy;
you were sensible enough when they brought us
here. Control yourself. Be a king in all the
word implies. For my part, I begin to see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what do you see?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see that the duke knows who we are, even if
his police do not. He will keep us here a day or
two, and then magnanimously liberate us with
profuse apologies. We shall be escorted to the
frontier with honors. His highness loves a jest
too well to let this chance escape. Besides, I see
in the glass the fine Italian hand of Herbeck. I
have always heard that he was a great statesman.
Swallow your wrath, even if your tongue goes
down with it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, Gretchen!&quot; said the king.</p>

<p>Gretchen could stand it no longer. She
wrenched herself free from the grasp of the
princess, who, with pitying heart, understood all
now. Poor unhappy Gretchen!</p>

<p>&quot;Here I am, Leopold!&quot; the goose-girl cried,
pressing her body against the bars and thrusting
her hands through them.</p>

<p>&quot;The devil!&quot; murmured the man in the other
cell.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345" />You here, Gretchen?&quot; The king covered her
hands with passionate kisses.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes! They have made a dreadful mistake.
You are no spy from Jugendheit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Gretchen,&quot; said the voice from the next
cell. &quot;He is far worse than that. He is the
king, Gretchen, the king.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle!&quot; in anguish.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us have it over with,&quot; replied Prince Ludwig
sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;The king?&quot; Gretchen laughed shrilly.
&quot;What jest is this, Leopold?&quot;</p>

<p>The king, still holding her hands, looked down.</p>

<p>&quot;Leopold?&quot; plaintively.</p>

<p>Still he did not speak, still he averted his head.
But God knew that his heart was on the rack.</p>

<p>The princess, remaining in the background,
not daring to interfere, felt the smart of tears
in her eyes. Ah, the poor tender little goose-girl!
The pity of it! This king was a scoundrel.</p>

<p>&quot;Leo, look at me! You are laughing! Why,
did we not work together in the vineyards, and
did we not plan for the future? <i>Ah</i>, yes! You
are a king only to me. I see. But it is a cruel
<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346" />jest, Leopold. Smile at me! Say something!&quot;
Gretchen was hanging to the bars now; her body,
held in the vise of growing terror, was almost a
dead weight.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen, forgive me!&quot; despairingly.</p>

<p>&quot;He asks me to forgive him!&quot; dully. &quot;For
what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For being a villain! Yes,&quot; his voice keen
with agony. &quot;I <i>am</i> the king of Jugendheit.
But am I less a man for that? Ah, God help me,
I have a right to love like other men! Do not
doubt me, Gretchen; do not think that I played
with you. I love you better than my crown, better
than my honor!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take care, nephew!&quot; came Prince Ludwig's
warning. &quot;Some one else is near.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I care not! Before all the world I would
gladly proclaim it. I love her. I swear that I
shall never marry, that my heart is breaking!
Gretchen, Gretchen! My God, she is falling!
Help her!&quot; wildly; and he shook the bars with
supernatural strength till his hands were bleeding.</p>

<p>But Gretchen did not answer.</p>

<h3>TWIN LOCKETS</h3>


<p>Carmichael tramped about his room,
restless, uneasy, starting at sounds. Half
a dozen times his cigar had gone out, and burned
matches lay scattered on the floor. He was waiting
for Grumbach and his confr&egrave;res. Now he
looked out of a window, now he spun the leaves
of a book, now he sat down, got up, and tramped
again. Anything but this suspense. A full day!
The duel in the <i>Biergarten</i>; the king of Jugendheit
and the prince regent in the Stein-schloss;
the flight of the ambassador to the palace, more
like a madman than one noted for his calm and
circumspection; Gretchen carried into the palace
in a dead faint, and her highness weeping; the
duke in a rage and brought over only after the
hardest struggle Carmichael had ever experienced.
And deeper, firmer, became his belief and
conviction that Grumbach's affair vitally con<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348" />cerned
her highness. What blunder had been
made? He would soon know. He welcomed the
knock on his door. Grumbach came in, carrying
under his arm a small bundle. He was pale
but serene, like a man who had put his worldly
affairs in order.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Captain, what did his Highness say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are your companions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are waiting outside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The duke agrees. He will give us an audience
at eight-thirty. I had a time of it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you mention my name</p>

<p>&quot;No. I went roundabout. I also obtained
his promise to say nothing to Herbeck till the
interview was over. Again he demurred, but his
curiosity saved the day. Now, Hans, the full
story.&quot;</p>

<p>Grumbach spread out on the bed the contents
of the bundle.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at these and tell me what you see, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael inspected the little yellow shoes.
He turned them over and over in his hand. He
shook out the folds of the little cloak, and the
locket fell on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_349" id="Page_349" />When did you get this?&quot; he cried excitedly.
&quot;It is her highness'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it is, Captain; but I have carried it about
me all these years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Captain. Count von Herbeck is a great
statesman, but he made a terrible mistake this
time. Listen. As sure as we are in this room
together, I believe that she whom we call the
princess is not the daughter of the grand duke.&quot;</p>

<p>Carmichael sat down on the edge of the bed,
numb and without any clear idea where he was.
From the stony look on his face, Grumbach
might have carried the head of Medusa in his
hand. The blood beat into his head with many
strange noises. But by and by the world became
clearer and brighter till all things took on the
rosal tint of dawn. Free! If she was not a princess,
she was free, free!</p>

<p>The duke allowed the quartet to remain standing
for some time. He strode up and down before
them, his eyes straining at the floor, his
hands behind his back. He was in fatigue-dress,
and only the star of Ehrenstein glittered on his
breast. He was never without this order. All
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350" />at once he whirled round, and as a sailor plunges
the lead into the sea, so he plumbed the very
deeps of their eyes as if he would see beforehand
what strange things were at work in their souls.
&quot;I do not recognize any of these persons,&quot; he
said to Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness does not recognize me, then?&quot;
asked the clock-mender.</p>

<p>&quot;Come closer,&quot; commanded the duke. The
clock-mender obeyed. &quot;Take off those spectacles.&quot;
The duke scanned the features, and over
his own came the dawn of recollection. &quot;Your
eyes, your nose&mdash;Arnsberg, here and alive?
Oh, this is too good to be true!&quot; The duke
reached out toward the bell, but Carmichael interposed.</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness will remember,&quot; he warned.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! So you have trapped me blindly? I
begin to understand. Who is this fellow Grumbach?
Did I offer immunity to him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am Hans Breunner, Highness, and I ask
for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Breunner? Breunner? Hans Breunner,
brother of Hermann, and you put yourself into
my hands?&quot; The tone developed into a sup<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351" />pressed
roar. The duke took hold of Hans by
the shoulders and drew him close. &quot;You dog!
So you ask for nothing? It shall be given to
you. To-morrow morning I shall have you shot!
Hans Breunner! God is good to me this night!
Thanks, Herr Carmichael, a thousand thanks!
And I need not ask who that damnable scoundrel
is who has the black face and heart of a Gipsy.
When I recollect what I have suffered at your
hands! If only the late king were here, my joy
would be complete!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness,&quot; said Von Arnsberg quietly,
&quot;all I have left in the world are these two withered
hands, and may God cut them off if they
ever wronged you in any act. I am innocent.
Those letters purported to have been written by
me were forgeries. I could not prove this, so
I have been outlawed, with the sentence of death
over my head. But to-night I shall leave this
palace a free man, and you shall ask pardon for
the wrong you have done me.&quot;</p>

<p>There was no fear in the voice; there was
nothing but confidence. The duke glared at the
speaker somberly, recalling what Herbeck had
often said.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352" />What you say still remains to be proved.
Now, what is at the bottom of all this?&quot; was the
demand. &quot;You men have not obtained this interview
for the sake of affirming your innocence.
Herr Carmichael, here, declared to me on honor
that you were in possession of a great secret.
Out with it, without any more useless recrimination.&quot;</p>

<p>Hans replied not in words but in actions. He
crossed the room to the duke's desk and spread
out his treasures under the flickering candlelight.
The duke, with a cry of terror, sprang
toward the secret drawer. His first thought was
that the shoes and cloak, upon which only his
eyes ever rested now, had been stolen. He
straightened. Nothing was missing. He glanced
from face to face, from the articles on the desk
to those in the drawer. He was overwhelmed.
But he steadied himself; it was no moment for
physical weakness. Slowly, ignoring every one,
he came back to the desk and fingered the locket.
Just then it was exceedingly quiet in the room,
save that each man heard the quick breathing
of his neighbor. The duke opened the locket,
looked long and steadfastly at the portrait, and
<a name="Page_353" id="Page_353" />shut it. Then he went to the drawer again and
returned with the counterparts. He laid them
side by side. The likeness was perfect in all details.</p>

<p>&quot;Carmichael,&quot; he said, &quot;will you please help
me? My eyes are growing old. Do I see these
things, or do I not? And if I do, which is mine,
and what does this signify?&quot; The tremor in
his voice was audible.</p>

<p>Grumbach answered. &quot;This, Highness. I took
these from the little princess with my own hands.
They have never been out of my keeping. Those
you have I know nothing about.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke rubbed his eyes. &quot;My daughter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Princess Hildegarde is not your daughter,
Highness,&quot; said Hans solemnly.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gott</i>!&quot; The duke smote the desk in despair,
a despair which wrung the hearts of those who
witnessed it. &quot;Herbeck! I must send for Herbeck!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet, Highness; later,&quot; Grumbach said.</p>

<p>&quot;But if not Hildegarde&mdash;I believe I must be
growing mad!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Patience, your Highness!&quot; said Carmichael.</p>

<p>&quot;Patience!&quot; wearily. &quot;You say patience when
<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354" />my heart is dying inside my breast? Patience?
Who, then, is this woman I have called my
child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God knows, Highness!&quot; Hans stood bowed
before this parental agony.</p>

<p>&quot;But what proof have you that she is not?
What proof, I say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would there be two lockets, Highness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More proof than this will be needed. Produce
it. Prolong this agony of doubt not another
instant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speak,&quot; said Hans to the Gipsy, who was
viewing the drama with the nonchalance of a
spectator rather than a participant.</p>

<p>&quot;Highness,&quot; said the Gipsy, bowing, &quot;he
speaks truly. He came with us. For fear that
the little highness might be recognized as we
traveled, we changed her clothes. He took them,
together with the locket. One day the soldiers
appeared in the distance. We all fled. We lost
the little highness, and none of us ever knew what
became of her. She wore the costume of my own
children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We shall produce that in time,&quot; said Von
Arnsberg.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355" />Damnable wretch!&quot; said the duke, addressing
the Gipsy.</p>

<p>The other shrugged. He had been promised
immunity; that was all he cared about, unless it
was the bag of silver and gold this old clock-mender
had given him a few hours gone.</p>

<p>&quot;I am summoning her highness,&quot; said the
duke, as he struck the bell.</p>

<p>&quot;And, Highness,&quot; added Grumbach, &quot;despatch
some one for Gretchen, who lives at number forty
the Krumerweg.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The goose-girl? What does <i>she</i> know? Ah,
I remember. She is even now with her highness.
I shall send for them both.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen? Carmichael's bewilderment increased.
What place had the goose-girl in this
tragedy?</p>

<p>&quot;Now, while we are waiting,&quot; resumed the
duke, his agitation somewhat under control, &quot;the
proof, the definite proof!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her highness stumbled one night,&quot; said
Hans, &quot;and fell upon the fire. I snatched her
back, but not before her left arm was badly
burned.&quot;</p>

<p>The Gipsy nodded. &quot;I saw it, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356" />And that was why Grumbach went to the military
ball with opera-glasses! Carmichael was
round-eyed. But Gretchen?</p>

<p>&quot;The Princess Hildegarde has no scar upon
either arm,&quot; continued Grumbach. &quot;I have seen
them. They are without a single flaw.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More than that,&quot; reiterated the duke. &quot;That
is not enough.&quot;</p>

<p>They became silent. Now and then one or the
other stirred. The duke never took his eyes off
the door through which her highness would
enter.</p>

<p>She came in presently, tender with mercy, an
arm supporting Gretchen, who was red-eyed and
white.</p>

<p>&quot;You sent for us, father?&quot;</p>

<p>How the word pierced the duke's heart! &quot;Yes,
my child,&quot; he answered; for it mattered not who
she was or whither she had come, he had grown
to love her.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry you sent for Gretchen,&quot; said Hildegarde.
&quot;She is ill.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen sighed. To her the faces of the
men were indistinct. And, besides, she was without
interest, listless, drooped.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357" />My child, will you roll up your left sleeve?&quot;
said the duke.</p>

<p>&quot;My sleeve?&quot; Hildegarde thoughtfully looked
round. Roll up her sleeve? What possessed her
father?</p>

<p>&quot;Do so at once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can not roll up this sleeve, father,&quot; blushing
and a trifle angry at so strange a request.</p>

<p>Hans opened his knife and laid bare her left
arm. She uttered a little angry cry. &quot;How dare
you?&quot; She tried to cover the arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me look at it, Hildegarde,&quot; requested the
duke.</p>

<p>To him she presented her arm, for she now
understood that a serious affair was in progress.
But there was neither mole nor scar upon the
round and lovely arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you do this, father? What is the
meaning?&quot;</p>

<p>No one answered; no one had the heart to answer.
Without waiting for the duke to bid him
continue, Hans unceremoniously ripped open
Gretchen's left sleeve. The ragged scar was
visible to them all. And while they grouped
<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358" />round the astonished goose-girl they heard her
highness cry out with surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;What is this?&quot; she said, pointing to the two
pairs of shoes and the two cloaks. She held up
the locket, the twin of which hung round her
neck. &quot;Where did these come from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My child,&quot; the duke answered, unashamed of
his tears, &quot;only God knows as yet what it means;
but the outward sign testifies to a strange and
horrible blunder. The locket you hold in your
hand was taken from you when you were an infant.
The one you wear round your neck is,
according to the statement of one of these men,
not genuine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the significance?&quot; She grew tall, and
the torn sleeve fell away from her arm.</p>

<p>&quot;That what is done must be all undone. I
know you to be brave. Strengthen your heart,
then. I stand before you the most wretched man
in all this duchy. These men affirm that I am
not your father. They say that you are not my
daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that Gretchen is!&quot; spoke Hans. His
conscience was costing every one something dear.</p>

<p>&quot;I?&quot; Gretchen drew closer to Hildegarde.</p>

<p><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359" />The duke studied the portrait of the mother
and then the faces of these two girls. Both
possessed a resemblance, only it seemed now that
Gretchen was nearest to the portrait and Hildegarde
nearest to the doubt.</p>

<p>&quot;You say she wore the costume of a Gipsy
child when you lost her?&quot; said the duke.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Von Arnsberg took from under his
coat a small bundle which he opened with shaking
fingers. He had been in the Krumerweg that
afternoon.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, those are mine!&quot; exclaimed Gretchen
excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;You see?&quot; said Von Arnsberg. &quot;Would you
not like to be a princess, Gretchen?&quot;</p>

<p>A princess? Gretchen's heart fluttered. A
princess? She saw the king shaking the bars
of his cell; she heard his voice calling out his
love for her. A princess? She laid her head on
Hildegarde's shoulder. She was weak, and this
was some dream.</p>

<p>&quot;But who, then, am I?&quot; asked Hildegarde.
There was no sign of weakness here.</p>

<p>Again there was no answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell what you know,&quot; said Hans to the<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360" />
Gipsy. &quot;Highness, he alone knows the man who
brought about all this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The archplotter of this damnable conspiracy?&quot;
The duke's eyes became alive, his face,
his whole body. Every beat of his heart cried
out for vengeance. &quot;Who is he? Tell me! Give
him to me, man, and all of you shall go free.
Give him into these hands. His name!&quot; The
duke's hands worked convulsively as if they
were already round the throat of this unseen,
implacable enemy. He was terrible in this moment.</p>

<p>The Gipsy produced a letter. It had to be
held carefully, as it was old and tattered. The
duke read it. Beyond that it made the original
offer it was worthless. The handwriting was
palpably disguised. The duke flung the missive
to the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Fool! Is that all you have? Tell me what
you know, man, or I shall have you shot in the
morning, immunity or no immunity! Quick!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Highness,&quot; said the Gipsy, thoroughly
alarmed, &quot;this is how it happened. My band
was staying at the time in Dreiberg. We told
fortunes and exhibited an Italian puppet-show.<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361" />
The letter came first. I was poor and sometimes
desperate. I was to take her away and leave her
with strange people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; interrupted the duke, with despairing
gesture toward Grumbach, &quot;why did you not
leave us all in peace?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Highness, a great wrong has been done, and
God brought me here to right it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a brave man,&quot; darkly.</p>

<p>&quot;I am in your hands, Highness,&quot; sturdily.
&quot;In a mad moment I committed a crime. I shall
abide by whatever punishment you may inflict.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Continue,&quot; said the duke to the Gipsy.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Highness, I would not accept till I had
talked personally with him. He came at last.
His face was hidden and his voice muffled. But
this I saw; when he gave me the first half of the
money I was certain I should know him again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By his little finger, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His little finger?&quot; Von Arnsberg repeated.
The two women, large-eyed and bewildered,
clung to each other's hand tensely. These were
heart-breaking times. Gretchen's mind, however,
absorbed nothing, neither the words nor
<a name="Page_362" id="Page_362" />the picture. Her thoughts revolved round one
thing; if she were a princess she could be happy.
But the other, from under whose feet all tangible
substances seemed to be giving way, she was
possessed by two thoughts which surged in her
brain like combatants. If not a princess, what
was she? If not a princess, she was free. She
stole a swift glance at Carmichael, who seemed
far removed from the heart of this black business;
and had he been looking at her he would
have seen the gates opening into Eden.</p>

<p>&quot;What was this little finger like?&quot; asked the
duke, shuddering.</p>

<p>&quot;One time it had been cut or mangled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The man was tall?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke silently toyed with the little yellow
shoes. Suddenly he laughed; but it was the terrible
laughter of a madman. There were death
and desolation in it.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, all of you; you, Gretchen, and you,
Hildegarde; come, Carmichael, and you, Arnsberg;
all of you! Let us go and pay a visit to
our good friend, Herbeck!&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII" /><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363" />CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>A LITTLE FINGER</h3>


<p>The king of Jugendheit, Prince Ludwig,
and the chancellor sat in the form of a
triangle. Herbeck was making a pyramid of
his finger-tips, sometimes touching his chin with
his thumbs. His face was cheerful. His royal
highness, still in the guise of a mountaineer, sat
stiffly in his chair, the expression on his face
hardly translatable; that on the king's not at
all. He was dressed in the brilliant uniform of
a colonel in the Prussian Uhlans, an honor conferred
upon him recently by King William.
Prior to his advent into the Grand Duchy of
Ehrenstein he had been to Berlin. A whim, for
which he was now grateful, had cozened him into
carrying this uniform along with him on his adventures.
It was only after he met Gretchen
that there came moments when he forgot he was
a king. He was pale. From hour to hour his
heart seemed to grow colder and smaller and
<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364" />harder, till it now rested in his breast with the
heaviness of a stone, out of which life and the
care of living had been squeezed. He rarely
spoke, leaving the burden of the conversation to
rest upon his uncle's tongue.</p>

<p>&quot;So your royal highness will understand,&quot;
said Herbeck, &quot;that it was the simplest move I
could make, and the safest. Were it known, or
had it been known this morning, that the king
of Jugendheit and the prince regent had entered
Dreiberg in disguise and had been lodged in the
Stein-schloss, there would have been a serious
riot in the city. So I had you arrested as spies.
Presently a closed carriage will convey you to
the frontier, and the unfortunate incident will be
ended.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks!&quot; said Prince Ludwig.</p>

<p>&quot;And when you cross the frontier, it would be
wise to disperse the troops waiting there for
you.&quot;</p>

<p>Prince Ludwig smiled. &quot;It was only an army
of defense. The duke had nearly twenty thousand
men at the maneuvers. I have no desire
for war; but, on the other hand, I am always
ready for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365" />There will never be any war between us,&quot;
prophetically. &quot;The duke grows impatient at
times, but I can always rouse his sense of justice.
You will, of course, pardon the move I made.
There will be no publicity. There will be no
newspaper notoriety, for the journalists will
know nothing of what has really happened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For that consideration your excellency has
my deepest thanks,&quot; replied Prince Ludwig.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it best to let you go without seeing
the duke. The meeting between you two
might be painful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That also is thoughtful of your excellency,&quot;
said the king. &quot;I have no desire to see or speak
to his highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is, however, one favor I should like to
ask,&quot; said the prince.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I grant it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Easily. I wish to leave a sum of money in
trust, to be paid to one Gretchen Schwarz, who
lives in the Krumerweg. She is ambitious to become
a singer. Let nothing stand between her
and her desires.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Granted.&quot;</p>

<p>The heart of the king, at the sound of that
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366" />dear name, suddenly expanded and stifled him.
The stiffness went out of his shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, this little world of ours, the mistakes and
futile schemes we make upon it!&quot; The chancellor
dallied with his quill pen. &quot;It was a cynical
move of fate that your majesty should see
the goose-girl first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; cried the king vehemently. &quot;Let
us have no more retrospection, if you please.
Moreover, I shall be obliged to you if you will
summon at once the carriage which is to take us
to the frontier. The situation has been amicably
and satisfactorily explained. I see no reason
why we should be detained any longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor I,&quot; added Prince Ludwig. &quot;I am rather
weary of these tatters. I should even like a
bath.&quot;</p>

<p>The three of them were immediately attracted
by a singular noise outside in the corridor. The
door swung in violently, crashing against the
wall and shivering into atoms the Venetian mirror.
The king, the prince, and the chancellor
were instantly upon their feet. The king
clutched the back of his chair with a grip of
iron: Gretchen? Her highness? What was<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367" />
Gretchen doing here? Ah, could he have flown!
He muttered a curse at the chancellor for the
delay. But happily Gretchen did not see him.</p>

<p>The duke came in first, and he waited till the
others were inside; then he shut the door with
lesser violence and rushed over to the chancellor.</p>

<p>&quot;Herbeck, you villain!&quot;</p>

<p>The chancellor stared at the Gipsy, at Von
Arnsberg, at Grumbach.</p>

<p>&quot;Herbeck, you black scoundrel!&quot; cried the
duke. &quot;Can you realize how difficult it is not
to take you by the throat and strangle you here
and now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is mad!&quot; said Herbeck, bracing himself
against the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I <i>am</i> mad, but it is the sane madness
of a terribly wronged man. Come here, you
Gipsy!&quot; The duke seized Herbeck's hand and
pressed it down fiercely on the desk. &quot;Look at
that and tell me if it is not the hand of a Judas!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is the hand, Highness,&quot; said the Gipsy,
without hesitation.</p>

<p>The duke flung the hand aside. As he did so
something snapped in Herbeck's brain, though
at that instant he was not conscious of it.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368" />It was you, you! It was your hand that
wrecked my life, yours! Ah, is there such villainy?
Are such men born and do they live?
My wife dead, my own heart broken, Arnsberg
ruined and disgraced! And these two children:
which is mine?&quot;</p>

<p>To the king of Jugendheit the ceiling reeled
and the floor revolved under his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Villain, what have you to say? What was
your purpose?&quot;</p>

<p>How many years, thought Herbeck, had he
been preparing for this moment? How long had
he been steeling his heart against this very
scene? Futile dream! He drew himself together
with a supreme effort. He would face
this hour as he had always planned to face it.
Found out! He looked at his finger, touched it
with an impersonal curiosity. He had forgotten
all about such a possibility. Where had he read
that there is no crime but leaves some evidence,
infinitesimally small though it be, which shall
lead to the truth? After all, he was glad. The
strain, borne so long, was gradually killing him.
A little finger, to have stopped the wheel of so
great a scheme! Irony!</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369" />Your Highness,&quot; he said, his voice soft and
strangely clear, &quot;I have been waiting for this
hour. So I am found out! How little we know
what God intends!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak of God? You blaspheme!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bear with me for a space. I shall not hold
you long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why? What have I done to you that
you should wreck all I hold dear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For you I have always had a strong affection,
strange as it may sound.&quot; Herbeck fumbled
with his collar, which was tightening round
his throat like a band of hot iron. &quot;I have practically
governed this country for sixteen years.
In that time I have made it prosperous and
happy; I have given you a substantial treasury;
I have made you an army; I have brought peace
where you would have brought war. To my
people God will witness that I have done my duty
as I saw it. One day I fell the victim of a mad
dream. And to think that I almost won!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I?&quot; said Hildegarde, her hands clenched
and pressed against her bosom. &quot;What have
you done to me, who am innocent of any wrong?
What have you done to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370" />You, my child? I have wronged you greatest
of all. The wrong I have done to you is irreparable.
Ah, have not my arms hungered
for the touch of you, my heart ached for the
longing of you? To see you day after day,
always humble before you, always glad to kiss
the back of your hand! Have I not lived in
hell, your Highness?&quot; turning to the duke.</p>

<p>&quot;What am I, and who am I?&quot; whispered Hildegarde,
her heart almost ceasing to beat.</p>

<p>&quot;I am your father!&quot; simply.</p>

<h3>HAPPINESS</h3>


<p>The grand duke of Ehrenstein beheld the
chancellor with that phase of astonishment
which leaves the mind unclouded. The
violent storm in his heart gave way to a calm,
not at all menacing, but tinctured with a profound
pity. What a project! What a mind
to conceive it, to perfect it down to so small a
detail as a jeweler's mark in the gold of the
locket! And a little finger to betray it! In a
flash he saw vividly all this man had undergone,
day by day, unfaltering, unhesitant, forgetting
nothing, remembering everything but the one
insignificant item which was to overthrow him.
He felt that he was confronted with a great
problem; what to do with the man?</p>

<p>Prince Ludwig took off his hat. &quot;Herbeck,
you are a great politician.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, prince,&quot; replied Herbeck, with ineffable
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372" />sadness. &quot;Had I been a great politician I
should have succeeded. Ah, give this to my
merit; self never entered into this dream. For
you, my child, only for you. And so great was
this dream that I almost made you a queen!
You are my flesh and blood, the child of my wife,
whom I loved. She was only a singer in the
opera, at Dresden, but her soul was great, like
yours. It is a simple story.&quot;</p>

<p>Hildegarde did not move, nor had she moved
since the revelation. Carmichael, a secret joy
in his heart, watched the girl for the slightest
swaying, that inevitable prelude to fainting.
But Hildegarde was not the kind of woman who
faints in the face of a catastrophe, however
great it might be. The only sign of life lay in
her beautiful eyes, the gaze of which remained
unswervingly fixed upon the chancellor's ashen
countenance.</p>

<p>&quot;Hildegarde,&quot; said the duke, &quot;you shall become
my daughter, and you shall dwell here till
the end of your days. I will try to right the
wrong that has been done to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, your Highness,&quot; she replied. &quot;There is
but one place for me, and that is at my father's
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373" />side.&quot; And resolutely she walked to the chancellor's
left and her hand stole down and met
his firmly. &quot;My father, I forgive you,&quot; she
said, with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>&quot;They are all wrong, Frederick,&quot; whispered
Prince Ludwig. &quot;She is as much a princess as
the other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You forgive me?&quot; The chancellor could not
believe his ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, father.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, recalling all the child-hunger in his
arms and heart, he swept her to his breast convulsively;
and the unloosed tears dropped upon
her bright head.</p>

<p>&quot;And who am I?&quot; said Gretchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Breunner, you say this little goose-girl is my
daughter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I solemnly swear it, Highness. Look into
her face again carefully.&quot;</p>

<p>The duke did so, a hand on either cheek. He
scrutinized every contour, the color of the eyes,
the low, broad brow, the curve of the chin. Out
of the past he conjured up the mother's face.
Yes, beyond any doubt, there was a haunting
likeness, and he had never noted it before.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374" />But who will prove it to the world?&quot; he cried
hopelessly, still holding Gretchen's wondering
face between his hands.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall prove it,&quot; said the king.</p>

<p>&quot;You? And how?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall marry Gretchen; I shall make her a
queen. That will be proof enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A fine stroke, nephew; a bold stroke!&quot; Prince
Ludwig laid his hand upon the king's shoulder
with rare affection.</p>

<p>&quot;If you accept her without further proof, I,
her father, can do no less.&quot; And the duke kissed
Gretchen on the forehead and led her over to the
king, gravely joining their hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Gretchen!&quot; murmured the king.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know how to act like a princess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall teach you.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen laid her head on his breast. She was
very tired and much bewildered.</p>

<p>The duke paced the length of the cabinet several
times. No one interrupted his meditation.</p>

<p>Back and forth, one hand hanging to the opposite
shoulder, the other folding over his chin.
Then he paused with abruptness.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Majesty, I regret that your father is
<a name="Page_375" id="Page_375" />not alive to accept my apologies for so baselessly
misjudging him. Arnsberg, nothing that I can
do will restore these wasted years. But I offer
you the portfolio.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am only a broken man, your Highness; too
old.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is my will.&quot;</p>

<p>Arnsberg bent his head in submission.</p>

<p>&quot;As for you,&quot; said the duke to the Gipsy, &quot;go,
and if you ever step this side the frontier again
you will be shot out of hand.&quot; He stopped
again in front of Grumbach. &quot;I promised to
have you shot in the morning. That promise
holds. But a train leaves for Paris a little after
midnight. My advice is for you not to miss it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And my father, your Highness?&quot; said Hildegarde bravely.</p>

<p>&quot;Herbeck, your estates are confiscated, your
name is struck from the civic and military lists.
Have you any ready funds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough to take you for ever out of this part
of the world?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do not ask to be forgiven, and I like
<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376" />that. I have judges in Dreiberg. I could have
you tried and condemned for high treason, shot
or imprisoned for life. But to-night I shall not
use this prerogative. You have, perhaps, three
hours to get your things in order. To-morrow
you will be judged and condemned. But you,
Hildegarde&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, your Highness; we shall both take the
train for Paris. Gretchen, you will be happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Gretchen ran and flung herself into Hildegarde's
arms; and the two of them wept. Hildegarde
pushed Gretchen away gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, father, we have so little time.&quot;</p>

<p>And this was the sum of the duke's revenge.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It never took Carmichael long to make up his
mind definitely. He found his old friend the
cabman in the Platz, and they drove like mad to
the consulate. An hour here sufficed to close his
diplomatic career and seal it hermetically. The
clerk, however, would go on like Tennyson's
brook, for ever and for ever. Next he went to
the residence of his banker in the K&ouml;nig Strasse
and got together all his available funds. Eleven
o'clock found him in his rooms at the Grand<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377" />
Hotel, feverishly packing his trunk and bag.
Paris! He would go, also, even if they passed
on to the remote ends of the world.</p>

<p>The train stood waiting in the gloomy Bahnhof.
The guards patrolled the platform. Presently
three men came out of the station door.
Two were officers; the third, Colonel von Wallenstein,
was in civilian dress. He was sullen
and depressed.</p>

<p>Said one of the officers: &quot;And it is the express
command of General Ducwitz that you will return
here under the pain of death. Is that explicit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is.&quot; The colonel got into his compartment
and slammed the door viciously.</p>

<p>In the next compartment sat Grumbach. He
was smoking his faithful pipe. He was, withal,
content. This was far more satisfactory than
standing up before the firing-line. And, besides,
he had made history in Ehrenstein that night;
they would not forget the name of Breunner
right away. To America, with a clean slate and
a reposeful conscience; it was more than he had
any reasonable right to expect. Tekla! He
laughed sardonically. She was no doubt sound
<a name="Page_378" id="Page_378" />asleep by this time, and the end of the chapter
would never be written for her. What fools
these young men a-courting were! War and
famine and pestilence; did these not always follow
at the heels of women?</p>

<p>As the station-master's bell rang, the door
opened and a man jumped in. He tossed his
bag into the corner and plumped down in the
seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You, Hans?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am weary of Dreiberg, so I am taking a
little vacation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For how long?&quot; suspiciously.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, for ever so long!&quot; evasively. And Carmichael
lifted his feet to the opposite seat and
prepared to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Hans said nothing more. He was full of wisdom.
He had an idea. The fleeing chancellor
and his daughter were on the train, and he was
certain that his friend Carmichael knew it.</p>

<p>The lights of the city presently vanished, and
the long journey began, through the great clefts
in the mountains, over gorges, across rivers,
<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379" />along wide valleys, and into the mountains
again; a journey of nearly seventy hours. At
each stop Carmichael got out, and every time
he returned Hans could read disappointment on
his face. Still he said nothing. He was an admirable
comrade.</p>

<p>By the aid of certain small briberies on the
train and in Paris Carmichael gathered, bit by
bit, that the destination of the woman he loved
was America. But never once did he set eyes
upon her till she and her father mounted the
gang-plank to the vessel which was to carry
them across the wide Atlantic. The change in
Herbeck was pitiable. His face had aged twenty
years in these sixty odd hours. His clothes, the
same he had worn that ever-memorable night,
hung loosely about his gaunt frame, and there
was a vacancy in his eyes which was eloquent of
mental collapse. The girl quietly and tenderly
guided him to the deck and thence to his stateroom.
Carmichael abided his time.</p>

<p>A French newspaper contained a full account
of Herbeck's <i>coup</i> and his subsequent flight. It
also recounted the excitement of the following
day, the appearance of Gretchen on the steps of
<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380" />the palace, and the great shouting of the people
as they acclaimed her the queen of Jugendheit.</p>

<p>The second day out Carmichael's first opportunity
came. He discovered Herbeck and his
daughter leaning against the rail. He watched
them uneasily, wondering how he might approach
without startling her. At last he keyed
up his courage.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, your Highness,&quot; he stammered,
and inwardly cursed his stupidity.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice she turned, and there
was no mistaking the gladness in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Carmichael?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I was surprised to learn that you were
taking the same boat as myself.&quot;</p>

<p>How clumsy he was! she thought. For she
had known his every move since the train drew
out of Dreiberg.</p>

<p>&quot;Father, here is our friend, Herr Carmichael.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Carmichael?&quot; said Herbeck slowly. &quot;Ah,
yes. Good morning.&quot;</p>

<p>And Carmichael instantly comprehended that
his name recalled nothing to the other man's remembrance.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381" />You are returning to America?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;For good, perhaps. To tell the truth, I ran
away, deserted my post, though technically I
have already resigned. But America has been
calling me for some days. You have never been
to sea before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; it is all marvelous and strange to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us walk, my child,&quot; said Herbeck.</p>

<p>&quot;You will excuse me, Mr. Carmichael?&quot; she
said. Never more the rides in the fair mornings.
Never more the beautiful gardens, the
music, the galloping of soldiers who drew their
sabers whenever they passed her. Never more
any of these things.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I be of any assistance?&quot; he said, in an
undertone.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; sadly.</p>

<p>The days, more or less monotonous, went past.
Sometimes he saw her alone on deck, but only
for a little while. Her father was slowly improving,
but with this improvement came the
natural desire for seclusion; so he came on deck
only at night.</p>

<p>The night on which the vessel bore into the
moist, warm air of the Gulf Stream was full of
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382" />moonshine, of smooth, phosphorescent billows.
Herbeck had gone below. The girl leaned over
the rail, alone and lonely. And Carmichael,
seeing her, could no longer still the desire in his
heart. He came up to her.</p>

<p>&quot;See!&quot; she exclaimed, pointing to the little
eddies of foam speeding along the hull. &quot;Do
you know what they remind me of? Mermaids'
fingers, grasping and clutching at the boat as
if to drag it down below.&quot;</p>

<p>How beautiful she was with the frost of moonlight
on her hair!</p>

<p>&quot;You must not talk like that,&quot; he admonished.</p>

<p>&quot;I am very unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And when you say that you make me so,
too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; She had spoken the word at last.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember the night you dropped
your fan?&quot; leaning so closely toward her that
his arm pressed against hers.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You put that word then. In honor I dared
not answer. You were a princess! I was only a
soldier of fortune. But now that you are in
trouble, now that you have need of me, I
<a name="Page_383" id="Page_383" />may answer. I may tell you now why, why I
have thrown ambition and future to the winds,
why I am here at your side to-night. Need I
tell you? Do you not know, and have you not
known? Am I cruel to speak of love in the moment
of your great affliction? Well, I must be
cruel. I love you! Faithfully and loyally, now
and hereafter, through this sad day into happier
ones. I ask nothing for this love I offer;
I ask only that I may use it in your service, in
good times or bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ask what you will,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I am
happy now!&quot;</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
